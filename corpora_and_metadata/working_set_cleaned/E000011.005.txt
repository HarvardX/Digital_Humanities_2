scotch reform considered with reference to the plan proposed in the late parliament for the regulation of the courts and the administration of justice in scotland with illustrations from english nonreform in the course of which divers imperfections abuses and corruptions in the administration of justice with their causes are now for the first time brought to light in a series of letters addressed to the right hon lord grenville c c c with tables in which the principal causes of factitious complication delay vexation and expense are distinguished from such as are natural and unavoidable by jeremy bentham of lincolns inn esq barrister at law the second edition with four additional tables showing the abuses in cases of appeal london   ridgway   0 opposite bond street piccadilly      first edition published in   0    advertisement the matter contained in the four following letters including the two sheets of tables subjoined to them was written it will be observed at different times in the course of the years   00 and   0  in the mean time a variety of incidents has taken place and the face of the whole business as laid before parliament has undergone a variety of changes but as to the matter of the ensuing letters if there be anything in it that presents a prospect of being of use that use will not be found to have received any diminution from any of those changes a continuation is in the press comprising the originally proposed chamber of review the two arrangements proposed one or other of them to serve instead of it by the lord president and ten others out of the fifteen lords of session and the bill said to have been laid upon the table of the house by the lord chancellor lord eldon and printed by order dated  0th august   0  in a separate work is intended to be humbly submitted to parliament and in particular to the house of lords a plan for enabling the house to render to suitors of all the three kingdoms that justice its inability of rendering which has now for so many years been so severely felt by the public and so explicitly acknowledged in the house a summary view of the plan is already begun to be put into circulation a b   letters to lord grenville on the proposed reform in the administration of civil justice in scotland lord grenville letter i my lord— in the account given in the public prints of a speech of your lordships on the occasion of the proposed reform relative to the administration of civil justice in scotland i observed a passage inviting suggestions from withoutdoors should these my humble endeavours be found productive of any useful lights it is to that invitation that the subject will be indebted for them if scotland feels as no doubt she will and does already her obligations to your lordship for the proposition itself so ought the three kingdoms with their dependencies for the invitation coupled with it in this they may behold a constitutional comment on the primitive text de minoribus principes consulunt de majoribus omnes in this the constitutional and only rational application of the principle of universal suffrage information accepted from every source suggestion the work of the understanding open to all decision the work of the will confined to the comparatively few among whom without polish confusion it can possibly be shared according to the terms of the speech as stated in the paper that lies before me in the designation made of the persons from whom communications were called for the members of the scottish bar were the only persons particularly mentioned if from the letter of the invitation any such limitation could with propriety be deduced it was doubtless because at the moment the situation so designated presented itself to your lordships notice as the only source from which on such a subject any useful information could naturally be expected deviations from the ordinary state of things could not in so general a survey have naturally been taken into the account but as africa of old was noted for physical so have the british islands been in modern times for psychological singularities hence it is that so far as the habit of contemplating the field of law in the point of view in question that of a field of reformation and improvement the very point of view in which on the present occasion it fell in your lordships way to bestow a glance upon it—i mean so far as the length of that habit can be regarded as capable of aiding the effect or supplying the deficiency of other qualifications—neither the scottish bar nor any other description of persons could probably afford a pen the suggestions of which would be less exposed to the imputation of temerity than these how small soever may be their value which are now courting the honour of your lordships notice two noble and learned lords in whose wisdom and experience your lordship finds day by day an everincreasing treasure wait on this occasion as on all others your lordships signal for pouring out the stores of it some time before those illustrious persons had either of them begun to make his profit of the imperfections or as some would say the abuses with which the regular system of procedure is spotted or of which as some would say it is composed the obscure interloper whose bow is now making to your lordship had made it the business of his life to inquire into the means of remedying them as to the measure itself viz that of endeavouring to infuse the spirit of reform into scottish judicature preceding administrations reckoned this it seems in the number of their velleities what they had been thinking of doing your lordship has done in the sort of relation your lordship bears to the measure i find a relief from an unpleasant difficulty in your lordship it beholds its patron and introducer the author it is matter of ease to me not to know to the athenians their legislator presented such was his plea the best of all plans that would have been borne with to scotland under a most crying urgency lord grenville presents the best or perhaps the only plan that was to be had as to the general complexion of the plan to prevent temporary misconceptions permit me my lord to submit to your lordship at this early period the general result of my researches in two very simple propositions that in point of utility there is enough in it to afford an ample justification to the provisional acceptance your lordship has been pleased to give to it that at the same time when minutely sifted by a not unexercised hand and with that continuity of attention   which it was impossible in your lordships place to spare for it it will be found to fall extremely short of the professions and perhaps expectations of the learned author not to speak of your lordships indubitably sincere and generous wishes and intentions in the track of improvement by a rare coincidence for a certain part of the way the interest of the suitor that is of the community at large and the interest of the lawyer happened to go hand in hand—just so far i observe the interests of the community really pursued but a little further the interests divide and there it is that i see that separation taking place which in my view of the matter could not but take place the interest of the community pursued in demonstration only—the opposite interest of the lawyer being carefully protected and even advanced in reality and effect before i proceed any further i find myself under the necessity of stating a little personal incident the mention of which would not have been thus obtruded on your lordships patience but for its indissoluble connexion with the present enterprise your lordships invitation found me employed in putting as i had flattered myself the last hand to a work of a somewhat new complexion on the subject of evidence a work which though of greater bulk than i could have wished was itself but an offset of a still larger one not wanting much of its completion and designed to give a comprehensive view of what in that extensive subject taken in all its branches appeared fit to be done in the way of law of that offset the object was—to bring to view the reasons by which i had been satisfied that whether the roman the english or any other system were resorted to the established rules of evidence occupied principally in putting exclusions upon the light of evidence were almost without exception adverse to the ends of justice a conclusion facilitated in no small degree by the observation that there is not one of them in english practice at least that is not departed from and without inconvenience or suspicion of inconvenience set at naught and that for reasons that can have no weight or truth in them on any other supposition than that of the impropriety of the rule in every instance in which it is observed in looking for the causes of this inconsistency for where in the department of legislation a full light has been thrown upon a subject causes are a topic that can never have been passed by i saw reason to suspect—and that reason gaining strength at every step—that what at first view had presented itself as the result of primeval blindness and imbecility was referable perhaps in a certain degree to those causes but probably in a much higher degree to sharpsighted artifice that to enable themselves to extract from it that profit which constituted their recompense and inducement for taking their part in it and that with as much case to themselves as the task of gathering in the profit admitted of it was necessary for the founders and successive supporters of the system to give to it a direction opposite at every turn to the ends of justice that among the leading features or main pillars of this system were the exclusions put upon the most instructive and indispensable sources of evidence and in regard to such information as was not in itself excluded the preference given to a variety of artificial and less trustworthy shapes in which they found means to clothe it to the exclusion of the more natural and more trustworthy but that these were but a part of a numerous and complicated system of devices all tending to the same altogether natural but not the less sinister end and that in a word on these points as on all others the reason why the system was and is so bad as men feel it rather than see it to be is that the power found itself in company with the interest and consequently the will to produce as bad a system as the people with the legislature at their head could in their primeval and as yet but little ameliorated state of relative ignorance and helplessness be brought by the utmost stretch of artifice to endure thus it was that the delineation of the instruments employed in the planting and culture of the predominant system i say predominant—for there exists another of very different complexion of which presently and which howsoever overpowered has nowhere been altogether killed by it constituted a sort of episode though for the full comprehension of the subject not an unnecessary episode to the work having for its main subject the exclusions put upon evidence finding then in the system of reform put into your lordships hands what i could not but expect to find in it as a matter of course—that the profit and ease of the man of law were as carefully provided for as ever the interests of the people in their character of suitors as completely sacrificed as ever to those original and with reference to the man of law so much nearer objects—and that all the advantage given to the suitor was that comparatively small though in itself not inconsiderable portion in which the licensed plunderer would be a sharer with him finding in a word that of all the devices above spoken of there was not one the full mischief of which was not reserved to the suitor the full benefit to say no more reserved to the man of law it was my original intention for the more complete elucidation of the proposed plan of reform and the resolutions by   which the outline of it is delineated to have subjoined the episode above mentioned—a sort of picture of the law of procedure—by way of appendix to this address but this picture not being yet in a state of complete readiness for the press and at the same time the bulk of it according to the measure taken of it by my fears too large for the proportion of your lordships time which even upon the most sanguine calculation could be expected for it the only feasible course seemed to be to submit to your lordship instead of the picture itself a sort of table of the contents of it a table bearing about the same relation to the work at large as in the case of those rude sketches which according to panorance editor custom are distributed for the accommodation of the curious whose visits are received or expected for the picture of the chief seat of scottish judicature as exhibited in leicestersquare for the purpose of assisting their recollections or anticipations in scotland as in england and elsewhere the system of judicial procedure has been in the main the work not of legislators but of judges manufactured chiefly in the form—not of real statutory law—but of jurisprudential law—imaginary law consisting of general inferences deduced from particular decisions by primeval indigence and inexperience on the part of the sovereign judges left without salaries but left with power to pay themselves by fees hence as will be seen a constant opposition between the ends of justice and the ends the original and thence the actual ends of judicature proper direct end or object of the system of procedure or adjective branch of the law giving execution and effect to the predictions delivered to the engagements taken by the other branch the main or substantive branch of the law viz by decisions pronounced in conformity to it—direct ends of justice prevention of misdecision decision unconformable to the regulations and arrangements belonging to the substantive branch of the law and failure of justice failure of justice the same thing in effect as misdecision to the prejudice of the plaintiffs side but taking place without decision and for want of it frequently without legal demand made and for want of it—collateral ends of justice prevention of delay vexation and expense in so far as superfluous or preponderant viz over the mischief from misdecision or from failure of justice misdecision when to the prejudice of the defendants side may be considered either as comprised under the head of vexation or as constituting a separate head of collateral inconvenience and the prevention of it as constituting a separate end of justice interest of the people in the character of suitors perpetual and complete fulfilment of the ordinances of the substantive branch of the law the utility of which must on this occasion be assumed and thence of the direct ends of justice interest of the judges the authors of the system of procedure maximum of profit and ease profit as much as could be extracted with as much ease as was consistent with the extraction of it profit and ease increased by the same cause—the increase of the aggregate quantity of fees justice thus denied to the poor to the labouring classes to the great majority of the people as being unable to pay the fees thence the trouble of administering justice to them saved limits set by various causes to the quantum of the fees exigible on each occasion aggregate of fees thence not otherwise increasable than by increasing the number of the occasions on which fees were exacted factitious delay vexation and expense the results or accompamments of the increase so given to the number of those occasions aggregate mass of judges profit increasing with the aggregate mass of delay vexation and expense hence the actual ends of judicature the interests and consequently the exertions of judges maintained in a state of constant opposition to the interests of the people and the ends viz thus far only the collateral ends of justice but from delay vexation and expense result in various ways failure of justice and misdecision to the prejudice either of the plaintiffs side or the defendants whichever be in the right hence a complete and constant opposition between the ends of judicature and the aggregate of the several ends of justice multiplication of the occasions of extracting fees the cause of factitious complication intricacy obscurity unintelligibility uncognoscibility in the system of procedure by this complication a sort of sham science produced and with it on the part of the suitors the necessity of having recourse to the members of a distinct class or fraternity thus raised up sole professors of that science and of the arts belonging to it profit of these professional as well as of the official lawyers arising out of the mass of factitious delay vexation and expense and increasing along with it the profit of the one class going hand in hand with that of the other hence the closest community and general identity of interests—a virtual partnership which may be called the law partnership—with the judges as managing partners at the head of it on the part of malâ fide suitors on both sides suitors conscious of being in the wrong an interest in increasing the quantity of factitious delay vexation and expense this mass of abuse their only instrument to work with employed by malâ fide defendants for staving off and oftentimes finally eluding compliance   with the just demands on the other side by malâ fide plaintiffs for forcing compliance with unjust demands or on the occasion of some trifling demand gratifying enmity by the distress or ruin of the object community of interests thus effected between malâ fide suitors i e dishonest men in general and the members official and professional of the law partnership malâ fide cause a cause in which a party on either side is in malâ fide proportion of malâ fide to bonâ fide causes in some instances as great as that of    to   in england the exchequer chamber an authoritatively reported and notorious example truth the handmaid of justice mendacity of injustice interest which the judges had and have in encouraging to the utmost the vices of mendacity on the part of suitors that is of the body of the people propensity to injustice being the source of malâ fide suits and malâ fide suits still more profitable than bonâ fide suits hence the interest which the partnership has in placing and keeping in a state of corruption this the most important part of the morals of the people injustice being the great source of lawyers profit hence love of injustice hatred of justice passions unnatural to all other men natural to lawyers of all classes the lawyer but more particularly the judge being under the constant necessity of concealing his passions and vices as well as the interests by which they are generated—of cloaking the vices under the semblance of the opposite virtues—hence under the influence of the stillexisting mode of remuneration insincerity hypocrisy and lawyercraft become natural and in a manner necessary to the appointed guardians of the public morals a man being the better qualified for concealing his own vices from others the more perfectly he has succeeded in concealing them from himself hence a sort of imbecility—a relative and partial imbecility—a disease of the understanding—another vice endemial among lawyers hence a general propensity and aptitude to mistake for justice the injustice by which they profit fees thus rendered the matter of corruption various channels some open some more or less disguised through which this matter has been taught to flow into the pocket and bosom of the judge examples—receipt propriâ manu—sale of a feeyielding office for full value—fine or bonus on admission—feeyielding office given in lieu and to the saving of the expense of other provision for a son or other near relation or dependent he doing the duty—or else not doing the duty but paying a deputy—feeyielding office given or the profit of it made payable to persons standing as trustees for a principal declared or undeclared if undeclared supposed of course to be the judge himself under this state of things the members of the law partnership natural and irresistible enemies of the rest of the community judges and the other official members reconcilable enemies reconcilable viz by the substitution of salaries to fees but not unless the conversion extends without exception through all the offices on these terms and on these alone would the partnership be dissolved the professional members enemies absolutely irreconcilable because professional profit admits not of any such compensation the moral diseases endemial to this branch of the partnership not like those of the other capable of a complete cure—but yet of a very considerable remission viz by cancelling the mendacitylicense granted at present to them and their clients in the manner explained below were the mass of suffering inflicted on the people by delay vexation expense and consequent misdecision as above no more than equal to the mass of enjoyment accruing to the law partnership by profit gained there would be no use in the substitution of salaries to fees no use in rescuing nonlawyers from oppression and pillage under lawyers but besides that the sum being given and circumstances on both sides equal enjoyment from gain is never equal to suffering from loss and that the portion which being added converts affluence into opulence in the hands of the lawyer being taken away converts as to the greatest part of it indigence into absolute ruin in the person of the distressed debtor and his frequently no less distressed creditor that part of the factitious expense which goes to the account of lawyers profit is but a part and that commonly but a small part of the whole loss exclusive of the other evils that accompany it hence although which is impossible professional lawyers profit were to be done away altogether the welfare of the whole community lawyers and nonlawyers included would in a prodigious degree be promoted by the change separately taken so minute in many instances are the parcels in which the matter of corruption in the shape of fees flows into the pocket of the judge as to be to appearance incapable of creating any efficient sinister interest in a bosom so strongly strengthened against its influence by remuneration in the shape of salary but the degree of seductive force being as the quantity of the aggregate mass and not affected by the minuteness of the component parts this minuteness serves but to disguise the force of the seduction without diminishing it system of procedure generated by the influence of this sinister interest the technical or feegathering system technical from its   nature feegathering from its object and its cause courts in which this system is acted upon courts of technical procedure technical procedure styled at present regular courts in which it is acted upon courts of regular procedure system of procedure which has for its object the ends of justice and for its model the course naturally pursued for the discovery of truth and administration of justice as towards children servants or other dependants in the bosom of a private family the domestic or natural system of procedure requiring nothing but appropriate powers for the extension of it with its benefits over the whole field of political judicature to which head belong in some but not in all instances the modes of procedure which at present in contradistinction to regular are designated by the name of summary courts in which this system is pursued courts of natural procedure system of technical procedure the work of judges executed by them in the form—partly of statutory law as in the case of english rules and orders scotch acts of sederunt c partly of jurisprudential law—with or without occasional patches in the form of statutory law stuck on by the hand of the legislator but mostly under the guidance of the members of the law partnership official and professional cooperating in concert consequently under the influence of the sinister interest opposite as above explained to the interests of the community and the ends of justice system of natural procedure the work of the legislator the legitimate and acknowledged legislator acting in pursuit of the interests of the community and the ends of justice courts in which the system of natural procedure is exclusively or principally pursued—in criminali the courts martial and preparatory courts of inquiry in both branches land and maritime of the military service in criminali minori courts composed respectively of commissioners in matters of excise customs stamps assessed taxes hawkers and pedlars london hackney coaches in criminali minori et civili the courts composed of justices of peace acting singly or in numbers disengaged from the technical trammels which await them in their periodical great sessions in civili the courts of requests called courts of conscience the courts composed of commissioners in matters of bankruptcy the courts primary and of appeal recently instituted for the collection of taxes on property and income the arbitration courts composed of judges nominated by the parties but acting under powers given to them by regular courts by authority from statutelaw—in scotland the courts composed of justices of the peace sitting in periodical sessions but acting summarily under the name of smalldebt courts in cidevant france the consular courts courts composed of mercantile men sitting on causes of a mercantile nature in the danish dominions the recently established more extensively operating and justly celebrated reconciliation courts with us again in a higher sphere the committees of either house of parliament sitting in the character of courts of inquiry the several courts instituted of late years by the legislature for such a variety of purposes—settlement of public accounts—liquidation of claims—investigation of abuses or other objects of reform—and though last mentioned yet not least that noble and necessary bulwark of the constitution which owes to your lordships illustrious father its existence and its name were it on this occasion worth while other cases might be found in which justice has broke loose from the shackles forged for her in the cavern of chicane but these may i should hope suffice to prove and to the conviction of all but those who by interest or interestbegotten prejudice stand bound never to be convinced that in no sphere of judicial inquiry from the lowest to the highest can the charge either of impracticability or dangerousness attach upon the honest pursuit of the ends of justice by the light of common sense but the further this only honest system is from being either dangerous or impracticable the more complete as i flatter myself your lordship will perceive the moral impossibility that any further extension of it should meet the wishes or so much as the endurance of the man of law—a system under which there is no factitious delay vexation or expense nor consequently factitious profit parcel of that expense in which misdecision is but an accident instead of being as under the hitherto predominant system a frequent and probable not to say predominantly probable result prepared by the operation of a variety of assignable and peculiarly appropriate causes a system under which failure of justice can scarcely find a place instead of being as under the predominant system in virtue of the arrangements taken for the reconciliation of ease with profit the inevitable lot of the great body of the people devices a denomination that may serve to characterize the several arrangements principles and practices peculiar to the technical system in contradistinction to the natural all of them being so many modes of action conducive at any rate to the ends of judicature and therefore upon the face of them contrivances suggested by the desire of giving to the greatest practicable extent fulfilment to those sinister ends   follows a list of those devices for greater perspicuity two columns are placed side by side one containing a brief designation of the device the instrument of technical procedure the other the correspondent state of things under the natural system of procedure logically speaking the quality of the natural system will be seen to be chiefly of the negative cast constituted by the absence of those devices which constitute so many characteristic features of the technical system the arrangements here referred to the natural system are—partly so many arrangements actually in use and practice in the courts of natural procedure in some in most or in all of them—partly so many ulterior arrangements such as being conducive to the ends of the natural system that is to the ends of justice would be necessary to the purpose of giving to the power and beneficial influence of the natural system an extent commensurate with that of the whole field of judicature in the work at large under the head of each device explanations are given where they appeared necessary under four subordinate heads—nature and description of the device examples of the employment given to it in the established system its repugnancy to the ends of justice its subservience to the ends of judicature these elucidations all of them applicable to the english most of them but happily for scotland not all of them applicable to the scottish modification of the technical system pruned and sheltered by your lordships learned adviser would occupy too much room here but remain upon occasion at your lordships command at any time i arrangements of natural procedure   at the outset of the cause and afterwards where necessary the parties willing or unwilling heard in the character of witnesses as well as parties face to face except in so far as by reason of distance or otherwise such confrontation and mutual explanation is physically or prudentially impracticable prudentially i e without preponderant mischief in the shape of delay vexation and expense preponderant viz over the mischief in the shape of increased danger of misdecision for want of the security against deception afforded by such personal appearance and consequent explanations and examinations such conjunct appearance preceded or not by ex parte appearance of the plaintiff according to the nature of the case   by or in the name of a party no writing except in the character of evidence nor in that character except in the shape of minutes taken of the vivâ voce testimony delivered by the parties respectively on such their personal appearance as above when either party thinks fit provisionally to take upon himself the necessary expense or where testimony in the readywritten form becomes necessary either in the character of a supplement or that of a succedaneum to vivâ voce testimony as per article   for the use of printing as a succedaneum to writing in the case of the instrument of demand see article      testimony received in none but the best shape viz vivâ voce testification subject to counterinterrogation ex adverso and per judicem except in so far as the necessity of time for recollection arrangement investigation perusal of written documents c requires a supplement in the form of readywritten testimony

with that temperateness and respect for the constituted authorities which becomes honest men to become suitors for relief at the throne of sovereign power—the fountain of all relief as well as of whatsoever is administered under the name of justice should the following sheets be found to present any claim to attention it may perhaps be matter of convenience to you lordship to see at this early stage and at one glance the general result of the inquiry—my lord it is this—   that so far as concerns the breaking down of the court into sections as per resolutions         the result in respect of the ends of justice and the interest of the people in the character of suitors is all pare benefit—but so is it to the lawpartnership   that what concerns the mode of pleading as per resolution   being nothing more than a repetition in terminis of what has been law these twenty years as far as an act of the court of session could make it so promises no better fruit and that the profession if they have not much to hope have quite as little to apprehend from it   that in scotland of the proposed introduction of jury trial in civil cases as per resolutions         the probable mischief in the shape of increase of delay vexation and expense seems greater than its probable good effect in the shape of a security against misdecision that the proper stage for that species of judicature is that of appeal after a vivâ voce explanation upon oath between the parties and decision thereupon and not after a series of written pleadings not upon oath in the first instance always under the supposition—learned lords and gentlemen—but good my lord do not join them—will smile at the simplicity of it—that on the demesne hitherto on account of the richness of the soil reserved for the chace of lawyers profit the interest of the whole community may be thought fit to be cultivated in preference to the interest of that small but domineering part of it and the ends of justice pursued in preference to the ends of judicature   that the other arrangements proposed apparently in the character of remedies against delay vexation and expense as per resolutions  0               —viz optional substitution of appeals to advocations and suspensions interposition of a chamber of review between the court of session and the lords prohibition of appeals against interlocutors allowance of penal costs in the house of lords and retrenchment of superfluous judicial writings—bid fairer when taken together for increasing than diminishing the aggregate mass of that fund of suitors misery and lawyers profit and that the specific remedies which could scarce have failed to present themselves to an experienced eye have with congenial delicacy been put aside in consideration of their too extensive and too drastic efficacy   that of the system of disorder to which the plan upon the carpet applies its powder of post there is not any part that does not admit of a perfect cure which cure consists in nothing more than an extended application of remedies that as already submitted in the preceding pages have over and over again received the sanction of the legislature and that in that part of the field of procedure to which those efficient remedies have not yet been applied there is nothing that can render them less applicable to it than to those    to which with so complete though untrumpeted a success they have been applied already before i close this introductory letter i will beg leave just to hint at a circumstance which to a statesman of your lordships discernment and experience cannot i think but have suggested a suspicion at least not unfavourable to the conceptions above submitted among so large an assemblage of acute and vigilant minds whose interests are so materially concerned your lordship has received marks of satisfaction from many—of dissatisfaction i believe from none now that titius or sempronius should originate or even without the merit of origination support a measure by which to a limited amount his own interest in the gross sense of the word interest would be prejudiced is by no means without example and that persons of this generous frame of mind are even now to be found at no great distance from your lordship the present parliament has already testified but that any body of men especially so large and domineering a body should without the pressure of necessity manifest either active approbation or so much as anything like patient acquiescence under any measure which by such acceptance would be converted into a selfdenying ordinance is i am inclined to think absolutely without example certainly out of the ordinary course of human nature yet the plan has been in their hands these six months and such is the countenance generally if not universally turned to it by learned gentlemen they admire though as yet in the air the beauties of this new jerusalem they congratulate one another and even in print on the fresh prospects opened to them and under these circumstances no wonder that the spirit of the union that younger brother to the original contract remains still inviolate but should any plan present itself pursuing upon the only terms on which to any considerable extent it could be pursued the interest of the whole community—i mean at the expense of this predatory part of it—no sooner would any such plan excite an apprehension of its acceptance than the union would be no less in danger than the church at one time used to be such is the discovery a man might venture to predict without the gift of prophecy and that without any other reserve than this viz that as there are some predictions which by invitation will sometimes produce so there are others which by shame will sometimes prevent their own accomplishment to place their system under the protection and the country beyond redemption under the tyranny of dead men legislating on a state of things of which no conception had ever presented itself to their minds is among the standing resources of all those intestine formentors of the body politic whose prosperity depends upon the preservation of abuse in all or any of its forms against the attacks of the probe or the incisionknife in the reforming hand would your lordship wish to see and in a still clearer and stronger point of view the signification and value of this quietism compare it my lord—contrast it with the sort of countenance shown to the act   g ii c    for consigning to the language of the people the tenor and history of those proceedings by which their lives and fortunes are disposed of my lord the opposition it underwent from learned lords and gentlemen—underwent in both houses was ananimous so at least chandler in his account of the debates assures us chandler in terminis and with timberland for his support by the english particians of those days the same sense of injury was felt as was felt at rome by the learned lords and gentlemen of that time when the book of procedure so religiously kept under lock and key was stolen and published by the archthief flavius in such sort as forced them to compose another placing it under better guard in the one case the rule of action was locked up bodily in a box in the other it was locked up spiritually in a dead language—the same sense of injury that is felt by the same learned persons and as constantly howsoever covertly testified by some of them as often as by a wicked and juryless court of conscience act the possibility of obtaining justice in certain cases has been extended to this or that other minute portion of the people—the same sense of injury in a word as was felt by the shark who carried off one of sir brook watsons legs at the thoughts of being obliged to leave the other in its place a shark is still a shark in britain as at rome after the christian æra as before the ocean breeds them with triple rows of teeth the technical system with teeth not less sharp and bushy

above key compressed and imperfect as it is should the execution have fulfilled in any degree the wishes and humble endeavours of the workman your lordship may perhaps find it rather easier than at first to come at the real tendency and probable effects of the plan already put into your hands by the learned reformer such at least is the object of the attempt i am thus making upon your lordships

proceed to submit to your lordship in detail my remarks on the plan as delineated in the seventeen resolutions passed in the house of lords in the present letter i propose to consider in one group the

remedy against misdecision in so far as these mischiefs may respectively have the multiplicity of judges for their cause i repeat the resolutions here to save the trouble of reference— resolved—  that it appears to this committee that the increase of manufactures extension of trade improvements of agriculture and consequent multiplication of transactions have varied the nature and greatly increased the number of suits brought before the courts of law in scotland and thence by appeal into this house and that it has therefore become necessary that some alterations should be made in the establishment of the courts of law in that part of the united kingdom adhering as much as possible to the forms and principles of the laws of scotland and maintaining invariably the true meaning and spirit of the articles of union   that it will greatly conduce to the better administration of justice in the court of session and will be for the evident utility of scotland that the said court instead of sitting in one collective body of fifteen judges shall sit in such number of separate chambers as may be found most convenient and that the lords sitting in such chambers respectively shall exercise the same functions and shall enjoy the same authority and privileges as are now exercised and enjoyed by the whole lords sitting together   that in each of the said chambers one of the judges belonging to such chambers shall preside such presiding judge to be appointed by his majesty to the said office during good behaviour   that causes coming in the first instance into court as innerhouse causes may be brought before any one of the chambers at the choice of the party instituting the suit and that causes coming into the outerhouse before any one of the ordinary lords of session and there decided may be removed by reclaiming petition or otherwise into that chamber only of which such lord ordinary shall be a member substance of the proposed arrangements as follows—the existing court divided into several chambers number not yet fixed each possessing the authority of the whole—president in each not removable at pleasure—plaintiff to choose his chamber so far so good my lord—reasons uncontrovertible—   benefit of dispatch—degree of dispatch increasing in certain respects with the number of the chambers in how many different ways delay increases with the number of judges—at least when they are understood to lie all under an equal obligation to take an efficient part—for your lordships with respect be it spoken know how to make these things easy to you it were almost superfluous to inquire time for settling the opinion of each—thence of the slowest and most accomplished in the science of dubitation for in a court as in a convoy the pace of the whole is regulated by that of the slowest vessel think of — my lord and if the whole world could furnish them conceive fifteen —s decorum forbids notoriety renders unnecessary the filling up of these blanks—time spent in discussions—in bolting out misconceptions and clearing them up not to speak of wanderings and in supporting opposite opinions this even where everything is purity and bona fides but should a malâ fide suitor have need of delay and a single judge out of the fifteen be disposed to give it him then what end of doubts and misgivings and new    points started and adjournments but my lord i am trespassing all this while upon your lordships time and like the fat man in the crowd constituting the very nuisance i am denouncing—i conclude benefit of dispatch produced—ends of justice served the collateral ends—prevention of superfluous delay vexation and expense   benefit of economy—saving of delay and expense by expense of printing struck off—viz printing pleadings for to the abuse made in this way in england and elsewhere of the art of writing in scotland they have found means to add the abuse of printing yes lawpresses broken up at least if the number of chambers as your lordship has been stated as inclining to propose be as great as three three chambers give five judges to a chamber only one more than in our westminsterhall common law courts at present not one more than we had in them in former times no printing of pleadings in england nor the want of it ever felt or imagined but my lord i am running wild again and outstripping your learned reformer in the career of reformation for upon looking once more i find this economy is my own imagination all the while not his proposition the printing trade he has indeed noticed but for what purpose—for the purpose of encouraging it not cramping it for in resolution the   th for the use of the proposed new court of appeal at edinburgh printing is enacted nowhere is it repealed   benefit of competition viz as between chamber and chamber among all these chambers ends of justice served all together collateral and direct saving of delay vexation and expense security against misdecision likewise—oh my lord how straight and how pleasant when once a man has learnt to travel in them are the ways of justice on the field here in question in the benefit of competition my eyes weak as they are have served me for distinguishing two branches one consists in the multiplication of the shops and the choice given to the customer that is to the plaintiff as between shop and shop the plaintiff if he is bona fide—if his wishes are honest as in the ordinary state of things those of the plaintiff are for his own sake picking out the best so far as this branch of the benefit is concerned to be satisfied of the reality and at the same time to understand the value of it i see no need to look further my lord than to cockers arithmetic the other branch of the benefit consists in the influence of this multiplicity on the disposition and conduct of the dealers in ordinary trades—in trades not subject to a monopoly the nature and efficacy of this branch likewise is clear enough but in the very particular sort of trade here in question the great lawpartnership—the competition so nearly resembling that between the two shops kept by the same cabinetmaker one in the city the other in bondstreet—the process for extracting the true value of this branch of the benefit does not appear quite so simple in some instances indeed i think i see a positive value but in others if my calculation be correct the value of it is what the value of x is so apt to be negative think my lord of the competition between b r and c b and the fruit of it—imprisonment for debt on mesne process upon the mechanical principle above explained the judge taking care to see neither party and to know nothing about the matter for fear of being obliged to stop a man in his way to jail and so losing his profit upon the jail besides so much time and so many other of his fees on this part of the problem therefore the calculation being somewhat intricate and running up into the higher algebra i will not attempt to trespass on the time of cæsar with so long a sermon agreed about the measure i see no practical use in rummaging among the reasons for points of difference but should any occasion present itself in which the benefit looked for from this source should be proposed in opposition and in the character of a substitute to any arrangement promising benefits to my view of a less equivocal and more substantial texture then would be the time for weighing the value of this part of the acknowledged benefit in diamond scales such as they are i have a pair for the purpose and they are at your lordships command at any time but my lord as in some companies the more the merrier so in all competitions the more the brisker setting down this benefit at whatever it may be worth this and the first together i mean dispatch from three do they not bring us on to fifteen but at number    or before if any inequality of numbers be admitted comes singleseated judicature and with it a new and in my view in comparison of either i must confess a still more important benefit viz individual responsibility a board my lord is a screen the lustre of good desert is obscured by it illdesert slinking behind eludes the eye of censure wrong is covered by it with a presumption of right stronger and stronger in proportion to the number of the folds and each member having his circle of partial friends wrong in proportion again to the number multiplies its protectors of the several branches of the public service i would not positively undertake to say that judicature is without exception the one in which the advantages of individual responsibility operate in the strongest force but    where this force is at its least dimension it can never be too inconsiderable for regard other departments for aught i know there may be—the treasury for example—in which emulation finding no place and the scene lying necessarily in a closet board management may upon the whole be preferable in lord cokes time the treasure being in a single hand and that armed with a staff lord coke finds a use for the staff and says it is for keeping off sturdy beggars but under the softer manners of modern times the screen may be found for aught i know but your lordship knows exactly the more convenient implement imagine a commanderinchief stalking in to the treasury in full costume—coat of mail and helmet—crying out your money or your place coming to close quarters a lord treasurer might find the staff break sooner than the helmet—but the screen might have its uses—but my lord what has all this to do with law and justice oh but sir this is all theory—well then my lord let us refer the matter to experience in westminster hall two courts of equity—one the exchequer with four judges in it the other the chancery with but one thus to outside appearance but in fact the chancery includes two courts sometimes both on a level sometimes one above the other as the plaintiffs attorney thinks fit to place them in the one the chancellor in the other the master of the rolls now should this my lord—should it in your lordships opinion be among the secrets worth knowing call for your lordship has power call for the number of suits instituted in a year in each of the three respective courts mean time one thing i can take upon me to certify to your lordship—i who have no power—viz that of the two singleseated courts the one which has fewest causes has more by a great many—and not only now has but always had—and i speak of those suits alone in relation to which the competence stands on an equal footing more by a great many than the manyseated court in the english court of chancery the authority has from time to time been vested in three judges under the name of commissioners of the great seal but so often as this trebleseated tribunal has been set up so often has it been recognised as no better than a makeshift and still the manyseated has given place to singleseated judicature so miscellaneous are the functions of the lord chancellor that to the maintaining of this constant recurrence to simplicity other considerations may have lent their influence besides that of its subserviency to the ends of justice but from this surmise of other possible concurrent causes no clear inference can be deduced the effect for which the advantage in respect of judicature is of itself capable of accounting remains certain and thus much may at any rate be inferred that from this sooftenrepeated experiment no indications were ever afforded sufficient to produce a tendency anywhere to call in that instance for the permanent substitution of trebleseated or in any other degree manyseated to singleseated judicature of any such tendency i for my own part at least never met with any trace but without crossing the tweed the homebought stock of experience might in scotland one should have thought have afforded indications sufficiently conclusive in favour of the proposition that no superior prospect of advantage to justice is held out by manyseated in comparison of singleseated judicature eightandtwenty sheriffs courts next in authority to the court of session and in the aggregate covering the whole extent of the kingdom all singleseated courts even in the court of session itself everything without any limitation worth adverting to comes in the first instance under singleseated judicature and what advantage has been derived or so much as been thought to be derived from the transference to manyseated judicature let experience testify on this head whatever has been done has been done in the way of reduction—i speak of the riddance made of the lords extraordinary in george the firsts time in edinburgh itself close under the eye of the same public that calls so loudly for the decomposition of the manyseated court there exists one of these singleseated sheriffs courts no call has ever been made for the substitution of complication to simplicity in this instance and how should this be if any inconvenience were felt for want of it ever since the union indeed—almost these hundred years—scotland as well as england has had a court of exchequer in england a fourseated court in scotland a fiveseated—and of this experiment too as far as it goes the result is in favour of simplicity compared with the fifteenseated court general suffrage appears to be in its favour for no complaints against it have ever been heard and now a slice of jurisdiction i mean that which regards the teinds anglicè tithes is proposed to be cut off from the manyseated court and given to the fewseated one manyseated to be sure it is in comparison of the singleseated courts    but this proves nothing against simplicity for in scotch exchequer judicature there has been no singleseated court to try against the manyseated one as there has been and is in english equity there are indeed the fourteen singleseated courts with a lord ordinary in each but such is the mode of being of these courts—sometimes detached from the fifteenseated court sometimes absorbed into it—that the distinctness necessary for comparison is not there to be found out of five causes brought before the lord ordinary he does not it is said pronounce a decision on more than one the four others being for mere want of time handed up by him to the inner house before any considerable portion of his labour has been expended upon them at its institution anno      why was the court so crowded as we see it because france was the model for everything and in france judicature was thus crowded in france how came judicature to be thus crowded because the sale of the seats was an object of finance from this sinister interest came the custom from the custom the prejudice and that prejudice so strong that it became a sort of axiom—that if in any instance the ends of judicature failed of being fulfilled it was for want of a sufficiently great multitude of judges we have a book my lord on this subject by condorcet a quarto volume with   0 wellfilled pages in it all algebra all demonstration and this axiom preface p    a basis of it sieyes in one of his plans improved upon this and to combine learning with popularity and compose a substitute for reason out of two blind prejudices he set up in every little town down to i forget what degree of minuteness a jurybox stuffed with lawyers but to feed this receptacle and keep it constantly filled after the requisite allowance for rotations and radiations and challenges the quantity of learning not to speak of probity with which he proposed to enrich the territory of the republic and by what means the learning itself was to find the necessary pabulum must be left for imagination to conceive now then my lord supposing that by the evidence of experience or in a word by evidence of all sorts put together singleseated judicature were proved to stand no higher than upon a par with manyseated judicature would not its title to preference be complete il ne faut pas multiplier les étres sans nécessité says a good french proverb is not this my lord among the cases that fall within it if in such a multitude of shops there should chance to be here and there one that should find itself without customers even in this case there would be no harm done the judge whose learned leisure remained thus undisturbed would be virtually in the condition of one to whom his salary is continued in the character of a pension of retreat—and to form an anomaly not altogether devoid of curiosity in the natural history of pensions here would be so many of these articles of expenditure the propriety of which would find itself attested by universal suffrage another thing—two additional manyseated courts require each a president and the scotch as well as english of president is if my dictionary inform me right additional salary this additional salary your lordship in your quality of presiding guardian of the public purse would find a delight in saving besides the correspondent burthen of patronage which by right honourable persons in your lordships high and highly responsible station has always been felt to gravitate with so severe a pressure but a single judge would no more admit a president than after a critical examination the largest elephant in the world was found to admit of either a superior or a rival in himself i dwell on this topic the more distinctly because in the succedaneous or supplemental plan which i propose to myself the honour of submitting to your lordship among my facienda additional salaries are so unhappily and inevitably abundant i mean for the existing local judges to draw them off from the service of the technical mammon and purchase the whole of their time for the service and benefit of justice provincial judges obscure but useful drudges—   if i do not miscount in number—who from so high an observatory as your lordships being too far distant to be viewed without a telescope such as your lordships learned assistant has not presented you with found no one to endeavour to bring them under your lordships notice but a drudge still obscurer than themselves but to return from this digression if england be so fit a model for scotland in respect of multiplication of juries why not in respect of reduction of judges and reduction or rather avoidance of increase of salaries the argument might be pushed further by observing that in the manyseated courts almost the whole of the efficient and honest part of the business—i mean the conduct of the trial—is performed by single judges—that of the business done in full court by far the greater part is made business business that had the ends of justice been the ends of judicature would never have come to be done and that out of every three of the four judges the best that can at any time be said and more than can at all times be said is—that they do no harm  0 take a man of commanding eloquence and character such for instance as lord mansfield was give him conceits such as lord mansfield was said to have had of putting himself in the place of king lords and commons and then see whether there may not be a convenience to such a chief in having for his supporters a train of everobsequious puisne judges then comes sir james burrows triumphant unanimity—an unanimity not so flagitious indeed but in other respects not much dissimilar to the unanimity so regularly and with so little expense in addition to that of perjury produced by torture among juries to speak plainly my lord i really see but two reasons if reasons they are to be called for the putting of so many judges in each chamber—one is that there is a stock of learned materials that somehow or other must be disposed of the other is that here are so many situations which may be continued without complaint because they exist already and which it would be so delightful for a multitude of learned persons to look up to and for some one learned person to have as at present the disposal of as to the first reason i feel what is due to public decorum combined with individual sensibilities but amidst such a number of persons at such a time of life if there are not already in the nature of things there cannot but soon be several to whom repose would be more acceptable than labour especially labour so unremitted as theirs is universally described to be and without insisting on their being killed off at any rate the supernumeraries may be suffered to die off as to the other reason unfortunately it is not the less persuasive for being incapable of being avowed and to this i must confess i have no better reply to make than what is contained in that project of my own for improving the condition and increasing the dignity and utility of the provincial sheriffs courts if what has been said in behalf of individual responsibility and singleseated judicature should not yet be found conclusive materials are not wanting for ulterior and diversified appeals to experience none of them without a precedent already in existence—all of them without addition to expense   in one court five learned lords as in the existing court of exchequer—the court which in respect of the number of the seats seems to have been taken as the model for the three proposed chambers   in another court four learned lords as in each of the three commonlaw courts in westminster hall   in another court—or in one of the above instead of the number above proposed two learned lords neither more nor less as in the welsh courts each of them serving upon occasion to prevent the other from doing anything a result that has now and then manifested itself in the other courts having seats as above in even numbers   moreover if number three were regarded as possessing any properties peculiar to itself—number three though unsanctioned by any particular precedent that i know of unless the three seats occasionally substituted in the character of a temporary makeshift to the higher single seat in the court of chancery be considered in that light might find its exemplification along with any two of the numbers already mentioned in each case there would still be learned materials enough left for courts more than one with single seats in them and forasmuch as a course of experimental judicature is intended to be delivered it were a pity that if the joint evidence of theory and experience in favour of singleseated judicature be not accepted as conclusive the experiment should not be diversified under as many forms as it is susceptible of thinking three degrees of jurisdiction whereof two of appeal numerous enough—sheriffs courts and others in the provincial towns metropolitan courts in edinburgh with concurrent jurisdiction as proposed and house of lords in the imperial metropolis one more than in ordinary cases we have in england quite sufficient—the existing inner house therefore at the best a superfluity which in degrees of jurisdiction each swarming with delays vexations and expenses is as much as to say a nuisance—your lordship sees already what my conceptions cannot but be of the proposed  th degree of jurisdiction—the chamber of review but of this in its place after which and after i have humbly represented to your lordship what representations are i propose to myself i believe it will be in the omissa to submit to your lordship by how many points the existing inner house always has been and in whatever number of chambers it were to come to be divided still would be worse than useless meantime at the bare idea of such a dissolution i see their whole lordships up in arms actually existing inner house three projected inner houses—all vanished no houses left but outhouses—each learned lord reduced to the condition of a mere lord ordinary the lord president left with nobody to preside over but himself the two bonuses the use and function of which was to produce on the part of the two leaders among their learned lordships a conviction of the utility of the plan an utility so transcendent as to outweigh even the mischief of innovation—these two allcomposing anodynes both gone    so redundant is the population of the inner house found to be when once any principle of reason or experience comes to be applied to it—so large the proportion of the mass that runs into scoriæ when once put into this test—so raging the disease so urgent the pressure that even mr malthus with his inflexibility and his bitter remedy might find himself at a loss to cope with it submitting mine i submit it rather for illustration than for any serious hope of seeing it carried into practice to give reception to it the interest of suitors would be to be preferred to the amour propre of so many judges the whole interest of   00000 unlearned to that delicate and tender part of the interest of fifteen preeminently learned persons the ends of justice to the ends of judicature—and in scotland in particular not to speak of other countries was ever any such preference to any extent worth speaking of so completely without a precedent as to the persuading a learned lord to sit in a court in which he would be sole judge instead of sitting in a court of no wider nor higher an extent of jurisdiction in which he would be but one out of five it is not there if that were all that i should be apprehensive of much difficulty the misfortune is that of the jurisdiction at present exercised by the court of session a great part and if i apprehend it right by far the greatest is jurisdiction in the first instance so small being the proportion of the number of causes that receive a decision from the lords ordinary and the business of the billchamber it is to be hoped not being sufficient when added to place the majority on that side at present the population of this upper story of the college of justice with the exception of the lord president standing the whole of it upon one level here would be a necessity for disturbing the equilibrium and fixing it on two different levels dividing it between an upper and an under school and here it is not as in the case of the two additional proposed chambers in which two learned persons are to gain each a remove their fellows remaining as they were but a sort of turning down or degradation would be to be effected of those who at present do upper as well as underschool exercise some being abased and confined to underschool exercise alone seeing their fellows at the same time exalted and set for ever above such inferior exercise here then would be the rub in some schools where a pill of the bitter kind has been to be swallowed lots have been cast to know to what part out of the whole number it shall be administered but that has been propter delictum which takes it out of the present case and unfits it for a precedent in our spiritual courts the same learned person is found i have heard it remarked to act alternately the part of judge and advocate coming upon the theatre of justice sometimes in the one character sometimes in the other with the most amiable condescension and with that facility and promptitude which is acquired by practice but that on that or any other theatre of justice any such custom has ever prevailed as that of a judge ad quem descending and coming on in the character of a judge à quo is more than i recollect an instance of especially where the descent has not been occasional alternating with reascent but permanent and definitive the misfortune is—it is impossible to disguise it—that not only on the existing plan but on my plan jurisdiction in the first instance is sheriffdeputes substitutes work and while any one of their lordships had appellatejurisdiction work to do and that alone to expect that any other of their equally learned lordships should set his hand to sheriffdeputes substitutes work would be an expectation about as extravagant as that the housekeeper of any of their lordships should set her hand to kitchenmaids work and undertake to wash the dishes in the military department indeed how often have we not seen in histories at least one general serving as volunteer under another a senior even under a junior but how different—how opposite or rather disparate in every point—are the two lines of service in the one a man hazarding his own life to save life and everything to his fellowsubjects in the other sitting upon a cushion to dispose of theirs not forgetting to secure a few pickings out of their fortunes to his own use honour the endowment of the soldier learning that of the man of law are south and north more opposite than honour and lawlearning—lawlearning with falsehood for the basis of it this then being hopeless—and whatever else may savour of selfdenial or sacrifice of personal profit or vulgar pride to public good or to more refined and sublimated pride from members of a body so placed and so habituated alike hopeless—your lordship will comprehend without difficulty with how much greater satisfaction i should see any such conception confuted than confirmed—it remains that for doing sheriffs work we should be reduced to men as yet unlorded to men upon no higher a level than that of sheriffsdepute substitute yet a time there was—and that at no great distance—at which a curtius of this stamp might not improbably have been to be found there lived an honest man once ever among their learned lordships whom they called swinton—lord swinton—the same whom on a pilgrimage made by him to england—like    that of herodotus to egypt or the fabled one of anacharsis to greece—to england as to the seat of more antique and mysterious learning judge buller perceiving in the man a sort of an excrescence like your love of justice and looking upon him for it as an oddity a species of howard like a man with two thumbs or a calf with five legs took upon himself to quizz telling of him a good story which i choose rather to leave for a bulleriana or kingsbenchiana than to entertain your lordship with it in this man judging of him from his pamphlet which perhaps your lordship may have seen and which is all i have to judge him from except the smalldebt act for which if it be his as it is said to be thousands and tens of thousands born and unborn are bound to bless his name—in this man i should have expected to find a sort of scrub a judgeofallwork ready to serve justice in any capacity in which he could be made useful to her and like another honest man far beneath him whom for different odd jobs i may in the course of these letters have occasion to present to your lordships notice without scratching his head for something to drink or calling for increase of wages not but that—could the plan of so unqualified a reformer as he who thus presumes to obtrude himself upon your lordships notice present any title to acceptance—work and that of a kind not to be disdained by any hand would be to be found for one at least of these indubitably learned and supposed superfluous distributors of justice work in its nature somewhat different from their present occupation but in dignity not inferior and with an appropriate title i mean that of inspectorgeneral—say lord inspector—of scotch law but of him and his functions in my short list of facienda moreover if another of them would condescend to take english and another again irish judicature under his care they would neither of them i would venture to say find in either field any want of matter meet for observation i have already ventured to confess to your lordship that under the existing feegathering system my expectations from the benefit of competition so far as concerns one branch of that benefit are far from sanguine but my lord since upon my plan we have so many preeminently learned persons each of himself a court and in the habit of being one upon our hands i will venture so much further as to submit to your lordship one experiment which although there could be no sort of competition in it would be but the more instructive and in proposing the experiment so bold am i for this once that without any sort of pretension to the gift of prophecy i will moreover venture to predict the result let any number of courts be set to proceed in the way of natural procedure let any other number for shortness let us speak as if in each case there were but one be left to proceed in the way of technical procedure according to the existing practice such being the experiment now as to the result the result will be my lord a separation of plaintiffs into two groupes— bonâ fide plaintiffs—every one of them without exception will go to the court of natural procedure malâ fide plaintiffs—every one of them without exception will go to the court of technical procedure every one of them—that is if there be any—if with his motives upon his forehead any lawyer—advocate writer to the signet agent—whatever be his nature or his name—should be to be found hardy enough to lend himself to a procedure of which where there is any other to be had the oppression of the defendant will be the sole object as well as manifest result to the court of natural procedure will betake himself every man who wishing to have his due with as little delay vexation and expense as possible is content for the benefit of seeing the obligation of veracity imposed upon his adversary to face him before the judge and take that same obligation upon himself to the court of technical procedure will betake himself every man who having a demand for the power of imposing upon his adversary a quantity of expense and vexation and wanting delay as an instrument for letting in and laying on the vexation and expense—whether it be for the simple purpose of inflicting torment or for the purpose of compelling by the terrors of such torment or the inability of enduring it longer a surrender of the naboths vineyard by which his concupiscence has been provoked—having an effectual demand i say for this jus nocendi and being content to torment himself for the advantage of applying corresponding torment to his adversary goes of course to the only officina justiciæ where jus nocendi is to be sold as to the court of natural procedure and the destiny that will await the causes introduced into it i can venture to submit an estimate not unworthy of your lordships notice a little less than a third or some other such large proportion of the whole number of causes will receive their decision on the first day and after one appearance on both sides—a little less than another third on the next day the defendant having made default the first but still with but one appearance on each side or with but one appearance and that on the plaintiffs side—a little less than the remaining third still on the second    day though in this case by adjournment—and thus with two appearances on each side i speak from a twenty years experience acquired in a court of conscience of which in another place and presently your lordship shall see—if not an estimate an expectation—from much higher indeed from the very highest authority and still more favourable other suits there doubtless are to the delay and expense of which as resulting from some assignable cause or causes of complication a table of which is hereto subjoined even under natural procedure no such limits as the above nor even any determinate limits can be assigned but these would most assuredly not amount to a tenth part of the whole number of civil causes of all sorts those included which cannot now come as well as those which can and do come under the jurisdiction of the courts of conscience or say of the smalldebt courts among these suits there are some in which the use of writing in the first instance will be necessitated by the circumstance of distance but that the exercise of the jus mentiendi is not necessarily attached to that of the art of writing is known even to english equity for all these extraordinary cases for such they are in comparison of the bulk of causes that would come for justice if it were to be had full provision is accordingly made in the plan the outline of which will be submitted to your lordship in the facienda but here another difficulty presents itself after travelling and so much at their ease and through the whole course of the learned part of their lives in the road that leads to the ends of judicature their lordships would be apt to find themselves a little awkward it may be feared when set to travel in so new and strange a road as that which leads by the shortest cut to the ends of justice my lord i feel the force of the difficulty but nothing but absolute necessity shall make me regard it as insuperable various expedients present themselves—there are schools in which grown gentlemen may learn to dance there are schools in which grown judges might learn to do justice each learned lord has servants most of their learned lordships have or have had children to whom in case of any little transgressions or disputes such as will sometimes present themselves in all families—to whom at any rate i speak of the children if not to the servants he will have been desirous to do and will accordingly have done justice each learned lord or at any rate almost every learned lord has or has had a lady whose learning let us hope if she has any bears no resemblance to his own if in that domestic tribunal he has not been in the habit of exercising the judicial office himself or even if he has let him put himself under her tuition for a while behold in her rules and orders a set of acts of sederunt to which i will not do any such injustice as not to suppose them better than his own and read in her fair hands his improved book of practice should that course of schooling in the instance of this or that learned tyro fail or be found insufficient let him follow the precedent though not literally set as above by the good lord swinton let him betake himself—not to a jurybox as lord swinton did—he will not find there exactly what he stands in need of—but to the nearest scotch smalldebt court—or it looking upon a visit to any such neighbouring school as a sort of remedy for his leprosy too near akin to a dip in the river jordan he does not any more than lord swinton grudge crossing the tweed let him repair to birmingham and put himself under the tuition of mr hutton whose amusing as well as instructive account of the proceedings of the court of conscience there as carried on under his presidence is lying on the table before me and who if applied to by any man in that elevated station will i am certain not refuse that information which in my obscure and humble station he has granted to me but not to impose on every one of their learned lordships the necessity of any of these wild pilgrimages there exists if on a hasty glance i comprehend this part of the carte du pays right—there exists in that spacious mansion called the outer house including in itself so many mansions one in which there sits a learned lord called the lord ordinary on oaths and witnesses on him is imposed i see on particular occasions the degrading function of sitting to receive in their own proper or rather improper persons the canaille of suitors there he finds himself now and then obliged—for i believe he finds it impossible to escape from them altogether—to hear them and examine them and thus to get from them the truth in its native crude and impure state without having it refined and doublerefined and treblerefined by being percolated through the lips and pens of commissioners and commissioners clerks and agents and writers to the signet and advocates and courtofsession clerks of so many sorts and sizes in this ergasterium if i understand the matter right it falls to the lot of each of their lordships the president excepted in his turn to drudge if then after drawing the truth or whatever is given for truth in this crude state and from whatever sources it is to be had from and that at the very outset of the cause and from both parties at once and without a syllable previously written by professional lawyers of either side or at any other time unless it be worth while as the parties and witnesses if    any speak to set down what they say—if with these little variations he can prevail upon himself to decide upon the evidence at once instead of setting it or something that passes for it to be committed to writing to be decided upon by some other judge who has heard nobody seen nobody and knows nothing about the matter he will have judged under the system of natural procedure whether he knows it or not as truly and scientifically as it ever happened to monsieur jordan to talk prose can the utility or the practicability of the natural system admit of doubt let us call authority then to solve it my lord and let us look up at once to the highest in this line— even mr hutchinson—i should have said his right honourable corrector of the press—p xiv—the lord president—speaking p     of the scotch smalldebt courts courts of natural procedure admits that the mode of procedure there pursued parties present no mendacitylicence is most excellent pp       0         meaning for a debt of £ —of course for a debt of £ 0 if incurred at ten different times the same learned gentlemen are indeed equally clear that the selfsame mode of procedure or at any rate that the selfsame courts are stark naught for a debt of £   s—it is plain say they p     that in this country the sum could not at present with propriety be raised above £  sterling† add a shilling to the £  thereupon comes the necessity of a determination on the part of the judge never to set eyes on the parties coupled with a determination to read or pretend to have read lawyers scribble heaped together in volumes printed with the benefit of the mendacitylicence as to the distinction itself nothing can be clearer but as to any ground for it relation being had to the ends of justice nothing of this sort is attempted to be given nor ever will the task being upon the face of it an impossible one in vain would it be to say when you get above £  learning is necessary and learning is not to be found among nonlawyers the noblemen and gentlemen who sit and act as justices of peace in these smalldebt courts this being admitted—not that the connexion between height of value and demand for learning has place in so many as a fifth part even of the causes above that value—this however being admitted still the ground would be never the stronger draw the boundary line where you will still it would remain to be proved that while truth is sufficient to justice below the line mendacity is necessary above it the mode of inquiry pursued in the system of procedure is one thing the description of the hands by or under which the inquiry is conducted and justice or something that is called justice is administered under that system is another whatsoever repugnancy learned minds may feel at the idea of pursuing with truth before them the only course leading to the discovery of it the bar is of their own making learned feet could they be prevailed on are no less capable of pursuing that track than unlearned ones so in regard to space and time in the one case there is a straight road of a mile long and without a turnpike in it in the other case you may go to or at least towards the same place by a road of a hundred miles in length—full accordingly of turnings and windings—full moreover of quicksands and pitfalls and equally full of turnpikes in conducting the traveller nothing obliges the conductors to avoid the straight road and drag him along the crooked one nor would they ever have given themselves any such trouble had it not been for the turnpikes the tolls of which are so regularly settled and the tills in such good keeping—learned feet could they be prevailed on are no less capable of treading the short road than unlearned ones as to our learned author so long as the travellers are low people and unable to pay turnpikes he is content that they shall be let into the onemile road where there are no turnpikes but as everything that begins must begin somewhere his calculation is—that where the value of the article to be travelled in quest of begins to rise above £  there begins the influx of your respectable sort of people who are able to pay the turnpikes then accordingly comes the time for shutting up the bowlinggreen onemile road which is without turnpikes and opening the bonesetting or bonebreaking hundredmile road crowded all the way with turnpikes it is not says he p     without some very good reason assigned that the court is to be delayed from one day to another but each days roll ought to be determined if possible at one sederunt as the loss of time besides the injury to the community is a very serious evil to persons in the lower ranks of life for whose benefit this act was principally intended every day every mile beyond the first is grudged your lordship sees by the humanity and justice of these learned gentlemen where the persons detained are low people out of whom nothing or at least nothing worth stooping for is to be got and the persons detaining are unlearned people by whom nothing is ever got and for whom nothing is intended but no sooner do your respectable people come up—bang goes the gate of the    onemile road in their faces and they find themselves thrust into the hundredmile road with more propriety i might have called it the  00 or  000 mile road while humanity and justice are as fast asleep as ever london watchman was at his stand in the one case not a single days delay will learned gentlemen endure to hear of without some very good reason assigned—in the other case days of delay by hundreds not to say by thousands insisted for and not an attempt to assign so much as the shadow of a reason—but nemo dat quod non habet thus it is that till that explanation shall come of which your lordship will judge whether it can ever come your lordship has not only reasoning which being my reasoning and without any intrinsic authority for its support is worth so little but authority which including as it does the authority of the right honourable president is beyond all price for being persuaded that the natural system of procedure is most excellent and even for causes of all sorts and sizes at any rate if administered with the benefit of that learning which if properly commissioned nothing but its own diffidence shall i say at any rate its own reluctance can prevent from administering justice in this most excellent mode in which unlearned gentlemen administer it without difficulty and so much to the satisfaction of their learned superordinates their satisfaction—yes my lord and their delight for it would do your lordship good to turn to mr hutchinsons book and see with what energy these learned persons over and over again plead the cause of natural procedure as personified in these smalldebt courts always supposing that at the exact sum of £  she makes a full stop by how rich a fund of virtue in the shape of candour disinterestedness devotion to the laws love of justice and i know not how many other shapes all that eloquence has been fed but until that explanation shall come which can never come it may be worth your lordships while to consider lest the force of such high authority should act in a wrong direction whether necessity was not the material of which all that virtue was composed and whether the real object were not seeing that what was done could not be undone to stop the unprofitable system from going further and for that purpose upon the strength of so much virtue to obtain credit for the insuperability of that inestimable bar of which no description was given because it was not to be found a circumstance which does not tend to weaken this suspicion is the care taken to bolster up this bar by the hack epigram made by montesquieu and retailed by blackstone in which the idea of incompatibility as between justice and liberty is insinuated a piece of sophistry which whether in design or no may be set down as being in tendency one of the most mischievous that wit was ever employed in varnishing and which before i close this address i feel myself strongly tempted to strip of its varnish that lawyers in general and especially lawyers to whose authority height gives weight may by shame and fear of public indignation find themselves estopped from using it fourandtwenty thousand six hundred causes in little more than eight years making  0   causes in a year is the number stated by the mr hutchinson and his right honourable collaborator i     as determined in one alone of two smalldebt courts in the edinburgh districts alone of the county of edinburgh exclusive of the two other country districts—population     0 as per returns printed by the house of commons viz if my conception of the districts meant to be designated by him be right of which i can form no assurance but take it in any way to the purpose of the conclusion there will be little difference— number of causes of the same description afforded by the whole population of scotland setting down at 0 the causes determined by the other edinburgh smalldebt court but supposing the whole population of scotland equally fertile in suits     0 numbers of new causes introduced per week into the court of session as per edinburgh review january   0  p     about   0 or  00 say then     making per year supposing    of these weeks in a year vacation times excluded    0 now then my lord if the mode of procedure pronounced most excellent by that right honourable and most competent judge be not to his belief most excellent how can he justify himself ask him my lord in certifying it to be most excellent in these     0 cases but if it be so excellent always saving and reserving to him the benefit of that distinction which will never come how can he justify himself in opposing the ineffable and unsurmountable bar to the extension of this most excellent mode to the    0 causes one observation more my lord to save learned gentlemen the trouble of seeking support in a straw which would break in their hands as soon as touched in vain would it be to plead in bar to the personal appearance of parties the vexation it would be attended with   the vexation which you grudge not to impose on     0 persons shall you grudge the imposing it on    0   the vexation which does not preponderate    against the advantage in so many other shapes where the value at stake is no more than £  shall it preponderate where the value at stake is  0  00  000times as much   the vexation which you never grudge imposing upon a man where the cause he is to attend upon is one in which he has no concern i speak of extraneous witnesses shall you grudge the imposing it upon him where the cause is his own   thus the matter would stand as between one man in the character of a party and another man in the character of a witness but my lord who does not know that frequently the appearance of a single man in the character of a party will save the appearance of any number of men in the character of witnesses   the vexation attached under natural procedure to the personal attendance of a party before the judge is less than that portion alone of the vexation attached to technical procedure which consists in the attendance necessary to be paid to his own lawyers   vain and groundless will be seen to be every use that can be made of the article of vexation in the character of an objection to natural as opposed to technical procedure when it is considered that of the vexation attached to litigation in general and in particular of the portion attached to attendance of parties little less than the whole was factitious—the produce of the industry of the predecessors of learned judges made by them in conjunction with one set of their partners viz malâ fide suitors who for the part borne by them in it get payment—plaintiffs as above—defendants also as above besides the benefit of delay—factitious mischief made by the managing partners on purpose in order to force men as they did injured and injurers together into the hands of another division of the partnership—the hireling and naturally treacherous assistants and substitutes of the parties the effect was produced—partly by swallowing up the local judicatures and thus enhancing the vexation and expense of journeys—partly by encouraging sham excuses for nonappearance called essoigns and multiplying incidents ad infinitum and so enhancing the vexation and expense of demurrage—all this in a state of society which afforded neither roads nor carriages nor lodgingplaces nor safety anywhere in my first letter in hanging up the two companionsketches of natural and technical procedure i had occasion to state this—and now to prove it i call the right honourable the lord president but my lord his evidence your lordship sees is already half given—a single day viz a few minutes in that day is all the time he says as above that a cause ought to last in general and setting aside the extraordinary cases there is the half that has been already given the other half that remains to be given consists in an estimate of the number of days minimum maximum and medium which the same individual cause that ought to be and commonly is dispatched in a small part of a day by unlearned judges parties being present at the outset would be drawn through in the hands of those learned persons over whom he presides—be drawn through—i mean in the several cases of its visiting the  st the  d the  d and the  th of those degrees of jurisdiction to the number of which as not being yet sufficient it is now proposed to add a fifth it is not without pain believe me my lord that i feel myself obliged to come to such close quarters with my learned adversaries if such they are to be and to apply a scrutiny of so rough a texture to a book which commands my admiration by so many titles but if i thus treat them as adversaries it is for the purpose of converting them into allies—and labouring under such a load of disadvantage contending against principalities and against powers having a great battle to fight and but one pair of hands and those very weak to fight it with prudence will not suffer me to neglect an advantage so eminent and so rare nothing my lord do i impute to these two learned persons or either of them that i do not find myself equally obliged to impute as the effect of the original sin of the whole race to all the inns whether of court or chancery as well as to the whole college of justice ah my lord—if your lordship could but prevail on the lord high chancellor or the lord chiefjustice of all england to write a book or what comes to the same thing to give a regular revisal to one sheet by sheet without one exception—to a book i mean showing how everything is as it should be and in particular how jurytrial placed and ordered as it is is a boon so perfect as to excite astonishment at the blindness that can hesitate about acceptance—could your lordship by any entreaty obtain for england a lecture ex cathedrâ correspondent to that which has been so generously and spontaneously bestowed upon scotland—ah my lord what sport should you then see but to return to my experiment—a competition if such it must be called—not between judge and judge both under the same system but between system and system technical procedure and natural procedure here would be an experiment indeed my lord—a true experimentum crucis has your lordship nerves for it fiat experimentum was the favourite dictum of that chancellor who i presume had his seat in the cabinet of that    day and who was at once the father of philosophy and the legislator of legislators fiat experimentum was the language of lord chancellor bacon would it be the language of lord chancellor erskine lord grenville letter iii proposed system of pleading in the present letter i propose to say what little there seems at present any use in saying on the little that on the subject of pleadings i find said in resolution the  th—the resolution which takes that subject for its theme resolved—  that in all causes whether originally brought before the lord ordinary or before the chambers as innerhouse causes the defender shall in his defence distinctly admit or deny all relevant facts alleged in the summons or other writ by which the cause is brought into court further on my lord i observe profession ample and yet performance scanty—but where what is professed is nothing what can be expected of performance of this profession the manifestly professed object is diminution of factitious delay vexation and expense viz in so far as the defendants share in the process called in english law pleading is concerned now my lord were it really an object to do away or diminish the factitious part of that aggregate mass of inconvenience learned gentlemen would not could not be at a loss admit compel even both parties in the first instance into the presence of the judge sending them however not from the orkneys to edinburgh but from the orkneys to kirkwall scotland has the happiness of possessing already a set of local courts by which the scotch metropolitan courts stand divested of the pretence which the english ones have made to themselves for turning a deaf ear to that first principle of justice admit them—but under that security for veracity which is never refused in the case where temptations to the opposite vice have no existence—which is never refused in the case of the most unexceptionable extraneous witness—take away in a word the mendacitylicence as it is already taken away in those civil courts where justice in all its shapes is really the object—in the english courts of conscience and in the scotch smalldebt courts do this and all relevant facts will really be either admitted or denied and on each occasion with whatever distinctness the ends of justice in the opinion of the judge require if the first word is not distinct enough he calls for a second and so on till he gets one that he looks upon as adequate to the purpose being exactly what happens where a man is heard and examined and crossexamined in the character of an extraneous witness—and what is more along with the distinctness you will get truth at least as surely as you could expect to get it from an extraneous witness—that truth which would so ill accord with the interest of the learned framer of the resolution and his learned partners and which accordingly he does not so much as profess to aim at what—put an end to written pleadings—rob us of our business—knock up our profession—substitute turkish to scotch and english justice whence comes this man—from the jacobin club or from st lukes loud laughter among learned lords and gentlemen—but will lord grenville join in it the defendant shall says the learned reformer be distinct in his admissions and denials what does it depend upon him then my lord to give distinctness to the language of a man he never hears and in a word of every man yes if he were a judge with the defendant before him—but that is the very thing which no learned lord or gentleman can ever bear to think of and yet he commands and in commanding undertakes for and predicts distinctness now then my lord let us see what are the chances his prediction has of finding itself fulfilled as often as the defendant is in malâ fide which in the most common sort of cause debt is most commonly the case it is the interest of that one of the parties that there shall be no such distinctness be he in malâ or in bonâ fide such at any rate is the interest of his lawyer and on these two it is—but in an infinitely greater proportion taking the suitors in the aggregate upon the lawyer that distinctness depends now then as to the chance of fulfilment how stands the matter at present no distinctness at present—for it is the want of it that is the very grievance to be remedied—how as to the future—though distinctness is the sole object nothing is so much as proposed for promoting it in future—and yet the learned reformer with his prophetic as well as imperative shall makes sure of it the learned gentleman who has distinctness at his command had he begun with giving it to his own conceptions and expectations might it not have been of use on occasions of this sort my lord there is a something which without the aid of learning common sense is pretty much in the habit of doing towards securing distinctness in respect of admissions and denials and that is—whatever having been asserted on one side is not denied on the other to set down as admitted and whatsoever being attempted to be denied is not denied with sufficient distinctness to set down that too upon occasion    as not denied but admitted such is the practice my lord and that not only where common sense is happy enough to continue unoppressed by learning but even in the midst of learning and in spite of it—for example in all reciprocating affidavitwork not to mention other instances had he gone thus far and said—whatsoever relevant facts being alleged in the plaintiffs summons c are not denied or are not distinctly denied by the defendant in his defence shall be regarded as admitted—by so doing something might perhaps have been done done i mean towards the apparently professed object—the abridgment of these written pleadings with their io mio and arrio of delay vexation and expense—and this too though perhaps not altogether without cramping yet certainly without knocking up the learned trade i speak my lord taking the matter upon the footing of the french chevalier dindustries position—monseigneur il faut que je vive and setting aside as surplusage the lieutenant de polices reply—monsieur je nen vois pas trop la necessité the case is my lord—as i hope i may now say your lordship sees—that so long as written pleadings especially in the scotch style continue to be received—without oath or equivalent security or faculty of counterinterrogation—it is the interest of those on whom it depends and it depends on those whose interest it is that there shall be no end to them on either side nor therefore any distinctness in them or truth—and it is in this state of things that the learned reformer undertakes by his fiat to infuse distinctness into all conceptions and all pens my lord on this subject there is a supposition which i really know not how to get rid of and which is—that in presenting to your lordship this his recipe for the cure of indistinctness the learned practitioner must have represented himself as doing something which had not been done before never surely could he have said to your lordship—this my nostrum is one of the powderofposts which the pharmacopæia juridica edinburgensis is full of—which we have been administering every day for these twenty years and which has never yet been found to have any more effect than it was designed to have no my lord this could never have been his language—what he must have said is—this is a new preparation which will now come to be tried for the first time along with the other novelties such was the character i had of course ascribed to it judge my lord of my surprise—a surprise in which i should expect your lordship would not be altogether without a share—when in rummaging among the acts of sederunt i found a part of one and of so recent a date as   th august      in these terms—when the defendant receives the summons he shall therewith return upon a separate paper his whole defences both dilatory and peremptory stating the facts he is to insist upon and explicitly admitting or denying the several facts set forth in the pursuers libel to be sure the tenor is not precisely the same—anno      explicitly anno   0  distinctly—but whether in purport there be any material variance your lordship will judge now then my lord this law of the scotch judges is it acted upon or not if acted upon your lordship sees what has come of it if not acted upon but neglected what security does the resolution give—what security is it in the power of the learned author to give—that the neglect will not continue as to neglect your lordship will please to observe that it is no more than has happened to many and many a law of more substantial texture for my lord in the court of session the very carpet they tread upon is made of shreds of laws enacted broken to shivers lying one upon another in heaps unabrogated unremoved—a carpet than which none was ever softer to the foot of a corrupt or partial judge but of this among the omissa all this while if by pleadings are to be understood demand with particulars and grounds of demand on one side—admissions or defences with grounds of defence on the other—think not my lord that if it depended upon me written pleadings would be no more on the contrary printiny where properly managed being a cheaper mode of writing great and constant use would be made of them though unfortunately for their reception upon such terms as would be of little use to pleaders but my lord without a body of substantive law to stand upon a system of pleading is a superstructure without a foundation without this basis an edifice fit for any better purpose than that of a labyrinth for harpies to burrow and fatten in upon the blood of suitors is an impossible work—on this basis foundation and superstructure together comparatively an easy one—but of this in the facienda yes my lord speak the word and a body of law with a system of pleading raised upon it you shall have comyns title pleader shall be taken into the laboratory it shall be thrown into the roasting furnace the arsenic  0 per cent will fly off in fume—it shall be consigned to the cupel the lead  0 per cent will exude out and repose for everlasting in the powder of dead mens bones the golden button  0 per cent shall be gathered up my lord and made the most of    on the present occasion with the benefit of second thoughts i spare your lordships indulgence no light load which under a first impulse i had destined for it about issues general and special summonses in the scotch style with libels in the belly of them and scotch petitions and english declarations and pleas and english assumpsit trover and ejectment and scotch ranking and sale and the existence in scotland of the equivalent of english declarations and the nonexistence of the equivalent of english pleas—and the original old english castle of chicane and the new wing added to it in lord mansfields time for in business addition is as welcome as subtraction is invidious to wit under the name of particulars and so forth how fortunate is it for one of us at least that the discovered nihility of this part of the learned improvers basis saves me from the task of seeking to load it with any such superstructure jeremy bentham lord grenville letter iv proposed trial by jury written pleadings my lord with the benefit of the mendacitylicence—the assumed necessary foundation of jurytrial—being thus provided for we come to the superstructure resolved—  that if the defendant shall in whole or in part deny the facts stated by the pursuer or shall in his defence make any averments in point of fact which shall subsequently be denied by the pursuer the court or lord ordinary respectively on the requisition of either party or the court at their own discretion shall order that the issue of fact shall be tried by a jury except in such cases as it shall be found proper to except from this rule   that when it appears to the chamber or to the lord ordinary reasonable that such issue so directed shall be tried in that part of the country where the evidence can be most easily obtained it shall be competent to remit the cause to the nearest circuit to be there tried by a jury   that whenever in the inferior courts proofs shall have been allowed it shall be in the option of either party to apply to the court of session in order that the issue may be tried by a jury if the court shall so think fit but if neither party apply for the trial by jury the cause may be decided by the inferior courts according to the forms now in use and afterwards in review by the court of session by jury or otherwise as the court shall think fit   that it shall be competent to parties to complain against verdicts of juries that the same were given contrary to evidence or by misdirection of the judge sitting as ordinary or on the circuit or presiding in the chambers before i proceed upon the learned reformers plan about jury trial permit me my lord to submit in the first place and—scotland not england being the proposed scene of action—without reserve the use which on my plan would be made of that security in civil suits in the second instance or degree—call it new trial as being after a former one though before another judicature—call it appeal as being from the decision pronounced by my single judge on the trial carried on by and before himself alone—i would have all causes so far at least as concerns the question of fact capable of being brought before this species of tribunal the first trial being of course supposed to have been carried on in the natural mode as in the english courts of conscience the scotch smalldebt courts the courts in both countries composed of justices of the peace acting on civil occasions as in some instances they do out of general sessions—and so forth in the first instance i would not have any civil cause ever brought before a jury either of course or as proposed in the resolutions at the instance of a party or by order of the court and now i will submit to your lordship as shortly as i can why i would have jurytrial in all causes in the second instance and at the same time why i would not have it in any civil cases in the first instance it being all along understood and carefully remembered that the decision in the first instance has been come to in the natural mode   trial by a judge a single judge is the original domestic natural most simple mode as such it ought not to be departed from without some special reason   trial with the addition of a jury has for its inseparable accompaniment more or less of additional inconvenience in the shape of delay vexation and expense   jury trial therefore cannot be subservient or reconcilable to the ends of justice any further than as it affords an additional security against misdecision including what is equivalent to misdecision failure of justice   that it is capable of being made to afford a highly valuable security against misdecision  0 i admit or rather i aver and am ready upon occasion to maintain but as this is admitted on all hands to argue it here would be superfluous   that it affords a general persuasion of security against misdecision is also admitted on all hands and therefore need not here be argued and this advantage though intimately connected with the other is perfectly distinct from it and abundantly more valuable   its affording any additional security depends upon its being thought to do so by one or other of the parties they being as to this point in each individual instance the only persons competent to judge if in the decision pronounced by a single judge there be not in the opinion of either party any misdecision i e if neither of them be dissatisfied with it no other person can have any reasonable ground for supposing any and if no misdecision no additional security against misdecision can be of any value but neither a suitor nor any one else can have any rational ground to be dissatisfied with any decision—with a decision formed by a single judge—till he knows what it is   upon the same causes will the general persuasion or opinion of security against misdecision as obtainable from jurytrial depend   therefore in respect of security against misdecision jurytrial in the second instance and not before is not less good than jurytrial in the first instance and now i will submit to your lordship why in respect of security against misdecision jurytrial in the second instance and not before is better than jurytrial in the first instance i in whatever cases if any it is neither necessary nor possible that jurytrial should contribute anything in the way of security against misdecision in all such cases jurytrial in the first instance is purely bad consequently in all those cases jurytrial in the second instance in so far as it imports exclusion of jurytrial in the first instance is preferable but cases of this description exist and in the whole to a very considerable extent probably much beyond all the others put together in this predicament stand undisputed causes in the report of the committee of the house of commons order for printing dated  d of april      on imprisonment for debt p    the number of bailable writs annually issued in middlesex alone is stated at   00 so many writs issued so many actions commenced but the writs included in this enumeration are such only in virtue of which the defendant is or may be arrested and held to bail the total number of writs issued including those in virtue of which the defendant can not as well as those in virtue of which he can be arrested—in a word the total annual number of civil actions of all sorts commenced—must therefore have been much more considerable but in that same report p  0 the whole number of civil causes of all sorts annually tried in middlesex in the kings bench and common pleas together is stated at   0 which adding those tried in the exchequer would unquestionably not have amounted to so many as  000 taking this for the proportion here then are for every disputed cause about  0 undisputed in the same page the number of actions annually terminated by writ of inquiry before the undersheriff of london is stated at about     but in this number the london as well as the middlesex causes are included those commenced by bailable writs as well as those commenced by writs not bailable and the undisputed as well as the disputed ones these must therefore be thrown out of the account ii in whatever cases if in any jurytrial in the second instance and not before being not only physically but prudentially practicable jurytrial in the first instance is physically impracticable in all such cases jurytrial in the second instance and not before is better than jurytrial in the first instance meaning by prudentially practicable practicable without additional and preponderant inconvenience whether in the shape of increased probability of misdecision or of increased delay vexation and expense but there are several of these sorts of cases and in the whole to no inconsiderable extent iii so where being in the second instance prudentially practicable as before in the first instance though not physically it is prudentially impracticable but there are also several of these cases and here too in the whole to no inconsiderable extent iv so where being in both instances prudentially practicable it is in the second instance and not before practicable to more advantage than in the first instance whether in the way of saving of delay vexation and expense or in the way of security against misdecision or in both ways for the purpose of conception cases where jurytrial in the first instance is physically impracticable and those in which it is only prudentially impracticable may as above be considered separately—but for the purpose of exemplification they can no otherwise be considered than together why because to exhibit the forms of jurytrial will in every case be physically practicable whatsoever becomes of justice in a civil case not to speak of criminal cases whatever cause is decided by a jury such cause if tried under that condition which is regarded and justly as essential to jurytrial—that    is to whatever superior security real or apparent against misdecision it may be capable of affording—must be tried in the compass of a single sitting or what comes to the same thing if any adjournment take place that adjournment must be performed in such a manner that the jurors shall not any of them have any communication with the world at large in a word they must be in a state of seclusion as in a roman conclave in civili no instance of a jury sleeping before verdict ever reached my knowledge in criminali in the case of elizabeth canning who in      was convicted of perjury the trial lasted ten days during all which time if in this respect the trial was properly conducted the jury must have been kept in a state of seclusion though in the account of the trial state trials vol x i see nothing mentioned on that head the operations for which in every instance time either is or eventually may be necessary are—  delivery of the evidence—whether testimonial written real—whatsoever the cause affords   observations preliminary and subsequential by or in behalf of the parties on both sides   charge of the judge including recapitulation of the evidence where necessary and observations   discussions among the jurymen when withdrawn to their private chamber for that purpose but the cases the individual cases in which the complete performance of those several operations is physically impossible are very materially numerous—bear a very considerable proportion to the whole number of causes destined in appearance at least to this mode of decision as being commenced in a mode which admits not of any other of these four operations just mentioned three are comparatively immaterial viz observations by or on behalf of the parties charge by the judge and discussions among the jurymen and the two last either or both are not unfrequently omitted in practice but the delivery of the evidence—of whatsoever information being presented in that character by either party is neither irrelevant nor superfluous is essential to the affording the requisite security against misdecision—is essential to justice numerous are the causes which receive their decision from arbitrators—in some instances without litigation in the regular mode in other instances after litigation in the regular mode the cause coming on in its turn to be tried by a jury is in this case instead of being so tried referred somehow or other to arbitration if not otherwise disposed of when in this way instead of being tried by a jury a cause is tried by arbitrators the mass of evidence is not unfrequently of such a bulk as to be incapable of being delivered in less time than several days perhaps even weeks as often as this state of things has taken place the employment of jurytrial in the first instance has thereby been proved to be prudentially impracticable physically impracticable however if no regard be paid to the ends of justice it can not in any such case it can not in any case be said to be if the mass of relevant and not superfluous evidence being of such a magnitude that the delivery of it cannot be performed in less than ten days no more than ten or twelve hours be allowed for the reception of it but at the same time the forms of jurytrial are observed and a decision—a verdict—extracted from the jury in this case jurytrial is not physically impracticable for it is practised in this case the best thing that can happen to a cause is—that jurytrial shall in that instance have been deemed and allowed to be impracticable for then the attempt to try it in that mode is given up and it is sent off to a reference or otherwise disposed of if this be not its fate a cause thus incapable of receiving a trial by jury in the first instance in a manner consistent with the ends of justice receives it notwithstanding as often as this happens the party who is in the right is divested of that superior chance of success which if the cause were tried properly he would possess his chance of       or whatever it be to i is reduced to a chance of   to  —is an affair of cross and pile remain to be spoken of the cases in which though when absolutely considered jurytrial in the first instance cannot be said to be either in the physical or prudential sense impracticable it is yet ineligible ineligible to wit in comparison of jurytrial in the second instance and not before—and that for special reasons over and above the alreadymentioned general ones causes thus circumstanced there will presently be found reason for distributing into two classes both of them however agreeing in this—viz that if according to the standing supposition commenced in the natural mode by conjunct appearance of the parties they would be incapable of receiving consistently with the ends of justice their termination on the same day on which they thus receive their commencement whether or no the cause can or can not receive its termination at a period thus pure from delay vexation and expense cannot be known till something in relation to it is known viz from the only authentic source—till the parties being thus met together have been heard and as a considerable proportion of the whole number of causes may and do receive their termination at this early period the measure    taken for the attainment of the ends of justice would be imperfect jurytrial being employed in the first instance if at the very commencement of the cause a jury were not in waiting to receive it but as before observed when once they have begun their business a jury to remain a jury cannot part till they have gone through with it as often therefore as it turns out that from the jury before whom the cause has thus been commenced it cannot receive its termination this jury must be discharged from it and if decided in the way of jurytrial it must receive its commencement and termination together before some other jury at some other time here then besides so much of the labour of twelve men in the character of jurors thrown away there is so much time and labour thrown away on the part of all other persons who bear any part in the cause—judge subjudicial officers parties and if they have any their professional assistants with the money expended in affording a retribution to those assistants moreover of a cause thus circumstanced another jury could not take cognisance without further manufacture of useless delay vexation and expense whatever evidence had been submitted to the first jury would have to be submitted over again to the second meantime for want of taking it at the earliest period some of the evidence which but for this second jurytrial might have been had may have been lost and thereby deception and misdecision generated moreover of the first crop of evidence more or less of the freshness and instructiveness may have been lost time having intervened for premeditation opportunity of receiving undue instruction information from experience what falsehoods stand most exposed to detection or contradiction what others may be hazarded with less risk then too comes perhaps an inconsistency real or supposed between the first edition of the evidence and the second and discussions carried on and time consumed in the endeavour successful or unsuccessful to clear it up these it is true though not altogether without their concomitant advantages are inconveniences inseparable from the sort of appeal called a new trial if conducted with that full liberty of confrontation and discussion which is necessary to the taking the best chance for the discovery of truth but their being in that case unavoidable is no reason for incurring them where they may be avoided many likewise are the instances in which it would be impossible to fix a particular day for another jury unless it were at a venture taking the greatest length of time that in any event can be necessary here then is an indefinite quantity of delay produced that under a permanent judge might be avoided for under a permanent judge each article of evidence naturally will be as it ought to be received on the earliest day on which without preponderant inconvenience it can be had i come now to speak of the two classes of cases above alluded to both comprisable under the above description but in a highly material point of view standing upon very different grounds one case and the more common of the two is when the mass of the evidence which the cause furnishes having been delivered in part viz so much at least if any as had fallen within the cognizance of the parties or either of them the remainder though known to the parties by whom it is respectively to be produced is not forthcoming at the time my demand says the plaintiff will be proved by oculatus but he lives at a distance and it requires the power of the court to secure his attendance or it will be proved by such or such a written document but that is in the hands of custos and custos would neither bring it nor trust it out of his hands—say then case   evidence all known but not all forthcoming—or rather to contrast the better with the other case—evidence though not all forthcoming all known say now case   evidence the existence of it more or less of it unknown requiring to be brought to light viz by investigatorial procedure investigation or investigatorial procedure—a new and necessary name for a practice in common use but not as yet sufficiently distinguished investigatorial power—power for tracing out evidence in the way of investigatorial procedure—for the discovery of evidence ultimately employable evidence fit to be received into the budget of evidence as parcel of the mass on which the decision may with propriety be grounded by means of other evidence whether itself ultimately employable or not from his connexion with one or other of the parties or from any other relative situation real or supposed a is supposed to be capable of furnishing relevant evidence when convened a of his own knowledge knows not anything about the matter but through him the judge hears of b who does so in regard to written or real evidence a has not the document sought but he indicates b who is supposed to have it b being convened if he has it produces it if not he indicates c who if he has it produces it if not he indicates d—and so on through the alphabet in what precise shape the assistance rendered to justice by this power shall show itself—against which of two evils opposite to the ends of justice it shall afford a remedy—failure    of justice or misdecision—depends in each case upon circumstances suspecting nay assured of the existence of the requisite mass of evidence but for want of this necessary instrument feeling his inability to bring it to light in many instances the plaintiff despairing of success forbears to present his demand to a system of judicature of whose inability to give effect to it he is thus preapprised in these cases failure of justice takes place but nothing worse in other cases assured of having right on his side but not sufficiently attentive to the obtaining a timely assurance of the means of giving effect to it he commences his suit and afterwards with an article of necessary evidence in his view understands when too late his inability to produce it in this case the mischief takes the shape of misdecision misdecision to the prejudice of the plaintiffs side for the want of necessary evidence existing but not producible and here to the suffering attached to the failure of justice is added the vexation of disappointment and the expense of the costs on both sides thus stands the matter where the mischief that takes place for want of this power falls on the plaintiffs side but the defendants side though not quite so much exposed to it as the plaintiffs is far from being exempt from it when it falls on this side it is in the more afflictive shape that it falls—misdecision aggravated by burthen of costs be the case criminal or civil your lordship sees how necessary an instrument this power is to the hand of justice how lame how paralytic that sacred hand cannot but be if deprived of it a few pages further and your lordship shall see—if not justice judicature—technical judicature—standing with her shrivelled hand lame of that palsy the right hand—the hand by which justice should be distributed may be seen from a variety of other causes subject to those fits while the left hand—the hand which by a preestablished mechanism gathers in and closes upon the fees as the dionæa upon flies is ever alert and vigorous when at the outset of the cause any part of the mass of evidence which it affords is unknown the tracing it out thus from hand to hand may considering that the hands may be at any distance from each other occupy any length of time the evidence of witness a being obtainable on one day of witness b not till another day week month or even year and so on without any certain limit half a dozen witnesses not examinable but at so many different days on each day it being uncertain whether the next day may not complete the mass of evidence that on each day a jury should be in waiting for the purpose of taking the chance of being able to give termination to the cause on that day is an arrangement the impracticability of which will scarcely be thought to stand in need of proof to warrant the judge in causing the mass of evidence to be laid before a jury whether summoned for that special purpose or already in waiting for general purposes there must be a sufficient assurance on his part that all the evidence which in his judgment the cause is capable of furnishing or such part of it as is necessary and sufficient to ground a decision on either side is already forthcoming or will be so time enough for their taking cognizance of it on this occasion let it not be forgotten that till an article of evidence has actually been received there can never be any perfect assurance of its being forthcoming to whatever class the evidence belongs testimonial written or real accident or design—misconception or right conception—may when the time comes have kept it at a distance—and to all these contingencies the jurys capacity of fulfilling the purpose for which they are brought together remains for ever subject but in the case of the permanent judge if the whole mass of the evidence has thus been really got in—got in by himself—he perfectly acquainted with it—having received it in its original and freshest shape—the grounds of the decision which the case calls for being thus completely known to him—the case in effect already tried by him—to what use try it over again if of all the persons concerned there is not one who desires to have it so to parties to witnesses to juries to judge to everybody double trouble useless and factitious delay vexation and expense and feefed lawyers always excepted to whom everybodys suffering brings advantage not a particle of advantage in any shape to anybody in every case no sooner is the cause become ripe for decision than my single judge my sheriffdepute unincumbered with a jury circumduces the proof as a scotch lawyer might say closes the budget as i would say and pronounces—not an interlocutor—but final judgment now from this decision pronounced without an atom of time or money wasted what possible prejudice can result to justice the party to whose disadvantage it operates is he satisfied with the decision nothing better could be wished for had the cause been dragged through a thousand juryboxes is he dissatisfied he has a jury he has it in that case and in that case alone in which he desires to have it—in which it will be—not an aggravation but a remedy supposing jurytrial or the forms of it forced upon the parties in every case in the first instance the bad effects of this force    are not confined to the loading the cause with this cumbrous additament where it is worse than useless your lordship has seen it depriving the cause of the benefit of this security against misdecision in cases in which it would be of real use—how frequently these cases come to be exemplified in practice is a point which i shall have occasion to speak to presently at present what i have to submit to your lordship is—that when grafted on natural procedure as above the utility and efficacy of the proposed postponement is not more signal in narrowing the application of this mode of judicature where it is useless and prejudicial than in extending the application of it wherever it is of real use for though there are cases and to a very considerable extent in which in the first instance the use of it is impracticable and even generally recognised as being so there is no case in which it is not practicable in every sense when postponed as above to the second instance for this purpose it rests with the judge in the first instance the same judge eventually in case of appeal for that purpose the superior judge to decompose the mass of evidence if as will generally be the case the whole of it that is so much as one or other of the parties insists on having repeated be not too much to be laid before one and the same jury so much the better but if in the whole there happens to be more than a jury can receive on such terms as to do justice to it—receive in the compass of one sitting—the cause being in such sort and degree complex as to contain at the same time as when of such bulk it can scarce fail to do divers integrant parts independent of each other it may in such case be distinguished and resolved into its integrant parts and different integrant parts or assemblages of integrant parts given to so many different juries by integrant part i understand so much of the mass as is delivered by witnesses whose testimonies respectively have a connexion with each other the testimony of each witness operating either in confirmation or information of that of the rest the mode and degree of complexity just described will frequently be exemplified where the case includes a number of facts whether individual or habitual having in respect of probability or improbability no connexion with each other   debt founded on goods sold and delivered at different times   demand on one part setoff on the other   promise made at one time broken at another—thus in adultery—  marriage celebrated at one time   alleged adultery of course at another   wifes loose intercourse with other men habit provable by one set of witnesses   husbands loose intercourse with other women habit provable by another set of witnesses   husbands cruelty towards the wife habit provable again perhaps by another set but of the time occupied by each such integrant portion of the mass of evidence measure complete measure has been already taken—taken by everybody concerned—by judge and parties it is therefore a point preascertained and to as great a degree of accuracy as is material what length of time the delivery of the whole and each part of the mass will occupy when repeated before a jury separating it into masses of competent length as many as the extent of it requires he distributes it to so many juries giving to each jury one or any greater number of issues one to try the entrance into the marriagecontract for example if it be matter of dispute as in scotland where the contract may be made as it were by habit another to try the fact of the adultery and so on but after the evidence has been once gone through—gone through in all its integrant parts—it will seldom indeed happen that the disagreement in opinion—i mean that between the losing party and the judge—will extend over all the parts so many as the disagreement does not extend to so many the evidence to which need not be repeated by the party by whom the decision is complained of of the number of facts and corresponding integrant parts of the evidence on which it was grounded a greater or less part will commonly if not before at least after the delivery of the evidence be admitted thus in adultery suppose the fact of the marriage once put out of doubt by the uncontradicted and unquestioned testimony of the clergyman or other person by whom it was celebrated or by evidence of cohabitation under the same name and the same roof for years—to what use after witnesses once heard and the matter put out of doubt drag them from their homes to put it out of doubt a second time if then in such a case for the purpose of vexation a party should insist upon such repetition of proof in the second instance of a fact put out of doubt in the first instance let him do so but at his peril the judge à quo marking it as vexatious it will rest with the judge ad quem with or without the concurrence of the jury to mark it out for punishment to punishment in the shape and to the extent of costs at any rate instead of being distributed among divers juries to be decided upon all at the same time the integrant and distinct parts of the mass of fact may be given to different juries or even to the same jury to be decided upon at different times—to the same jury not so well on account of the danger or suspicion of embracery and so forth    in one case the trying these different parts of the cause at different times will he attended with particular advantage this is where pronounced in one of the two opposite ways a decision given on one of the several component parts of the cause thus decomposed renders the trial of the rest some or all of them superfluous thus no contract no breach no marriage no adultery such are the advantages which jurytrial in the second instance possesses over jurytrial in the first instance even when grafted on the best possible mode upon the best and soundest stock—i mean natural procedure i will now beg your lordships notice for the advantages of jurytrial in the second instance as compared with jurytrial in the first instance grafted as under the husbandry of learned gentlemen upon the corrupt and cankered stock of technical procedure—stock and graft together the tree of good and evil not to say of evil without good—factitious delay vexation and expense the fruit of it the conception entertained by scotchmen of commonlaw procedure in civil cases with jurytrial in the english mode will be very incomplete if to excess of delay they do not add excess of precipitation for in the composition of it vices of this opposite nature meet and embrace in the most perfect harmony with the help of vacations that is preestablished denial of justice for weeks and months together and fixed days and mechanical judicature of which in my first letter instead of a small part of one day or a small part of each of two days for where the ends of justice are the objects—i speak of the courts of conscience—a great majority of the whole number of causes actually take no more six months or twelve months or a great many more months—in a cause as simple as any that ever came before a court of conscience—consumed in doing nothing or worse than nothing—delay the staple commodity of judge and co manufactured in this wholesale way for the accommodation of their best customers the malâ fide suitors then come circuits one or two in a year according to the latitude from part of one day to the whole of three or four days allowed to a place whatever be the number of causes to be tried at it and whatever the quantity of time required by each—a short and limited length of time and that frequently short in the extreme for an unlimited quantity of business alas where my lord is the wonder—that for which sufficient time cannot in any case be wanting is—receipt of fees that for which it matters not how short the time is the service to be performed in consideration of those fees has delay its profits precipitation is not less productive but your lordship will see— of the whole number of causes set down for trial in a year one part who can ever say how large a part tried badly another part as yet unknown but not incapable of being known it rests with your lordship to know it and in the mean time known not to be a small one not tried at all when this is the result there are three modifications among which it takes its chance all of them repugnant to justice i one is the going off in the character of a remanet or remanent i e to be tried at the next sittings or assizes consequence of the postponement as follows—   delay cause suppose pecuniary—plaintiff in the right as in general he is—loss of interest on the principal representing the value of the property adjudged by the verdict amount of interest if at the sittings say three months if at the assizes elsewhere than in one of the four northern counties six months if in any of those counties twelve months for this is among the punishments a man is loaded with for the offence of living in the country and the doubly heinous offence of living in the northern parts of it   expense expense of trial somewhat less than doubled on the second—trial it cannot be called the cause not having been tried when it should have been tried but— setting down of the cause upon the list of causes that ought to be tried—some abatement perhaps in the professional fees in the official scarcely   danger of misdecision or equivalent failure of justice in consequence of the delay deperition of necessary evidence deperition of the matter of wealth in the hands of the adverse party in the character of eventual matter of satisfaction—deperition viz with reference to the party in the right—by dissipation by concealment or by exportation ii another mode of termination is by what is called a compromise which being interpreted is denial of justice by the terrors of remanentcy as above explained the plaintiff consents to accept a part of what is his due giving up the rest by consent the traveller gives up to the unlicenced plunderer what money he has about him in order to save his life by consent the plaintiff gives up to the malâ fide defendant armed with delay put into his hands by his learned partners value to any amount viz to whatever can be agreed upon with extortion on the one part and distress on the other to settle the account iii the third and last remaining mode of termination is by reference reference is either to one referee agreed upon on both sides or to two or more referees called arbitrators named one or more seldom more than one on each side referees may be either lawyers or nonlawyers    lawyers very frequently—whether most frequently or not is more than i can take upon me to pronounce it is among the thousand things in and about law worth knowing and not knowable in this case this is what a man gains by having recourse to technical procedure to that which by courtesy passes among lawyers by the name of justice—the advantage of finding himself at the end of the suit in the same situation as he was at the commencement of it always excepting what concerns the delay vexation and expense—licence to obtain justice if he can at the hands of nonlawyers or lawyers—after paying for it and not getting it at the hands of lawyers does your lordship feel any such curiosity as that of knowing the number absolute and relative of these causes in which justice is paid for and not done in your lordship will is volition clothed and armed with power—in me it is bare inert velleity—meantime accept at my hands what chance presents to them— times newspaper   th december   0 —yesterday morning in the court of kings bench guildhall eight causes for special juries appeared on the list for trial they were all referred in one only a verdict was taken pro formâ for the plaintiff the whole number without exception—in all of them justice paid for—in all of them justice denied this where time for trying them for pretending to try some one of them at least could not be wanting sent off untried for what reason to all appearance because in the instance of each such cause there was something in its complexity and thence in its length or intricacy that rendered it incapable of being so tried even by select men men of cultivated minds to any good purpose the causes london causes and those special jury causes therefore mercantile causes of the higher order—causes naturally attended with a large measure of complication here no want of time the causes therefore capable of being tried one or more of them that same day howsoever badly how then must it be at the assizes—where to any degree of complication and thence of prudential impracticability is so frequently added absolute physical impracticability through denial of necessary time in another case—the date of which i must beg to stand excused from mentioning—while the pleadings are opening counsel for defendant proposes a reference which the plaintiff being present at length assents to a referee really above all exception and pro hâc vice a nonlawyer is agreed upon the noble and learned judge having perused the pleading certifies them to be very intricate highly approves of the reference and declares that it does credit to the counsel on both sides the virtue of candour—your lordship sees for if this be not the proper name of the virtue thus displayed i must confess my inability to find for it any other—the virtue of candour for this is the virtue i have heard named a hundred times on similar occasions—in short whatever the virtue displayed on this occasion was—was displayed by learned gentlemen and lest virtue should fail of its reward the praise of this virtue whatever it was was with accustomed liberality virtue for virtue bestowed upon them by the noble and learned lord my lord though of my own knowledge i know nothing respecting the correctness of this account i should find no sort of difficulty in crediting it in the state of things in question it is natural that learned gentlemen should display such virtue it is natural that learned lords should bestow such praise on it not unfrequently has it happened to myself to hear like virtue rewarded with like praise without any loss of fees the whole body of learning lord and gentlemen together gains so much ease the whole body of learning goes so much the sooner to its dinner ever and anon learned gentlemen one or more of them acquire the faculty of displaying other virtues in the character of referees the virtue of justice in the award when made the virtue of patience for fees de die in diem are no slight pledge of patience by the care taken not to be precipitate in making it the whole body of learned gentlemen acquire ulterior chances for ulterior displays of virtue by motions for setting aside the award when made by motions for attachment for nonperformance of it—two species of motioncauses setting out from opposite sides but meeting at the same point here then we see a species of judicature of which the distinguishing characteristic is the being altogether inapplicable in effect in a large proportion of the instances in which it is applied in demonstration and pretence a feature of deformity altogether without parallel in the worst mode of judicature that can be found in the same country or any other and this is the species of judicature which in a plan of reform it is proposed to introduce and without any change into a country as yet unvexed by it day by day this mode of judicature is seen to stand in pointblank repugnancy to the ends of justice practicable only in demonstration and grimace impracticable prudentially and even physically in effect in every such instance the real effect of the institution is to serve the partnership and particularly in the higher branches in the character of a false pretence for receiving money—receiving without earning it but the oftener the repugnancy is brought to view by experience the oftener this pillage    is repeated the more abundant are the occasions on which this meed of praise is earned on one part bestowed on the other the murmurs of suitors are drowned in a concert of praises a concert in which lawyers all amateurs are sole performers a concert performed by them for their own benefit and at the expense of justice i speak not here of the cases numerous and extensive as they are in which the jurors are mere puppets their minds no more applied than that of the emperor of morocco to the decision given in their name—special verdict found for them by learned gentlemen jurors contributing nothing but a stare—verdict taken for them on this or that one of halfadozen or a dozen counts said counts all lawyers lies but one—one of the twelve taken in vision out of the jurybox that the absence of the plaintiff who stands before them may be recorded by order of the judge—alas i was confounding—though in perfect innocence—lie with lie—withdrawing a juror to make a drawn battle and calling the plaintiff that by saying i am not here he may under the loss of that cause console himself with the prospect of losing another these with instances in plenty that might be added—more apposite more impressive if they were worth looking for—would if detailed make it necessary for me to attempt to drag your lordships conception along with my own through the filth of fiction—and sufficient to the day is the evil thereof to those whose love for the system rests on the imposture mixed with it all this appears right and proper the appearance of a jury and the people deluded by it which is all that is wanted but my jurors my lord are not puppets i wish not to trouble them often but when they do come they come for use and not for show all that mockery would vanish of course were the cognizance given to the jury reserved as proposed for the second instance on this occasion a word or two more may perhaps be not ill bestowed on the practice and power of investigation in natural procedure there being no bars to shut it out it takes place your lordship has seen how of course without any special authority for there needs none every justice of the peace exercises it whether sitting out of general sessions and thence free from technical trammels on matter submitted definitively to his cognizance or carrying on under the statute a preparatory examination in a case of felony under the like liberty every committee and every commission of inquiry pursues for the discovery of truth the same necessary course—pursues it through any number of intervening links or channels regardless nothing calling for regard of the difference between this less direct and the more direct or immediate mode of obtaining ultimatelyemployable evidence the case is—that it requires art and contrivance—science and regularity—to bereave the hand of justice of an instrument at once so natural and so necessary such ingenuity is not wanting to englishbred technicalism the effect is produced by confining the efficient part of the course of procedure within the compass of one single sitting a who knows nothing indicates b who knows everything but before b can be so much as sent for the jurybox is emptied as little is it wanting to romebred technicalism a who knows nothing indicates b who knows everything no want here of time sittings in any number judges pay—for an examiner or examining commissioner is a judge—judges pay per diem other learned persons pay per number of words words and sittings consequently not scarce—a who knows nothing indicates b who knows everything but the scene lies in the judges whisperingcloset from which all who have any interest in the discovery of the truth are carefully excluded the persons to be examined are predetermined and by the solemnity of an oath the seal of secresy is applied to the lips of the judge—a who knows nothing indicates b who knows everything but b who knows everything is unknown to the persons without whom he cannot be had such being the imbecility of the trunk i speak of romebred procedure such is it in four at least of its branches—continental law in general—english equity law—english coinciding in this point with continental spiritual law—english coinciding with continental admiralty law if everywhere the hand of justice labours under this palsy it is because everywhere she has found such regularbred practitioners to tie up the nerves an occurrence that happened not many years ago—one of a thousand that are happening every year—may help to place in broader light the two companion pictures—of real justice in her native vigour and sham justice in her straight waistcoat—a man dropped out of his pocket banknotes to the amount of about £ 00 they were found by another man who being poor and illiterate was unconscious of the value of his prize the value opening to him by degrees he fell into negotiations with jews and gentiles and disposed of it or a part of it at an under value it was a case for trover out of the multitude of instances in which the action so denominated is brought one of the very few in which it can be brought without a lie no one to make oath of felony or cause of suspicion of    felony no felony therefore no legal ground for examination by a justice of the peace but among unlearned judges in general and among those of the london police in particular strange as it may seem to learned ones there does exist a sort of principle or whim whatever be the proper name for it called the love of justice it is by this principle or this whim that they are led on such a variety of occasions to do good by stealth—your lordship will see how and as they never find it fame that being a monopoly in the hands of their learned betters whatever is done by them in that way is without any expense to any body in the article of blushes in the particular instance in question at the queensquare policeoffice mr colquhoun hearing of the loss took the business in hand and laying about him with his so well known activity in this irregular way—hitting the mark by pushing in quart where learning would have missed it by pushing in tierce—got back for the loser his £ 00 except a small part that had been spent from link to link he followed up the chain of information as if it had been by an examination carried on under the statute in a case of felony warrant none there being no legal ground for any such coercive instrument no witness convened but by a summons to which had the impotence of the technical system to this as well as so many other good purposes been known no regard would have been paid fortunately for justice poverty or simplicity or terror withheld the confederates one and all from applying to an attorney if justice be a friend to man the omission was fortunate since it is to that she owes that technical judicature or its terrors did not tie up her hands all the learning in westminster hall armed by all its power would not have got for the man a single farthing of this £ 00 the finder with the money in his pocket would have moved off or spent it or shifted it from hand to hand to the loser the best thing that could have happened would have been to be apprised in the first instance of the impossibility of recovering the money and so to have sitten down quietly with the loss another result would have been the commencing the action and for want of that power of investigation which in a civil case technical procedure does not give suffering a nonsuit or judgment as in case of a nonsuit with three or four or five score pound to pay for costs on both sides another and still worse misfortune would have been the getting a verdict and thereupon by a sort of a vehicle called a writ of error find himself set down and then hung up in a place called the exchequer chamber where he would have had a year to cool his heels while the finder was spending or securing the remainder of the £ 00—deducting inter alia for merit crowned with learning and nobility a slight retribution of which lord ellenborough can give your lordship a much more particular account than it is in my power to do at my humble distance but of this in another letter in which your lordship may take a nearer view of the difference between the love of justice and the love of fees as to scotch judicature though another twig of the old stock i should hope to find that somehow or other she has escaped this palsy or at the worst that it has its intermissions no jury therefore no necessary compression of a trial into a space of time incapable of holding it at edinburgh the lord ordinary—that is not he but a clerk or a clerks assistant lawrie p   0 takes the evidence and if he proceeds in the manner of the lord ordinary on oaths and witnesses he admits parties and their advocates to be present ib  0  and in the country before commissioners the depositions are taken ib  0  in the same manner as before the lord ordinary though learned lords know better than to allow to any such one of their deputes to whom they intrust this vital part of judicature the faculty of pronouncing any decision on the evidence that nobody but himself has heard or will hear—his door i see is not always shut against parties or at least not against parties lawyers and seeing no limit to the number of his sittings the conclusion i draw is—that when a who knows nothing indicates b who knows something it may happen to b in that event to be heard diligence scoticojargonicé means inter alia an order to a man to appear in the character of a witness for among scotch as well as english lawyers it is a rule that when a word in use among the people is employed it may be employed to mean anything but what the people mean by it diligences are the nets employed in scotland to fish for witnesses and seeing nothing to hinder but that from the beginning to the end of the career of factitious delay diligence may follow upon diligence i see nothing to hinder but that when it happens to an ignorant witness to have pointed out a knowing one the knowing one may be heard but under the management of your lordships learned reformer english is to be the model of scotch justice—juries for ever and in the true english style and thence comes my apprehension that either for want of thought or from thought twisting itself to the sinister side this palsy may be inoculated into scotch justice along with so many others from the same source thus stands the matter in respect of the provision made for the discovery of sources of evidence as yet unknown if in this deficiency    in the system the situation of the authors considered there appear not much cause for wonder there will appear still less when it is observed how by another of its vices sources of evidence already known are exposed to perish without remedy during the six or twelve months or any greater number of months of the factitious and unabridgeable delay fortune is not always idle a necessary witness whose testimony would under the natural system have been collected the first day—this necessary witness suppose dies thereupon along with him perishes the plaintiffs or the defendants right—for in all that time the system has afforded no possible means of preserving his evidence for the relief of this disorder under english law so carefully inoculated and nursed by one sort of lawyer—the common law judge—up comes another sort of lawyer—the equity judge—with his sham remedy bill in equity for examination in perpetuam rei memoriam or examination de bene esse in both these instances a previous suit in equity is necessary—with its attendant train of extra delay vexation and expense in both instances the evidence is collected in the bad mode—put into the bad shape—attached to that modification of technical procedure—with its attendant danger of misdecision in the case of the examination in perpetuam rei memoriam the suit has no other object—and admitting of no decision ends when that object has been obtained or found unattainable in the case of examination de bene esse a suit having an ulterior object being already instituted the effect of the application for an examination in this mode or rather upon these terms is only to procure the examination of this or that witness to be accelerated—performed before the defendants answer has come in though not before he has appeared i e without appearing has submitted to employ an attorney in his defence—performed at that premature period antecedently to the stage appointed by the general rule for the examination of all the witnesses in both cases there is a chance—but on this occasion it were far too much to undertake to explain what chance—that the evidence so collected under the authority of a court of equity may come to be employed in a trial at common law and laid before a jury but in neither case can it be so employed unless the witness so examined be by death or perhaps by incurable infirmity disabled from attendance moreover in both cases besides that this remedy even when admitted to be applied is thus inadequate and no less apt to afford aggravation than relief so scanty is it in its application to the field of law as to cover but a small fragment of the extent of the demand no such remedy where the person of the plaintiff or of any one else through whose person his mind is wounded—none where his reputation is the subject of the injury no such remedy where the subject of the injury being this or that individual article of specific moveable property the injury consists in destruction or deterioration the result of negligence or malice no such remedy in a word beyond the comparatively scanty range of equity jurisdiction of the imperfection of which in point of extent this sample may serve for as to the marking out its limits a mystery which remains such to the most learned eyes will not be undertaken to be revealed especially in a parenthesis by this unlearned hand but even within this narrow range it may be a question whether upon the whole justice so far as jurytrial is concerned is anything the better for it excepting for special reasons too special to be here detailed the case of a will the validity of which it is meant to secure against dispute—without some apparent danger of death as likely to ensue before the witness can be presented to a jurybox a man will not be apt even where equity and common law join in allowing it to betake himself to so expensive a security were such precaution natural the use of it would be general in all cases in which the importance of the cause presented a warrant for the expense the case of a will as above excepted the use of this security is in a manner confined to the case where imminent danger is certified by old age or particular infirmity the suitor then say the plaintiff having notice of the indisposition of the witness if so it be that he has law and reflection enough to be aware of the peril that awaits him repairs accordingly to his attorney the scene lying most probably in the country the country containing seven or eight times as many inhabitants as the metropolis while he is occupied in procuring an interview with the attorney or the attorney in corresponding on the subject with his agent in town and the one or the other in drawing instructions for the bill in equity and counsel in town or country in perusing and settling the bill or drawing the interrogatories or the agent in town in performing the operations preparatory to the taking out the commission for the examination of the witness or while the commission or the commissioners are upon their travels—the patient dies or loses his recollection or does not choose to be disturbed on the subject of a dispute which to him is a matter of indifference—not to mention that men are apt to die at short notice that a disorder which proves mortal is not always  0 at the outset known to be so and that it does not necessarily follow that because it happens to me to stand in need of a mans testimony his manner of life and the state of his health lie all along within my knowledge of this incidental equity suit thus to be squeezed into the belly of a lawsuit the certain expense is in the greater number of instances greater than the whole value in demand in the lawsuit greater not only in the majority of the suits that would be instituted under the natural system but in the majority of the suits that are instituted under the technical system notwithstanding the exclusion put by it upon so great a majority of suits and suitors of this incidental suit the costs on one or both sides are borne by the party whose misfortune it is to stand in need of testimony thus circumstanced and this not only in the first instance and while as yet it is unknown whether his demand be just or no but even after the definitive judgment given and the justice of his demand established by it if the patient recovers in such manner that his testimony is capable of being delivered at the trial so much the worse for the party who stands in need of it for in that case the testimony must be collected on this second occasion in the only mode in which it ought to have been collected on any occasion and the expense of collecting it including travelling expenses demurrage and so forth is repeated all these considerations laid together it would be matter of satisfaction rather than regret should it be found as i am confident it would that in comparison of the number of instances in which it might be employed the instances in which this insidious remedy is actually employed are extremely rare in queen annes reign on the occasion of the act which afterwards passed for the amendment of the law      ann ch    this defect in jurytrial as then and still constituted—a defect—not in the composition of the tribunal but in the course of procedure anterior to the day on which the cause is brought before that tribunal—came under the view of parliament and was attested by the recognition of both houses under the guidance of lord somers the lords proposed a palliative at once inadequate and dangerous under the guidance of mr pulteney the commons rejected and prevailed upon the lords to join in rejecting this palliative but for reasons a material part of which operates in condemnation of the still subsisting practice the proposal of the lords journals xviii    was that after issue joined in any action to be brought in the courts of westminster upon oath made that any witnesses cannot be present at the trial by reason of their being to go beyond the seas or by reason of sickness or other infirmity it shall be lawful by rule of court for the plaintiff or defendant to exhibit interrogatories to such witnesses to be examined thereunto upon oath before one of the judges of the said court or before commissioners to be appointed under the seal of the court which depositions may be made use of at the trial in case the witnesses cannot be there and said depositions shall be afterwards entered or enrolled in the said court the mischief having its root in the essence of the technical system no remedy leaving the basis of that system untouched refusal to hear parties and witnesses at the outset could operate as anything better than a feeble palliative—but this remedy fell short even of that feeble palliative a case to which it applied itself besides the somewhat less exceptionable ground of sickness or other infirmity was the case of a design on the part of the witness to go abroad a case to which it did not extend was that of death to save himself from the ordeal of crossexamination a man engaged by corruption ab extra or ab intra to give false testimony may feign and what more easy than to feign and in a manner not to be detected sickness or other infirmity—or what is much more simple if it be worth his while he may pretend obligation to go abroad take a trip from dover to calais and so go abroad on purpose but to no such purpose will a man either die or feign himself dead examination taken in either of the modes thus proposed by lord somers might therefore if under condition of not being used but in case of death have comparatively speaking been legalized with little danger and in this case the earlier taken the more effectual the remedy but the stage of the cause proposed for taking the examination was—not till after issue joined that is not till after two three or any greater number of months after the commencement of the cause of the body of objections which operated to the conviction of their lordships comm journals xv     an indisputable part was composed of such as have no force but upon the supposition of the radical impropriety of equity practice of an essential part of the practice of the court of which the noble and learned lord their spokesman the great lord somers was sole judge the impropriety i mean of employing one judge to hear and see witnesses—another and without the first to apply their testimony or supposed testimony to its use—an impropriety most explicitly confessed by the lord chiefbaron gilbert in the book called bacons abridgment title evidence vol ii p     and which i have not the least particle of doubt would with equal frankness be confessed or rather proclaimed by lord somerss noble and learned    successor should it occur to your lordship to put the question to him across the convivial table meantime supposing the admission thus proposed to be given to the testimony in this makeshift shape had been confined to the case on which in the most perfect shape testimony from the source in question is not to be had—on this supposition the proposed amendment it is evident would have been a real improvement i mean in so far as it consisted in allowing the application to be made in the commonlaw court in which the suit was already lodged the use of it might in that case and of course would have been coextensive in civil matters at least with the jurisdiction of the court in which the evidence was to be employed and except the radical inconvenience of committing the decision to a judge by whom the witness at the time of his examination was neither seen nor heard—an inconvenience which however cannot always be avoided—the mode of collection would have had or might have had in every other particular the advantages which jurytrial possesses in common with the natural mode—viz crossexamination by or on behalf of the adverse party with the benefit of questions arising out of the answers and so forth but in this proposed amelioration of the technical system whatsoever good there was or could have been what is it but an approximation and that a remote one made towards the natural mode on all such occasions what care what tender care on all sides to avoid seeing the object—the unexceptionable the perfect system—all the while standing close under their eyes in respect of the occasion and the purpose correspondent to the english practice of examinations in perpetuam rei memoriam and de bene esse is the scotch practice of examination of witnesses to lie in retentis but whereas the jurisdiction of english equity extends over but a part probably the smaller part of the field of what in one of the four or five senses of the word civil is called civil law the applicability of the scotch practice of taking depositions in retentis is coextensive i take it for granted with the jurisdiction of the court of session an authority which in one way or other covers the field of civil law in its whole expanse—not to mention a considerable portion of the field of criminal law scotland not being afflicted by any such distinction as that between law and equity—to the application of this remedy such as it is no additional suit in another court is in scotland necessary but even there whether upon the whole justice finds most matter of satisfaction or of regret in the facility of resorting to it is matter of account the statement of which is beyond my competence in some other place i propose to myself to submit to your lordship some sort of apperçu of the price paid—paid by the people—paid in the several shapes of delay expense and denial of justice not to speak of misdecision—for the benefit of jurytrial at its present stage grafted as at present on the technical system—and for the services rendered by learned lords and gentlemen—to somebody doubtless but to whom i cannot find except to learned lords and gentlemen—by the upholding of that together with the other branches—as likewise what are not as well as what are the considerations by which this popular branch of the technical mode of procedure has never ceased to command their eulogy any more than the natural mode their silence but fearing to diverge too far from the more immediate subject of this letter i dismiss these topics for the present having thus submitted to your lordship the only plan upon which in my view of the matter jurytrial in civil cases can in scotland be rendered in any considerable degree subservient upon the whole to the ends of justice i proceed to consider so much of the proposed plan on this subject as appears on the face of the resolutions from the very little that is there stated what i see distinctly enough is in what way this supposed remedy against factitious delay vexation and expense if that be among the objects of it presents a probability of giving increase to that aggregate mass of inconvenience what i am unable to discover is—by what means it presents a probability of making any defalcation from that mass no particulars being given concerning the mode in which the several questions of fact are designed to be brought before the jury to speak of this and that and tother mode in the character of possible ones and then to say—this will not diminish delay c nor this nor that—is a sort of exercise that would be little better than fighting shadows what i see beyond doubt is—that to lay the points in question before a jury abundance of new formalities must be introduced what i do not see any probability of is—that upon the introduction of this new mass of formality any such portion of the existing mass as shall be equal to it will be cleared away in england a cause in which a jury is employed is sooner terminated it has been said than without a jury a cause of the same nature would be in scotland be it so—but it does not follow that by the application of jurytrial even in the best mode in which under the existing system of technical procedure it could be applied in scotland to that same cause the cause would receive its termination there sooner than it    does now in the midst of so much factitious delay what little abbreviation there is in the english mode depends upon the system of pleading taken in a mass and i have no more apprehension of seeing the scotch nation submit to defile itself with any such abomination than i have of seeing the port of leith opened for the importation of a pack of mad dogs or for a cargo of cotton impregnated secundum artem with the plague in english pleading what little abbreviation—defalcation i mean from factitious delay—what little abbreviation of that sort there is—and that purchased at the expense of intelligibility and cognoscibility speaking with reference to the body of the people—consists in the use of those general propositions or forms of averment on the part of the defendant called general issues—not guilty—nonassumpsit and four or five more some of which include others so logically have they been framed but these propositions have not any of them any meaning but in the way of reference and their meaning varies ad infinitum according to the object to which they are referred—it varies according to the genus of the action as characterized by the declaration the instrument of demand exhibited on the part of the plaintiff and the counts the specific demands and allegations contained in it not guilty for example the most changeable of all these proteuses involves two clusters of propositions which are altogether different according as the action it applies to is an action of trover or ejectment in one of the instances it entitles the defendant to prove by way of defence one or more of one list of facts in the other one or more of another list of facts and so on lists tolerably well settled viz among lawyers for ordinary purposes by arbitrary and absurd and inconsistent decision but altogether undiscoverable by the light of common sense and thence incapable of being understood even by the enlightened part of the body of the people the two general issues here mentioned corresponding to three formularies or genera of actions nonassumpsit corresponding to the action of assumpsit are mentioned because under one or other of these actions but in by far the largest proportion under assumpsit nine tenths at least of the whole number of causes commenced in the regular way in the commonlaw courts would be found to be comprised but it is to the use of these abbreviations one advantage of which professionally speaking is that they are so frequently found to stand in need of redilatations under the name of papers of particulars with fees for the same that everything that savours of dispatch is confined in english practice and this jargon unless as in british india planted by the bayonet being incapable of taking root in any other than english ground along with it vanishes all the advantage looked for or pretended to be looked for on that score but this prop in the character of a technical support for the jurybox being thus found eaten up by the dry rot there remains no other regular commonlaw support than that the rottenness of which is conveyed to every ear by the name of special pleading a mass of corruption on which a stigma is regularly imprinted—i will not undertake to say exactly how many times—some dozen of times at least—every year by the hand of the legislature—as often i mean as allowance is given to plead the general issue and give the act in evidence remain it may be thought for supports to the jurybox the papers of particulars above alluded to or whatever else under the name of relevant facts alleged in the summons or other writ c or admissions or denials thereof may be proposed to be substituted to them on scottish ground but these so far at least as they extend on english ground—the only ground on which they have ever been placed—are but fragments of a new system of special pleading already dryrotted serving no other purpose so assuredly and so completely as that of a certificate bearing witness to the rottenness of the old call them these conflicting masses of allegation—call them by any name—english or scottish—counts and special pleas—or counts on one side with papers of particulars on either or both sides summons with the libel in it on one side whole defences distinct or indistinct on the other—the same religious care is observable on both sides of the tweed to prevent their cutting the thread of the suit too soon—to prevent their answering any other purposes to the prejudice of the ends of judicature—the same effectual care to shut out that simultaneous reciprocal complete and correct explanation which nothing but the presence of both parties facing each other under the eye of the judge can give—to prevent the stemming of that torrent of learned and indefatigable mendacity which spreads such fertility over the ancient demesnes attached to inns of court and colleges of justice another support indeed capable of being provided is a suit in equity as where in the language of english equity an issue is said to be directed upon the hearing of the cause on the ground of the mass of evidence already delivered in another shape the comparative untrustworthiness of which is thus recognised an allegation or set of allegations are fixed on and by the help of a lie dictated by the judge the truth of it is sent to be inquired after on the ground of testimony delivered in that more trustworthy shape in    which alone except now and then in a case of necessity it is ever suffered to be presented to the jurybox to the adoption of this basis no objection on the score of probable repugnance seems opposable unfortunately by the same causes and in the same proportion as the practicability of it is increased the utility is diminished the cause is first to be tried in some one or other of those bad modes to which in consideration of their acknowledged badness jurytrial is proposed to be substituted under the name and notion of a substitute jurytrial would on this plan be erected as a superstructure on an edifice the immoderate bulk of which is the very subject of complaint at the end of a course of special pleading in the original mode the points in question are somehow or other brought to an issue without the application of any such instrument as human reason on the part of the judge in the newinvented mode by papers of particulars the use of that instrument in that learned hand is or at any rate might i should suppose be alike spared but in the case where an issue is directed nothing that is to be done being predetermined by any preestablished forms whatsoever might by possibility be done in practice nothing ever is done without a previous settlement of the tenor the very words of the issue under the eye of a judge this function—being like so many other of the most essential functions of judicature beneath the dignity of so great a personage as the judge so called—is turned over that is turned down to a subordinate sort of judge called a master—more delay more business and more fees this practice of directing issues were it imported into the port of leith the same incompatibility with superior judicial dignity would—though not necessarily but too naturally—be imported along with it meantime this operation of directing an issue or issues is not materially different from that which my judge would have to perform in the case where jurytrial were called for by either party after a decision pronounced in the character of a definitive decision by himself and unless the instances in which under the existing practice reference is thus made to a jury are much fewer than they ought to be which under the recognised enormity of the addition to the expense may not improbably be the case your lordship may conceive by anticipation how few the instances would be in which on my plan the good men and true of scotland would find themselves saddled with this burden in comparison of the instances in which they would have to submit to this vexation on any plan which the learned reformer could approve one actual and therefore possible though even rarely exemplified technical substratum for jurytrial i am sensible still remains and that is the sort of cause to which finding no name in use for it though in every technical court they are heard every day in swarms i have been obliged to make a name and call it a motioncause a cause carried on upon no other than the favourite sort of evidence already mentioned—affidavit evidence petitions to the chancellor in matters of bankruptcy form the most striking—and probably in respect of average quantity of value at stake the most important—exemplification—petition a sort of motion upon paper in the case of these petition causes an issue is now and then directed and even in other motioncauses in other courts reference has been known to be thus made to a jury though much more rarely but to the working after this model there are two objections one on the ground of justice and utility the other on the ground of practical probability of adoption on the ground of justice and utility the objection is—that under this mode of trial the encouragement to perjury is so great that the facts capable of being extracted out of the mass of testimony for the purpose of being taken for the subject of the issue will be liable to be concealed or overwhelmed by the mass of false facts advanced under the protection afforded by that mode of trial against the scrutinizing power of counterinterrogation not to speak of its dilatoriness in comparison of the natural mode and its furnishing no witnesses but willing ones it presupposes therefore the universal extension of a mode of conflicting testification alike favourable to the generation of perjury and unfavourable to the direct ends of justice i throw out this objection rather as matter for consideration if it were worth while than as being assured of its not being upon the whole an advantageous succedaneum to the existing system—but what renders it not worth insisting on is its failure on the ground of practical probability a motioncause though in comparison of a cause carried on under the natural system enormously long is in comparison of a cause carried on under any other branch of the technical system as conspicuously short it moreover imports a withdrawing of the mendacitylicence and a substitution of a meagre and comparatively close discourse purporting at least to be the discourse of the party himself to the exuberant and inexhaustible effusions of professional and learned eloquence in the case of an incidental application springing out of a cause already introduced and carried on in regular form such abbreviation may be admitted but to apply to the body of every cause any such short method    would be an infringement of the prerogative of the college a contempt for the wisdom of ages and a violation of the act of union if not totidem syllabis at any rate totidem literis indeed be the occasion what it may and the arrangement proposed what it may to be assured of its being a violation of the act of union there needs no more than the assurance of its being a defalcation from the mass of delay vexation and expense and thereby from the reward allowed by the wisdom of ages to learned industry accordingly it is merely in the character of a model already existing in the english repository that i mention this possible support for jurytrial in scotland—and that no article in the list of these models may be omitted—and not with any the smallest expectation any more than wish of seeing it recommended to your lordships notice by your lordships learned reformer or any other learned adviser for any species of cause—meaning always principal not incidental causes by what means therefore this additional formality is likely to be made to operate in the character of an instrument of dispatch passes my comprehension but how it may be and is likely to be made use of as an engine of delay to that question answers offer themselves in abundance occasion has already presented itself—not surely of informing but however of humbly reminding your lordship that there are such sorts of causes as malâ fide causes of the existence of such iniquity the innocence of the learned reformer if his language were to be believed has need to be informed in the  0th resolution he speaks of dissatisfaction—of a partys being dissatisfied with the judgment of any court meaning subordinate court—and proceeds as if a real dissatisfaction with the judgment of such subordinate court were the only motive which in his experience any man ever found for making application to a superordinate court supposing scotland to be this sort of utopia—from the power which he gives to either party for referring the matter with or without reason to a jury no very considerable mass of mischief might arise but in england as your lordship may have seen and will see a little more distinctly a little further on we have a chamber in which the vermin that spin out such causes are bred in swarms as lice and fleas are said to have been bred in turkish hospitals and nurseries founded and stocked for the purpose and one of his improvements as your lordship will see presently consists in the building of just such another receptacle at edinburgh spick and span new admitting then the existence of the breed of malâ fide suitors without which his nursery for them would be without inhabitants—your malâ fide defendant for example with another mans estate or money in his hands—admitting the existence of this best sort of customer observe my lord but i think your lordship will not be pleased to observe in how many shapes nourishment is provided for him by these four resolutions about juries he forms his calculation and if mesne profits or interest of money promise to outweigh the eventual addition of expense—or without any such trouble of calculation if his affairs be desperate—after all anterior sources of delay are exhausted taking care to wait till the last moment he flies to resolution the  th as to the horns of the altar and calls for his share in this newimported stock of english liberty if as per resolution  th that part of the country where the evidence can be most easily obtained happens fortunately to lie within the range of a circuit and the commencement of that race against time happens to be or can be made to be at a convenient degree of remoteness the further off the point of time so much the better for mala fides moreover the principle of circumgyrating justice consisting in the allotment of a limited quantity of time for an unlimited quantity of business another chance he thus gets into the bargain is—that of finding that when the cause has got to the circuit town there is no time for trying it as it should be whereby he gets the benefit of cross and pile—or there is no time for trying it at all whereby he gets either the benefit of a further respite to the next circuit or that of finding his adversary content to give up half his right rather than see the other half exposed to further perils is it a cause that has taken its commencement in shetland or the orkneys—a cause about a hovel for example or a few yards square of potatoeground adjoining to it or the boundary between one such scrap of ground and another—he lays hold on resolution the  th and up goes the cause to edinburgh and there breeds another cause the object of which is to know whether the court of session there shall or shall not think fit that when the cause is got back again so far in its way to norway it shall receive the benefit of its share in the new imported stock of english liberty and note that the power of thus giving exercise to the faculty of locomotion may be no less useful in the hands of a malâ fide suitor on the plaintiffs than on the defendants side as for example—in a situation like lord selkirks should it happen to a man to be actuated by a disposition such as nobody can be further than i am from meaning to attribute to that noble lord it might not be unworthy of your lordships consideration how    much might be done in such hands towards ridding the country of its superfluous population by actions judiciously introduced into the local subordinate court and thereupon set to vibrate as above in an arc of  00 or  00 miles length between the subordinate court and the superordinate over and over again i have had or shall have occasion to confess that were there any such instrument as a speculum mentis that would suit the purpose astutia rather than innocence is the state in which i should expect to find the learned reformers mind should this conception on the other hand be erroneous it may be of real use to him—in his office or in his profession—to be informed what wicked people there are in this wicked world the mention made in resolution the  th and resolution the  th of the lord ordinarys court in the outerhouse and the court or chamber meaning i presume the correspondent innerhouse reminds me on this occasion as on so many others of which hereafter of the enigmatical and mysterious state of that court which is at the same time two and one our malâ fide suitor when with the help of one jury or succession of juries he has exhausted the stock of delay purchasable at the outerhouse is it proposed that with the help of another jury or like succession of juries he shall be admitted to the purchase of a fresh stock in the innerhouse and this in the two cases—of the causes breaking out of his lordships hands and getting into the innerhouse viz by reclaiming petition whether he will or no and that of its being gently wafted thither by his diffidence viz in that easy sort of vehicle called a great avisandum in the construction of which his lordship shows a degree of expertness so far above the comprehension of any english judge these are questions to which from the first an answer may have been provided though upon the face of the resolutions no trace of any such thing should be to be found as to resolution the  th—relative to causes brought on in an inferior court including the country courts at all distances—whether it be considered in itself or confronted with resolutions the  th and  th relative to causes brought before the court of session in the first instance it calls in my view for questions and observations more than one when under resolution the  th proofs having been allowed in a court in the orkneys application is made from the orkneys to edinburgh for trial by jury where is it supposed that the trial will take place—in the orkneys from whence the cause came and where most probably the residences of witnesses and parties are—or at edinburgh in the case where the cause is brought before the court of session at edinburgh in the first instance—in that case by resolution the  th the idea occurs i perceive to the learned reformer that there may be one part of the country in which evidence may be more easily obtained than in another and power is accordingly given to the court of session to place the scene of action in that venue but to the case where the cause is in the first instance brought before the country court in the orkneys this power is not extended had resolutions the  th and  th changed places this doubt would have been removed but whatsoever may have been the cause the monopoly of this benefit seems to have been intended for the suits commenced at edinburgh suitors perverse enough to wish to have justice administered to them near to their own homes not being thought worthy of it true it is that for aught i know the intention may have been that when a cause which from the orkneys has ascended to edinburgh has redescended to the orkneys receives the benefit of jurytrial it shall not be at any circuit court but at the stationary court from which it came i mention this therefore not as matter of opinion on my part but as matter of doubt be this as it may if i comprehend the matter right my lord suitors who wish to receive justice without being sent  00 or  00 miles for it are a bad set of people their wish is to cheat superior merit the exclusive growth of the metropolis out of the reward so richly due to it—the practice of bringing causes before these paltry little courts is accordingly a bad practice and ought to be discouraged else why is it that when a cause is brought in the first instance before one of those petty courts neither party can have the benefit of jurytrial without trying the cause first at edinburgh to know whether it shall be tried afterwards in the jury mode in the edinburgh court there or elsewhere—to be tried viz in the court it came from or in the circuit court or in god knows—and perhaps the learned reformer knows—what other court while if the plaintiff has but the sense to commence the cause in the proper place in the only place in scotland where any sort of cause ought to be commenced to wit at edinburgh where persons of superior learning and merit may extract their due out of it he as well as the defendant may put themselves in possession of this new and matchless benefit each of them at his own will and pleasure without being beholden for it to the court of session or anybody else and without being obliged to join in the trial of a preliminary and additional cause as above in england centuries ago these little country reptiles were either swallowed up or    sucked dry—nothing left but a husk—by the great serpents in westminsterhall—the wisdom which gave success to the design was if i mistake it not a prototype and perhaps a model to this the learned reformers grand scheme of reformation all this while lest injustice be done to jurytrial and a matchless remedy put upon the list of pure poisons let it not my lord be forgotten that in jurytrial all this crabbedness is not innate but comes of its being grafted upon a cankered stock instead of a sound one upon the technical—and in particular upon the scotch branch of the technical—instead of the natural system of procedure and moreover in respect to removal in general—removal for whatever purpose and under whatever pretence—if it be so well adapted as at present it appears to be to the convenience of the malâ fide suitor it would not be so in the smallest degree under that modification of the natural system which i propose to submit to your lordship in the facienda if it is so now it is only because as i proceed to state in my next letter learned lords and gentlemen find it convenient to have it so finding in the malâ fide suitor for whatsoever stock of delay vexation and expense they can contrive to manufacture—in the malâ fide suitor the latent though not dormant partner in their firm besides a partner their best sort of instrument and in the mode and conditions of removal one of their best channels of conveyance on this occasion i know not whether there be any adequate use in hinting that of the two modifications of which misdecision on the part of a jury is alike susceptible—viz misdecision which calls for reversal and misdecision which respecting quantity only calls only for modification—viz angmentation or diminution—say misdecision pro toto and misdecision pro tanto—the eye of the learned reformer seems to have pitched but upon one a verdict requiring correction—for example on the score of excessive damages—and given without any direction from the judge or against his direction—was it considered and meant to be included under the description of a verdict given contrary to evidence but the occurrences—specified as above in the character of fit grounds for new trial—are they all that required to be thus specified   vicious composition of the jury—by the admission of a juror who had gained admission by fraud after his disqualification had been pronounced—   mistake or misconduct on the part of the jury—in giving a verdict contrary to evidence or contrary to the direction of the judge respecting matter of law—or in giving a general verdict the judge requiring a special verdict or a verdict subject to the opinion of the court—or in deciding by lot—   notorious partiality of a juror—evidenced for example by previous declarations on his part of a determination to cause the verdict to be given in favour of one of the parties—   mistake or misconduct on the part of the judge—in excluding evidence that ought to have been admitted—or in admitting evidence that ought to have been excluded—or in giving an erroneous direction respecting the matter of law—   on the part of the evidence a deficiency on one side—whether produced by fraud on the opposite side—by pure accident—by misconception or neglect on the first side viz on the part of the professional agents of the party on that same side—   absence of any other of the dramatis personæ whose presence was regarded as necessary—as for example of an advocate on one side—the absence produced by fraud on the opposite side— all these have in english practice been sustained as grounds for the allowance of a new trial these in the course of about a century and a half the time during which the practice of granting new trials has been in use have been brought to light by the fortuitous concourse of the parent atoms of litigation more for aught i know there may be though i should not expect to find many presenting an equally good title but as yet lying unextruded in the womb of time were it to present any prospect of being of use i know of one hand at least by which weak as it is the labour of exploration would not be grudged on this as on so many other occasions analogy if properly commissioned would in the course of a few days or hours produce in useful abundance cases calling for regulation and regulations adapted to those cases but it is among the maxims of learned policy that all such anticipations are an injury to the profession and as such ought to be discountenanced—that the only fit shape for law to appear in is that of ex post facto law—that providence is rashness—that punishment especially when without delinquency is better than prevention—that legislation is usurpation upon jurisprudence—and that to shut the stable door before one steed at least has been stolen is defrauding thieves and lawyers of their due from this cause it is among others that cases—which to so vast an extent might by the light of analogy be at once brought out and provided for—and by the hand of the legislator in the best mode—are left to be dragged out one by one time after time each time at the expense of many a pang by the afflicted suitor and provided for in the course    of ages by the hand of the judge—proceeding in his ever imperfect and insufficient mode but to return to the grounds for new trial of the above upon which english practice has already put its seal few if any would i am inclined to think be regarded by a scotch lawyer as insufficient yet out of the whole number two and no more—contrariety to evidence and misdecision of the judge—are specified by your lordships learned adviser in the resolutions—i have the honour to be with all respect my lord your lordships most obedient servant jeremy bentham lord grenville letter v on the bill called lord eldons my lord— i resume the pen times have changed but the address of these letters shall not change your lordships was the mark first stampt upon the measure there i hope still to see it by me at any rate it shall not—by your lordship i hope it will not—be obliterated be the fundator perficiens who he may to the character of fundator incipiens your lordships title is beyond dispute be the profit of the piece to the public what it may your lordship may claim to the last an authors share your lordships edition of it was the subject of the four preceding letters when the last of them was concluded the plan of observation i had set out upon wanted much of having been completed my intention however was to have gone through with it and that intention wanted at length but little of having been executed but when the text was fully understood to have been laid upon the shelf the comment could do no less than follow it should the text ever find its way again to the carpet it will then be time enough for the comment to follow it in its course not that the labour bestowed upon the dormant plan is altogether lost it can be no secret to your lordship that to my humble view of the matter the tower of judicature was already high enough and to all but the favoured few to whom a golden ticket opens the way the summit of it sufficiently inaccessible without any such additional stage as your lordships learned architect had planned for it my intended globe of compression shares of course the fate of the fortress against which it was designed to serve but if of the stock of projectiles originally destined for that service it should happen to a splinter or two to glance that way without prejudice to the new service to which they are now destined so much the better for economy and not the worse i hope for justice to us in england intermediate chambers of review are no novelty viewing them at once in the character of shops where injustice in the shape of delay is sold to all who will pay the price and in the character of mexican temples polluted by human sacrifices this feeble hand would regard itself as employed not like that of erostratus but like that of daniel if in addition to the model of the projected scotch edifice of that name it were able to consign those antique receptacles of corruption to a consuming fire though always a respectful observer your lordship never has found never can find in me a flattering one had i a vote and at the same time no other option than between the plan prepared by your lordships learned adviser and the new one now placed upon the carpet by another learned scribe howsoever it fared with my wishes my judgment would find itself obliged to decide—that in that perpetual competition for public favour on which under the best and at the same time the most improvable of all governments all hope of ulterior improvement depends the latest bidder has in the present instance shown himself the best do not let the lot be knocked down to him my lord that if not on the present on some future contingent occasion brought on by some new turn of the wheel of fortune your lordship after being enabled may be prevailed upon to bid above him is amongst the objects aimed at by this renewed address in the former instance after a leading step or two the direction pursued appeared to my weak judgment such as it was a wrong one in regard to this new plan what i have now to notice resolves itself into this viz that after a few uncertain and tottering steps though the direction be in the main a right one yet so small is the advance yards or inches when furlongs were necessary that when the moving power is exhausted the measure will find itself by a vast interval short of the proper mark the case and comfort it gave me not merely to find myself at liberty but by the nature of the case compelled to ascribe the details and technical parts of the plan to an inferior and that an unknown hand was on the former occasion represented in my first letter happily on the present occasion the same good fortune still attends me to outward appearance and in common parlance the bill which lies before me presents the image and superscription of the noble and learned lord whose seat to use a flower culled from his own bouquet of which presently is at the head of the law—the second person in dignity after royal blood—the lord high chancellor of great britain as to the actual penmanship i ascribe it without hesitation to some other and consequently inferior hand the proof is no less simple than    conclusive legislation is in every public station unless that of the chancellor of the exchequer be an exception matter either of mere supererogation and not in any degree or point of view of obligation or at the utmost of what according to the distinction so familiar to moralists and jurists is denominated imperfect obligation judicature i e on the part of a judge to borrow a term from the same authoritative vocabulary dispatch of business and with the utmost degree of celerity which consistently with rectitude the powers of decision on the part of the judge admit of matter of perfect obligation how far in the highest source of that purest kind of law which in the only country that has any conception of it is distinguished by the name of equity the rate of dispatch is from keeping pace with the demand is a point that could no otherwise be ascertained in proper mode and form than from the register books and such other documents as in either house of parliament any member who should think it worth knowing whether equity gets on or stands still might command at any time but that in a general view it is such as to present to the eye of superficial observation at least symptoms of debility in the extreme—and this whether the standard of comparison be taken from anterior or cotemporary and collateral examples—is a fact which since the time of the chancellorship of lord loughborough has with little interruption been rendered but too notorious by the daily lists of causes as well as by the groans of suitors and the unvaried cloud that has been seen sitting upon the brows of advocates whom famine has driven along with the causes corpora cum causis out of the two great banqueting halls in palace yard and lincolns inn into the great audience hall at the rolls of this inadequacy of the supply to the demand for judicature what the efficient causes may be is a subject of too much delicacy not to speak of danger for so weak a hand as mine to attempt to dive into whether it be that in mere spite the powers which should have been the powers of harmony have metamorphosed themselves into powers of discord and notwithstanding and even by virtue of that very discord entered into a conspiracy to disturb the quiet of the bench and in the rage of their hunger and thirst after equity to keep squalling and knocking for it at a door which they deserve not to see open to them—whether     but it would be no less superfluous than perilous to attempt prying into causes when the effects which for the purpose of the argument are so indisputably sufficient are themselves beyond dispute my lord what like an innocent and suspected queen i have been thus long groping for blindfold in a labyrinth composed of redhot ploughshares—what i have thus been groping for and am at length arrived at is—this argument the time of the noble and learned person whose seat is sometimes upon a bench sometimes upon a woolsack is insufficient for the discharge of the duties of perfect obligation by which he is pressed—à fortiori for imperfect ones clearing the paper of the causes is so far as time and powers serve matter of perfect obligation drawing this bill or any other bill is matter either of no obligation at all or at the utmost but of an imperfect one in the noble and learned bosom here in question conscience is at once too delicate and too enlightened to sacrifice perfect obligations to imperfect ones therefore it was not by the hand of the noble and learned lord that this bill was drawn therefore again it was drawn by some other and consequently by some inferior hand which hand saving its inferiority is unknown which is all that i do know or so long as it is in my power not to know will know concerning it hence my lord my comfort and now with a tranquillized mind i enter upon my new task your lordship will be apt to smile—other readers if i happen to have any will stand aghast—at seeing a letter divided into chapters and those chapters perhaps into sections but having no share in that profit which has unintelligibility for its source nor interest consequently in manufacturing a chaos without distinguishable feature shape or limb such as the laws of this one country this proposed law among the rest are doomed to be—more particularly in their first concoction when for the purpose of reference confrontation of parts methodization and discussion division and distinction are most necessary—having no such profit i say nor consequently any such sinister interest even the law of custom—to so many noble and learned persons and on such good and valuable considerations the dearest and most sacred of all laws—has not been able to prevail upon me to forego the use of those instruments of distinct conception as well as unambiguous and uncircumlocutory reference which have the rules of division and numeration for their source chapter i analysis of the bill called lord eldons bill §   distinguishable parts for the purpose of such observations as i may have to submit i shall take the liberty of considering the matter of the bill as divided into four parts— part the first taking for its subject the judicial establishment of the court of session and the course of procedure in that court and for its declared object dispatch of business occupies itself in making regulations    outright by the sole wisdom as well as by the authority of parliament of the nineteen sections that may be found on numbering the paragraphs in the bill for as already intimated it would have been unparliamentary to have put them into a state already fitted for numerical reference i e into a state in which they would have been capable of being referred to otherwise than by a constantly tedious and oftentimes ambiguous circumlocutory designation this part embraces or at least touches upon sections ten viz              0          part the second taking in hand the same subjects and it may be presumed looking to the same object not to speak of other objects occupies itself in giving to the court of session powers of subordinate legislation to be exercised on the subjects mentioned above—sections touched upon four viz       and    part the third occupies itself in giving to a set of special commissioners authority but without power to make inquiries relative to the course of procedure in that court and the sheriffs court as carried on at present and thereupon to propose any such alterations as in their judgment may seem proper to be made by parliament as also to another special commission the operations of which are confined to the particular purpose of reporting concerning the utility and proper extent of jury trial and the most advantageous mode of engrafting it upon whatsoever system of procedure may have been proposed by the set of commissioners first mentioned—sections two viz    and    part the fourth takes for its subject the appeal presented from the court of session to the house of lords and for its object to judge by inference in default of express declaration—for its principal at least if not sole object—the reducing the burthen imposed by those applications on the time of the house of lords such is at any rate the principal declared object of the plan contained in the memorial presented to the house of lords by eleven out of the fifteen judges of the court of session headed by the lord president which memorial was followed by a bill and that by a second having for its reputed author the same right honourable judge which bills taken together form upon the face of them the basis of this which since that time we have seen issuing from a still higher source—sections four viz          and    i proceed to sketch out the contents or at any rate the topics of the bill considered as divided into these four parts— §   part i parliamentary regulations touching the judicial establishment  —section   the court of session to be cast into two divisions in division the first the lord president and seven other judges in division the second the lord justiceclerk and six other judges  —section   the king to appoint which of the judges shall sit in the several divisions the appointment first made quere is it to be susceptible of variation  —section   the lord president of the whole court to preside in division the first the lord justiceclerk in division the second in the absence of such permanent president an occasional president to be elected on each occasion by the judges then present quere if by to sit at the head of such divisions respectively be meant to exercise the functions of president n b in no one of the three fourseated courts in westminster hall does the judge who presides sit at the head of the line of judges  —section   each division to contain the same number of judges of the court of justiciary reckoning for one the lord justiceclerk—who always is one  —section   undertaking to give a quorum number to each division the same to each leaves a blank for it† in the case of the entire court as often as a quorum number is mentioned the blank is filled up  —section   except in cases herein excepted see part ii each division is to have the like duties powers and functions    authorities and privileges as are now exercised or enjoyed by the whole court  —section   this section takes for its object the securing a decision in the case of difference of opinion among the judges with equal numbers on each side but of this part of the bill i find myself unable to give any tolerably correct account in any other words than its own‡  —section   liberty to the plaintiff to  0 choose under which division he will commence his suit  —section   cases of remitter excepted see part ii no removal of a suit from division to division words in abundance clouds proportionable

—section   so in what rotation for example of years sessions months or weeks regard being had to dispatch of business and avoiding of expense   —section   so to regulate the days of sitting in the two divisions during the time of session in which phrase seems to be implied that in vacation times being four months and two months total six months in the year neither of the divisions are to sit viz in the innerhouse with the exception probably of ordinaries in the outerhouse and billchamber as at present   —section   so to regulate concerning the remittal of causes from division to division in consideration of a connexion between cause and cause  0—section    so to regulate concerning the forms of proceeding and process in each division and particularly concerning the mode of conducting the pleadings by writing or viva voce and that as well in the innerhouse as before the ordinaries §   contents of part iii authority inquisitorial and initiative  —section    power to the king either by letters patent or by instrument under his signmanual to appoint commissioners number not limited to sit at such times and places as they think fit for the exercise of the functions hereinafter mentioned with power to choose a præses i e one of their number it is supposed for præses as also a clerk one clerk  —section    authority without any coercive power to these commissioners to make full inquiries without power for compelling answers to any such inquiries into the present forms of the court in conducting process extracting decrees registration of the same and execution thereon or

authority to set down in writing—amendments such as shall appear to them—most reasonable and best calculated for the due administration of justice in that court n b so far as concerns the court of session every point in which the personal interest of the judges is more particularly concerned and in particular that repose to which their determination to sacrifice the interests of justice has been solemnly declared memorial art  0 seems left to the uncontrouled operation of that sinister interest—the commissioners not authorised so much as to propose anything in relation to it forms of pleading—a subject sufficient of itself to absorb the whole of a mans time for months or years—another point which the commissioners are not to meddle with reserved for the judges whose determination not to give up a particle of their time has been declared as above†  —section    authority to inquire into the fees perquisites and emoluments claimed by or belonging to the clerks and officers of the court and other members of the college    of justice including those called in england attorneys and solicitors or and persons connected with the said court the faculty of advocates excepted  —section

accruing to persons entitled to nominate to the offices the emoluments of which may then come to be abolished nothing is said  —section    authority to propose regulations relative to processes or causes to be brought into the court of session by advocation anglicé by certiorari or suspension anglicé by writ of error or appeal or in the first instance or before the circuit court i e as explained in the preambulatory part of this section the circuit court of justiciary by appeal procedure in causes brought into the court of session in the first instance having as per no   been already included in the authority given to these commissioners what is it that can have been intended by the words first instance in this clause which appears not to have any other object than the option to be made as between one mode of appeal and another  —section    authority to inquire into the fees perquisites or emoluments claimed by the clerks and other officers judges it seems excepted in the sheriffs courts in scotland and to take and set down in writing what occurs to them relative thereto   of the great variety of inferior judicatories or sheriffdeputes courts not to mention their substitutes courts which in fact are distinct judicatories with appeal to the respective principals justice of peace courts borough bailies courts dean of guilds courts barons courts commissaries courts of different ranks one above another admiralty courts ditto all liable to have their proceedings reviewed by the court of session how happens it that the inquiry is confined to the sheriffcourts meaning the sheriffdeputes court†   under this term sheriffcourts not very usual in scotch law would the judicatories filled by the substitutes be understood to be included as well as those filled by the principals   in the instance of the judicatories included as above in the authority for making inquiry why confine the inquiry to the subject of the emoluments excluding the system of procedure between which and the system of procedure pursued in the court of session—the judicatory by which the proceedings in those subordinate courts are reviewed—the connexion is necessarily so intimate   taking and setting down in writing what occurs—relating thereto by this expression was it meant to denote or to include authority for proposing alterations or amendments as in the case of the court of session if so what can have been the reason for thus varying the phrase‡  —section    like authority respecting the state of the records in these courts viz the sheriff courts and those only as aforesaid like queries to this clause as to the one last mentioned     0—section    injunction to these commissioners to report the whole of their proceedings to his majesty with all

the proceedings of the court of session or any other court in scotland trial by jury no authority having been given either to this or the other set of commissioners for making any inquiry into the system of procedure pursued in any such other court in any and what cases in matters of a civil nature and in what manner and form the same could be most usefully established   —section    injunction to report as in the case of the signmanual commissioners on the occasion of the shadow of power given as above to the two sets of commissioners for the collection of the requisite stock of information

be stopped by appeal  —section    respecting all matters     done or having taken place     in consequence of such regulations so made as to interimpossession execution and payment of expenses or

to be allowed from interlocutors or decrees of lords ordinary which have not been reviewed by the judges sitting in the division to which such lords ordinary belong §   phraseology a topic dismissed on the subject of part the first as above marked out i shall not on the present occasion at least attempt giving your lordship any further trouble so far as concerns this first part of the bill such remarks as i should have to submit would turn chiefly upon the penmanship doubts for example concerning the meaning of the learned scribe and supposing the meaning rightly guessed at doubts whether the words would answer the purpose of giving effect to it in legislation though there cannot be anything but what has its importance yet as between style and matter so far as they are capable of being separated matter will in the order of importance claim an undisputed preference    thence it is that for the present at least part the first is put aside the apprehension i have been all along under of falling into the sin of misrepresentation and my anxiety under that apprehension must already have betrayed itself of misrepresentation there are two modes one is when the language of the original being clear the representation given of it is unfaithful ambiguous or obscure the other is when the language of the original being obscure or ambiguous the representation given of it is clear and decisive in practice this last mode of misrepresentation is the most mischievous be the original what it may if the abridgment appear unintelligible or doubtful a man betakes himself to the original of course but if the original being ambiguous the abridgment be clear the clearer it is the more perfectly he is satisfied with it and the less he suspects the danger he is exposing himself to by trusting to the abridgment and upon the faith of it ascribing to the original a sense which when the time comes may prove to his dismay to be different from the sense put upon it by the judge how happens it—over and over again have i asked myself this question without ever having been able to find an answer—how happens it that throughout the texture of this bill the language is continually varying—varying as between clause and clause—between clauses in which so far as can be concluded against the presumption afforded by the variation in the language the import meant to be conveyed was exactly the same to what cause shall this perpetual departure—departure of a man from himself—be ascribed—to thought or to want of thought is it that certainty was sacrificed perpetually and deliberately sacrificed to an imagined beauty—beauty supposed to be produced in an act of parliament by variety of style or is it that this bill a bill on which the state and fate of justice in one of the three kingdoms depends—this truly momentous bill having in the manner of a speech spoken been dictated to an amanuensis was never looked at afterwards    d table vii an account of the number of

book intituled the solicitors practice in the house of lords      dismission is not stated as taking place on any other occasion than that of a compromise pp          f arrears of each year this column together with the two next viz gained upon the arrear and total amounts of arrear viz in each year deduced as they are from those comprised in the official accounts are here added for the purpose of applying the information the more closely to the object in view g gained upon the arrear the comparative degree of dispatch given in these two following years viz      and      under the management of lord loughborough compared with the arrear which commencing in the next year      continued thenceforward to increase is an object that ought naturally to attract notice h totals remaining upon the arrear these results are deduced by subtracting from the numbers presented in each year the numbers disposed of viz in one or other of the three several ways viz by the appeals being either heard withdrawn or dismissed had every year produced an arrear in that case in each year the total amount of the arrear accumulated in the course of the whole period down to that year inclusively would throughout have been exhibited by the simple operation of adding to that year the arrears of the several preceding years but as the table exhibits two years      and      which instead of making an addition to the total amounts of arrear in those years respectively subtracted each of them a number from the total amount hence came the necessity of interposing between that column and the column expressive of the arrear of each of the years that afforded an arrear the column expressive of the numbers gained upon the arrear viz in the only two instances in which any such extra despatch took place a natural question here is whether the number     the number expressive of the total amount of the arrear accumulated in the thirteen years and part of a fourteenth comprised in these official accounts delivered in as they were on the   th of march   0  comprised the whole of the number remaining in arrear and waiting to be disposed of at that time the affirmative seems not improbable but in regard to the amount of the arrear neither that conclusion nor any other can be deduced to a certainty from any information afforded by these accounts that in      being the year immediately preceding the commencement of the earliest of the two periods comprised in these accounts an arrear existed is manifest on the face of them for at the end of      being the third year

number presented in those same years deducting then    as being the arrear formed during this period there remains   a number which must already have been remaining in arrear at the commencement of this same period but in addition to these   there may have been at the commencement of this period an arrear to any amount—an arrear which if existing will be to be added to     the number exhibited by the last column of numbers in this table b writs of error in english and irish commonlaw causes appeals are called writs of error in english and irish equitycourt causes as well as in english spiritualcourt and admiraltycourt causes they are called appeals so likewise in all such scotch causes as come before the house of lords in the wholesheet table of standing orders of the house dated anno   0  and therein ordered to be printed and published and affixed on the doors of this house the house of lords to the end all persons that shall be therein concerned may the better take notice of the same—in the title as well as in the body of the paper writs of error are mentioned in conjunction with appeals writs of error occupying the first place the declared principal object of the document in question being to bring to view the amount of the demands made upon the house of lords for such part of its time as could with propriety be allotted to the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction if the cognizance of the appeals called writs of error occupied any portion of that time the reason for stating the portion of time occupied applied no less pointedly to this sort of appeals than to any of the others and the number of writs of error as the appropriate column shows has been much greater than that of all the other appeals put together in the contrary case viz if by the appeals called writs of error no portion at all of the time of the house was occupied then so far as the time of the house was the sole object the reason for bringing to view the others would not extend to these in the ulterior results art   to these tables and in ditto art   to table x in the case of the appeals called writs of error presented to two of the three english subordinate chambers of review viz the kings bench and of the two exchequer chambers that one which sits over the kings bench the number of appeals which occupy any portion at all of the time of the judicatory which is supposed to take cognizance of them is not it will be seen more than   0th of the whole the inference is—that possibly and not altogether improbably of the whole number of writs of error presented to the house of lords in the course of these fourteen years there was not one to which the mind of any one member of that superior and ultimate judicatory by which the fate of so many groups of suitors had been disposed of had ever been applied of these writoferror appeals supposing the rate of influx to have remained during the whole of the period without increase though a very considerable increase seems probable the number must at the end of the period have amounted to     at which time of the appeals called appeals the whole number furnished by this and the two other kingdoms put

irish parliament from its dependence on the british viz anno      by    geo iii c    the appeals now presented to the house of lords sitting for the three united kingdoms used to be presented to the irish house of lords l     so far as concerns the mala fide appeals which till the time comes for hearing at which conjuncture they are either withdrawn or dismissed commonly without being argued cannot be distinguished from the bona fide appeals the cause of this appear may be seen in the feegathering system by the feegathering system understand that system which to the remuneration attached to the offices concerned in the administration of justice gives the shape of fees viz sums of money the aggregate of which rises and falls along with the number of suits and the number of incidents taking place in each suit the multitude of mala fide appeals is produced by the profit which the appellant finds it in his power to make by subjecting the respondent to the ulterior load of delay expense and vexation attached to this ulterior stage and forasmuch as the amount of official fees has all along risen and fallen with the multitude of appeals mala fide as well as bona fide ones it has thus been the interest of persons in high office judges and others to render by apt encouragement the multitude of these acts of iniquity as great as possible this encouragement consisted in the giving to the operation of appeal the effect of staying execution on the decision appealed from by this means where in contemplation of the advantage to be reaped from such delay a man had got possession of property to which he had no right whatsoever might be the nature and amount of such advantage was secured to him for such length of time as the delay could be made to last see ulterior

  at this time the sort of appeal called a writ of error was the only one of which that house was in the habit of taking cognizance of this standing order there are two declared objects one is the frustrating that desire to delay justice the frequency of which on the part of the plaintiffs viz the appellants is recited as a fact to which the attention of the house had directed itself the other is the causing these plaintiffs to satisfy the officers of this house the fees justly due to them so far as concerns the abuse unfortunately the arrangements therein professed to be designed for the prevention of it have ever since proved to be what at that time they might without any extraordinary degree of penetration have been foreseen to be if not seen to have been viz as inefficient as they are complicated in this case as in every other if the prevention of the wrong be really desired the one thing needful is to take away the profit of it in the instance of these writs of error in the case of the mala fide ones the profit consisted in the stoppage applied to the execution of the judgment pronounced below to secure this profit in the first instance to the mala fide appellant from whose pocket the official fees payable on account of the appeal were to come and through him to the official pockets into which those fees were to come the power of the house had been employed–this profit was left untouched in regard to the other object viz the enabling the officers of the house to gather fees the degree of success with which this part of the plan has been attended has ever since been accepted as full compensation for the failure in regard to the other the learned person to whom these officers are indebted for the success and the public for the failure was the ever pious and venerable and on many and great occasions honest earl of clarendon prime minister as well as chancellor of that day for ulterior exemplifications of the effects produced in this way by the

of before any of the appeals presented in   0  or at any later period can in regular course either have come on to be heard or have arrived at that stage at which the appellant whose object was delay could have found the requisite inducement for suffering his appeal to be struck out of the list viz by withdrawing it to save ulterior costs or for want of prosecution suffering it to be dismissed     in the scotch causes proportion of mala fide to bona fide appeals nearly as     to     nearly as                       to  ¾ for     is the number of scotch appeals presented     the number of those either withdrawn or suffered to be dismissed by a mala fide appeal is here meant an appeal in the instance of which the appellant either is at the time of making it conscious of his not having right on his side or at least has no expectation of success in this case the profit certain and contingent together expected by him from the delay thus produced is his inducement for subjecting himself to the vexation and expense attached to this state of litigation—his inducement and the only inducement which in the shape of pecuniary profit to himself he can have to his reaping any such profit one condition however is annexed and that an indispensable one viz that among the effects attached to the appeal by the practice of the court above shall be—the stoppage of execution viz that so long as the appeal remains undisposed of the judgment appealed from shall not be executed nor consequently the appellant be by such execution divested of the possession which he has of the subject in dispute among the english appeals presented to the house of lords in the case of those which are called appeals being those which are presented in equity causes such stoppage of execution does not take place accordingly no advantage being to be got by the appellant in any other event than that of its being by the superordinate judicature decreed to have right on his side the appeals presented from any one of the equity courts may with few or no exceptions be reasonably presumed to have been bona fide ones accordingly upon    presented whereof    heard the english list affords in the    years no more than   withdrawn and   dismissed together   on the    presented not so many as   out of   on the    heard exactly   to  ½ but since these six appeals could not have had for their final cause any profit resulting from delay some other cause or causes must in these instances be found among these causes the most productive if not the only probable ones seem to be—   death of one or more among the parties by which in any one of a variety of ways the conditions the concurrence of which is necessary to the prosecution of the appeal viz the requisite interest or on other accounts the inclination or in respect of pecuniary sufficiency the power or the opinion in respect of interest or probability of success may one or more of them have been made to cease   failure of pecuniary sufficiency or of resolution and perseverance on the appellants side   compromise a result which may have been produced either by some one of the causes above mentioned or from a difference in the conception entertained by the parties respectively of the probably prevailing opinion of the judicatory at the one time compared with the other in the instance of the english appeals called appeals those either withdrawn or dismissed being then not any of them mala fide ones and bearing though not near so large a proportion as in the case of the scotch appeals yet some proportion to the number heard—not the whole it may naturally be said should in the instance of the scotch appeals be placed to the account of mala fides any more than in the instance of the english appeals but what seems probable is that in the case of the english appeals the number of those withdrawn or dismissed small as it is may have been swelled by some accidental cause not applying at all or not with equal efficiency to the scotch appeals for under the incitement of a profit in like manner to be gained by delay in the instance of the class of english appeals called writs of error upon so large a number as    0 we shall see not more than one in  0 argued    out of  0 therefore either withdrawn or dismissed—see table x ulterior results art   and this though the premium for delay must latterly at least have been much less in the case of the english appeals than in the case of the scotch appeals not more than about one years delay being at the expense of the costs in appeal purchasable in those english intermediate courts of appeal   th report of finance committee      while latterly no less than three years delay has been purchased viz as above art   in the house of lords in all these cases the profit by delay and consequently by mala fide appeals is matter of calculation depending on the one hand on the proportion between the amount of costs in the house of lords up to the time when the appeal goes out of that judicatory by being withdrawn or dismissed and on the other hand on the profit which the situation of the appellant enables him to make of the subject in his possession in the meantime rent of land for example   per cent interest of money   per cent commercial profit        0 per cent or more or if no security or no adequate security has been exacted of him appropriation of the whole subject viz by expenditure exportation or concealment     number of scotch appeals in which injustice is the result of the rule giving to the act of appeal the effect of stopping execution is     out of     nearly   out of   for by adding to the number withdrawn    and the number dismissed    the number in which the decree made below was affirmed  0  we have for a total     in all which instances so long as the decree the justice of which came thus to be afterwards acknowledged by the unsuccessful party or declared by the supreme judicatory remained unexecuted so long did the injustice last on the other hand by adding to the number in which the decree was reversed    the number in which the cause was remitted to the courts below viz for the purpose of some change to be made in the decree    we have    being the number of instances in which the delay was productive either of no injustice at all or none but what received some compensation in the justice operated by such change note the distinction between the number of cases in which injustice viz in the shape of delay was the result of the rule and ditto of ditto in which the appeal was accompanied with mala fides the cases in which the delay proved to have been productive of injustice were as well those in which the decree was affirmed as those in which the appeal was either withdrawn or dismissed while it was only by those in which the appeal was either withdrawn or dismissed that any presumption was afforded of mala fides e ulterior results deducible from this table     the english bona fide

appeals that under the name of writs of error were presented to the house of lords is not much less than twice the whole number of scotch appeals presented to the same judicatory—more than thrice the number heard while of these and all other english appeals put together the whole number heard ie argued if any at all were argued was at any rate much less than that of the scotch appeals argued in that same house of these english appeals so small if any was the number heard that either on this account or some other which remains to be explained in the accounts called for and presented as per tables vii viii and ix for the purpose of showing the draughts made on the time of the house by its appellate judicature the appeals of this description were not comprised—though in the titles of the wholesheet table of standing orders they face the eye at the same time concerning these same     appeals called writs of error presented to the house two other articles of information would have been of use with reference to the present purpose viz—   from which of the four commonlaw westminsterhall courts capable of furnishing appeals directly to the house viz the two courts of immediate jurisdiction the kings bench and the exchequer and the two courts of intermediate appellate jurisdiction the exchequer chamber sitting over the kings bench and the exchequer chamber sitting over the exchequer they were respectively presented   of those if any which through the medium of the kings bench were furnished by the common pleas how many in their ascent to the house went from the kings bench directly and how many not till after they had passed through that one of the two exchequer chambers which sits over the kings bench—passing thus through two intermediate chambers of review

in     out of these   0 instances the imputation of error can scarcely have been otherwise than groundless it may have been so in any of the remaining seven but if there were any in which it was just

the course of three years   0 decrees of that court had been complained of as erroneous the imputation it seems probable would not have sitten altogether easily upon the judges of that court and in particular upon the president but if it be in the power of any such imputations to excite commotions in learned minds we see the virtue of £    ayear in the character of a sedative and if such be its

disbursements in this instance nothing is given under either of those heads it is for the purpose of doing nothing and getting nothing by it that the lord chiefjustice is kind enough it seems to nominate himself to be clerk under himself that in some way or other the chiefjustice of the common pleas gained £           by alleged errors—whereof all but the trifle above mentioned by the sale of factitious delay—is certain p    but in what particular way baffles all research in pages         under the head of returns from the court of exchequer mr henry edgell is stated as being clerk of the errors in the exchequer chamber and as holding the office by appointment from the lord chiefjustice of the court of common pleas—£           is therein stated as the net receipt for three quarters of a year from that office—but the only pocket in which any part of it is represented as resting is that of the officer so appointed no part of it going as in the instance of the other chiefjustice into the pocket of the learned and reverend patron of the office that in the instance of the chiefjustice of the court of common pleas as above stated the alleged errors thus converted into sources of profit to the judge were errors alleged to have been committed by the judge himself was matter of inference should this inference be itself found erroneous the error was altogether unintentional and remains as yet invincible in the court of common pleas errors constitute the supposed subjectmatter of the supposed business of a clerk who is at the same time chiefjustice these errors if not by the chiefjustice by whom else have they been committed question the same in regard to the still more profitable mass of errors the source of which is the kings bench meantime in the way of a corollary these particulars may serve moreover as samples of the produce of jurisprudential science of that part of the rule of action which men have been kept from knowing that they might be pillaged for not knowing it—samples of the purpose for which as well as of the mode in which it has been elaborated    summary view of the plan of a judicatory under the name of the court of lords delegates proposed for the exercise of those judicial functions the adequate discharge of which by the whole house has for these six or seven years been rendered confessedly impracticable by want of time section i number and choice the judges members of the house so far as obtainable—viz so far as in that high station it shall happen to a set of fit persons finding adequate inducements for the acceptance of so laborious a duty to obtain the preference—see §   article  —and with salaries—in consideration of their taking upon them the requisite official obligations   puisnes three—to be elected one for each of the three kingdoms by the lords sitting for that kingdom and to be denominated respectively the english the scotch and the irish delegate—in the hope that in each the choice may fall upon some person who being in a special degree conversant with its peculiar laws and local circumstances may be considered as in a more particular manner charged with its legal concerns in the two minor kingdoms all danger from local partialities will be excluded by the number of the votes three to one not exposed to any such sinister influence   the president to be elected by the whole house and to be denominated the union delegate—that the english ascendency on its present footing may be preserved and thereby this committee rendered the more correct a representative of the whole house the presumption is that the president and perhaps the three puisnes or some of them—at least by reason of the peculiarity of scotch law the one for scotland—will at the outset be a professionallybred lawyer taken from the bar or from the bench but the need of such assistance will be less and less thenceforward—see §   article    —and all this will of course depend at all times upon the pleasure of the house   election annual—viz at the commencement of each session—if as in the case of the kings delegates viz in ecclesiastical and admiralty causes there were a fresh election for each cause the office would not be worth acceptance or if it were a perpetual ferment would thus be kept up at any rate the benefit of appropriate experience would be apt to be lost if the office were for life as in three of the four westminsterhall courts the mind of the delegated body would not be as in this case not to change the constitution it ought to be the nearest resemblance capable of being taken of the mind of the delegating body the supreme judicature would be no longer substantially in the house of lords the renewal of the election every year will provide in case of necessity the gentlest and most decorous mode of ridding the judicatory of any member whose performance may have fallen short of expectation while the apprehension of it will be a security for propriety of conduct and a preservation against negligence nor yet would this possibility of amotion destroy the value of the office it would be considered as differing substantially but little from an office for life as in the case of the chairmanship of the middlesex sessions and in that of the chamberlainship of the city of london the former case may be referred to as one    in which the utility of periodical election as above has in every point of view received a satisfactory exemplification   mode of election secret viz by ballot—that the electors being free as possible as against all influence of will over will no influence prevailing but the unpreventible and oftentimes salutary influence of understanding over understanding the mind of the delegated body may as above be the faithful copy of the mind of the constituent body taken in its permanent and habitual state—and that no elector may stand exposed or conceive himself exposed to the danger of finding himself by an adverse vote rendered an object of personal displeasure to a person to whom it may happen to become his judge   notwithstanding the appropriation of the title of president to a single person the functions to be exercised by all the judges in turns each taking his month or his number of causes or the causes of his own kingdom or the above different modes of alternation being combined—that inept candidates may keep aloof—that the sense of responsibility may be kept alive in all—that the faculties of all may be sharpened and invigorated by exercise—that no one of all four offices may ever degenerate into much less be at the time of the appointment designed to be made a sinecure—and that each pursue judge may be the better qualified for eventually succeeding to the office of president thereby adding to all other elements of aptitude that of appropriate experience by the obligation of presiding i e taking the lead in causes and being the mouthpiece of the court—viz not only in the delivery of the decision but in the conduct of the whole business doing all that which in judicial business is done by the chancellor in the house of lords—an effectual exclusion will be put upon all persons manifestly unfit for the conduct of judicial business in general—by the more particular obligation of presiding in causes coming from the kingdom for which each delegate is respectively elected an exclusion will naturally be put upon a person not particularly competent to the conduct of the business from that kingdom a person conversant solely in scotch law will not find it so easy to be chosen to fill an english or irish delegateship a person solely conversant in english or irish law will not find it so easy to be chosen to fill the scottish delegateship section ii members lords visitants   every member of the house to bring with him into the court of lords delegates every other right but not that of voting—not that right—because to that are attached whatever imperfections the lords judicatory has been charged with by lord hale viz fluctuation of numbers whence general deficiency of numbers especially of minds actually applied to the business alternating with occasional excess—occasional partialities or suspicions of partiality by reason of latent interests—occasional deficiency in point of intellectual aptitude or appropriate learning in the instance of the presiding member or of a more or less considerable proportion of the other voters—want of a sufficiently strong sense of responsibility that guard to probity that security for adequate intelligence a deficiency which so naturally results from the power of contributing by a bare expression of will to the formation of a decree without the obligation of giving reasons so long as it is without the right of voting although a lord were to carry with him to the judicatory all the partialities of a party he would only add one unpaid to the two professional advocates for ages together according to lord hale a multitude of assessors with right of advice only formed a part of the judicatory of the lords house   in the court of lords delegates scotch peers though not having seats in the house to be admitted to the privileges of lords visitants in like manner irish peers and bishops—the design and expectation is that with the aid of so numerous a reinforcement there might be found for subsequent vacancies a sufficient number of persons already invested with the peerage willing to charge themselves with the duties as well as able duly to discharge the functions of the office judicature it is conceived and especially in the particular tribunal here in question would be a still more appropriate preparative than advocateship for judicature in the character of lords visitants with every right but that of voting the members at large of the house of lords together with the scotch and irish nonsitting lords would be what according to lord hale the consilium magnum was formerly in the house of lords—judges as to every right but that of voting the bench of the court being open to them as lords visitants a sufficient number for each kingdom might find adequate inducements for frequent attendance in the mixed and decorously ambiguous characters of inspectors and censors students and future candidates—nay even on occasion if such be their pleasure latent advocates for particular interests—forasmuch as they will not have it in their power to gain support to those interests otherwise than by reason from which no prejudice can ensue to justice among the scotch and irish nonsitting lords such as may have it in contemplation to become candidates for seats in    the house on future vacancies will possess on this bench a theatre on which their qualifications will find much better opportunities of displaying themselves than any that are at present open to them or that could be opened to them by any other means for the chancellorship not to insist on the chiefjusticeships this bench either on the judges side or on the lords visitants side might after due probation time afford at least as suitable a nursery as the bar of a commonlaw court the instances of sir christopher hatton lord shaftesbury and even lord clarendon together with cromwells english judges in scotland may be worth adverting to in this view against inaptitude for want of appropriate learning a free and periodicallyrepeated election an election by that house in which at the same time the crown can never fail of possessing its due influence will surely be at least as good a security as can be afforded by the single probity and discernment of any minister   power to each judge of the court to appoint for his occasional substitute a lord visitant such substitute however not to preside as per §   article   without the consent of all the rest—that in case of indisposition the number of judges may never be incomplete—and that from this faculty lords looking forward to the judgeship may derive an additional opportunity of manifesting as well as acquiring superior aptitude the care of his own reputation will it is conceived prevent the judge from choosing for a substitute any lord other than one whose fitness for the station might upon a vacancy be sufficient to point him out to notice in the judicial establishment of scotland this power of substitution is exemplified to a very considerable extent and though under so much less efficient security against abuse than here with it is supposed sufficiently established and generally recognised advantage section iii decision of the court—its effect   in respect of irreversibility and immutability except in the possible but highly improbable case of misbehaviour on the part of a majority of the four judges of such sort as to call forth censure the judgment of the court of lords delegates to stand on the same footing with that of the house—otherwise it would be no better than an interpolated and additional stage of judicature affording to the time of the house but an inadequate relief and to suitors a grievous additional burthen instead of relief   the court divided and the numbers equal power to the court to call in a lord visitant for the occasion if no one can be thus agreed on each judge to propose one and the house to choose viz as before by ballot but without being restricted as to the person so proposed section iv place of sitting—habiliments—title   place of sitting as near to the house as may be—at any rate under the same roof—that in the public mind the idea of the body delegated may be as closely as possible connected not to say identified with that of the body delegating and that in parliament time whatsoever occasion brings members to the house may have its chance of bringing lords visitants to the judicatory   habiliments such as may serve to combine in the public mind the idea of the judicial function with that of the superior political station and dignity—barons robes for example—higher ones of course if the judge possesses a higher rank in the peerage the judges of the court of exchequer having originally been barons probably of parliament bear though not the robes the title of barons   in an anteroom leading to the bench a lord visitant to invest himself with some easily assumed and redeposited ensign of office such as a short mantle to attest to the public eye his right to the privileges which he may be about to exercise—the distinction being thus sufficiently expressed without the aid of place seats left unoccupied by lords visitants may by sufferance as at one time in the kings bench be occupied by private individuals   each judge if not a peer to bear before his name the title of lord during his delegateship section v duration of the establishment   duration of the establishment temporary of course—as in the case of the grenville act and the middlesex police act in the first place a length of time sufficient upon calculation by means of uninterrupted sittings for the discharge of the existing arrear—to that another fixed length added sufficient for a further trial of the institution as applied to the current influx   at the end of the last fixed length of time the salaries to cease unless the establishment be continued on by parliament but with power to the house to continue the authority beyond the day—lest causes that have been begun before this judicature should remain undecided by it the salaries    unless a day were fixed for their cessation would in their tendency operate as bounties upon delay section vi obligations   oath of office if any not so general as to be nugatory—the use of official oaths is in case of misconduct to expose to loss of reputation him who by deficiency of legal evidence or by difficulties standing in the way of prosecution is exempt from legal censure to which purpose the collection made of the modifications of misconduct should be as ample and the description given of them as particular and pointed as possible the bad effect is by sham security to engage unwarranted confidence in demonstration a bridle in effect a cloak   a lord delegate if a member of the house not to speak or vote in the house or give proxies during his delegateship—lest of the time purchased for judicature any part be diverted to politics—lest the politician corrupt or be suspected of corrupting the judge—and lest the fear of their leaving their seats in the court vacant while engaged in the house should exclude members from being the objects of choice general observations the option is be it observed not between this plan and doing nothing for either the house will abdicate its appellate judicature having first converted it into a manufactory of vendible delay or something will be done but between this plan and some other of this plan the first object was that as little change should be made as possible the next that whatsoever change were made should be for the better the admission of the nonsitting scotch and irish lords to the privileges of lords visitants episodical as it may appear in form is in substance not a change but a preservative against change the main object was to give the best chance possible for continuing the function in the aristocratical hands in which it has all along and though not altogether without inconvenience yet without any inconvenience on the score of aristocracy been lodged continuing it viz so far as could be done without establishing that indefeasible monopoly which in the eyes of the public might be apt to appear preclusive of scientific aptitude the advantages given by the plan to these unchosen peers are therefore given to them not as against their more fortunate fellows in the peerage but as against commoners necessity—and that at the outset more especially a very hard and galling necessity—excluded them on the occasion of the respective unions from by far the most valuable portion of their hereditary privileges to the proposed share in the supreme judicial function this necessity has under the proposed plan no application admitting them to it was therefore rather continuing what might be continued to them of their ancient privileges than investing them with new ones    as to the ulterior and unlimited door left open for the admission of commoners viz of such persons in whose instance presumptive evidence of preeminent aptitude for this supreme judicial station may have been afforded by ability displayed in a subordinate rank of judicature or in a course of professional practice—were the right of election in any other hands than those of the lords themselves such an admission would indeed be a most serious invasion of their privileges but that right being in their hands and theirs alone the consequence is that by the enlargement of the field of choice the power of the house so far from being trenched upon would be enlarged to render the mind of the body deputed a faithful representative of the mind of the body deputing it is not necessary that the members of the one should be members of the other doing the will of the king the kings delegates are not kings—to do the will of the lords it is as little necessary howsoever on other accounts desirable that the lords delegates should be lords want of physical power adequate to the dispatch of a mass of business within the space of time within which to be done effectually it was necessary it should be done—want of time in a word was the infirmity for such it is by which kings were gradually compelled to commit the judicial part of their authority to other hands unless lords in england are exempt from those infirmities which are the inevitable lot of human nature and under which there as well as elsewhere kings have bowed it need not be matter of much regret to them to submit thus late to a necessity which for so many ages past has been submitted to by kings the innovation let it be considered if such it must be called is not of the number of those which are so apt to be called for by rival ambition but of those which are forced on by the irresistible hand of the universal and indefatigable innovator time various arrangements which in the planning of the proposed judicatory presented themselves to the proposer as highly conducive not to say necessary to the object of it are for the present omitted as not being applicable to this alone to the exclusion of other judicatories by the consideration bestowed for the purpose of the present proposal on the judicial function of the house of lords reference being all along made to the several ends of justice of which an exact list has been endeavoured to be made out the inquiry was suggested whether in the exercise habitually given to that function it has been really coextensive with what it seems to have been generally regarded as tantamount to viz the function of general superintendence meaning thereby the habit of applying to such of the several evils correspondent and opposite to the several ends of justice all such remedies as in the nature of the case are capable of being applied to them without the exercise of legislative power compared with this standard the authority of the house as at present exercised was found to be deficient and to a greater extent than could readily have been imagined the physical power of the house as dependent on the quantity of applicable time having already sunk under the load of business imposed on it by that part of the function of general superintendence which has been habitually exercised by it till of late years is of course still more decidedly unequal to any ulterior burthen but of this demand a part of which has thus been found to overdraw the quantity of time capable of being appropriated to the discharge of it by the house itself the whole might find an adequate supply in the more ample quantity capable of being allotted to it by the proposed court of lords delegates—a tribunal clear of all other business and sitting on such terms as would render the whole of its official time applicable to the one purpose the mass of remuneration which on other accounts would it is supposed be deemed necessary to be allotted to the members of a tribunal so armed with power and so exalted in dignity would be sufficient to entitle the public to call upon them in return for a degree of assiduity not inferior to that which is seen to be habitual on the part of other judges and the greater in extent and value the service thus rendered the more secure would be the requisite disposition on the part of the public at large as well as of the coordinate authorities to submit without regret to the burthen that would be to be imposed by the requisite expense a view of the particulars in respect of which the judicial function as exercised by the house of lords fails of being coextensive with the function of general superintendence in the extent above indicated as belonging to it has been already taken but under the apprehension of awakening those jealousies which are so easily awakened or of overloading that patience which is so easily overloaded this part of the plan is for the present at least put aside what on this occasion ought never to be out of mind is that as to whatever regards the superintending authority of the house of lords in matters of judicature the existing practice whatsoever may be its effects was in its origin the mere fortuitous result of a contest for power between two coordinate authorities—the result of anything rather than a calm and comprehensive and constitutionallyconcerted  0 plan directed to the ends of justice this want of design and consequently of congruity is no more than might have been anticipated by a reflection on the natural course of human affairs and it may be seen most satisfactorily demonstrated as well as clearly displayed in the instructive and interesting preface prefixed by mr hargrave to his edition of the work of lord hale on the jurisdiction of the house of lords other expedients have fallen under the notice of the proposer as having been in contemplation—an ordinary committee to begin to sit or to continue to sit during the recess—an appellate judicatory to sit in london but to confine itself to scotch causes c c but regarding them as having already been found to stand excluded by one or other of two bars viz impractivability or inexpediency he gladly discards the consideration of them out of a paper in which the space necessary for any such discussions could not have been found he had even set his mind upon an inquiry into the fund of possible expedients capable of being directed to the same end on which occasion distribution governed by principles adapted to the nature of the case or even by lot a mode of selection less objectionable in reality than appearance and even preferable to the modes of blind exclusion hitherto pursued did not pass unnoticed but nothing having thus presented itself to his conception as promising to be suitable to the end in view in a degree approaching to that of the plan here submitted he suppresses without reluctance everything that had come into notice under that head as to the present plan even to those exclusively competent judges whose approbation it may not be fortunate enough to be honoured with it may it is humbly hoped be not altogether without its use good or bad an anterior plan by breaking as it were the ice of the subject is to the framer of any succeeding plan commonly found more or less of use as an object of comparison and reference and as to the observations submitted in support of it where in the character of reasons they fail of producing the effect endeavoured at in the character of sources of error to be guarded against they may still be not altogether without their use if in this or any other way the present plan should contribute to the production of any other which issuing from some more competent source should at the same time be less open to the charge of unconstitutional innovation and more highly conducive to the ends of justice the labour here expended will have received in the establishment of such better plan its sufficient reward issuing from high station the stronger the recommendation a plan of any kind derives from the height of the station the less it is commonly found to stand in need of any other in one respect therefore the present plan possesses an indisputable advantage over any other that is at all likely to come in competition with it presented under a name altogether unknown and without any authority or consideration in the state if it were to find acceptance it could do so on no other ground than that of its supposed conduciveness to the object in view to the work at large if published is intended to be added an examination that has been made of the plan proposed by lord hale for an ultimatelyappellate judicatory to be substituted to that of the house of lords—substituted wantonly one might almost say and when no such necessity had as yet presented itself as that which at present presses upon the house in the way of illustration and as serving by enlarging the view given of the field of argument to afford the more ample satisfaction to a contemplative and cautious mind the discussion it is supposed may be found not altogether unacceptable as presenting any the least chance of being preferred in practice either to the plan here submitted or to any other the plan of lord hale notwithstanding the high reputation of its author will scarcely be found worth notice for in the character of an innovation on the constitution it was no less violent than with reference to the ends of justice it may be seen to be unsubservient and unfavourable jeremy bentham queensquare place westminster  0th january   0     the elements of the art of packing as applied to special juries particularly in cases of libel law by jeremy bentham esq bencher of lincolns inn first published in         advertisement to the first edition this work was printed many years ago circumstances prevented its being at that time exposed to sale in regard to the author all that need be said is—that it was not by him that it was then kept back and that it is not by him or at his instance that it is now put forth if on either accounts it were desirable that the causes of its being thus long withheld should be brought to view those causes would afford a striking illustration of the baneful influence of the principles and practices it is employed in unveiling and presenting in their true colours    part i chapter i occasion of this work §   work on libel law commenced—occasion of it what gave rise to this work is neither more nor less than a newspaper article—an article in the times for the  0th of february   0  and which so far as it belongs to the present purpose and consists of statements concerning matters of fact is in these words— speaking of a clamour against what is called the licentiousness of the press the article goes on and says—such has been the dread inspired by this clamour     that of the persons now under prosecution two have actually pleaded guilty to informations for wilfully and maliciously slandering the british army who never till many days after their publication saw or heard of the libel with which they were charged       the grand fountain of all this mischief it continues seems to be major hogans pamphlet      for this very work there are now or recently have been we believe six and twenty printers and publishers under prosecution it was only from one of these that the original pamphlet sprung the rest did no more than extract from or recommend it and that upon the attested character of its author who was no sooner known to have fled from his charge than every one of them retracted his praise of the work and was willing to maintain that the duke of yorks character stood as fair as if this individual arraignment of it had not been published yet is this so far from having produced a disposition to recede from punishing them that though the informations were all of them filed last term and might have been tried during the present the objects of them are without any assigned cause to be kept in a harassing state of suspense over the present to the term ensuing and what is the origin of these mens offences an error common to them with the prosecutor—a belief in the respectability of major hogans character which was attested by no fewer or less men than generals fox floyd whyte dundas macdonald hall hay tilson and hamilton can there be a stronger palliation of error than that the person erring should have been misled by a man of such reputation as the above more especially when it is considered that the duke of york was himself as much deceived as any one else by these testimonies in favour of major hogan his royal highness on the strength of them believed him to be deserving of rank and elevation in the army and therefore noted him for promotion others on the very same authority supposed only that he might be entitled to common credit and are therefore notwithstanding all their renunciations of that opinion noted for prosecution  thus far the newspaper facts in their nature so notorious seemed not likely to have been either invented or so much as materially misrepresented i looked out for contradiction or correction but could hear of none whatever i could learn went in confirmation of the statements given as above on the subject of libel law my general conception had been of some thirty or forty years standing for example that in point of actual law a libel is any paper in which he who to the will adds the power of punishing for it sees anything that he does not like and in point of public utility that it was neither necessary nor fitting that any part of the rule of action much less so important a one should be lying in any such wild and barbarous state such on this subject became my opinion almost as early as on the subject of any part of the law i could take upon me to have any but those opinions would scarcely have found any expression in public at least and in any considerable detail but for the incident above mentioned seeing thus that under the mask of a temporary occurrence a battery had been opened by the enemies of the constitution upon the liberty of the press—that a fire of grape shot had already been commenced and no fewer than sixandtwenty persons wounded by it at one discharge—i felt myself urged by an irresistible impulse to summon up whatever strength i might have left and howsoever impotent my own feeble efforts might prove and at whatever personal hazard to show the way at least how this battery might be spiked      libel law as it stands or rather as it floats is incompatible with english liberties   to destroy them utterly and reduce the government to a despotism it requires nothing but to be consistently and completely executed   in this state it must remain until either the constitution is so destroyed or by authority of the legislature certain arrangements are made the basis of which will be a definition in form of the sort of thing called a libel or something that shall be equivalent to it   in a fixation of this sort though there is some difficulty there is no natural impossibility   it is from the hand of parliament alone that this crying evil can receive a radical cure   but in the intelligence and fortitude of a jury it may in each instance receive a momentary palliative   things being on this footing in the case of a political libel and to fix conception in the case of a libel for which mr cobbett was convicted and mr justice johnson suffered had i been upon the jury i should not have regarded it as consistent with my oath and duty to join in a verdict of guilty   applying to this use the power which under the law of primeval barbarism any one determined juryman has of subduing the eleven others i should have taken care that no such verdict should be found   by a few successive exertions of such fortitude not only momentary and partial relief against particular oppression would be afforded in each particular instance—  0 but by a gentle and truly constitutional pressure measures of complete and permanent relief might as from the unjust judge in the parable be extorted from the legislature such were the opinions in support of which i was preparing to submit to the public the considerations by which they had been produced when by another incident this design though it received a confirmation and that no slight one received at the same time a collateral turn and as to this part of it a temporary stoppage §   that work why postponed to this jurymen—special jurymen—are the persons you propose to address but whatever you had to say it being to this effect is there any the least chance that they would listen to you the men whom under the name of jurymen special jurymen you would on any such occasion have to deal with—are they in fact what they are said to be and in general supposed to be on any occasion such as that in question are they really free to follow the dictates of their own judgment can you see any the smallest probability of their doing so such were the questions suggested to me by the publication of the late sheriff sir richard phillips—a document which though it had been for some time in circulation had not till a considerable progress had been made in my own abovementioned work happened to fall into my hands such were the questions and to my unspeakable astonishment no sooner were they formed than they received each of them to my apprehension a decided negative in common with the generality of my countrymen no particular incident having ever happened to point my attention to the subject i had been used to annex in my mind to the word jury the idea of a momentarily assembled body of men composed of members determined by lot or if by a nomination a nomination not differing in effect from determination by lot—the nomination performed afresh for the purpose of each cause the list of the members of which the body was composed in each cause changing perpetually as between cause and cause in this particular i had indeed understood the term special jury to be expressive of some difference but a difference by means of which the advantage attached to a fortuitous assemblage being preserved further advantage resulting from a sort of reciprocal choice as between party and party had by the matured sagacity of modern times been superadded in common with such others of my countrymen whose education has conducted them through the ordinary paths of history i had read of a species of judicial abuse which under the name of packing had on this or that occasion broken out in former times and in particular in the profligate and arbitrary reigns of the two last stuarts my astonishment has not oftentimes been greater than it became when upon looking into the book for which as above the public is indebted to the late shrievalty of sir richard phillips i found that this practice called packing a word which when thus applied had never presented itself to my mind but in the character of the denomination of a state crime—nor that exemplified but rarely and under a disastrous state of things long since past—had been moulded into a system had become an established practice—a sort of practice which by the quality of the practitioners has as shipmoney had once acquired the force of law and that in that character it had found in the person of the chief judge of one of the three great commonlaw courts not only an agent perhaps an author to avow it but moreover a champion to defend it for some time i could scarce give credit to my own eyes am i indeed awake—is not this a dream—what century is this—can it be the   th—is it not the   th—who    reigns now—can it be a brunswick—is it not a stuart king come according to the prophetic and once loyal hymn come to his own again it is but too true under the name of a jury—under the name even of that supposed improved species of jury a special jury—we have in fact avowedly in that court in which most use is made of special juries and at pleasure in the only other judicatory in the corruption of which the servants of the crown and their adherents can as such have any special interest—a standing body of assessors instruments tenanted in common by the leading members of administration by the judges and by the other crownlawyers—troops enlisted trained and paid by the crownlawyers—liable to be cashiered each of them at any time and without a word of explanation each of them at the instance of any of the above indefinite multitude of inspectors as well as by the hand of the recruiting officer who enlisted them and they know not who besides—tools in effect of the very power to which in pretence and appearance they are a check great would be the error if it were supposed that so far as concerns the security afforded by juries the higher criminal cases excepted we are under this special jury system no worse off than our ancestors were in the time of the two last stuarts package of juries was in those times no more than an effort of casual violence and passion losing more by the general irritation it produced than by the particular advantage of the moment it could gain it is now as will be seen become a regular a quietly established and quietly suffered system not only is the yoke already about our necks but our necks are already fashioned to it as to the title of this work elements of the art of packing it is not a mere jest in the bringing of the system to its present state no small degree of ingenuity it will be seen has been expended nor to the present purpose could the true nature of it have been sufficiently displayed without considerable labour—in short without a pretty ample course of development—applied to its objects its effects its motives and its means in bringing into view this sinister species of art the object of these pages is—to do what may be found capable of being done by an obscure individual towards putting an end to the exercise of it and the more thoroughly the processes employed in it are brought to light the more imperious will the considerations be seen to be which call for the abolition of it by the abolition of special juries if complete and in point of local range rendered coextensive with the whole kingdom a sort of gap might appear to be left in the system of jury trial on what principles this gap may be most advantageously filled up will be matter of inquiry at the conclusion of the work chapter ii juries—their use as a check to judges of the functions exercised by the body of unlearned assessors termed jurors or jurymen the original intention as well as experienced use seems to be universally agreed as well as understood to be—the serving as a check upon the power of the learned and experienced judge or judges under whose direction or guidance at least they have to act in name the decision pronounced in each cause—that decision at least to which the name of verdict is given and in which not only the question of fact is decided upon but a decision on the question of law except in the particular case of a special verdict is involved is ascribed to them as if it were theirs alone but besides the power of sending the cause to a new trial before another jury the effect of the power exercised by the professional judges is upon the whole so great the verdict having in no instance any effect until it be followed by a corresponding decision distinguished by the name of the judgment the formation of which depends altogether on the professional part of the compound judicatory—that a conception nearer to the truth will be formed by considering the main or principal power as in the hands of the judge that of the jury serving as a check to his power than by considering the principal power in the hands of the jury that of the judge serving as a check to theirs that of the unlearned body so designed to operate as a check the members ought so far as concerns the exercise of the functions belonging to their body to be in a state of independence—of independence as perfect as possible—is a proposition included in the very denomination of a check to deny the truth of it is to utter a contradiction in terms to say that there ought not to be any such independence is the same thing as to say that there ought not to be any such check in appearance this sort of independence is in modern practice everywhere in every part of the field of jurytrial actually preserved that which on the occasion of each trial the judge or judges who constitute the professional part of the mixt judicatory have power—say for shortness the judge has power—to do is to compel the nonprofessional part the jury to pronounce a decision termed its verdict that which he has not the power to do is to determine what that verdict shall be great however as is the power of the judge in every case over the ultimate result of the cause yet so far as concerns the    decision pronounced or supposed to be pronounced by the jury it applies more directly and certainly to the prevention of a verdict contrary to his wishes than to the obtaining at their hands a verdict conformable to his wishes when therefore in pursuance of a sinister interest in whatsoever bosom it may have happened to it to originate—his own for example that of the king or that of any servant of the kings in any other department of the state it has come to be an object with a judge to obtain at the hands of a jury a verdict in any way contrary to justice a necessary endeavour has been to obtain a jury so composed as that the verdict pronounced by them may be depended upon as about to be conformable to his wishes to give in a word to the judgment which he has it in his wish and intention to pronounce the appearance of being the proper and necessary result of an antecedent decision which under the appropriate name of a verdict the jury have by the mouth of their foreman pronounced or at least been considered as having pronounced if in consequence of any sinister influence exercised over their faculties by the judge a verdict different from what would otherwise have been pronounced by them has been pronounced that influence will have assumed a very different character and have been produced by causes of a very different description according as it is to the understanding or the will that in each bosom it has applied itself to the understanding of a juryman as of any other man though influences which being unfavourable to justice may be termed sinister are liable to apply themselves from other quarters yet so far as it has happened to any such influence to have been applied by any act of the judge it is only by his understanding—by the application of his relatively stronger understanding to their relatively weaker understandings that it can have been applied in a word it can only have been the influence of understanding on or over understanding when it is to the will of the juryman that any sinister influence acting in a sinister direction has been applied by the judge it is by the will of the judge that it has been applied it has been the influence of will on or over will in so far as the prescriptions of duty the dictates of probity are taken by the juryman for the rule of his conduct no other will is by his will suffered to exercise any influence on it his will takes for its guidance the dictates of understanding purely of his own understanding if it feels itself strong enough if not of some other understanding on the relative strength of which relation being had to the question in hand its reliance is more assured to the dictates therefore of any other will the will of a juryman as of any other judge the lawfully declared will of some lawful superior alone excepted for which in the case of the juryman there is no place cannot so much as listen but at the expense of probity from whatsoever source it happens to it to flow—whether from the will of the judge or any other will—the influence or as in this case it is styled the temptation to the assaults of which the probity of the individual in the present case the juryman stands exposed will apply itself in one or other of two shapes in the shape of evil viz illapplied punishment working by intimidation in the shape of good viz illapplied reward working by corruption against these two opposite dangers provision was made in the principles which presided over the original organization and mode of procedure that took place in the case of these singularlyconstituted judicatories or rather component parts of judicatories against undue intimidation they received for their protection in the first place exemption from any infliction which avowedly and under the name of punishment might otherwise have been applied to any of them    separately by the arbitrary power of the judge in the next place being that without which the other would have been of little value the veil of secresy to preserve to them during their conferences the faculty and to render it more effectual the obligation of keeping themselves during their conferences out of the reach of his observation and not of his only but of that of all other men and especially all other men in power in whose enmity they might be apt to behold a source of danger against corruption the principle employed was that of continual change no person being continued in the exercise of that function for any length of time that so neither the seductive artifices of the judge their natural tempter who in their power had before his eyes a force constantly antagonizing with his own might have time to mould into undue obsequiousness the weakness of their minds nor the casual tempter—the party who in the event of his obtaining anywhere a sufficiently steady view of a future juryman against whose probity his operations might be directed with a sufficient prospect of success might find himself disposed to apply the opportunity to any such sinister use chapter iii the check how done away by influence §   checks are ever odious to all persons checked to the welfare of the governed—of men considered as men subject to power—it is highly conducive at least if not as under the british and other mixed or limited governments men are apt to say altogether necessary that in whatsoever hands power be lodged checks to it in some shape or other should throughout the whole field of its exercise be applying themselves and upon the supposition that the good which in the shape of security against misrule is thus produced by the check is not exceeded by the evil produced by the defalcation made by it from the quantity of power necessary to enable the holder of the power to render in the highest degree of perfection the service expected at his hands the utility of the check will hardly find any person to dispute it but whatsoever be their utility relation being had to the interests of the people considered as subject to power to the hands by which the power is holden the sensation produced by anything which acts upon them in the character of a check never has been nor ever can be otherwise than unpleasant how it happened that in england the operations of the kings ever dependent instruments the official judges not to speak of the equally dependent instruments of his imperfectly subjected subordinates the great barons found themselves in the infancy of the constitution incumbered and to so great an extent by the presence and interference of a determinate number of unofficial assessors still more ignorant than themselves while in the other part of the same island the incumbrance was confined to the criminal division of the field of law and even there to the upper parts of the ground and while on the continent either no such incumbrance was ever known or was at a very early period got rid of these are among those points of legal history the obscurity of which seems to have given them up beyond redemption to the arbitrary dominion of conjecture thus much however appears with tolerable distinctness viz that over a great part if not the whole of that field over which the jurisdiction of a limited and even fixt number of assessors under the denomination of jurymen petty jurymen extends itself the sort of function now exercised by them was exercised by an unlimited and usually much larger number of the inhabitants of the district in question under the name of freeholders by which denomination were distinguished the whole of that comparatively small number of persons whose interests according to the notions moral and legal of that time had any claim to notice and that of this larger and imperfectly determinate body the part now called a jury was a sort of select committee gradually and by general consent the result of general convenience substituted to the ever fluctuating and unwieldy whole but though in one shape or other the incumbrance has from the earliest days of the existing constitution been clinging to the shoulders of the official judge yet in whatsoever shape it clung it could not have been otherwise than a troublesome one to the free exercise of his power the obstruction given by it is sufficiently obvious for so often and in such proportion as he found it necessary to give effect to a will on their part which howsoever expressed differed ultimately from his own wishes so often and in the same proportion was his power converted into impotence supposing even his will to have been in every instance ultimately and completely prevalent and not withstanding the incumbrance his power thus far unimpaired even thus on comparing his situation with that of a judge the freedom of whose actions is unrestrained by any such incumbrance it will be manifest enough that though his power were ever so entire one effect inseparably attached to the nature of this incumbrance is—to afford in  0 one way or other perpetual disturbance to his ease all their desire is to shape their wills to his and for that purpose to know what it is be it so yet to this purpose it may be necessary for him to make them know what it is and simple as it may be to impress into their minds this article of knowledge will every now and then require on his part one of those operations which cannot always be performed without more or less disturbance to the operators ease on the other hand suppose on their parts any reluctance towards the adoption of his will argument in some shape or other would on his part be necessary to the surmounting of that reluctance and so much argument so much time and trouble consumed so much disturbance given to his ease let there even be no reluctance opposed to his will yet if in their conceptions there should be any difficulty in comprehending it still to the removing or endeavouring to remove any such difficulty explanation in some shape or other would be necessary more consumption of time and trouble more disturbance given to ease but to a man in power it neither then was nor to this time is no nor ever will be natural to submit readily to any such limitation to his power as he can commodiously get rid of it neither then was now is nor ever will be natural to him to suffer his own ease to remain exposed to any disturbance from which he can conveniently keep it clear to keep it to a certain degree habitually clear of disturbance may from time to time cost him more and more labour giving to his ease more and more disturbance but be his expectations of neat profit in that valuable shape verified or not by the event his exertions will not the less truly have had for their motive the love of ease on both these accounts therefore and in whichever of the two shapes he found the weight of this body of assessors pressing upon him the endeavours of the judge to shake off or lighten the incumbrance cannot but have been coeval with its existence in the character of a sinister motive becoming in the bosom of the judge an efficient cause of injustice the love of ease seems hitherto to have almost escaped notice but it has not been the less efficient and of its efficiency exemplification but too extensive will meet us as we advance §   judges defences against checks—corruption and deception henceforward let us suppose the use of juries firmly established and of the part originally acted by the promiscuous assembly to which this select committee succeeded all distinct remembrance as well as desire obliterated obliterated by this primæval grenville act of which the record is no where to be found for securing on the part of this select body of assessors whose office was to keep a check upon his will a subservience as constant and prompt as possible to that will thereby impairing as far as possible the use and efficacy of that check three possible instruments as above brought to view were afforded by the nature of the case viz intimidation corruption and deception for such is the name that may with propriety be given to the influence of understanding over understanding as often and in proportion as the exercise of it is recognised as operating to the prejudice of justice as to intimidation in the character of an instrument of influence applicable to the purpose here in question it must from the very first have been too plainly incompatible with the acknowledged constitution of this compound judicatory and too insupportable to the feelings of the people to be in anything like constant or even frequent use of punishment applied to this sinister purpose by the sole power of the judge in the shape of pecuniary fine for instance examples seem to have been not altogether wanting but forasmuch as such a practice could not have been permanently established without the utter destruction of the power of juries the existence of that power is a sufficient proof that of that suffering though applied under the name of punishment and by judicial hands the infliction could never have been considered in any other light than that of a casual act committed under the spur of extraordinary irritation by illegal violence†    corruption the work of will operating upon will and deception operating by the influence of understanding over understanding were therefore the only instruments affording any promise of being regularly and steadily applicable to this sinister service viz the securing of undue obsequiousness on the part of juries §   corruption—modes of applying it in regard to corruption the standing problem was and is so to order matters that on each given occasion in which it may happen to the judge to take on any account an interest in the verdict of the jury it shall depend upon his will with the surest effect and with the least trouble possible to mould it to his own desire to this purpose on the occasion of each verdict the concurrence of two circumstances was and is necessary—  that in the event of their finding themselves in the situation requisite viz that of inhabitants of a jurybox there should exist a sufficient number of persons disposed no matter by what causes to manifest the sort of obsequiousness requisite   that matters should so have been ordered that in that requisite situation the persons so disposed should in each instance be to be found there are two courses or orders of proceeding in either of which this supposed unjust but supposed desired result is capable of being produced—  finding out persons in whose instance the requisite disposition is already formed and thereupon placing them in the situation requisite   going to work with a set of persons already stationed in the situation requisite and to the persons so situated giving the disposition requisite the first of these two courses is that which having been invented in the time of our ancestors in a somewhat distant age has from them received the name of packing—a name which from the application at that time but too frequently made of the practice and thence habitually apprehended from it has acquired a dyslogistic tinge serving at present to express not merely the practice itself but the sentiment of disapprobation excited by the idea of it and thus by the principle of association attached to it of the two courses this ancient one is evidently by far the most simple in the other may be seen an example of a degree of refinement reserved for modern times—a number of persons whose dispositions in regard to the subject in question are as yet unformed or unknown being collected—required to generate in their breasts the disposition requisite such is the problem the solution of which was necessary to the pursuing of this second of the two courses and with what success it has been accomplished will ere long it is supposed be not indistinctly visible for this purpose the following process stands alike approved by theory and experience— into the situation in question it being a situation conferring power—legal power cause to be placed the number of persons requisite they being provided with the requisite legal qualifications—you possessing in your hands to a certain extent the faculty of influencing their interest or welfare that is producing in their respective bosoms the sensation of pain or pleasure or the eventual absence of either—and no preponderant force acting on the same bosoms in an opposite direction these things being done the exercise of that power is thereafter at your command and this whatsoever be the name given to the act of power so exercised—such as verdict judgment decree sentence vote resolution statute law in the science of psychological or moral dynamics of which political is one branch the above proposition though never yet perhaps reduced to any scientific form of words may be stated as a fundamental axiom and among public men under whatsoever degree of incapacity labouring in other respects no man was ever yet found to any such degree weak and incapable as not to be sufficiently sensible of the truth of it a man may receive his ten twenty thirty any number of thousand pounds ayear on pretence of his occupying a writing clerks place and this without being any more able than he is willing to do the duties of that place—and yet be no less fully and adequately impressed with the truth of the above proposition longwinded as it is than bacon was and accordingly not only act but get up and speak according to his mode of speaking in exact conformity and consequence the orator without parade or pedantic display of hardworded    science acting psychological dynamics all the while and to no less perfection nor if told of it less perhaps to his surprise than monsieur jourdan when upon being thereof informed by his preceptor he found himself talking prose for effecting the solution in question by the application of the above axiom or rule the simplest and most elegant of all modes which hath as yet been invented—perhaps it may be added which the science itself admits of—is—that which you are enabled to put in practice when the functions attached to the situation being by a mass composed of the matter of wealth or other objects of desire instruments or efficient cause of pleasure of any sort at command according to each mans taste worked up into a compound of an agreeable flavour the continuance of the person in question in the situation which enables him to feed upon it has been made dependent on your will so long as he continues in the situation with such his allowance in his hand he will continue to feed upon it in his heart—if not with thanksgiving for having been put into the situation—at any rate what is most to the purpose with fear of being put out of it in the event of his comporting himself otherwise than as expected suppose for example the situation of a juryman thus at the same time dulcified and saving dismissal fixed the power of dismissal howsoever disguised and the more effectually disguised the better being at the same time in your hands upon the very face of this statement it is evident that barring the accident of opposite and preponderant force as above mentioned the verdict of the jury so far as depends upon that juryman is altogether at your command in this mode of solution a necessary step we see is the placing the person in question in a situation in which he is exposed to the action of the efficient cause of influence viz the matter the ever pliant and ductile matter which in your plastic hands becomes the matter of reward or the matter of punishment according as he behaves himself but to the situation as above described permanence is necessary and this—partly because without a certain degree of permanence the situation would not possess sufficient value nor consequently the fear of losing it act on his mind in the character of an efficient cause of influence with a sufficient degree of force partly because the correspondent disposition—viz a disposition duly prepared to yield to the influence—the obsequiousness in a word—may not always be capable of being produced in an instant as in the case of casting or stamping but may now and then require some length of time for the production of it as in the case of modelling or sculpture here then we see the difference between the ancient and the modern contrivance for nullifying checks and producing acceptable verdicts in the ancient mode it was necessary that in the instance of each juryman the disposition to obsequiousness should be ready formed on the other hand wherever this condition could be and was fulfilled the business was the work but of an instant nor was any application of influence necessary to the accomplishment of it in the modern mode it is not necessary that the disposition to obsequiousness should in the first instance be already as in the ancient mode completely formed nor even that at that period it should in any degree have existence but what is necessary is on the part of the situation in question a considerable degree of permanence understand always eventual and defeasible permanence the two modes stand thus distinguished by the two different principles on which their efficiency respectively depend—the ancient mode by the principle of choice—of selection—or to call it by its established and proper name the principle of package—simple package—package toties quoties and without need of permanence—the modern mode by the principle of permanence—thence package once for all and with the benefit of permanence in the last preceding chapter mention was made of the principle of mutation or continual change of persons as one of the expedients employed in the original constitution of juries for enabling them to act with effect in the character in which they were destined to act viz that of a check upon the power of the judge and in that view for securing them against any sinister influence by which the efficiency of the check so to be applied might come to be impaired the principle there mentioned under the name of the principle of permanence consists exactly we see in the absence or removal of that tutelary and fundamental principle the principle of permanence being thus palpably opposite to one of the essential and acknowldged principles of jury trial to have established it directly and avowedly would have been plainly impracticable for each court for instance a determinate number of jurymen consisting of the number twelve necessary to compose a jury with or without a few supernumeraries added for provision against accidents—to each juryman his situation whether by salary or fees rendered    a desirable one—he at the same time pronounced removeable—avowedly removeable—at the pleasure of the judge or some other dependent of the crown—on any such plan even in the most uninformed and incurious age the continuing to the institution the name of jury would scarcely have sufficed to reconcile men to an arrangement so palpably perverse—thus destructive of its manifest and manifestly intended nature when a determination to subvert as far as it might be found practicable and convenient this part of the constitution had been taken whatsoever were the contrivance employed it was seen to be altogether necessary there should be some disguise or other put upon it the business was neither to be attempted openly nor all at once four distinguishable conditions were seen to be necessary—  power of nomination virtually in the hands of the judge   emolument sufficient in magnitude and thence in ordinary duration to render the situation an agreeable one and thence the loss of it an object of apprehension   power of amotion viz of removing a man from that situation also virtually in the hands of the judge   in each case the design so enveloped as not to be seen through all these points were accordingly accomplished one point more required to be attended to to have attempted to apply any such plan of deceit to all cases and all at once would have been incompatible with the success of it—for the effect being produced in every instance the efficient principles would have burst through the disguise applied to all cases in which it was likely that the judge or any of the servants of the crown his confederates would have any special interest it would be sufficient to their purpose to the object thus limited the plan was accordingly confined and thus far it has been accordingly found to be but too practicable to carry the design into effect and without prejudice to the disguise of all these several desiderata the accomplishment will now be brought to view as having been effected in and by the constitution of the sort of body termed a special jury but for the purpose of this exhibition a separate chapter will be requisite compared with that mode in which the principle employed is no other than that of simple package nobody it is supposed can be at a loss to see how prodigious the advantage is which is gained by calling in the principle of permanence in the way of simple package extempore package everything requires to be done afresh each time each time you have to hunt out for your men and whereabouts are you if so it be that at the moment none that will suit you are to be found apply the principle of permanence there they are—your men—always at hand and the longer you have had them where they are the surer of them on each occasion you may be juries packed in the old mode are like woodpigeons for which the woods must be hunted ere they be in a state of requisition for the cook or like those wild horses which a spanish creole has to scamper after in the plains ere he is in readiness to take his ride juries packed in what will be seen to be the new mode packed with the advantage of the principle of permanence are like pigeons taken out of a dovehouse or like those wellbroken geldings which an englishman keeps in his stable in juries in a word permanence is exactly what it is in armies it is the work of the same policy in both cases it was when as yet there were no standing armies that the coarse and precarious operation of extempore package packing without the aid of permanence was employed in the case of juries as our armies acquired their stability so did our juries and now that under the pressure of national necessity our armies strengthened by that principle have swelled to so unexampled a magnitude now it is as will be seen that without any such necessity without any other more cogent cause than convenience numbers in juries not being susceptible of increase this part of the establishment has received its improvement and that to the degree of perfection that will be seen in the shape of permanence say permanence but never without remembering the increased facilities it affords for package convenience and nothing more but what more was needful for it was the convenience as we shall see of great characters in those high situations in which in the convenience of the individual there is apt to be more of cogency than in the necessity of nations at the outset packing having been practised when as yet there was in juries no such thing as permanence the principle of package came unavoidably to be spoken of antecedently and thus far in contradistinction to the principle of permanence but now at this stage of the inquiry it will be sufficiently apparent it is hoped that of these two principles one is included in the other and that by the principle of permanence as applied to juries is to be understood permanence and package together package with the benefit of permanence and permanence for the purpose of package §   deception—modes of applying it—instruments for the application of it corruption being the instrument principally employed on the occasion which gave rise to    this little treatise deception an instrument not more in use on this occasion than on any other and the part here played by it no more than a subordinate one—a very slight mention of it will be sufficient here not that the mention of it will even here be altogether out of place corruption having among its effects that of disposing a man not only to deceive others but moreover in the first place and for the better quieting of his own conscience to deceive himself on the present occasion so far as deception is concerned the problem stands thus—in cases where if the conception entertained of the case by the jury were adequate viz complete and correct their will as declared by their verdict would be more or less apt to run counter to the will of the judge so to order matters as that by means of some want of completeness or correctness viz on the part of the conception entertained by them of that case it may happen to their will to coincide with that of the judge there are two ways in either of which an effect thus desirable may be brought about one is by causing them to have a will and that will exactly the same with that of the judge the other is by causing them not to have a will viz of their own forming of which state of mind the necessary consequence will be their adopting without more ado whatsoever will may come to be presented to them for that purpose by the judge of these two modes this latter mode is by far the most advantageous one to the success of the former the creative or special it is necessary that fresh labour should be bestowed upon the subject on the occasion of every cause by the other the preventive or general mode the business is done once for all and without any fresh expense in the article of labour a perpetually renewed harvest of success is reaped on the occasion of each individual cause in the one case the business is carried on in the retail in the other in the wholesale line in the case of corruption the will of the party corrupted—here the jury—being formed by the will of the party by whom or for whose benefit the matter of corruption is applied the state of the intellectual faculty is immaterial nor is any sort of debility in it necessary to the production of the effect here supposed to be desired but where in a question of fact or law a will of his own is to be formed by a man who having no natural interest at all in the business has no interest at all in it unless by means of corruption he has a factitious one he cannot have a will other than one to the formation of which the use of the understanding is necessary and thus it is that if so it be that his own understanding is not with relation to the matter in hand in a state fit for use that is capable of being applied to use he is not only content but glad to borrow one of the judge whose care it is that under the cover of an act of the understanding a will of his own more or less nicely folded up shall be inclosed by the understanding of a person placed in the situation of judge an influence will of course be exercised over the understanding of every person standing in any such situation as that of juryman and this influence being on all occasions applicable to all purposes good and bad is thereby applicable to all bad ones on this occasion the part which is open for deception to act is the giving to this influence a degree of strength beyond what properly belongs to it—such a degree of strength as will enable it upon occasion on the spur of sinister interest or passion to act with advantage in a direction opposite to that of the dictates of justice in another work scotch reform letter i it has already been shown how completely opposite the interest of all judges commonly called by that name as well as of all other men of law has throughout their whole field of action all along been and still continues to be to the duty of judges which is as much as to say to the interest of the people in respect of the ends of justice not only this fact but the cause of it viz an illchosen mode of remuneration has in that same work been already brought to view of this opposition the cause and influence having as yet in a very small if in any degree been understood the whole course of action of these functionaries has consequently been a course of deception of deception practised throughout that whole course of action on all sorts of occasions and upon all sorts of persons upon individuals at large in their character of suitors upon jurors in particular in their character of jurors of the two modes of deception special and general the general has already been shown to be in every respect by far the most convenient with reference to the present purpose the general consists in forcing the people with whom you have to do to borrow your understanding and under the cover of it your will by preventing them from having any understanding fit for use and thence from having any will applicable to the purpose on this occasion the system of deception divides itself into two branches—the first consists in rendering the subject—whatever it be law religion anything—in the present instance law as incomprehensible or what is the perfection of incomprehensibility as uncognoscible as possible to all whom you have to deal with and that to their own conviction and satisfaction the other consists in doing whatsoever the nature of the case admits of towards raising    in their minds to as high a pitch as possible the estimate formed by them respectively of the correctness and completeness of the knowledge possessed by yourself in relation to the same subject to the first end contribute jargon nonsense absurdity surplusage needless complication falsehood—every kind of intellectual nuisance in every imaginable form and this the higher in degree and greater in quantity the better without any other restriction than what may be imposed by whatever caution may be necessary to enable you to avoid counteracting the other object last above mentioned of these two branches of the art of deception the firstmentioned may be termed the depressive or humiliative the other the selfexaltative the instruments applying or applicable to the purpose of deception as above distinguished may be the more readily comprehended by being distinguished into two classes those of the one may be termed the incorporeal instruments of deception and though upon a principle of division and nomenclature already attached to the subject a complete enumeration of them would perhaps be scarce practicable a tolerably sufficient sample of them has just been given viz in the words jargon nonsense absurdity and so forth for the designation of the instruments of the other class of these instruments the term corporeal will of course present itself to the mind of every man who has read blackstone under the class of corporeal instruments may be comprehended besides the posts or other uprights by which the level of the bench is elevated above that of the jurybox the peculiar habiliments by which the profession and the office together stand distinguished outward and visible signs of the inward and invisible graces and virtues intellectual and moral that dwell within these last in consideration of the incalculable influence which they are found to exert on the understanding of jurors and others through the medium of the imagination may be moreover termed instruments of fascination and as among heathen statuaries the circumstance of a mans having officiated with his own hands in the character of his own godmaker was not found to diminish his devotion towards such his god so if among the inhabitants of the same jurybox it should happen to the makers of the several instruments of fascination viz the furrier the tailor and the perukemaker to find themselves assembled and met together there seems no reason to suppose that upon the minds of these several manufacturers the influence of the several articles in the character of instruments of fascination would be less efficient than upon those of the other good men and true their colleagues of these corporeal instruments the importance is the greater inasmuch as but for them and the fascination produced by them it seems not altogether easy to conceive how the first branch of the art should have been compatible with the second and how the stock of jargon nonsense absurdity and so forth how abundant soever should have been conducive to or even compatible with the design of raising in the minds of the persons concerned the idea of the stock of real knowledge possessed by those exalted characters by whom these incorporeal instruments of deception have ever been so liberally employed both sorts of instruments incorporeal as well as corporeal may moreover if not in a strictly legal sense as savouring rather of the personalty than the realty yet at any rate to a common intent be styled and entitled hereditaments in relation to the corporeal hereditaments the instruments of fascination two things ought notwithstanding to be observed one is that the fascination performed is performed by the intrinsic and independent virtue of the instruments themselves and that to the bearer nothing being on his part performed or necessary to be performed towards and in relation to the effect no part of the effect ought to be ascribed or imputed the other is that were it not for the evil company they are connected with viz that of the incorporeal instruments above mentioned and the evil purposes to which the whole company are so unhappily apt to be applied the influence of these corporeal instruments notwithstanding the name of fascination so incontestibly belonging to it might well be salutary and beneficial upon the whole it is only by the abuse in so far as abuse is made of them that they operate in the character of instruments of deception—the character in which they belong to the present purpose and if these corporeal were separated from the incorporeal instruments and hereditaments above mentioned viz the jargon nonsense and so forth the abuse of the corporeal ones would be separated from the use of these several instruments of influence to whatsoever purpose applied that of deception or any other the efficiency in that character will it may be said naturally be the same—nearly if not exactly the same whether in the constitution of the jury in question the principle of permanence be or be not employed this may be admitted one means of influence however there remains coming under the head of influence of understanding on understanding which is applicable with peculiar advantage to the purpose of deception and which requires as a necessary condition to its application the application of the principle of permanence    when the judge and the jurymen become acquainted with each others persons being in a state of habitual intercourse a sort of connexion though it be but in the way of sympathy grows up between them a friendship which though it be of that kind which has been called a friendship of inequality a friendship betwixt the superior and the inferior betwixt wisdom and simplicity is not to this purpose at least the less powerful and effective a look of complacency indicative of old acquaintance and mutual good understanding descending if ever the dignity of the judge finds itself reduced to descend to such benignity from the heights of the bench upon the leading man in the jurybox the bellwether is gained—the flock follow of course a sort of compact forms itself under and in virtue of which the man of learning engages to afford direction the child of simplicity to follow it this compact once formed the presumption which on any particular occasion should presume to think and act for itself would be an act not only of temerity but of revolt and perfidy chapter iv special juries a special engine of corruption §   the system briefly stated we have seen what expedients the nature of the case affords for moulding juries into obsequiousness principally by means of corruption and thus divesting as much as may be of all reality the appearance which they exhibit of a check to the arbitrary power of the judge we now come to speak of the instrument or engine contrived for that purpose applied to it and to this day continuing to be applied to it and with what disastrous success will be seen as we advance this engine in no small degree a complicated one is no other than the sort of jury termed a special jury a special jury is so termed to distinguish it from a common jury this last name being reserved for the designation of the only sort of jury which till the invention of this special instrument of corruption was in existence above has been brought to view in the character of a possible one an arrangement by means of which bating such rare and casual exceptions as are liable to be now and then produced by the irregularities of the human mind a body of men be they who they may may be brought into a state of constant and complete obsequiousness to the will of some person or persons in the present instance the judge between whom and them the requisite sort of relation has in the manner there indicated been established in the case of a special jury this possible arrangement will be found to have been and to remain to this day completely realized as of the true and original jury so of this impostrous modern substitute the origin lies buried in obscurity human craft in every shape and in particular in the shape of lawyercraft—humancraft like the mole hides its ways from the light of day and as completely as possible from human eyes the clearest view as far as it goes that we possess of this sort of jury is that which is afforded to us by the statutebook and in the statutebook antecedently to the year    0 being the third year of the last reign no mention of it is to be found in a statute passed in that year   geo ii c    the sort of jury in question is spoken of in the way of reference as a sort of tribunal actually in use—finding it already in existence all that the statute does with it is to regulate it in the way of amendment this act was in the course of the same reign followed by four others or parts of others viz   geo ii c     geo ii c    making perpetual   geo ii c       geo ii c       geo ii c   † in each judicatory viz in each of the three westminsterhall jurytrial courts—kings bench common pleas and exchequer in the hands of an officer of the court the righthand man and dependent of the chief judge‡    this cluster of acts to consider them together found the effective nomination of these assessors by whose power that of the judge was in appearance to continue checked such are the hands in which king lords and commons found the faculty of reducing to a shadow the controul supposed to be exercised by a jury and in the same hands under the direction of their learned and essentially treacherous guides in these same hands it has been left in the hands of the agents of the parties in crown causes the solicitor of the crown acting under the direction of other servants of the crown his superiors they found the faculty and the practice of giving to each special juryman a fee to an amount altogether unlimited whether it was or was not in their practice or in their power to keep back the fee till after he had earnt it to their satisfaction does not appear in one of these acts    geo ii c    sec   reciting that complaints are frequently made of the great and extravagant fees paid to jurymen under the authority of the said recited acts parliament did indeed attempt to limit this fee viz to the sum of a guinea but with how little success may in due season be observed part iii ch   this guinea however was not merely a guinea for each day of service but a guinea for each cause tried in the compass of that day and to the number of such causes there was no certain limit nor therefore to the number of daily guineas §   the corruption briefly indicated such so far as could be exhibited by a rough outline and upon a small scale was and is the actual state of practice now in respect of such matters as influence corruption and obsequiousness let us upon the same scale observe the fruits and consequences by means of the magnitude of the fee and the situation of the hands on which on the occasion of each individual cause it was thus made to depend by what individuals this mass of emolument should be received a regular corps had thus gradually and secretly been established—the members nominated in all cases by the dependent of the judge that is in effect by the judge himself—paid in private causes by individuals but in crown causes by the servants of the crown a body of troops taking its orders in private causes from the judge alone—in crown causes also immediately from the judge but in effect from the judge and the other servants of the crown in conjunction according to any agreement which in each instance it happened to them to have made and thus it is that in a westminsterhall court in a crown cause including almost all causes in which the members of government as such are liable to take any real interest—the fate of the defendant rests altogether in the hands of the dependent set of jurors thus picked out from the rest so much as to the fact of the dependence now as to the degree of the occupier of any lucrative situation of the placeman who by any formal notification is liable to be at any time removed from his situation—removed by an officer who himself is liable in the same manner to be dismissed by the king or any of his servants the dependence is commonly considered as standing at the highest point in the scale of strict and perfect discipline but a point still higher is occupied by the sort of dependence which in the manner we have seen has place in the case of a special juryman for by the formality of express dismission the attention of the public mind is naturally with a degree of force depending on existing circumstances pointed to the incident and in some cases disapprobation from that quarter is in a greater or less degree liable to be incurred but in the case of a special juryman let drop out of the list for lack of obsequiousness the right hand of the official agent of corruption scarce knows the deed the negative deed thus committed by his left §   the system further developed such is the general result by a few explanations the conception obtainable of this mystery of iniquity may be rendered more distinct and particular though to any practical purpose the proof need scarcely nor perhaps can it be rendered more conclusive the choice made as above by the immediate instrument of the judge is not absolutely    without its limits but by the limits which it finds no bar whatsoever it will be seen is opposed to such a choice as can ever fail to be fully adequate to every desirable purpose   in the first place forming the basis of all subsequent operations comes what may be termed the qualified list on the foot of the primeval practice settled before the distinction between common and special jurymen was devised the members of the list which served as the general fund out of which jurymen were drawn for the purpose of each cause were and are in each township named by the constable of the township on the supposition of their being possessed of certain pecuniary and other qualifications fixed upon by law by the sheriff of the county these elementary lists were and are collected into one aggregate which as above may be termed the qualified list—the common and special jury qualified list   by the same hand out of this list a selection is made of such persons as under the clauses in the acts relative to special juries are regarded as being provided with the special qualifications appointed by these acts the minor and included list thus formed may be termed the special jury qualified list the persons thus distinguished from their fellows and by the distinction qualified for being in the character of special jurymen employed by the master the judicial officer above mentioned are in the constables books designated by the title of esquire   among the members of this special jury qualified list persons whose names are lying constantly before him and with whose characters their number being so much smaller i speak of those for middlesex about  00† he is at least as well acquainted as the chancellor of the exchequer with those of the members of the house of commons—this righthand man of the judge‡ this master this master packer as he may be termed chooses on the occasion and for the purpose of each cause   ∥ of these    the list may be distinguished by the name of the gross occasional list   from this gross occasional list the agent of the party or parties on each side of the cause has the power of discarding    which faculty the agent having of course his fees for it will in the natural order of things of course be exercised§ but if to this natural order of things so on any occasion it should happen that an exception should take place then and in such case it is by the master packer that the defect is supplied and the operation of discarding performed   be this as it may of the remaining    is constituted what may be termed the reduced list of each of these    the attendance is or at least ought to be required by the sheriff by a summons issued in obedience to an order or precept which contains the whole reduced list and has been previously transmitted to him from the court   the number actually serving on a jury being no more than    the object in view in summoning the    is to secure the appearance of half that number of those who on any given occasion actually make their appearance accordingly the list may be termed the actually appearing or attending list      be the number actually appearing what it may the    whose names stand first upon the reduced list are the    that serve of these the list may be termed the serving list if not so many as    make their appearance then so many as do appear being put upon the serving list the rest are taken from among such persons as happen to be in attendance in the character of common jurors on the face of this statement nobody surely can be at a loss to understand how nugatory the power of discarding though allowed to both sides is in the character either of a bar or so much as a check to any sinister choice which the righthand man of the judge the master packer under all the sinister influence to which in some cases his principal stands exposed may be disposed to make the whole    being alike at his devotion alike the creatures of his choice what matters it to him which of them are the twelve that serve   of all these several lists though not as yet distinguished any of them by names viz neither by the above nor by any others in current use—the existence is neither unknown nor disavowed nor so much as endeavoured to be concealed but another list the existence of which though it scarcely would be avowed is not the less real and to which suspicion has it will be seen already fastened a sort of nickname is a list which in the style of sober sadness may be distinguished by the appellation of the select and secret qualified list it is a list composed of such members of the gross qualified list as by the grand elector so often mentioned—the talleyrand of the respective courts—are regarded as sure men men who being qualified for dependence may accordingly be themselves depended upon and from among whom upon each occasion the gross occasional list required for that occasion may be securely taken without fresh expense of thought §   the corruption and dependence developed these seven† grand electors have they each of them a separate list of this kind or does one such list serve for them in common the answer is among those mysteries which must in a great degree remain involved in their original darkness what as will hereafter be seen‡ is certain is that in and for the use of the exchequer a list of this sort exists—exists with or without a name what will appear probable is that if there be not a distinct list of this sort kept in and for the use of the kings bench the exchequer list is occasionally resorted to for kings bench service of these secretly enlisted and though without words of command publicly delivered not the less perfectly disciplined troops the number is of course not known but so well is the nature of them known that it has obtained for them a familiar name the corps being termed the guinea corps the members of it collectively guineamen and if taken separately this or that one is familiarly spoken of as being concerned and interested in the guinea trade∥ of the degree of dependence in which the situation places a man no unapt token may be found in the multitude of the persons whose desire of being placed in it is manifested within a given district in a given length of time in   0  number of persons inhabitants of middlesex actually upon the qualified list   00§ number of those who in part of one year applied to be put upon that list addressing their application to one of the sheriffs  0 under the erroneous notion of its being in his power to put them upon it upwards of  00—all spoken of by him by the description of respectable persons—not to speak of others† two other sources require here to be brought to view from which the completeness and abjectness of dependence and the correspondent arbitrariness of the correlative power are capable of receiving increase—  the facility and security with which the correspondent power created by such dependence is capable of being exercised   the number of the persons by any one of whom the power in question is with that same degree of facility capable of being exercised over the one dependent in question on both these accounts may be seen in the instance of the guinea corps a degree of dependence—in that of their secret rulers a degree of arbitrary power—such as it may not be easy to match in any other instance consider in the first place the number and quality of the persons in whom the dependent will be apt to view the arbiters of his fate visible and immediate possessors of this power two—and two only these will be in the first instance the master packer by whom the gross occasional list is formed—and in a crown case the crown solicitor by whom the candidate for a place in the serving list is liable to be discarded but these are not either of them persons by whom in case of any sinister interest the original sinister interest will naturally be possessed it is from other persons behind the curtain—persons in quality and number unknown to the continuallyemploymentseeking and everlastinglydependent guineaman that in case of any such sinister interest and correspondent notification of superior will those ostensible and apparent officers will have taken their direction or their cue in these unknown occupants of the region situated behind the curtain the trembling guineaman will behold so many phantoms to the will of every one of which so far as it can be guessed at and to him presents itself as reconcilable with that of the rest it will be necessary for him to shape his part in the verdict among halfadozen of these highseated spectres to five for example the verdict he joins in may in his conception be matter of indifference no matter if to the remaining sixth it be matter of anxiety the liberty of the guineaman is as effectually killed by this single one as it could have been by all six meantime neither with any of the phantoms behind the curtain nor with either of the two masses of human flesh subsisting is it possible for the guineaman ever to come to any sort of explanation with the righthand man of the judge it is scarce possible with the crown solicitor it is neither necessary nor natural that he should ever have any sort of intercourse his sin the joining in a wrong verdict is committed openly in the jurybox his punishment—removal out of the select qualified list—will be inflicted in secret yea and so secret as not to be at any determinate time made known even to the sinner himself offended powers inexorable were it only because uncognoscible repentance rendered utterly unavailing by the very nature of the case‡ think now of the facility and security with which the correspondent power created by this sort of dependence may be aye and ever must be exercised say rather profited by without being exercised to powers that need never make their appearance neither action no nor so much as existence is necessary to the production of the most unreserved obedience existence sufficient to the purpose is lent to them by the dependents fears on the part of the invisible potentate no previous mandamus no lettres de jussion are ever necessary the effect is produced without an atom of responsibility in any such high quarter in any the slightest shape how delightful yes even in comparison of what it is at present would be the situation of a chancellor of the exchequer were the corps under his command subject to an equally efficient mutiny law and thence in a state of equally perfect discipline no need of letters no nor so much as of hints or winks suggestive of the moral duty of resignation no whitbreads no madoxes to encounter no votes of innocence to frame after confessions of guilt no previous questions to move and carry by main force the thorns that pierce the wellcompacted bench he sits upon would    not then be so pungent but that it might be in the power even of money dross as it is so there were but enough of it to assuage the smart how perfect soever the discipline of this corps i speak of the guinea corps may be at present its existence in any such degree of perfection cannot have been of any very ancient date point dargent point de suisse before the situation was capable of being moulded into an instrument of corruption—an efficient cause of sure obsequiousness—it was necessary that a quantity of saccharine matter sufficient for the dulcification of it should have been secreted and combined with it but even at present keen and numerous as we have seen the appetites to be that are excited by that matter the quantity of it furnished in a year is no greater i speak always of middlesex than that which is extracted from  00 causes at present as already observed the whole of the gross occasional list    being on the occasion of each cause chosen in the first instance by the master packer all taken out of the select and secret list with whose connexions c he is so perfectly well acquainted—in this regular and wellordered state of things which of them are left to constitute the reduced list    of whom the    whose names stand first upon the appearing list will constitute the serving list will to him and his highseated superiors be as already observed matter of complete indifference but at an early period of the special jury system no such entire security could have been possessed of those with whose dispositions he was sufficiently acquainted they being at the same time such on whom if attending and serving dependence might be placed there might not be above a dozen of whose attendance he could be sure and of the whole of this dozen supposing the right of discarding exercised he might find himself deprived in such a state of things the command of a verdict even from special jurymen seems to have been matter of anxiety and though when once established the faculty of discarding could not as it was thought consistently with prudence be absolutely taken away yet what in this way was thought capable of being done without a too complete removal of the mask a too barefaced act of injustice was done accordingly in the  d of king william anno    0 holt being lord chiefjustice of the kings bench a standing regulation if not at that time made was at any rate found to be in existence a regulation whereby it was provided that unless a special order were made for the purpose giving to the parties on both sides and consequently to the defendant that faculty it should not be exercised but the nomination should be completed as well as begun by the officer of the court the subordinate of the then removeable and completely dependent judge† thus the ordinary course of practice at that time was—not to allow any such faculty and it was only where having been importuned for it could not for shame be refused that it was granted throughout the system of technical practice so universal is the practice of misrepresentation and deceit that it is matter of continual uncertainty by what hand this or that branch of business is actually performed thus in equity practice of the mass of business stated in the books as being performed by the master an indefinite and ever variable proportion is really performed by some clerk of his the master knowing nothing of the matter in any of these offices intimate on any occasion a suspicion of anything not exactly correct whether in the article of probity attention or capacity your mouth is stopped at once by a reference to the dignity and character of the learned person whose office is held nominally during good behaviour virtually for life and who attired in such resplendent robes takes in the court of chancery in westminsterhall his periodical seat by the side of the lord high chancellor himself whereas in truth on the occasion in question the business was performed the power exercised a power over the property of suitors to any amount in point of importance exercised—not by this learned person but by some underling who is known to nobody whose name appears nowhere and who being there to day may be gone tomorrow thus in the case of the jurypacking business in every of the five packing offices but one the person by whom the business is done is in the several books of practice above referred to gravely stated as being the master and in each of those four instances so it may be or may not be but in one of them viz in the kings bench office crown side of the practice of which there was no account till so late as in the year   0  the public happened to be favoured with one by mr hands the packing business it appears p  0 is performed    formed as it may happen sometimes by the master sometimes by his clerk this being the case in a crown cause a libel cause for example whosoever it may happen to to see reason for wishing to make himself master of that useful article of knowledge which in the exchequer according to mr edmunds as above persons concerned are so regularly solicitous to acquire viz information concerning the connexions c of persons qualified for being special jurors has his choice of two of these intelligenceoffices one of them inferior in dignity and thence perhaps superior in obsequiousness and tractability to what is likely to be commonly known or imagined for according to mr hands p  0 after the solicitor has got the masters appointment on the rule to name the jury     it is the masters clerk that extracts out of the sheriffs book of jurors the names and additions of fortyeight and afterwards if either party does not attend the masters appointment it is the master or his clerk that strikes out for the absent party §   aggregate mischief of the system of the mischief capable of resulting to the country from the application of this engine of sinister influence the quantity will of course depend on the extent of which the application of the instrument is susceptible cases of felony excepted this extent coincides with that of jury trial at least with that of jury trial in causes originating in any of the great westminsterhall courts on every occasion it rests with either party to have a special jury for asking for what is reserved to the court is only to say and that at a subsequent stage by which of the parties the extra expense shall be borne among the causes in which the king is nominally the plaintiff—in those to which the name of crown causes is more commonly understood as being confined—i mean those in which the servants of the crown as such being substantially prosecutors having the prosecution under their care—the expense being borne out of the taxes all causes it may well be imagined become special jury causes and among these are kings bench libel law causes and in comparison of these of which presently all other crown causes will to the purpose here in question be seen to be of light importance and here then we have not only the possible and probable but actual extent of sinister influence of the sinister influence of which the institution of special juries is thus the engine the local sphere is indeed confined perhaps at least in a great degree within the bounds of london and middlesex but by causes not necessary to be here particularized within this sphere are brought with scarce an exception all causes that belong to this most important class but this mischief though the principal forms but one ingredient in a compound mass of mischief in which at least four distinguishable component elements may be reckoned up—   first comes the injustice—the base and sordid injustice—out of the common pockets of rich and poor an allowance given by the rich to the rich in compensation for a burthen which to those to whom the compensation is given is as nothing but to those to whom compensation is refused a serious one†      then comes the pension fund—thus secretly formed and though not altogether without the formal allowance yet as to its nature and application completely without the actual cognizance of parliament   in the third place comes the application of this fund to a purpose undeniably hostile and in its tendency—and if not remedied in its sure ultimate effect—destructive to the constitution destroying altogether to the extent of its influence and under its influence are included we see the most important causes the check which the power of the jury was designed and is supposed to apply to the arbitrary power of the judge   lastly—though after mention of the preceding abuse the mention of this last is but an anticlimax comes the facility which by the permanence already become notorious is afforded to the casual corruptor to any individual to whose improbity it may occur to take advantage of the facility thus afforded to extinguish this facility was the declared and principal object of the first of the series of statutes above mentioned declared in two places   geo ii c    §   §   corruption of jurors is in the first of the two places spoken of as the notorious effect permanence the continuance of the same man in that situation is in the last of the two places spoken of as the cause §   views of the lawyers who penned the acts the confirmation given by the series of statutes all of them statutes of the last reign to the use made of special juries this confirmation and the prodigious extent to which the practice has in consequence been spread have been already mentioned of the lawyers with whom this series of statutes originated or through whose hands it passed the treacherousness though in this any more than in any other instance treacherousness of this sort ought not to excite surprise has not the less claim to notice the everlastingly vaunted use and if not the sole at least by far the principal use of juries was the serving as a check to arbitrary power that otherwise would have been in the hands of judges but the mode of appointment considered in proportion to the extent to which it prevailed by the substitution of this newinvented to the original species of jury the efficiency of this check    was in the first instance greatly debilitated and left exposed to be at any time utterly destroyed for the healing of the wound thus given to the constitution nothing whatever was done by these unfaithful trustees and unworthy representatives of the people in the hands of the dependent subordinate of the judge to whose power the function of those his assessors was in pretence designed to operate as a check these pretended reformers found the nomination of those same assessors—in those hands they found it and in those same hands they left it by such practised eyes the fraud was by far too palpable to have passed unnoticed as to the remedy nothing could have been more obvious in a selection made by human judgment under the influence of human selfishness and improbity there was in any hands more or less danger in a selection made in the first instance by chance corrected afterwards by human judgment under the influence of impartiality a neutral power formed by the combination of opposite partialities there could be no such danger the expedient was too much in use and too obvious to escape notice use will be made it further on in the composition of the proposed remedy the extent they found it occupying i mean the special jury system was not only bounded but extremely narrow they rendered it boundless and by this newfangled and corruptlyconstituted tribunal all causes that are considered as coming under the denomination of important ones have accordingly been swallowed up to the party in the wrong to the malâ fide suitor as often as he sees his advantage in substituting they gave the power the indefeasible power of substituting this unconstitutional tribunal to the old constitutional one and amongst others to the servants of the crown and to the judges themselves as often as it should happen to them to have any malevolent passion to gratify or any sinister interest to promote at the expense of justice giving to their new tribunal a character so different from that of the old one which it has to so great a degree elbowed out—giving to a board secretly composed of commissioners paid placed and displaceable by the servants of the crown the respected and almost sacred name of jury they thus contrived to transfer to the counterfeit institution all that attachment and confidence so justly possessed by the genuine one which it supplants finally nor in the extent as well as confirmation given to this abuse did they forget that which judge and co never have forgotten profit to their own firm chapter v jury unanimity increases the corruption §   the effect of corruption how secured by it of the efficacy of the system of corruption of which the institution of a special jury is the instrument our conception would be very inadequate    if the force given to that engine by the obligation of what in the case of a jury is called unanimity were not taken into the account but for this feature for any purpose of corruption a majority or at least half of the twelve all corrupted would have been necessary under and by virtue of this feature one any one gained and properly armed—armed with the necessary degree of patience suffices if the mode of forming verdicts had been the work of calm reflection working by the light of experience in a comparatively mature and enlightened age some number certain of affording a majority on one side viz an odd number would on this as on other occasions have been provided and to the decision of that preponderating number would of course have been given the effect of the conjunct decision of the whole witness the course taken for securing a decision under the grenville act but the age in which the mode of forming verdicts was settled being an age of remote antiquity of such high antiquity that nothing more is known of it except that it was an age of gross and cruel barbarism the course taken for the adjustment of that operation was different and compared with anything that was ever exhibited in any other nation no less extraordinary than it was barbarous the whole body of these assessors twelve in number being confined together in a certain situation and in that situation subjected to a mode of treatment under which unless in time relieved from it they would at the end of a more or less protracted course of torture be sure to perish subjected to this torture but in the case of this as of other torture with power to relieve themselves from it in the present instance by declaring each of them the fact of his entertaining a certain persuasion the persuasion expressed by their common verdict whether really entertained by him or not in this way it was that a joint decision called a verdict expressed by a predetermined word or form of words was on each and every occasion extorted from the whole twelve such for the declared purpose of securing truth veracity verè dicta—for making sure that on the sort of occasion in question whatever declarations of opinion came to be made should be true—such was the expedient invented in the   th or   th century—such the course which still in the nineteenth continues to be pursued here then as often as in the number of twelve jurors any difference of opinion has had place so often has an act of wilful falsehood of mendacity had place viz in the instance of some number from one to eleven included in the twelve if not as in the case of sinister influence may at any time happen in the instance of all twelve for that it is in the nature or power of torture—one and the same torture—as being applied at the same time and place to twelve persons a b c d and so forth to produce a real change of opinion in any one of them—or if it were to render it more likely that the opinion of a should change into that of b than that of b into that of a and so forth—is a proposition which upon reflection will not it is supposed easily find any person either to sign or so much as seriously to say it excepting always the case of his being placed under the action of any of those machines for the production of peace concord ununimity or uniformity under the pressure of which anything whatsoever—any one thing as well as any other is either said or signed but though what never can happen is that by a quantity of bodily pain or uneasiness any real change should be produced in the opinion formed by any human being on a subject that has no natural connexion with that pain or uneasiness yet what may very easily and will naturally happen is that either by the eventual assurance of any given quantity of pleasure or what comes to the same thing by the assurance of having at command a given quantity of the instruments of pleasure in any shape—or by the eventual apprehension of any given quantity of pain or uneasiness—a disposition may in a bosom soothed with that assurance or galled by that apprehension be produced—a disposition—yes and moreover an effective determination—to submit to that pain for a greater length of time than any during which the same pain will be submitted to by a bosom not acted upon in either way as above from this state of things follow two practical results—   suppose no sinister influence viz of will over will to have place the verdict will always be conformable to the opinion declared by that one of the jurors in whose bosom the prospect of the uneasiness to which until the formation of the verdict they will all be subjected operates with least force—more shortly by him whose sensibility to the torture is least acute—whose power of endurance is greatest   suppose any sinister influence to have    place—an influence acting on the bosoms of any one or more of them in the same direction—while no sinister influence has place in the bosoms of any of the rest—there are two cases in each of which the efficiency of the sinister influence and the delivery of a corresponding verdict will take place of course—viz if on both sides the power of endurance with reference to the torture be equal or if in the bosom operated on by the sinister influence in question say the fear of losing the situation at the guinea board the force of the fear produced by the sinister influence be anything more than equal to the quantity by which what would otherwise be the power of endurance on that side falls short of the actual power of endurance on the other §   corruptors regular or casual—both served by unanimity two sorts of corruptors have above been indicated and distinguished the regular corruptor judge and co the casual corruptor any individual to whom it may occur to take advantage of the facilities afforded by the institution of the guinea corps for securing a verdict favourable to his cause in whatsoever shape and from whatsoever quarter the matter of corruption be proposed to be administered for securing the effect of it no other contrivance so effectual as this of unanimity—forced and mendacious unanimity—could possibly have been devised on so simple and easy a condition as the being prepared to endure longer than any of his fellows a degree of bodily inconvenience which no persons so circumstanced were ever known to endure long it gives to any one of these jurors that chooses thus to purchase it the power of all twelve two different sorts of causes each with its appropriate judicatory may serve as examples of the assistance derivable by the two different species of corruptors from this one common source i a political libel cause—sole judicatory the kings bench—is in a peculiar degree adapted to afford exercise or rather does of course and of itself afford exercise to the sure and safe and silent and imperceptible operation of the regular corruptor or rather corps of corruptors whose headquarters are at the crown office belonging to that honourable court   a smuggling cause—ordinary and among the courts of technical procedure in practice almost sole judicatory the exchequer—is under the invitation held out by the permanent establishment of the guinea corps in a peculiar degree adapted to the finding exercise for the dexterity of the casual corruptor his solicitor for when the disposition to corrupt and be corrupted is banished from the treasury bench it will be time enough for a smuggler to despair of meeting with it upon the roll of attorneys his solicitor the same sort of gentleman who a few years ago would have answered to the name of attorney pursuing the instructions given to him as above by mr solicitor edmunds p     attends at one of the five packing offices above mentioned addresses himself according to circumstances either to the acting master packer himself or to the clerk who to this purpose officiates occasionally as the master packers deputy—and according to instruction as above makes his inquiries into the connexions c of the jurors      alas what a roundabout course is this i was about attempting to delineate as if a solicitor in the smuggling line did not know his duty the duty of an advocate is to take fees and in return for those fees to display to the utmost advantage whatsoever falsehoods the solicitor has put into his brief the duty of the solicitor is to put into such his brief whatsoever falsehoods promise to be so made use of to the best advantage it is for this amongst other purposes viz for giving scope and effect to such falsehoods that by a law of the modern medes and persians suitors stand for ever excluded from the presence of the judge in the great system of delinquency the smugglers branch as it has its principals viz the smugglers themselves who are called by that name so has it amongst its accessaries—its licenced accessaries after the fact—the learned aiders abettors receivers and comforters of the aforesaid smugglers in virtue of that division of labour which by the fortuitous concourse of talents disposition and opportunities has been produced in the court of exchequer besides advocates of the inferior order there is always a titlegownsman or two regularly established as anybody may see in the smuggling line can it be otherwise among solicitors in the case of any or each such solicitor let us then make that supposition the contrary of which would be alike invidious and unnatural let us suppose him to know and knowing to fulfil in this behalf his duty his duty towards man and of his duty towards man that more specially imperative branch which is composed of his duty towards the smuggler in speaking of the master packer and his lists a list mentioned—as one that he ought to have and having to keep hung up is speaking of special jurors the gross qualified list—as a list which it is natural he should have but not natural that he should keep hung up another under the name of the select and secret qualified list or to give it its other denomination the guinea corps    the solicitor in the smuggling line can he be said to fulfil his duty as towards each or any of his clients if he has not either in his hureau or in his head a list of the several members of this corps—as correct and complete as it is in the power of inquiry and industry to make it if in the whole flock of guinesmen there be but a single scabby sheep to be found that one individual sheep is his man—under the unanimity system that one individual secures the verdict as to the arguments by which he whose duty it is to offer the bribe satisfies the conscience of the habitually obsequious guineaman of its being his duty to accept it any attempt to display them in detail would be alike superfluous and irrelevant necessity of smuggling—impossibility of carrying on trade without it—informers perjurers—never believe one of them—prosecution is persecution      is it for any such purpose as that of biassing a gentlemans judgment that the little compliment—the small retribution for his trouble—is ready to be presented good heavens no—it is only to engage his attention—his strict and unbiassed attention—of which his detection of the system of perjury which it is known will be brought forward will be the certain eonsequence    but to what purpose go on incumbering the section any further with any the slightest hints our solicitor has heard with due attention the speeches delivered from learned silk he has read debates in newspapers—poorly qualified indeed must he be for the exercise of this part of his duty if on the occasion of any such diplomacy he ever finds himself at a loss come the worst to the worst he can but go up to the guineaman with his piece of paper in his hand and in a tone of blunt frankness speak out and say—look here sir look at this five hundred pound this very note shall be yours the very day a verdict of not guilty is pronounced—good sir you need not stare so it is but corruption make the worst of it and its all for the good of trade in short sir without corruption no government can be carried on—its a known fact agreed to on both sides of the house—and if government cant i should be glad to know sir how can trade well sir we wont differ about names if corruption is not to your taste let us say influence—and pray sir wheres the difference but in one and the same cause suppose the regular corruptor on one side and the casual corruptor on the other—in a case of this sort how will the matter be settled fret not thyself about any such case it is a case that can never happen nor if it were to happen would there be any difficulty in it in the libel line it can never happen for as every man that either writes or reads is by law a libeller there is no such person as a solicitor specially established in the libel line the regular corruptor—or rather the phantom of the regular corruptor—for as we have seen the phantom is quite sufficient—this regular phantom having here no competitor walks over the course in the smuggling line it can almost as little happen the solicitor for the smuggler is solicitous for the smuggler because and in so far as in being solicitous for his client he is solicitous for himself here then we have the casual corruptor the solicitor for the crown is not solicitous for what is called the crown his solicitude if he has any is more likely to be for the smuggler because the more of them escape a first time the more there are that remain to be prosecuted a second time and whether the smuggler be caught or escape the solicitor remains solicitor as before here then provided the fee be handsome enough for proportions it will be seen must not be forgotten—here it is the casual corruptor that walks over the course as to the regular corruptor everywhere but a phantom he is here a phantom by much too weak to oppose to flesh and blood any effectual resistance in the exchequer he is but a pigmy it is in the kings bench only and there in the field of libel law only that he is as he will presently be seen to be a giant but suppose be it possible or no a real competition a solicitous casual corruptor on one side a solicitous regular corruptor on the other how it may be asked would matters be settled in this case in the guinea trade as in any other trade they would be settled upon the principles of trade compliment offered so much down per contrà on taking stock situation in the guinea trade gross value so much situation not being insurable either at the equitable or the amicable say loss of value by peril of false brethren and shipwreck in case of nonobsequiousness so much balance for or against accepting compliment so much but at this rate says somebody we should have bought acquittals especially in smuggling causes as plenty as sham pleas or sham bail—and of any such degree of frequency or anything approaching to it are any indications to be found have patience—things must have time to ripen it is only within these few years and under the auspices of the present learned chief that the system has been raised to that height in the scale of perfection at which it will presently be seen to stand earth must have time to bring forth her increase especially in such a field as that of judicature where if of those things which yield profit    to the husbandman the growth of every thing is sure yet even of those things the growth of almost everything is slow true it is that after fighting off till judgment the swindler with another mans money in his pocket goes to eight of the twelve judges in the exchequer chamber or to four of them in the kings bench as the case may be and says to them they appearing in the only mode of appearance which they admit of viz by this or that agent of theirs—the delay you have upon sale is cut out i find in pieces much of a length let me have one of the longest make out your account i know you deal for nothing but ready money here it is for you here we see perfection—the very summit of the scale expect not however that at the guinea office even at that which is under the exchequer business of this sort should at so early a period of the institution be already to be transacted upon any such pleasant and easy terms as with the old established firm judge and co the business of which has for so many hundred years been conducted upon the true principles of trade expect not therefore to find already established by the side of each delayshop a verdict shop at which addressing himself to a clerk of the guinea board with as much frankness as if in an erroroffice it were a solicitor to a swindler addressing himself to the clerk of the errors a solicitor in the smuggling line may say—the king against such an one—i am for the defendant secure me a verdict penalty so much   per cent upon that sum so much here it is for you no—to the prosperity of this branch of the trade one limit there is which is set by the very nature of the trade the regular corruptors are here the fair traders casual such as smugglers are but interlopers between the fair trader and the interloper there exists an everlasting jealousy this being the case suppose this branch of trade arrived even at its highest possible pitch of improvement—no one guineaman could expect to sell any more verdicts than one his comrade would peach of course he would of course be let drop out of the list and there would be an end of him therefore unless the case be such that the price offered for the verdict is more than a place at the board is worth the guineaman is no less incorruptible than cæsars wife was chaste expect not everything at once arm yourself with patience a few pages more and—though you will not find the curtain that screens the verdictoffice so completely drawn up as that which once screened the delayoffices has now been for these eleven years—yet should your patience serve you till part ii chap   a slight peep behind this curtain you shall have chapter vi purposes to which influence on juries may be made subservient §   blind confidence in judges not warrantable if for confining the exercise of it within the paths of justice the power of the judge stood not in need of any kind of check the destruction of the sort of check which was designed and is supposed to be applied to it by the functions of the jury would not afford any just cause of complaint any demand for reformation if in the situation of judge a man were not liable to stand exposed to the action of any sinister interest or delusive passion opposite to the interest of the public in respect of the ends of justice viz neither on his own individual account nor on account of any other individuals or classes of men whose interests or passions by whatsoever tie connected with his own it may happen to him to espouse—were such the real state of things on that supposition the exercise—the independent and wellconsidered exercise—of the functions of the jury would not in the character of a check to the power of the judge be of any use nor therefore would any diminution of that independence present any just cause of complaint any demand for reformation not that even on this supposition the propriety of continuing the use of juries whose obsequiousness were thus regarded as certain would in this or in any other part of the field of jury trial be the practical inference no the practical inference would be—that in this part at least of that field juries ought to be abolished for sure it is that if so cumbrous and expensive an appendage as is the jurybox to the official bench were not useful it would be much worse than useless to the course of judicature in the character of a source of factitious complication and thence of factitious delay vexation and expense it is as it is an enormous—as at best it would be—a considerable incumbrance while to such individuals as are loaded with the duty of filling it without recompense the vexation is such as to constitute as we have seen no inconsiderable part of the aggregate mass of public burthens†    in saying abolished—juries ought to be abolished—i mean of course abolished by proper authority—abolished by parliament—not reduced to collections of puppets by the machinations of judges but of the several propositions thus brought to view for the purpose of the argument the contraries will it is supposed be found true throughout the whole field of special jury trial for confining the power of the judge—meaning the exercise of it within the paths of justice there exists much need of a check and that an efficient one for in the situation of judge throughout the whole of that field whatsoever is situated without that field belongs not to the present purpose a man is continually exposed to the action of sinister interest and delusive passion acting in directions opposite to the interest of the public in respect of the ends of justice to sinister interest and passion casually on his own individual account much more frequently on account of other individuals or classes of men whose interests or passions by whatsoever tie connected with his own it may happen to him to espouse throughout the whole field of special jury trial obsequiousness on the part of juries—obsequiousness secured as above by corrupt influence is therefore if the above propositions be true prejudicial in a high degree to the interest of the public in respect of the ends of justice i say obsequiousness thus secured and if so then so therefore are its abovementioned efficient causes—viz packing and permanence §   interests to the action of which judges are liable to be exposed money power ease and vengeance these together with reputation so far at least as the efficient cause of felicity in this shape may have the effect of serving as a security or means of increase for it in any of those others—reputation how well or how ill soever deserved may be set down as indicative of the several interests by which when acting in the direction of sinister interests the conduct of public functionaries in general and of judges in particular is in a more particular degree liable to be warped partiality—viz in favour of the interests of this or that other individual or class of men—will be apt to present itself as another interest—and certainly not an inefficient interest—distinct from the above such as it is the indication of it may however in a certain sense be comprised in the above list since by that one word are indicated the several sorts of interests already spoken of as comprehended in that list the only difference being in the personality of the individual or individuals whose interest is considered as being at stake the pecuniary or money interest to the action of which in the character of a sinister interest i stand exposed may have for its exterior cause a sum of money which i myself am in a way to gain or lose or a sum of money which another person whose interests i espouse may be in a way to gain or lose and so in regard to power ease vengeance and reputation as above of these objects of desire money and power especially if considered with reference to no other person than the functionary himself present on the present occasion comparatively speaking but little matter for attention to the judge himself money and power are secured by office secured and fixed out of the reach of receiving augmentation any more than diminution at the hands of juries so far as power is concerned those cases excepted if any such there happen to be for they are but of casual occurrence in which the affections of the judge taking an interest in the way of partialities in the event of  0 the cause it may happen to his power in the event of his endeavouring to afford to that partiality a gratification at the expense of justice to find in the power of the jury an opposing check love of ease and desire of vengeance may therefore be set down as the two passions or affections from the influence of which for want of such check as the power of a jury was intended to apply the interests of justice are most exposed to suffer in such hands love of ease applies and applies alike to all sorts of causes vengeance unless by mere accident to but one and that comparatively a narrow one viz libel causes but that with reference to the interest of the public so important a one that all others shrink as it were to nothing in comparison of it not only money and power but dignity and respect being secured by office the chief object of solicitude and pursuit remaining to the judge is ease but so far as jurytrial is concerned the ease of the judge is as the obsequiousness of the jury these volunteers so different from some others being by the very nature of their situation and without need of exertion anywhere kept in a state of constant preparation and established discipline waiting and wanting for nothing but the word of command and drilled into that sort and degree of intelligence which is sufficient for the understanding it labour on the part of the judge is reduced to its minimum ease raised to its maximum if circumstances be to such a degree favourable that not so much as the show of explanation is found necessary so much the better—at the worst all anxiety and with it the greater part of the labour is removed by the preestablished harmony nor in this way is the reputation of the judge worse provided for than his ease be the man in power who he may what can be more flattering to him—what to a superficial view at least more honourable than the known fact that under the name of opinion upon all whose lot has fixed them within the sphere of his intercourse and his influence his will has habitually the effect of law for the operations of the sinister interest created by the love of ease every sort of cause and every sort of judicatory presents almost in equal degree a favourable theatre instead of love of ease say for shortness sloth which though under the pagan dispensation neither god nor goddess not ranking higher than with syrens† is not in our days the less powerful whatsoever might have been her influence in those early times it is to sloth that by official persons of all sorts and sizes but particularly the highest sacrifices are made continually and in all shapes in all shapes and in particular in that of justice the only one which belongs to the present purpose of a sacrifice of this sort a sketch taken pretty much in detail has already been given in another work scotch reform letter iv bewitching syren a little while and even before these pages are at an end we shall see a preeminently learned and most reverend person confessing his passion for her with scarce a gauze before his face part ii chap   plutus is apt to betray his votaries to him justice cannot readily be sacrificed but in a tangible shape syren desidia keeps her secrets better so well indeed that without hard labour in other quarters and in no small quantity sacrifices made to her can seldom be brought to light even when a mischance of this sort happens to them the mischief be it ever so enormous finds the public—the english public at least—comparatively indifferent to it john bull—the representative of this most enlightened of all publics—is a person somewhat hard of hearing and unless by the chink of money and that a good round sum—the irascible part of his frame is not easily put into a ferment and even then it is not so much by the mischief which the public suffers be it ever so heavy as by the sum of money which the wrongdoer pockets be it ever so light that his fire is kindled mischief if the truth may be spoken does not much disquiet him so long as he sees nobody who is the better for it the love of ease is too gentle a passion to be a very active one but what it wants in energy it makes up in extent for there is neither cause nor judicatory in which there is not place for it as to vengeance it is only now and then and by accident that it comes upon the stage of judicature but when it does such is its force that in the character    of a sinister interest no interest to the action of which that situation is ordinarily exposed can compare with it for the exhibition of the triumphs of this tyrant passion and of the sacrifices made to it the kings bench is by patent the great and sole kings theatre the liberty of the press its victim libel law the instrument of sacrifice behind this sinister interest lurks frequently at least if not constantly another viz selfpreservation an interest than which to judge of it from this its general name nothing should be more innocent and uncensurable but selfpreservation is preservation of ones self from evil in any shape a species of evil which will be presently seen to be impending—and that too an evil from which by so pleasant an operation as that of the gratification of vengeance a judge in that situation feels himself every now and then called upon to preserve himself and with himself his partners in the firm of judge and co together with abundance of his friends is—the loss of an indefinitely extensive lot of money or power—whether in possession or though not in possession regarded as within reach—viz whatever portion of either is not recognised as being the offspring of any species of abuse of the several departments of government howsoever carved out and distinguished—judicial financial military naval and so forth—suppose that in all or any of them abuses exist—abuses from which the persons or some of the persons by whom those departments are respectively filled derive each of them in some shape or other a sinister advantage in this state of things if there be any such thing as an instrument by the operations of which all such abuses without distinction are liable to be exposed to view the tendency of it is thereby to act with hostile effect against the several sinister interests of all these several public functionaries whom thereupon by necessary consequence it finds engaged all of them by a common interest to oppose themselves with all their means and all their might not only to its influence but to its very existence an instrument of this allilluminating and allpreserving nature is what the country supposes itself to possess in a free press and would actually possess if the press were free as it is supposed to be   interests to the sinister action of which english judges stand actually exposed thus much as to the interests to the action of which in the direction and character of sinister interests the probity of a judge in every age and country is liable to stand exposed but—not to speak of the footing on which the matter may stand in this or that other country—in england at least so far as concerns pecuniary interest—the most uniformly active and generally irresistible of all sinister interests—the degree in which the probity of a judge has ever stood and still continues to stand exposed—in mechanical language to the action of sinister interest—in chemical language to the action of the matter of corruption—is such as cannot anywhere be exceeded paid as he is paid—and were he even paid on any purer principle—trained as he has been trained—draughted from the corps from which he has been draughted—not only his interests but the prejudices begotten by those interests are in a state of constant universal and diametrical opposition to his duty—to every branch of that duty—to every one without exception of the ends of justice—scotch reform letter  —to the several most immediate ends not to look out for any remoter ends—to the collateral ends—avoidance of unnecessary delay vexation and expense—to the main ends avoidance of denial of justice and of undue decision to the prejudice of the plaintiffs side and avoidance of undue decision to the prejudice of the defendants side in a word in exact proportion as by or under the authority of this dives the suitors are tormented he himself—not only in his preceding character of advocate had been used to be but in his present character of judge continues to be—comforted not a delinquent high or low—but especially not a high and powerful delinquent—with whom he is not linked by the bands of a common interest not a wrong from which if not certainly and immediately at any rate in respect of its natural and frequently efficacious tendency he does not derive a profit the more wrongs the more causes and the more causes the more fees not an imaginable channel that of punishable bribery alone excepted in which in the shape of the matter of corruption the matter of wealth does not under the name of fees flow in

the name is given and by whom the great and happily uncorrupt body of those functionaries is ruled—no other country upon earth in which in this highest rank amongst these monopolizers of the honour so justly due to the function corruption has place to an extent approaching to that to which it has spread in this country of pretended purity or in which it is possible that anything like equal profit should be made by it in other countries not being practicable but in the shape of bribery or extortion—practices proscribed by law and necessarily open to detection—it is but casual in england being in all these other forms that have been mentioned either legalized or seated above the reach of punishment it is in that highest rank constant and universal by means of sinecures in general and judicial sinecure offices in particular whatsoever money is levied upon the subject is so much extracted from him on false pretences the tyranny of extortion and the turpitude of swindling are combined in it in the case of judicial sinecures by the very men by whom these enormities are punished—punished in cases in which they derive a profit from the punishment and none from the practice—these same enormities are not only connived at but participated in and the profit pocketed falsehood—corrupt and wilful falsehood—mendacity in a word—the common instrument of all wrong—was in the instance of all those judicatories as any man may see even in blackstone among the notorious foundations or instruments of their power and in every one of them from the beginning of each cause to the end sometimes by the lips or the hand always under the eyes of the judge matter of constant and universal practice not one of them in which it is—not merely allowed of but encouraged and not only encouraged but forced inexorably forced without so much as an attempt at argument in the very teeth of common sense falsehood the irreconcilable enemy of justice—falsehood under the name of fiction—is passed off by them upon the deluded people—passed off as the true friend and necessary instrument of justice in such a state of things behold two propositions between which the perplexed and deluded people are left to make their choice—  that falsehood—wilful deliberate and rapacious falsehood—is not a vice or   that it is in the power of man—of every man who has the power of a judge—to wash away the filth of vice and transform her into virtue hence if mendacity and rapacity be vices the very sink of vice is the seat of the titled lawyer who to his other titles blushes not to add that of custos morum—guardian of the public morals as if the most noted among procuresses were regularly to write herself over her door—guardian of female chastity in the character of an instrument of corruption for the depravation of the moral part of mans frame falsehood has been scarcely more useful to them more actively employed or more deservedly prized by them than in that of an instrument of deception for the debilitation perversion confusion and depravation of the intellectual faculty fiction accordingly has scarcely been more serviceable in the character of an engine for the accumulation of undue profit and illegal power than in the character of a species and source of nonsense by which the eye of the understanding being blinded or bewildered is thus prevented from seeing the absurdity and wickedness which is at the bottom of it in every one of these paths of depravity the most depraved system that can be found in any other country is left far behind swearing says one of the characters in a french drama constitutes the groundwork of english conversation lying he might have said without any such hyperbola lying and nonsense compose the groundwork of english judicature in romebred law in general—in the scotch edition of it in particular—fiction is a wart which here and there deforms the face of justice in english law fiction is a syphilis which runs in every vein and carries into every part of the system the principle of rottenness let us steer clear of exaggeration in this as in other parts of the field of law to plant new abuses is not even now so easy as to preserve the old and as the resisting strength of the public mind increases the difficulty cannot but increase but if the stock already in existence be in any degree greater than what is desirable and especially if among them there be any of so hardy a nature as without need of further care to keep on growing of themselves no very powerful plea it is presumed will by this admission be afforded in favour of any such unbounded confidence as must be bespoken for judges by any person to whom the check supposed to be applied to their power by that of juries is regarded as superfluous keeping our minds fixed on jury trial and the extent to which it is capable of operating in the character of a check to the enormities above mentioned and thence on the amount of the mischief liable to be produced by the destroying or weakening of that check another observation which in the way of admission it may be of use to make is—that so far as concerns sinister profit by far the greater part of the work of corruption has been executed by means of a set of devices see the list in scotch reform letter   to the success of which the concurrence of juries neither is nor ever has been necessary    but neither are instances by any means wanting in which whatever be the purpose—profit ease vengeance or whatever other sinister advantage may be the object of the day—complete success even with the aid of the whole host of those devices may in one way or other depend on the obsequiousness so effectually secured as above on the part of juries scotch reform letter iv upon the whole under the feegathering system as above glanced at of which system packed juries and sham jurytrial have come to make a part the result is—that unless in an english judge the nature of man be totally opposite to what it is in every other human being unless this be assumed everything at all times rather than nothing at any time ought in common prudence to be apprehended at the hands of an english judge §   existing popularity no sufficient ground for confidence but amidst and in spite of all this temptation the purity of english judicature is it not in fact so exquisite and so universally recognised as to have become in a manner proverbial and in this experience is there not that which suffices for the confutation of all that theory universally not much short of it—proverbial there or thereabouts but note well the causes—   impurity to appearance washed away by legalization   impurity covered over by perpetually renewed coatings of interested praise   by intimidation impurity protected against disclosure these causes understood the popularity will be seen to be the result—and as such an indication—not of purity but of depravity thus much for hints—follow a few elucidations   impurity to appearance washed away by legalization be the system what it may and let impurity have risen under it to ever so high a pitch yet if the system be but of old standing the sanction lent to it by antiquity is sufficient to prevent the impurity from fastening any the slightest stain upon the reputation of the system as also so the system be but legalized upon the reputation of the judges be they who they may who act under it in the way of sale or in any other way suppose the judge to derive an advantage from an office the profits being composed of fees the aggregate amount of which it depends upon himself to increase or preserve from diminution for example by increasing or preserving from diminution the number of the occasions on which they shall be received if among the acts by which an advantage of this nature is capable of being reaped there be any one which being prohibited by law and made punishable is upon occasion actually punished—then it is that in case of his being known or suspected to have done any such act his reputation will be more or less affected but let that same act be allowed by law and legalized his reputation remains untouched now there are two sorts of law by either of which or by a mixture of both a judicial practice may be legalized one is common alias unwritten law and this is the sort of law which in so far as a rule of action which has no determinate set of words belonging to it can be said to be made has for its makers the judges themselves since it is by their own practice that it is made the other is statute law and in the making of this through the means of their partners in trade in both houses they have at all times possessed and exercised a most baneful and if not altogether irresistible scarce ever resisted influence    of the effect of the sinister interest under which the judicial system of this country or call it the system of procedure has been throughout its whole texture and all along    manufactured the samples given in the note are but as so many handfuls of tares let us not say wheat taken at random out of the contents of the whole granary in a parenthesis as it were as here more will surely not be expected such is the mode and such the hands in and by which upon a careful computation the mass of factitious expense and delay not to speak of vexation with which the approaches to justice are clogged have according to circumstances been increased to some scores and even to some hundreds of times what would otherwise have been its amount and the great mass of the people—from ninetenths to nineteentwentieths or more—fixed—with only here and there an exception produced by inconsistency—fixed in a state of perpetual outlawry exposed without redress to injury in every shape in which it is not deemed criminal besides a multitude in which it is but this system of general proscription this system of general outlawry being the work of law is according to law the creators and preservers of it being all men of law are all honourable men and in the words of blackstone every thing is as it should be   impurity covered over by perpetually renewed coatings of praise partly by the imbecility partly by the interested artifice of the makers the rule of action unwritten and written law together having been worked up into a chaos of which it is impossible for the people to form to themselves any tolerable conception hence such conception as they have of it is grounded exclusively upon the reports made of it by the manufacturers themselves but the worse they have made it the greater their apprehension lest its depravity should be discovered the less deserving it is of praise the greater the need it has of praise the more flagrant its defects the greater the demand for the only sort of covering of which they are susceptible scotch reform letter iv   in regard to the system the more afflictive it is to the people in the character of suitors the more profitable it is to the man of law and the greater the profit he derives from it the greater the quantity of praise which it is his interest to bestow upon it and which accordingly he ever has bestowed and ever will bestow upon it   so in regard to the persons by whom for the time being it is administered the persons themselves being linked together by the tie of one common interest and all who either dare to publish any account of their proceedings or are qualified to publish any tolerably correct one being candidates for their favour the consequence is—that with the rare and casual exceptions produced by party jealousies the same picture of scarcely diversified excellence has served for all of them at all times the portrait is the same and all that remains for this and that new limner is to write under it this and that new name in this happy state of things the system and those by whom it is administered afford reciprocal demonstrations of each others excellence the excellence of the system is proved by the excellence of those by whom it is administered and the excellence of those by whom the system is administered is proved by the excellence of the system by which they were formed and under which they act up to the instant which sees him mounted on the pinnacle of the bench the man of law is recognised by every body as being of the number of those to whom right and wrong truth and falsehood would be matter of complete indifference were it not for the predilection naturally entertained for the best customer and in whom the minister of the day through whose hands in his way to that pinnacle he must first have passed has found an instrument no less ready for the wages of corruption to do the work of corruption upon the largest scale than the individual wrongdoer has found him to do the work of iniquity upon any smaller scale yes and although his interest remains at least as opposite as ever to the interests of the community in respect to the ends of justice no sooner have the form and substance of his robes undergone the customary transfiguration than the heart which they so well cover is universally understood to have undergone the correspondent change the corruption has put on incorruption and the will the training of which towards the paths of iniquity had till then been so generally recognised is now secured against all danger of taking a wrong direction being itself become the standard of rectituds      by intimidation the impurity protected against disclosure while under the spur of every excitement which avarice or ambition can apply—every thing that is said of the law and its administrators being a sort of prizeessay on their perfections—while by the force of this stimulus whatsoever features of excellence it possesses are raked together and held up to view decorated with every embellishment that interested eloquence can bestow—its defects were they still more flagrant than they are would be as they ever have been kept

to point to the wrong mark the system is faultless the creators and upholders of it are faultless but in the shape of wicked attorneys evil spirits creep in now and then and convert into poison the salutary remedies it affords no representation was ever more opposite to the truth the quantity of mischief produced by anything which under the name of irregular practice is either punishable or censurable is as nothing in comparison of that which is produced by regular practice—by that which has been legalized and organized for the purpose and even the loopholes at which the irregularities have crept in are amongst the works which the regularity of regular practice has had for its objects and its uses if judgments are snapt it is because by the preestablished mechanism scotch reform letter i devices   and   they were framed as they are to fit them for being snapt now and then in great ceremony in the character of scapegoat or to speak in modern language in the character of tinman in expiation of the sins of the whole tribe a miserable attorney the child of the system is sacrificed on the altar of offended justice but the chief profiter by all those sins is the chief priest who with indignation on his brow and laughter in his heart offers up the sacrifice by the inferior branch of the profession—by the attorney branch—the system has all along been taken such as it has been found it is by the two superior branches—composed of judges and advocates—advocates in the senate judges occasionally in the senate constantly on the bench—that it has been made such as we see or rather as we feel it of the three branches the inferior as it is the most populous so is it in its nature the least impure to an attorney—those operations and instruments excepted in which the part he takes is compulsory and unavoidable having been imposed upon him by judges—to an attorney as such the language of insincerity is never necessary on the part of the advocate the necessity and consequently the practice is constant the only choice there is for him is between the more and the less such is the mind of the advocate and the mind of the advocate is the stuff of which the mind of the judge is made filling the bench from no other fund than the bar is it not exactly such a mode as if boardingschoolmistresses and governesses were never to be chosen but from brothels yet by giving to the matter and language of the law a texture nauseous to every liberal mind and impenetrable to every mind not sharpened by hunger an exclusive admission to the bench has been secured in favour of a profession which if either love of justice or of truth had been considered as necessary qualifications would for ever have stood excluded obvious as they are against all these considerations the nonlawyer has learnt to shut his eyes at an early age the picture of the law drawn by blackstone had been put into his hands a picture in which all deformities and turpitudes are plaistered over with the most brilliant colours to pry into the original would require hard labour to glance over the picture requires but a glance set before him the original he turns aside from it to an insight into the original he prefers a dream over the picture thus it is that when rightly considered the popularity of the system—paradoxical as    at first sight the proposition cannot but appear—the popularity of the system so far from being a conclusive proof of its excellence affords a proof inasmuch as it is among the results of its depravity the depravity being the cause of which through the intervention of the intermediate causes that have been brought to view the popularity has been the effect—   depravity viz in respect of factitious delay vexation and expense   profitableness to lawyers in respect to their profit upon the expense   popularity among lawyers   praises by lawyers   popularity among the people at large but more particularly among the ruling classes connected in so many points of sinister interest with the lawyers—in three out of the above five we see the intermediate links by which a cause and effect to a first view so wide of each other have been brought into connexion important as these topics are—viz the goodness of the system and the virtue of those who act under or by virtue of it to the present purpose they belong in no other point of view than this—of the packing system—being a system which it has already been seen is established and as it will soon be seen has been avowed the effect—quoth the argument against it—say in lawyers jargon the declaration—is to destroy this part of the constitution by destroying the check which the power of the jury was intended to keep applied to the power of the judge—nay but so transcendently pure quoth the argument in favour of the package—say the plea so transcendently pure under and by virtue of the system is the virtue of the judge that no such check is or ever can be necessary such being the plea it became necessary to traverse it and if the plea itself be no departure so neither is the traverse chapter vii chief purpose crushing the liberty of the press §   liberty of the press—has it any and what existence we come now to the grand and paramount use of the packing system—the crushing the liberty of the press—destroying whatever remains of it undestroyed to prevent indistinct or erroneous conception a few words of explanation may here once for all be of use king de jure and king de facto is a distinction familiar to every eye that has ever glanced over english history the same distinction must be applied to the liberty of the press by whosoever would be saved from falling into error and heterodoxy on this scabrous ground liberty of the press by law no that sort of liberty excepted which consists in the nonexistence of a safetyshop in the shape of a licensers office no such thing either has or ever has had any existence so embodied in the person of lord mansfield the soul of the custos morum certified to some of us in    0 so embodied in the person of lord ellenborough the same guardina spirit of good order confirmed to us in   0 † liberty of the press de facto yes viz that which being contrary to law proscribed by law has all along maintained a sort of rickety and still maintains a momentary halfexistence in the teeth of consistency as well as law by means of breach of the law in low situations and nonexecution of the law in high ones hence it was that in the place of any such words as destruction or destroying—which otherwise would have been so much more obvious—it was necessary to look out for some other of a less determinate import such as crushing as above for of any such word as destroying the effect would have been to bring in with it and keep attached to it the idea of existence than which as above a more dangerous heresy could not by any englishman protestant or catholic be entertained but forasmuch as in neglected bodies vermin of all sorts will be apt to crawl into existence hence comes the necessity which persons in high situations are under of keeping in their hands the means of crushing—as often as in any such shape and stature as to render itself troublesome it happens to it to show itself—the liberty—but forget not for a moment the de facto liberty—of the press in the first place while pen and ink remain still at command i shall endeavour to bring to view a sketch—an extremely slight and temporary one—for that is all that can here be given—a sketch or rather as before a sample—of the interest which not only judge and co as above but moreover the high connexions of the firm have in keeping the liberty of the press in the sort of abortive embryo state in which it has so effectually been preserved viz by the hands by which had convenience prescribed and possibility    permitted it would have long ago been no less effectually destroyed i shall then but rather in the way of recapitulation and reference than in any other add the little that can be necessary to show the assistance that may always be depended upon from the zeal of the master packers office and the discipline of the guinea corps on the occasion of so necessary a service in the catalogue of abuses judges have their peculiar articles other highseated persons have theirs but towering above all the rest one abuse there is in the profit of which judge and co find their partners in the very highest and most impregnable situations in the one house in the other house in the cabinet in the closet yea even among those whom the king delighteth most to honour i speak of that congeries of abuses the component elements of which are law sinecures so far as judges alone are concerned it has been slightly touched upon already but in consideration of the prodigious increase of strength given to the alliance bipartite between judges and wrongdoers by the accession of court favourites and the triple alliance thus formed for carrying on with irresistible force the predatory war against the common enemies viz liberty and justice a few ulterior elucidations respecting the nature and cementing principle of the alliance may have their use §   improbity in judges and their high allies—its hostility to the press some years ago on the examination of a question of finance i found occasion to inquire in what way by the taking out of the pockets of the people a given sum of money the greatest possible quantity of mischief was produced the result was—by assessing it in the form of a tax on the several operations and instruments the performance and exhibition of which were rendered necessary to a man to enable him whether in the shape of plaintiff or in that of defendant to take his chance for justice affliction heaped upon affliction in the case of him who has wherewithal to comply with the exaction—denial of all relief exposure or rather subjection to all imaginable wrongs in the case of him who has not wherewithal to satisfy the exaction—such are the shapes in one or other of which or both the mischief manifests itself and in the latter case being the case of virtual outlawry a vast majority of the subjects of the british empire—say ninetenths say more likely nineteentwentieths subject to limitations and exceptions too particular and upon the whole of too little extent to admit of notice in this place—would be found see scotch reform letter i and elsewhere the quantity of money taken from a man on this account being in the mathematical sense given i e determined—what the appellation employed on that occasion may happen to be—for example a tax or a fee—as well as what the pocket may happen to be in which it finds its restingplace after it has gone out of his own—whether that of the public for example or that of a judge or other man of law—is to him and in respect of the quantity of suffering of which in his instance the defalcation is productive—a matter of indifference yet so it happens that though the quantity of money so raised being given a tax on law proceedings is by far the worst of all possible taxes yet by the money raised on law proceedings under the name of fees mischief to an incomparably greater amount has been produced than by money raised on the same occasion under the name of taxes the reason is altogether simple by the man of finance at whose instance the money is exacted in the name of a tax the occasions on which it is exacted are not created but taken as they are found but of the man of law especially in the station of judge by whose power and in some shape or other for whose benefit the money is exacted in the name of a fee it has been in the power to create the occasions on which it is exacted which accordingly he has done and in this difference the immense load of misery so regularly manufactured by judges their connexions and dependents has found its cause the amount of this mischief has in some sort found its expression in the difference between the amount of factitious delay vexation and expense habitually created in the technical mode of procedure styled on this account the feegathering as contradistinguished from that natural mode which without a total dissolution of the bonds of society could not have been by its overbearing antagonist utterly expelled see scotch reform letter i throughout of these fees by the concourse as usual of sinister design and accident masses of emolument of different bulks from that of a bare subsistence to ten twenty or even thirty thousand pounds ayear and upwards exacted by so many different persons have been composed and here comes the community of sinister interest by which the judges of all the high judicatories without exception—and in particular the chief justice of the kings bench—the mastermanufacturer of libel law—and in effect the absolute master of the press—have been linked together linked with each other and with some of the most influential members of those supreme assemblies    from which alone remedy to abuse in this or any other shape can come where of the masses of emolument thus formed the bulk has been to a certain degree moderate being received in all cases in the name of reward for service the reward has been suffered to remain in the pocket of him by whom the service has been performed where it has happened to the mass to swell to such a bulk as to attract the notice of irresistible rapacity in a higher sphere it has been fastened upon as a prey and a comparatively small pittance though by the experiment proved to constitute an adequate compensation for the burthen of the service being left to the lowseated individual by whom the service was performed the remainder has been seized by the highseated personage by whom in that shape no service whatever has been rendered even in pretence and to whom in many instances it has never been necessary that he should have rendered to the public any the smallest service whatsoever in that or any other shape of these enormous masses of miserymaking emolument outstripping by far in magnitude if not in mischievousness whatever has been produced by the judicial system of any other the most outrageously misgoverned country some have been seized by judges and above all by the chief justice of the kings bench—others having been left in the hands of the crown have fallen a prey to the vultures that hover about a court and here we see a natural bond of the closest union between court and bench at present it may be said—whatsoever may have been the case formerly—at present no such sinister interest is created by any of these masses of emolument for at present—the maxim having been established that no mass of emolument in possession and obtained without breach of law shall be taken from any man without an equivalent—no man has any interest in the retention of them—neither a judge nor any one else to this observation the colour of reason is not wanting but the substance is allowances which under the spur of reform have thus been given by the legislature under the name of equivalents have scarce ever been complete of the masses of emolument in question viz those attached to sinecure or overpaid judicial offices it is the nature to go on increasing as population and wealth increase from year to year and this even in the way of natural increase and setting aside whatsoever factitious increase may be contrived to be given to them by the combined ingenuity of the partnership but by any allowances that should be given in lieu of them under the name of equivalents no such increase would be experienced they would be fixed sums in the nature of pensions of those ever increasing masses of emolument not only the possessors but the expectants know of course much better than to submit to any commutation so long as by any means not punishable it appears possible to avoid it pillaging the future as well as the present the gavestons and spensers of successive ages—nor let the present be forgotten—contrived to obtain in expectancy those masses of illcollected and illbestowed wealth life after life passion and policy have here acted in alliance passion seized on the booty policy rendered it the more secure the more enormous the prey the greater and more burthensome would be the compensation necessary to be given for it under the name of an equivalent so long as the burthen falls on men whose afflictions are productive of no disturbance to the ease of the man of finance it tells for nothing see protest against law taxes so long as the burthen continues to be imposed by a tax which though beyond comparison more mischievous than any other was not of his imposition the man of finance had no personal concern in the matter and how enormous soever may be the mass of misery produced it formed no object of his care but to provide the compensation if that came to be provided was so much hard labour to him while of those he has to deal with and to cajole the great crowd is composed of such as care not what mischief is produced by a tax or anything else they are used to but cry out of course against everything of that sort as of any other sort when it is new the law moreover is a sort of black lottery a lottery of all prizes indeed without blanks but the prizes so many negative quantities instead of so much profit so much loss and the same confidence in fortune which secures to a mans imagination the acquisition of prizes in the state lottery so called secures to it the avoidance of them in the lottery of the law and thus it is that by every continuance given to this species of depredation a fresh obstacle to the abolition of it is opposed you call this economy do you know then that by this economy of yours the mass of public burthen so far from being diminished will be increased cries the ironhearted sophist in whose balance the heaviest load of misery in which he and his confederates expect not to bear a share weighs but as a feather turn now to the despot of the press and consider what in this state of things the plan of policy is which in his situation a man may be expected to pursue his first object would of course be the affording the most effectual protection to abuse in those instances in which  00 the benefit of it is in the whole or in part reaped by himself and his own immediate connexions but to protect that same abuse with its benefit against limitation and even reduction under the name of compensation might require support and alliance elsewhere to protect with effect the abuses the benefit of which accrued immediately to himself it would therefore be necessary for him to extend his protection without distinction to all established abuses from which any other man so situated as to be capable of giving him the needful support derived or could conceive himself to derive in any shape a benefit in a word to act in the character of protectorgeneral of all established abuses the liberty of the press being their common and irreconcilable enemy the liberty of the press became the necessary object of their common and interminable war existing it was to be destroyed not existing it was so long as possible to be prevented from coming into existence and here we see the knights service looked to at the hands of the guinea corps and its squires of the energy and effect with which this conspiracy among governors against good government has been carried on diverse exemplifications will present themselves as we advance §   incapacity in judges and their high allies—its hostility to the press by this copartnership in the profits of misrule the bond of union formed as above between judges and the other leading members of government is a constant one but besides this there is another which how frequently soever exemplified may in comparison of the former be termed an occasional one i speak of that in which incapacity—congenial and mutually sympathizing incapacity—is the cementing principle suppose a judge—no matter in what particular respect—incapable of discharging the duties of his office discharging them ill or—what constitutes the most palpaple of all exemplifications of incapacity—not at all if on the part of the suitors to whom such his incapacity has been a source of injury—or on the part of other persons prompted by sympathy for their sufferings or by the pure love of justice facts indicative of this incapacity or complaints grounded on those facts were made public the consequence might be—an obligation on his part to withdraw from the situation his continuance in which had rendered him an instrument of such extensive injury to any such unfit judge a free press would naturally be an object no less odious and formidable than a prison to an ordinary delinquent whose situation had not elevated him above the reach of justice but by the same cause incapacity by which a free press is thus rendered an object of hatred and terror to a functionary seated in the situation of judge it would of course be rendered an object of the like emotions to a functionary in any other situation to a functionary to whose apprehension any the least danger were to present itself  0  of his seeing such his deficiency exposed to view men who to all practical purposes are seated above the law and the existence of an indefinite multitude of men selfseated in the situation is a fact unhappily but too incontestible men so circumstanced as they—have nothing to fear from any other quarter—so as far as they have anything at all to fear from any quarter—have everything to fear from the liberty of the press accordingly where on an occasion already spoken of the recent grand attack was made upon that branch of english liberties and for the more effectual accomplishment of those purposes if of any purposes at all the modern case de famosis libellis was displayed to view and the fundamental principles of libel law developed and adapted to existing circumstances—among the propositions laid down upon that occasion was—that in speaking viz in print of any man placed in a high situation to say anything meaning to infer that he is illplaced in such his high situation is a libel and this even although his unfitness for that high situation be of no worse sort than that which is not incompatible with his being fit for the ordinary walks of life if there be any way in which it is possible for the hand of power to afford protection and encouragement to misrule—to misrule in all its branches—it is surely this viz the threatening with the vengeance of the law all such as shall do anything towards holding it up to public view and towards this end whether anything which it is possible to do by the exercise of judicial power has been left undone let this doctrine together with the sentences with which in other prosecutions it has been followed up declare but the persons at whose instance and for whose protection these sacrifices were made—these sacrifices of public welfare to private convenience—were a junto of great characters—some learned some unlearned—placed but whether well or ill let him pronounce to whom liberty and imprisonment are matters of indifference placed at any rate somehow or other in high situations and in the instance of some of these great characters how urgent the demand was for this sort of sacrifice will at the peril of imprisonment appear in another place chapter viii the exchequer packing office suffices keeping the liberty of the press as it were in a state of constant annihilation if the expression may be allowed being thus among persons in high situation in these days of unexampled purity the common object—the one and almost the only one in the attachment to which the agreement is among them constant and almost universal—come we now to the convenience afforded by the chief jurypacking office for so necessary an operation by the chief jurypacking office i mean on this occasion that one of the seven which has for its master packer the deputyremembrancer of the exchequer to this distinction the title of that office is rendered incontestible by two considerations—  the permanence and thence the operations of which it is the result are in the instance of that office avowed by the judge and defended by him upon principle   the number of juries thus nominated in that office is equal to little less than that of all the juries nominated in like manner in all the other offices put together the proposition to be proved is—that though the exchequer—the judicatory to which this office belongs is not itself the judicatory in which the operation of crushing the liberty of the press is carried on yet for the purpose of that operation the system of package and the collection of permanent special jurymen which compose the produce of that system are no less effectually sufficient than if the scene of the chief part of the jurypacking business were an office immediately under the judicatory in which the business of crushing the liberty of the press is carried on on this head little remains but to recapitulate here may be seen the grand house of call for guineamen here the receivinghouse in which the recruits are enlisted here the parade on which they are drilled here the grand musterroll—the select and secret qualified list—on which they are entered here the registeroffice in which their connexions c and thence their qualifications are registered and accordingly inquired after by all lips to which the information can be of use but why it may still be said lay so much emphasis on the exchequer if the exchequer has its two master packers has not the kings bench as many yes but in the exchequer the permanence which but for actual packing could not have place is as hath just been mentioned irrevocably confessed or rather professed in the kings bench no such avowal can be produced it is in the exchequer alone that the main body of this corps being in constant service it is there and there alone that with certainty and without effort the trustworthiness—the degree of discipline—of each member is known to the whole staff†  0  to this office therefore it is that in case of need when a libeller for example is to be punished for calling a man in high situation by his fathers title or for questioning his fitness for his office a solicitor to the crown would send his order—saying pick me out a good dozen for kings bench service oh—but all this—so far at least as concerns kings bench and libel law—is but mere surmise the work of audacious imagination in the exchequer be it as you say but in the kings bench no such packing can be proved no such purposed selection ever yet took place there at least all is simplicity there all is purity thus far my objector but could even any such negative be demonstrated still the reasons for the pulling down of all jurypacking offices—for the complete abolition of the guinea trade—for the disbanding of this standing army—this noble army not of martyrs but of martyrizers—would not lose any thing of their force down to this day nothing of the kind has been done be it so but why because down to this day nothing of the kind has been necessary come tomorrow and the necessity may come along with it and so sure as the necessity of the practice comes so sure the practice comes along with it convenience—slight convenience—has long since sufficed to establish the practice in one judicatory the exchequer and the united forces of selfpreservation and vengeance will they not in case of need suffice to establish the same practice in the kings bench in the kings bench as well as in the exchequer the officer whose practice is thus open to suspicion actually exists by him the selection is actually made—made in every individual instance by him whether he will or no a certain quantity of information relative to the characters and dispositions of the individuals out of whom he has to choose is possessed thus much is matter of notoriety and the only proposition liable to be made a question of is—whether in the view of gaining additional information it be likely that in case of need he or those whose interest in the business is more immediate—for example in a state libel case the solicitor of the crown—will seek for it at the hands of the correspondent officer of that other court in which the opportunities of obtaining that sort of information are more abundant to such a question can there be any other answer than this if of the sort of information in question there be in the judgment of those whose interest it is that the judgment be correct a deficiency in the kings bench to that other court and that office in it which is best able to supply the deficiency application will accordingly be made if no such deficiency then no such application but if in the kings bench there be no such deficiency then so it is that in the kings bench the mischief in question exists already in its full force in a cause in the exchequer inquiry at the hands of the officer by whom those jurors are selected it is in the books of practice stated we have seen as being on the part of the solicitor on each side a matter of duty regularly recurring and regularly fulfilled that which in the exchequer it is matter of duty to the solicitor to be inquisitive about can it in the kings bench be matter of duty to him not to know in the exchequer the permanence being by the chief judge avowed and justified the selection—in a word the packing—without which the permanence could not have been established—is thereby avowed and justified along with it of the matter of justification which in the judgment of the chief judge is in the exchequer so conclusive is it credible that there should be any deficiency—and in a case of libel law too—in the kings bench to confound social order—to destroy the characters of all public men—to defame the justice of the country—to bring government itself into hatred and contempt—conspiracy to do all this and more—necessity of defeating it—ferment raised by wicked and artful men—necessity of allaying it—respect for every thing that is respectable on the point of being shaken off—necessity of fastening it on all these topics—with a thousand others equally conclusive—all of them in such wellexercised and skilful hands—can they fail of furnishing argument enough to justify the adopting in one court a practice which with so complete a success has so long been established in another  0  were it possible that for such unction the cruise for example of mr justice groses eloquence should ever fail—fail when addressed if needful to his own subordinate—addressed  0  in form to none but the culprit libeller who for his better instruction in the art of decorum is about to be sent to school for a few years at dorchester or gloucester—addressed in form to none but this one scholar but moreover in effect to the master packer who is sitting under the head master all the while—were it in the nature of things that such a fountain should run dry is not the eloquence of mr bowles published and to be published or even though it were not published always at command thus then in respect of law and practice in the field of libel law and in respect of the liberties disposed of by it stands the result in a case let us now return to abstractions in which the personal interests and passions of the judge or of any of his closest connexions are most deeply affected the selection of the individuals by whom in the character of jurymen a check is supposed to be constantly applied to the power of the judge is as constantly in the power of the very person or persons to whose power the authority of these assessors is supposed to operate as a check and this with the fullest and freshest information not only of their characters and circumstances in every respect but also of their disposition in relation to this as well as all other points of judicature that come under their cognizance if this statement be correct what are jurors in all such cases but mere puppets—jurytrial but a solemn indeed but disastrous puppetshow the judge but showman who with the intervention of a system of machinery more or less complicated moves the wires the judge who in the sort of case in which his interests and passions are most deeply affected is in effect judge sole judge in his own cause i spoke of decorum yes it is for breaches of decorum that under a judicatory thus constituted libellers and who is there that is not a libeller have so recently been crushed by punishments of such unexampled rigour for a libel on the king imprisonment for two years for libels on judges and let not the climax pass unnoticed—for libels on judges parties and judges in their own cause—imprisonment for three years with et cæteras—imprisonment to the destruction of livelihood in a scene of secluded penitence† nor  0  let this be unremembered—viz that in the most recent of those cases perseverance—perseverance in this novel track of rigour—is announced but under libel law as it stands—and now that the punishment awaiting a delinquent is understood to be thus destructive—can you really regard it it may be said a probable event that a special jury of englishmen who cannot all of them be supposed to be regardless of english liberties will persevere in pursuing a course which in your view of it would be so completely destructive of english liberties for admitting that under the influence of a sinister interest so constituted obsequiousness will carry a man a certain length it follows not by any means that to the sinister effect of such influence there should be absolutely no limits even from persons thus unhappily exposed to temptation can depravity such as that would be be seriously to be apprehended in english bosoms is there no such sense as a sense of shame      i answer—that to destroy the de facto liberty of the press as completely as the de jure liberty of it has for ages been destroyed there needs not any sort of conduct to which any such word as depravity or anything like it is wont to be applied—in a word that there needs not on the part of any one individual breathing anything which any man can reasonably be expected to be ashamed of but for the reader to be the more effectually impressed with the truth of this proposition three other matters of fact present themselves as necessary to be borne in mind   that with libel law in its freshest state—the state in which it is declaredly ready and about to be enforced—enforced by punishments the rigour of which has just been brought to view—the existence of a de facto liberty of the press in any sense in which it is capable of operating as a check to misconduct in any shape on the part of public men is perfectly incompatible i mean if the intentions declared as above be with any tolerable degree of steadiness and consistency pursued   that by the mode in which judges are in use to direct—and without exposing themselves to reproach or so much as complaint may for ever continue to direct juries it is rendered difficult to a degree of hopelessness for a jury without setting its face in a style of marked opposition against the opinion of the judge to avoid convicting a man as for a libel be the paper of a sort ever so necessary to the preservation of english liberties   that the fixation of the punishment not lying within the province of the jury no consideration grounded on its magnitude can operate in such a manner as to afford to the publisher of any the most meritorious composition any chance of acquittal at their hands a small sample of libel law in its freshest state will form the business of the next chapter chapter ix instruments for crushing the liberty of the press §   doctrines and rules a view of libel law as it is confronted with a view of what it ought to be is destined for a separate publication slight indeed and consequently imperfect and inadequate is the only view that can be given of it here but without something under this head of the most fatal of all the effects of the packing system—of that in comparison of which all others put together are as nothing—not any even the slightest conception could have been conveyed even the slight sample or two which have incidentally presented themselves may have been sufficient to induce a suspicion and that not a light one—that the treatment which under the notion of law has been given—and at this moment is ready to be given—to  0  the press is if persevered in with any tolerable degree of steadiness incompatible with every political—not to say moral—use of it a fundamental sophism from which every other rule doctrine or maxim draws its mischief is one that from having never been announced in words is not the less but the more mischievous it consists in confounding on this ground demand for punishment with demand for disapprobation or what comes exactly to the same thing assuming that the one being established the other follows of course is this proper is this decent is this endurable ask the orator reinforcing at every step the intensity of the disapprobation which the appeal thus made to the passions is calculated to call forth at the same time in whatever degree if in any that hostile sentiment be actually called forth verdict of guilty is the verdict the necessity of which is thus constantly assumed and which by the delusive force of the assumption is but too constantly produced reducing this notion to a determinate proposition with a correspondent practical rule let us add to it a few others expressive as far as they go of the actual state of libel law stating under the head of each the documents from which it has been deduced taken together they will suffice it is apprehended to establish—and with a degree of evidence sufficient at least to the present purpose—that under libel law as it is prosecution and conviction are the same thing and that when a political libel is the offence the form of jury trial is but a melancholy farce   a written and published discourse is a libel and every person who contributes to the communication of it punishable in respect of it if there be to be found in it any passage or passages the tendency of which is in any degree to expose government i e any member or members of the governing body—considered in that character—to disesteem rule—punish whatever tends to bring a man in power into disesteem   — or in relation to any person in any high situation affording any inference representing him as illplaced in it and questioning his fitness for it rule—punish whatever imputes unfitness to any man in

ireland and mr marsden under secretary of state for ireland on which information the defendant was tried in the court of kings bench at westminster on thursday the   th of may   0  before the lord chiefjustice lord ellenborough and a special jury the words of the several passages quoted are copied from that report n b this libel is the same on account of which mr justice johnson judge of the court of common pleas in ireland was afterwards to wit on the   d of november   0  convicted in the character of the author on a trial at bar in the court of kings bench in england §  —   rule concerning disesteem proof of the rule—ch justice p    —it is no new doctrine that if a publication be calculated to alienate the affections of the people by bringing the government into disesteem whether the expedient be ridicule or obloquy the person so conducting himself is exposed to the inflictions of the law it is a crime it has ever been considered as a crime whether it be wrapped up in one form or another the case of the king v tutchin decided in the time of lord chiefjustice holt has removed all ambiguity from this question thus far the lord chiefjustice while these pages are writing persons out of number are amusing themselves with rendering what i hope appears to themselves at least good service to the country by complaining of abuses which to them appear as if existing in the government of it and to some at least of these persons these abuses appear to have swelled to such a magnitude as that nothing short of an alteration in the mode of representation in parliament can operate as a sufficient remedy have or have not such proceedings and such publications a tendency not only to bring the government into disesteem but to alienate the affections of the people from something or other—forexample from a parliament composed as at present if yes and if to any person so occupied it  0  should happen to cast an eye upon this page i would beseech him to ask of himself whether a cell in dorchester or gloucester jail be or be not a fit abode for him—to consider whether he be in a state of fit preparation for a visit of some years length to either of those theatres of lawful reform—and in what manner accommodation may in the most convenient manner be provided in those or some other boardinghouses of the same class for himself and the quantity of company whom he ought to have there another hint to reformers—among the situations at the disposal of this noble and learned teacher of the arts of decency and candour—situations the profit of which helps to constitute that part of his lordships remuneration which is composed of patronage is one which in      produced from £  00 to £  00 ayear part of the profit of which consists in the letting of lodgings for which it is part of his lordships occupation to provide lodgers amidst the demands which the execution of the law thus delineated would if executed with anything like impartiality be productive of for accommodations in this and other such schools of reformation would not forecast suggest the endeavouring to secure some of the most convenient of these lodgings by a suitable retaining fee §  —   rule concerning feelings proofs—ch justice p    —     by the law of england there is no impunity to any person publishing anything that is injurious to the feelings and happiness of an individual      ib if a man publish a paper he is exposed to the penal consequences as he is in every other act if it be illegal and it is illegal if it tends to the prejudice of any individual   ib     the question for your consideration is whether this paper is such as would be injurious to the individuals and whether c   p     it has been observed that it is the right of the british subject to exhibit the folly or imbecility of the members of the government but gentlemen we must confine ourselves within limits if in so doing individual feelings are violated there the line of interdiction begins and the offence becomes the subject of penal visitation   ib if you are of opinion that the publications are hurtful to the individuals or to the government you will find the defendant guilty on putting together these passages all out of the same speech—out of the same charge and that not a very long one—it seems evident enough that if they mean anything they mean this—viz that it is a crime for any man to write anything which it happens to any other man not to like or more shortly that if a man publishes what he writes under lord ellenborough at least it is a crime to write for what published book was ever written—and being written read—in which somebody or other has not found something or other that he did not like—in plain language that he did not like or in the language of avenging sentimentality that was not injurious prejudicial hurtful or violational—add for further enrichment of the language vulnerary to him or to his feelings and how am i to know whether what i am writing and meaning to publish will or will not meet with any man to whose feelings it will be injurious and so forth why by his prosecuting me or not prosecuting me and if he prosecute me what will be the consequence why that i have committed a crime and must be convicted of course for if his taking upon himself the expense and vexation of carrying on a criminal prosecution be not a proof that his feelings have been injured prejudiced hurt or violated nothing else can be therefore as already observed admit but this doctrine to be good law—and coming from the source from which it comes how can it be otherwise—prosecution for a libel is in every case itself evidence that the paper prosecuted for is a libel and that evidence is conclusive the criterion—it must be confessed—the criterion thus afforded is an extremely simple one no man can fail—or at least no man can long fail—to know whether he is or is not under prosecution if then for anything that i have written i am not yet prosecuted what i have written is not as yet a libel if for anything in that way i am already under prosecution then it is a libel such being the criterion to the noble and learned inventor nothing—it may well be presumed—can be more satisfactory but to us without doors who are as yet out of jail and who if we did but know how had rather continue at large than be locked up in one is there any and what course left open for learning at any earlier point of time whether this or that article which it would be satisfactory to us to see made public will or will not be productive of an effect which to us would be so serious a one a highsheriff for example or other chairman of a county or other meeting in which a set of resolutions are voted imputing either folly or imbecility or corruption to any of those right honourable persons to whom those qualities or some of them have of late in one or other meeting of that sort been now and then imputed—any such presiding character though not a great character wishing to  0  give to these resolutions a certain degree of publicity and at the same time not wishing to pass his time in a prison though it were for no more than three or even for no more than two years—what is he to do for knowing what on a given occasion a mans feelings will be—or rather and to come somewhat closer to the point what on that occasion he will declare his feelings to be—i know of one course and but one which is—to put the question to himself on this principle to save circumlocutory description i will venture to submit to the consideration of such gentlemen as it may concern the form of a note which short and simple as it is may it is humbly hoped be found to be not the less well adapted to the purpose— circular mr—or sir— presents his respectful compliments to lord castlereagh and begs the favour of being informed whether the exhibition of his lordships folly or his lordships imbecility or his lordships corruption should it take place would be prejudicial hurtful injurious or violational to his lordship or to his lordships feelings the like to the right honourable spencer perceval c c c to any such chairman who though not a great character will at any rate be a distinguished one should it happen to be apprized of the qualification which from certain exemplifications whereof presently that have been given of the magnanimity of the said mr perceval may by implication be understood as being allowed to be in a certain sense and under certain restrictions capable of exempting a man from the lot to which a liberty of this nature would otherwise so justly doom him—should it happen to him accordingly to be capable of making the proper responses to the catechism formed by that no less religious than highborn and highseated gentleman—and in particular to his grand latin question quo patre natus—wrapping himself up in mr percevals virtue as if it were his own what may also happen to him is—to turn aside with disdain from this humble but wellmeant endeavour to save him from what it may happen to him not to like but whatsoever may happen to be the security real or imagined of a person so distinguished the resource may not be altogether beneath the attention of those who like myself belong to the undistinguished herd i mean the printers who propose to print the booksellers who propose to sell any such resolutions as well as the readers to whom in reading of them it might happen not to take sufficient care to keep their tenor and purport to themselves §  —   rule concerning unfitness in high situations ch justice p    —after having on the occasion of a sentence mentioned above undertaken as above to enumerate the libels contained in that one sentence coming to that which in this list happens to occupy the second place—he admits says his lordship speaking of the libeller—he admits this noble person lord hardwicke to be celebrated for understanding the modern method of fatting a sheep as well as any man in cambridgeshire—now gentlemen continues the lord chiefjustice what does this mean does it not clearly mean to infer that lord hardwicke is illplaced in his high situation and that he is only fit for the common walks of life thus far the lord chiefjustice—among the persons just spoken of as being suspected—and surely not altogether without apparent cause—of endeavours used to bring the government into disesteem i have observed some by whom declarations have been made expressive of an opinion—and that too pronounced still more clearly than in the way of inference—concerning lord viscount castlereagh and the now right honourable spencer perceval—the same right honourable person whom we then observed officiating we have seen how in the character of his majestys attorneygeneral—as being respectively somewhat illplaced in one of their high situations after passing eighteen months in prison for one of the two libels thus uttered and made public the libellers of whom i am speaking are they prepared to pass another eighteen months in the same place and condition for the other of these same libels being a man that writes or even though he be but a man that thinks—whosoever prefers liberty to imprisonment safety to destruction let him think of these things to doubt the fitness of him whom the sovereign hath chosen borders near on sacrilege such is the rule laid down by some learned lawlord chiefjustice of the emperors bench in the time of the emperor justinian—sacrilegii eniminstar est dubitare an is dignus sit quem elegerit imperator c ff        of the constellation of great characters in high situations by whom the rule thus copied and those others that match so well with it have been called for and laid down let any one who dares and who to use the words of the lord chiefbaron thinks it worth while say—that they or any of them are illplaced in or unfit for those their respective situations thus much however may be a question—though alas it is but a speculative and barren one—whether for their own feelings at least they are not more particularly some of  0  them rather unfortunately placed in point of time in england in these our days at this early part of the nineteenth century their feelings are forced to content themselves with comparatively scanty gratifications gratifications such as may be afforded for example by the spectacle of a judge driven off the bench and a few years—as yet no more than a few years—imprisonment bestowed upon a few paltry booksellers and without seeking to send them or any of them so far back as to those imperial times from which this rule of theirs was with so much fidelity transcribed or even of those of our own first defender of the faith who even without the benefit of the act called in the newspapers sometimes the cutting act sometimes the ellenborough act enjoyed in the course of his life the deaths of no fewer than  0000 of his subjects in the character of criminals—had the noble and learned godfather of that law been as free to choose the time as he is the place of his circuits would not the western circuit anno      have been a choice more congenial to feelings such as his than any circuit can now be in these degenerate days ubi pro duritie temporum as the learned anatomist so feelingly laments vivos homines dissecari non licet when in plain english such is the hardness such the ferment of and in the times that men cannot be found to be cut up alive for the amusement of learned eyes so that noble lords and honourable gentlemen who have a taste for torture understand for witnessing it not for feeling it are reduced to content themselves with such inferior yet nevertobepartedwith gratifications as the agonies of bulls dogs cats and horses can afford §  —   rule concerning dislike follows a list of qualities which on the supposition of their being to be found in a discourse of any kind have been stated as being of a nature to excite in the breast of any person by whom it is heard or read a sentiment of disapprobation or dislike the existence of which sentiment has by the chiefjustice of the kings bench or by the attorneygeneral with the concurrence of the said chiefjustice been stated as constituting a sufficient warrant for pronouncing such discourse it being consigned to writing libellous and for punishing with any number of years imprisonment besides other punishments every person who in any way has contributed to the communication of it—   want of fairness   want of liberality   flippancy   deviation from decency   unbecomingness   impropriety   slanderousness   illnature   want of candour  0 tendency to ridicule    contradictoriness—viz with reference to matter of opinion advanced by another person follow now the correspondent passages serving as grounds of this doctrine—proofs of the existence of the corresponding rule— it cannot with reason and therefore it is presumed it will not be expected that on the occasion of every one of these qualities either the chiefjustice or under his allowance the attorneygeneral shall in precise logical form be seen exhibiting and reexhibiting to the jury an argument in any such words as these—viz this quality exists in the discourse in question—the quality and in respect of it the discourse will be regarded by you with disapprobation or dislike—therefore in consideration of such disapprobation or dislike even although the discourse should be found to contain no other passage in it having the effect of exciting in your breast the like sentiment you will regard yourselves as bound to join in pronouncing against the defendant the verdict guilty that such throughout was their intention may surely be regarded as placed sufficiently out of doubt by the following considerations the purpose and sole purpose for which on that occasion the defendant was brought before the jury was—that it might be ascertained whether in respect of the discourse in question he was in the character of a libeller guilty and as such punishable in any other view than that of contributing to this effect had anything been either by the chiefjustice or the attorneygeneral said of the discourse in question it would have been irrelevant and not merely irrelevant but insidious and injurious having for its object and tendency the causing a man to be convicted as if it were criminal on account of a portion of discourse which in their own opinions was not criminal not but that on several of these occasions the passage taken for the subject of animadversion is in express terms pronounced by one or other of these official persons a libel or libellous—and since in this respect no line of distinction is drawn between any one of the passages so animadverted upon and any other it will surely not be regarded by anybody as a question open to dispute whether among all these several qualities and all these several corresponding passages there were any one in respect of which it was not part of the design and endeavour of the official persons in question to cause the passage to be by the jury reputed libellous and the defendant dealt with accordingly in respect of it the qualities successively ascribed to the various parts of the printed discourse and in respect of which it is supposed to be the design and endeavour of the spoken speech to cause the discourses to be considered as libellous are hereinafter designated and introduced by the words quality or qualities the passages respectively adduced to serve   0 as proofs that on the occasion of each such respective quality such was the design and endeavour are designated and introduced by the words proof or proofs i qualities—  want of fairness   want of liberality proof—attorneygeneral p     now gentlemen is there anything in all this that can be called a fair and liberal description of a public character       ii qualities—  flippancy   deviation from decency proof—attorneygeneral p     gentlemen i have already adverted to the indecency and flippancy of many expressions made use of in this libel if this libeller had been hurried away with the temptation of saying a flippant thing i should not have thought it a subject of criminal prosecution but in the case before you it is criminal as indicating the spirit with which it was written and as being descriptive of the mind of the man at the time he was making them i would not however be understood to say that even in the warmth of discussion upon public men and public measures decency of language ought not to be preserved and that any deviation therefrom is not punishable     here the doctrine in question is directly avowed by the attorneygeneral avowed and by the chiefjustice never contradicted viz that for every written discourse to which a deviation from decency can with propriety be imputed a publisher is punishable iii qualities—  unbecomingness and again flippancy proof—attorneygeneral p   0 surely no one who has the least liberality of feeling could think it becoming to taunt such a gentleman as mr addington taunt him viz by naming him by his fathers title p     i again say that for any publication calling mr addington doctor addington or any flippancy of that nature standing by itself i should think it beneath the dignity of that right honourable gentleman to make it the subject of a prosecution n b—beneath his dignity only not above his power learn we hence that if at this moment there exists out of a jail any such person as a newspaper editor or a political writer on any other than one side it is owing to the joint magnanimity of such a gentleman as mr perceval and such a gentleman as mr addington iv qualities—  impropriety as intimated by the word ought   slanderousness   illnature proof—attorneygeneral p     after speaking of divers passages in which lord hardwicke had been spoken of as being a good father a kind husband fond of literature and agricultural pursuits— qualities like these continues he ought to have made the libeller pause before he ventured to attack such a chahracter       gentlemen you must shut your eyes—if you do not see that these amiable qualities are attributed to lord hardwicke with a slanderous with an illnatured meaning v qualities—  want of candour proof—attorneygeneral p   0 will any man believe that there is any degree of candour in saying that all that has been done by the british government for ireland is to send them a sheepfeeder from cambridgeshire and a strongbuilt chancerypleader from lincolnsinn when i tell you that     ireland     is defended c c learn we hence that whatever degree of candour there may happen to be in any given discourse it is in the power of the honourable spencer perceval—but whether in his character of spencer perceval or in his character of attorneygeneral that we are left to learn as we can—at any rate in the power of somebody—and the safest conclusion seems to be in the power of any and every man that is in power—to divest the discourse of such its candour and thereby subject the author and publisher of it to punishment and this by so easy a process as telling the jury anything that shall have the effect of a contradiction to this or that part of the discourse on this head not a particle of mr attorneygenerals law howsoever objected to as we shall see by the defendants counsel is dissented from by the chiefjustice on the contrary from what immediately follows let any man judge whether by implication at least—by necessary implication—it has not the whole of it been confirmed vi qualities— 0 tendency to ridicule proof—chiefjustice p     upon the above and other passages the observation of the defendants counsel mr adam had been p     that if the doctrine so laid down were admitted     the freedom of discussion relative to public men and public measures would depend—not upon a point of right but upon the taste of the attorneygeneral and that the controul which the attorneygeneral is thus desirous of putting upon it the liberty of the press would go to extinguish it for ever p     ridicule he had afterwards contended p     is a weapon which may be fairly and honourably employed especially when it is in the true spirit of english humour and for an object purely of a public nature after speaking of the nickname of carlo khan formerly given to charles fox and the print of a colossus comprehending all scotland within the stride of its patronage—when after adducing these examples he goes on to say lord hardwicke is again represented     as devoted to agricultural pursuits     he finds himself thus interrupted by the lord chiefjustice— do you maintain that a person has a right to ridicule his neighbour—mr adam—this is an information for a public libel and not for private ridicule lord ellenborough—i suppose you have some authority i do not wish to restrain your arguments but it is a doctrine which never was and never can be maintained vii qualities—   contradictoriness viz when manifested in terms of a certain degree of strength towards some proposition or propositions that have been advanced by some one else n b—in the instance in question it was a mere matter of opinion relative to the state of the nation not any specific matter of fact proof—chiefjustice p     afterwards in his charge speaking of one of the sentences in the paper his lordship says p     now the libels in this sentence are these—thereupon coming to one of them he proceeds and exclaims is it to be endured that it should be said of any person but more especially of a person sitting in the capacity of a judge that he had poured a broadside upon the truth of the fact—n b sitting in the capacity of a judge yes so the judge in question mr justice osborne was but how not hearing a cause but haranguing upon politics the disapprobation excited by this expression in the bosom of our lord chiefjustice was it seems of such a strength as to be past endurance a similar if not exactly equal sentiment is what he assures himself of finding prevalent in the bosoms of the jurors the guineamen to whom he is addressing himself and on this sentiment it is that he relies as sufficient of itself to entitle him to expect at their hands a verdict of guilty enabling him to subject the victim to any number of years close imprisonment in a scene of solitude the word fiction will of itself suffice to satisfy any person who can endure to look into blackstones appendix with the corresponding chapters in this view that in the universal scramble for fees of which the jurisdiction of the westminsterhall courts in its present state is the result the war was carried on in no other manner and by no other arms than by broadsides which then were and still continue to be poured upon the truth of facts if then anything like consistency were to be expected among persons in such high situations so far exalted above all need of consistency and all fear of shame long ago would every man who has ever vended or in any other way contributed to the dissemination of the contents of blackstones commentaries have been prosecuted by the hon spencer perceval and convicted as of course by one of lord ellenboroughs juries signing a notorious falsehood—is this pouring a broadside upon fact if so is there a term in which broadsides are not poured upon facts by hundreds not to say thousands—poured by the very hand of this very judge with fees for the same or to his profit and under his orders by the smoke of these broadsides have not the paths of judicial procedure been converted into—what they were meant to be converted into—a jungle penetrable to the eyes of tigers impenetrable to the eyes of suitors who such of them as do not perish in it are dragged through it before he was what he is—this noble and learned lord chiefjustice—was he not an advocate does not the occupation of an advocate consist in pouring broadsides upon the truth of facts—of whatsoever facts are set up for him as a mark by the attorney who brings him his brief with this or that number of guineas marked on the back of it was not he a special pleader knows he not what a sham plea is the distinction between the cases in which falsehood is either allowed of or compelled and those in which it is made punishable had it ever—has it to this day—any better object than the enabling wellpaid marksmen to pour broadsides upon the truth of facts scotch reform letter i device  0 mendacitylicence what is endurable—yes and endured and with as much complacency as if vice were virtue and falsehood necessary to justice is—that by these guardians of public morals broadsides should be poured without ceasing—poured upon the truth of facts—what is not endurable is—that they should be told of it decency and candour what important words how necessary is correctness to the conceptions which it may happen to a man to have annexed to them what is there that does not depend upon it open one report more which shall be quoted presently and you may see the whole fabric of english liberty hanging upon the import of these two

against the proprietor and printer of a sunday newspaper called the independent whig for a libel upon mr justice le blanc and the jury before whom the captain of a merchant ship had been tried for murder at the oldbailey      grose j said it certainly was lawful with decency and candour to discuss the propriety of the verdict of a jury or the decision of a judge and if the defendants should be thought to have done no more in this instance they would be entitled to an acquittal but on the contrary they had transgressed the law and ought to be convicted if the extracts from the newspaper set out in the information contained no reasoning or discussion but only declamation and invective and were written not with a view to elucidate the truth but to injure the characters of individuals and to bring into hatred and contempt the administration of justice in the country the defendants were found guilty on this and a similar information and sentenced to three years imprisonment thus far the reporter the similar information was for a similar libel on lord ellenborough the lord chiefjustice you to whose imagination any such imprudent fancy should at any time present itself as that of taking for the subject of free discussion under favour of any such licence as above the decisions or the conduct of an english judge would you know whether the expressions that have presented themselves to your pen are consistent with the rules of decency and candour go to the house of penitence at dorchester or gloucester—repent there for three years or any such increased number of years as for the allaying of the increasing ferment shall have been deemed necessary—repent and when your course of penitence has there been run through perhaps even at the commencement of it when beyond hope of mercy it has by your sentence been announced to you—then it is that you will be informed and know all that it is intended you shall know and what is that not by what means those rules may in all cases be observed but by what means in one instance they have been violated behold then in the kings bench the royal school of decency a school the discipline of which has however this to distinguish it from ordinary schools—for example from the other royal school within view of it—viz that whereas in dr careys school instruction comes first and then in case of transgression if the transgression be wilful and perverse perhaps correction afterwards—stripes say half a dozen in lord ellenboroughs school correction or peradventure under the name of correction destruction comes first and it is from this correction or this destruction that for the first time and without the possibility of learning it from any other source or at any earlier period the scholar derives the satisfaction of learning how he ought to have behaved himself §   terror issuing from the darkness of the doctrines if by competent and acknowledged legislative authority and in and by any determinate assemblage of determinate words such as are the words of every act of parliament maxims even such as those that we have been seeing were consigned to writing and established—established though it were in these very words—the very words that we have just seen—the condition of englishmen would be a condition of security in comparison of what it is at present but by no such authority in no such determinate form of words has this part of the rule of action as yet been or will any part of it ever be established and fixed that judge and co are able to prevent from being thus fixed† under such law—the abuse here made of the term law must be tolerated for it is inevitable—under such law security may be talked of and even fancied but for any man who either publishes a newspaper not to speak of pamphlets or contributes to the communication of its contents security itself cannot with truth be said to have existence thus much for actual danger now as to alarm—terror—the inseparable consequence of opinion of danger on this as on every part of the field of law in which the legislator—dupe or accomplice of judge and co—has refused to act fear makes law as among the heathen it made gods‡ the lord chiefjustice of the kings bench—would he think this decent becoming proper—would he endure it might not his feelings be hurt wounded violated prejudiced or injured by     it mr

concerning any part of the contents or of the supposed design of this or that passage in my projected pamphlet should happen to have found its way may it not happen to them or any of them mr attorneygeneral excepted to intimate as much to mr attorneygeneral in which case prosecution may and if prosecution conviction and perdition will to a certainty be my doom to publish or not to publish to write or not to write of this sort will be the question which under the darkness visible at which we have been taking a glance any man into whose mind any such speculative theoretical and jacobinical conception should have entered as that of attempting to bring to light any abuse the theatre of which is to be found in any part of the system of judicial procedure will of course be tormenting himself the answer will be determined—partly by the incidents which chance has presented to his notice partly by the strength or weakness of his nerves in this state of law bribery excepted among those which concern the administration of justice exists there that enormity which a judge—i mean an english judge one of the legislating twelve—by committing or even by confessing would expose himself to any the slightest danger—i do not say of punishment—the supposition would be too extravagant—but so much as of any expression—any the faintest expression of regret—such as majorities know so well how to frame—that it had not been otherwise confessing would he obtain credence not long ago comes out a newspaper announcing a series of letters to be addressed to the lord chiefjustice of the kings bench—letters which were to have presented to his lordships notice abuses upon abuses the scene of which was to have been laid in his lordships court or in which at any rate practitioners in that court were to have been represented as actors in the character of an introduction the first of the announced letters crawls out—no other follows it—whence this sudden death that which history refuses to disclose must be supplied by another hand between the first letter and the day which should have brought forth the second in the hour which should have been that of repose the pillow of the publisher receives a shake the united curtains separate and behold at the beds feet a grisly spectre—wrapt up in clouds of artificial hair ill concealing the streams of gore which are seen issuing from wounded feelings in its uplifted hands is displayed a terrific scroll exhibiting a plan and elevation of each of the two lately consecrated abodes of sequestered penitence with mene tekel and utrum horum in flaming capitals garnished with fragments of sentences about contempt of government high situation et cætera and so forth scrawled upon the walls after such warnings—and where is the literary pillow that is not visited by them—suppose for arguments sake—and it is only for arguments sake—suppose lord ellenborough to have done any of those things which lord macclesfield or even any of those things which alas lord bacon did before him—suppose him to have squeezed clerks as lord macclesfield did masters—suppose him like lord macclesfield to have sold places under himself which it belonged to him to check—or supposing it moreover unlawful—suppose him instead of selling them to a disadvantage to have listened to the suggestions of a more improved economy and pocketed the whole profit in the lump suppose—but what end would there be to such suppositions in such a state of things among those elected guardians of justice if any such there be—to whom economy so displayed and on such a theatre would appear a fitter object of reform than imitation or confirmation is there any one that would hear of it—is there any one that in print at least would tell of it not unless a situation in gloucester or dorchester jail—and that a safe and permanent one—safe as safecustody could make it—permanent as a lease for years could make it—had become the object of his choice this then is among the effects—and is it not among the uses—not to say the objects—of libel law the purity of the bench an article—a fortieth article—in the creed of englishmen—orthodoxy on this ground even where unpaid universal yes but behold the cause of it such being the bar opposed to beneficial discovery by universal terror suppose it broken through at all by whom will it have been broken through by the candid the correct the moderate possibly—should haply these virtues be found at any time in company with almost unexampled fortitude but how much more likely by the uncandid the incorrect the violent vices like these when exemplified in the supposed libel have they or have they not any such effect as that of enhancing the mischief if any which is liable to be produced by it the answer is not altogether clear but at any rate it is on the supposition of the affirmative that the proportions generally given to the intensity of invective seem to be grounded but it is truth not violence that has been     the real object of terror and hostility to the creators and preservers of english libel law and thus it is that while under the spur of indignation and desperation violence and exaggeration burst forth truth—gentle and simple truth—remains at the bottom of her well without daring to peep out chapter x want of adequate obsequiousness morally impossible §   obsequiousness found unavoidable by a veteran advocate in any published written discourse taking for its subject the propriety of public measures or of the conduct of public men whatever merits disapprobation presents an adequate demand for punishment this principle being either expressly laid down or assumed and juries habituated to accede to it and act in conformity to it it seems not very easy to conceive what that published discourse can be to which if written on any such subject as that in question a jury even though it were not a draught from the select and secret qualified list would on any tolerable ground of probability be expected to refuse to attach a verdict of conviction yes if so it be that in the alleged libel that lies before them there be not one of them that can find an expression or a word which he feels himself disposed to disapprove viz neither on any such score as decency or liberality or candour or propriety and so forth as above—and what if he can not only that in that case for supporting a verdict of conviction then some other ground must be looked out for of which while such doctrines as have just been seen are acceded to whether it be possible there should be any deficiency the reader may now judge if in the event of his entertaining in relation to any passage thus brought under his review any such emotion as that of disapprobation or dislike it would afford to his feelings any gratification to be contributory to the subjecting the delinquent to punishment in such case whether a juror will not find in these established doctrines an amply sufficient warrant for the affording this gratification to the irascible part of his frame may be seen already but whether inclined or not inclined will it be in his power to avoid it—in his power physically or metaphysically speaking yes—but to keep clear of metaphysics and every thing that ends in—ism practically speaking—whatever be the state of a jurymans inclinations can there for any proposed writer on politics or legislation which is as much as to say for any proposed libeller—can there be any rational hope or prospect of witnessing on the part of any such juryman any such forbearance the degree of probability in question cannot it is evident but be in a high degree influenced even if not in one event converted into moral certainty by the mode of address pursued by the directing judge by the degree of freewill which it may please this creator to have left or not left to his habitually obedient creatures to learn if possible a thing so necessary to salvation let us open the book of history that in it we may behold the words of prophecy and read in it the eventual doom that is in store for us no question is made says the lord chiefjustice as to the publication itself being a libel—the fact is incontestable but the cause what can it have been the inquiry is a curious one and in the answer may be seen a confirmation of the moral impossibility of any verdict other than that of guilty at the hands of a jury of guineamen not to say of any men so directed on the trial of the other defendant in regard to some parts at least if not the whole of this multifarious libel a question of this sort had as we have seen been made made and by the same learned gentleman who after having been leading counsel for the political writer officiated now in the same character for the culprit judge the question having been made then how comes it not to be made now on that former occasion the authority which the learned counsel had to contend with was no other than that of a single judge on this present occasion the authority before which he has to plead is that of the entire judicatory—a     judicatory composed of four judges of whom the judge in question though in authority the chief was in number no more than one do you maintain that a person has a right to ridicule his neighbour      in the report given of this trial the words pronounced by the noble and learned lord chiefjustice are reported or professed to be reported by the reporting scribe—the tone the countenance the deportment by which the interruptive interrogation was accompanied were not—any of them—nor could they have been—included in the report whatsoever was the cause—whether an acquaintance with the persons and dispositions of the guineamen to whom the defence would have been to be addressed—a consciousness that under such direction obsequiousness was a virtue not confined to the jurybox—or a casual deficiency of nervous power such as learned advocates for liberty no less than the unlearned are liable to—or that even where there is nothing dangerous there is something unpleasant and to polished feelings grating in kicking against the pricks and pressing against the feelings of official superiors whose countenances are day by day to be encountered—so it is that there being according to the learned counsels own statement at least nothing more at stake than the liberty of the press—that liberty which as he had observed has ever been held as one of the first principles of the constitution—nor from the doctrines against which on that former occasion he had with so little fruit been contending any worse effect to be apprehended than the extinguishing of that liberty for ever—whatsoever may have been the cause of the abandonment so it is that before this reinforced and de jure at least superior judicatory the contest was not renewed §   on the part of a trained juryman unobsequiousness still more hopeless but if such was the noresistance made by a sturdy veteran—possessing too in the plea of professional duty an excuse such as might have been expected to disarm resentment call forth sympathy and edulcorate feelings in the bosom even of the most obdurate judge—what under such direction could have been or ever can be—expected for the relief of a defendant libeller or for the preservation of the about to be extinguished liberty—what i ask can to any such purpose be with any the least colour of reason expected from the firmness—let us not say of the craving guineaman who in one unacceptable verdict beholds the extinction of the race of his expected guineas—but of any gentleman habituated as by the discipline of the blackstone school all gentlemen are habituated to regard in every word that cometh from the mouth of one of the reverend and learned twelve the rule of legal faith—the unerring standard of rectitude chapter xi such juries worse than none §   starchamber preferable to a covertlypensioned jury to a mixed tribunal containing along with the judge a jury thus constituted and thus directed two other tribunals each of them more simple in its composition might in cases of libel law so long as libel law stands as it is at present viz without any determinate set of words for the expression of it be substituted it should seem and with no inconsiderable advantage to liberty and justice   one of them is—a starchamber in a word the ancient judicatory of that name revived with or without amendments it was in that judicatory that libel law as it stands at present received its form and tenor viz in so far as form and tenor can be attributed to a species of law—viz unwritten alias common alias judgemade law—of which the essential character is the not having any tenor at all belonging to it nor consequently any purport of any such solidity as that certainty and safety can be built upon it it was in that judicatory that the earliest cases extant—being those which in the character of the foundations of libel law are continually referred to—were determined of that transcendent judicatory the acknowledged fruit of which was the keeping of all england in a state of quietude pure of all fermenting matter one great advantage was the being composed altogether of persons in high situations—great characters—whose greatness so long as it pleased the fountain of all greatness was placed out of all danger of failing being fixed by office though under special jury law it does belong to the defendant to choose out of    persons fixed by a very different choice by what    he shall not be tried it does not under any law belong to a defendant to make choice of any of the judges by whom he shall be tried but for my part supposing for arguments sake that it rested with my choice more willingly would i be tried and being of course convicted sentenced by a starchamber composed of the same great characters as heretofore than under such direction tried before a jury of whom it should happen to me to know thus much and no more—viz that they were so appointed and so paid—a sentence all the while awaiting me from such a source and of such a nature as by the     examples that are under everybodys view has been rendered so intelligible in the case of the libel in question—the libel composed of the letters signed juverna—the great characters mentioned in the title of mr cobbetts trial as objects of that libel are the earl of hardwicke lordlieutenant of ireland lord redesdale lord high chancellor of ireland mr justice osborne the alleged pourer of broadsides one of the judges of the court of kings bench in ireland and mr marsden undersecretary of state for ireland to these may be added—as so many persons over whose wrongs a veil had been drawn partly by their own magnanimity partly by that of the attorneygeneral of our present sovereign lord the king who for our said lord the king was then and there in that behalf in his proper person prosecuting and on such an occasion what more proper prosecuting person could there have been viz the honourable spencer perceval—the hobarts meaning doubtless the then commonly called lord hobart now properly called earl of buckinghamshire—the westmorlands meaning the then and present earl of westmorland—the camdens meaning the then and present earl camden—and the then right honourable henry addington now viscount sidmouth and in the said libel so unbecomingly taunted by being called by the title of his father doctor addington the purpose for which this constellation of great characters is here introduced is no other than that of saying that it being by the supposition my misfortune to be under prosecution for a libel against all those several great characters—and at the same time my advantage and privilege to have for my trial and sentence the choice of a starchamber in lieu of a jury so constituted and directed as aforesaid—my choice would be in favour of the said starchamber and this even supposing the constitution of it to have received this—i know not whether to call it confirmation or amendment—to wit that of its being composed in the character of judges of the very same persons neither more nor fewer as those whom by the hypothetical and argumentative mention thus made of their names it may for aught i know at a time when to write is to write libels have already happened to me to have libelled neither caprice nor rashness dictated the choice thus made judging thus openly and avowedly in their own cause—executing the operation of conviction and punishment at the same time and with the same hands—this apparent as well as real union of functions at present so erroneously supposed to be disjoined would be sufficient to point towards them the attention of the public eye weak as every check must be the action of which is to be conveyed up into so high a sphere some check and that a real one they would have whereas in the existing case while the phantasmagoric vision of a check displays itself of the reality no signs have ever yet been visible §   a juryless judge preferable to a covertly pensioned jury   the other sort of judicatory to which in my own case as above in comparison with a jury so constituted and directed i should not hesitate to give the preference is a singleseated judicatory consisting of a judge without a jury and this even without excepting the noble and learned judge under whose direction the jurybox for the reasons already so distinctly stated would in my mind oppose so insuperable a bar to hope to those if any such there be to whom an object of such inconsiderable importance as the actual state of judicature when delineated by so obscure a pen as the present may have already presented itself to view the considerations by which in the character of reasons see scotch reform this choice is dictated will if not already brought to view at any rate be sufficiently apparent—it being in one word of the nature of responsibility in the burthensome sense of the word to go on diminishing ad infinitum in proportion as the number of those who are sharers in the burthen is increased not that from the same learned judge by whom the jury would in the case supposed be directed and of course directed to convict me i could as far as conviction goes entertain any rational expectation of any better fate but the fate of the defendant being in the case supposed placed so manifestly as well as completely in his hands what in that case i should hope for is—some mitigation in the rigour of my sentence not that by the nonexistence of a jury—not that by a circumstance so completely foreign to the consequences and tendency of the offence—any defalcation could be made from the real demand for punishment but that in some way or other more readily felt than described the like effect might in some degree be produced by prudential considerations you have had a fair trial you have been tried by a jury by a jury composed of your equals and fellowsubjects you have been convicted by that jury     in this strain runs regularly the eloquence by which when a convict is about to receive his doom in an oration addressed in form to his own but in design to other the surrounding ears not to speak of pens intimation is given to him that is to them to recognise the justice of it in this way it is that the satisfaction whatsoever it be which it is the lot of the up     start censor to afford by his suffering to the injured excellence of great characters placed in high situations is enjoyed without abatement while of any dissatisfaction that may chance to be raised by it a portion more or less considerable is turned aside upon the jurybox the inhabitants of which find in the constitutional darkness in which their operations have been involved an effectual protection against all assaults to which visible objects stand exposed were it my lot to be tried for a libel—a lot that may fall to me at any time as well as to every other man in the country who can either write or read and whose endeavour is to afford in any shape he being not a man of family instruction to mankind—i had rather a hundred times over be tried by lord ellenborough sitting alone in his proper place whatever it might be—the kings bench the starchamber or the privychamber—by lord ellenborough without a jury—than by a jury trained under the direction of as well as directed by lord ellenborough by tears by prostrations by a certain quantity of dust licked up by intercession of friends by vows of good behaviour and other et cæteras of penitence and humiliation it might then happen to a man to find feelings where feelings other than those which are but springs of vengeance are not now to be found and where except of that sort the printers of the independent whig found none but suppose me prosecuted and before such a jury of course convicted what would be then the language fool or weakest man that walks over earth without a keeper—what would you have you have been tried by a jury of your country you have been convicted there go and write libels if you can do it within four walls without communication from without in the wellordered jail of gloucester for six years for three as is proved by your transgression after the examples you have had before you are not sufficient who in a word who had to stand fire from an adversary would not rather have the adversary before a screen than behind one     part ii state of the packing system anno   0  chapter i introduction—two reforming shrievalties §   turner and skinner anno       in the year      sir barnard turner and mr thomas skinner see city characters the late celebrated auctioneer afterwards alderman of london finding themselves sheriffs of london and middlesex charged as such with duties of no inconsiderable importance conceived what to many grave and learned persons of that time friends to social order and our holy religion was looked upon of course as a theoretic and speculative fancy viz that of making things better than well by applying their minds to the fulfilment of those same duties the state of things appertaining to that department having presented itself to their eyes as being in divers particulars susceptible of improvement they made in that view what arrangements had occurred to them as being in their own power and in a tract of forty  vo pages—gave an account of what they had done themselves together with a statement of such other things as if done by others presented in their view of the matter a prospect of being of use in addition to some regulations partly executed partly recommended having for their objects the health and good behaviour of prisoners the changes thus spoken of under the name of alterations and amendments consisted of three innovations—one respecting the disposal of goods taken in execution in civil actions the two others respecting the place and mode of putting criminals to death   on their entrance into the shrievalty they had found lodged by customary negligence in the hands of the sheriffs officers—a class of men whose hearts are universally recognised as standing in a peculiar degree exposed to the inroads of hardheartedness and corruption—the function of nominating persons at whose disposal in the name and character of appraisers goods taken in execution were regularly placed by these their patrons and of the general result of this arrangement a tolerably adequate conception may be formed from one individual case in which according to the report given of it by these sheriffs the value of the property so taken being about five times the amount of the debt and the whole having been taken from the debtor no more than a tithe of it viz half the amount of the debt had found its way into the pocket of the creditor the other ninetenths having in some regular and established but unascertained or at least undivulged proportions been shared between the minister of justice and his official nominee and associate above mentioned to this grievance the remedy they applied was one which though in principle and in the character of a regularlyestablished remedy applicable by all persons on all occasions not altogether an unexceptionable one proved in the individual hands in question there is reason to think a beneficial one the nomination which they had found as above in the hands of their officers was taken out of those lowstationed and impure hands into their own and forasmuch as in that station men are not only too highly and conspicuously elevated but moreover too frequently changed to be much in danger of engaging with success in the organization of any regular plan for the extraction of lucre from so impure a source the mischief if not altogether eradicated must naturally have been considerably diminished on what footing the matter stands at present it has not fallen into my way to learn at that time as the evil genius of the discarded functionaries would have it both sheriffs were upright as well as publicspirited men and skinner being in relation to the branch of business in question in a preeminent degree an intelligent one knew where to find his like at present the magnificent edifice now erecting in the centre of the city under the name of the auction mart presents the idea of a more radical cure   on the ground of capital punishment the place and mode of execution furnished to these reformers two other opportunities for casting their honest mite into the treasury of justice on those melancholy occasions on which to save the trouble of reforming them and adjusting punishment in quality as well as quantity to delinquency malefactors of the     most diversified descriptions are involved in one indiscriminating destruction the operation was in those days regularly preceded it seems not easy to say why by a procession of two or three miles length in the course of which whatever effect could have been expected from the concluding tragedy was more than countervailed by the intervening disorders struck with the incongruity of this surplusage of locomotion our reformers fixed the ceremony to the wellassorted spot to which it remains attached at present a spot immediately contiguous to the place of confinement from which the victims then used to be as they still are taken for the appointed sacrifice at that same time the fatal operation being performed as mechanicians say by hand was performed in that coarse and uncertain manner by which the sufferings of the patients were exposed to receive unintentional increase it was to this happily associated pair of humble and unambitious reformers that the machinery now applied to that purpose and still known by the almost burlesque but sole existing name of the new drop owed its establishment under english justice the intended object as well as effect of it corresponds exactly with that of the guillotine under the anarchical tyranny of revolutionary france for in the design of the humane as well as scientific inventor whose name it has perpetuated that instrument a french edition of our halifax maiden had no other object than that of diminishing in each instance the suffering produced by those executions the multitude of which depended on other hands to any one who has been accustomed to observe how slow in every department of government from the highest down to the lowest the pace of reform is and how thickly beset with obstacles the paths which it has to traverse it may be apt to appear difficult to conceive by what strange accident even in so low a sphere a change which had for its result as well as for its object the good of the many should have been suffered to take effect as to the innovation which consisted in the disturbance given to the official arrangement by which so quiet and regular a division had been made of the property of the debtor between the officer and the appraiser—in the fact of its having been suffered to take effect and that too without opposition from above he may behold a certain proof of two things viz   that there was no individual existing in any such station as that of a judge or other considerable lawofficer into whose hands so much as a single penny of the profit that used to be thus extracted was ever felt to have found its way and that in particular if in the disposal of any of the property in question any errors were ever committed by any one of these inferior ministers of justice no chiefjustice of the kings bench had ever considered himself as having gained or conceived himself as being in a way to gain to the amount of £            ayear or any part of that sum nor any chiefjustice of the common pleas £           ayear or any part of that sum nor any attorneygeneral that or any other sum by contributing to the manufacture or effecting or permitting the correction of any of these errors   that neither did there exist among any of those exalted personages any individual whose pride had found itself by any accident engaged in the protection of the abuses or inconveniences thus removed   as to the procession from newgate to tyburn the thieves whose practice found itself diminished by the abolition of this ceremony—these unlicenced depredators—not one of whom ever had or ever would have found any difficulty other than from want of money in his endeavours to purchase a tossup for impunity on pretence of some error bearing no more rational relation to his case than to that of the first homicide—found themselves unable in their conjunct capacity to make any such case as on the ground of precedent would in point of decency have warranted any gentleman of the long robe in the character of judge counsel or member of parliament to stand up in support of it   as to the new drop the dying agonies of the patients destined to be relieved by it not having found in a long robe or in any high situation any person possessing any such interest in their continuance as is possessed by such a multitude of personages in high situations and long robes in the continuance of the living agonies of so many thousands who are kept so regularly immured in forced idleness by their authority and for the sake of their profit and their ease and the only persons whose cooperation towards this reform was necessary being the surveyor and the carpenter whose sensibility to the advantages of it was beyond dispute thus it was that this reform too found its way into existence unopposed in a word barring opposition from superior power accomplishment being within the power of the reformers themselves and no interest intervening in any tangible shape to call down opposition from above the reforms such as they were were carried into effect by these circumstances when rightly considered and put together the known facts of the case may be found to stand divested of that air of fable by which to a first glance they may have seemed obscured §   phillips and x anno   0   from that year      to   0  nature took   0 time to rest herself and in all those threeandtwenty years though of abuse in a considerable variety of shapes there

one to whom the idea had occurred of occupying himself in any such theoretic and speculative task as the attempting to make any defalcation from the mass no—not a thought about any such matter in the breast of any one of the units in so many pairs of functionaries any more than if instead of paying his £ 000 or £ 000 for the privilege of discharging the functions of his office he had like a pair of honourable knoxes received his £ 00   ayear or like an earl of buchinghamshire his £  0   or like a pair of lord seymours his £      or like a pair of percevals one behind the other his £

bookseller of the first eminence who on receiving from his majestys sword the customary honour changed his appellation into that of sir richard phillips in the nature of the shrievalty there is a sort of mystery in consequence of which he who does not look well to his words and even he who does will be in continual danger of falling into one or other of two heresies which like scylla and charybdis lie in wait for him one on the side of grammar the other on the side of legal and curious learning in london and middlesex taken together there is never one sheriff only there are always two sheriffs the same two respectable gentlemen who in the city of london constitute two sheriffs and thereby two persons constitute in the county of middlesex but one sheriff and thereby in legal abracadabra like man and wife but one person—or else vice versâ—for such is the frailty of unlearned memory that as often as in relation to this article one minute finds me in possession of orthodoxical truth the next minute finds me dispossessed of it in the artificial and involuntary fraternity contracted by him on this occasion it was not the lot of sir richard to find any such felicity as that which had attended sir barnard and mr skinner bishop burnet—or if not he some other selfreported eyewitness whose name if found would not to the present purpose add much to the stock of our useful knowledge

sort or other in the region of the backbone constituting thence instead of two bipeds one unfortunate quadruped at the age of about twenty one person of this unhappilyconnected pair paid the debt of

of his of which mention has been already made as to sir richard—what things he did—what other things he tried to do and would have done but for the giants and dragons he had to encounter in his way—all the while with this mass of proud flesh at his back—matters of that sort belong not exactly to this place any more than the sort of requital he met with in another character see p     from a pair of learned brethren whom he found so much more perfect in the art of dwelling together in unity than he and his of the list of his achievements and less successful endeavours one alone belongs by any direct title at least to this history viz the discovery made by him of the pitch of perfection at which the art of packing that master art of which the elements have been     endeavoured to be delivered as above has been carried in the application made of it to special juries beholding in the court of exchequer as above the great manufactory or workshop in which it was carried on and seeing more to admire in the ingenuity displayed in it than in the purposes to which he saw it applied he addressed a letter to the chief conductor of that important branch of business noticing the state of the art together with such observations as had been suggested by it at this time he was either charitable enough to suppose—or what seems the more probable interpretation of the two decorous enough to seem to suppose that the mode in which the business was conducted was a secret to the preeminently learned as well as skilful person under whose auspices and authority he found it going on but if such was ever really his belief it was not long before he found himself obliged to take his leave of it chapter ii the sheriff to the lord chief baron—notices §   substance of the letter few simple and important will be seen to be the statements made by this sheriff to the lord chief baron after the substance of each statement follows an intimation of the sort of answer given to it   that in the judicatory over which the lord chief baron presides juries are become virtually permanent and that the lord chief baron knows they are of this state of things the lord chief baron admits the existence and moreover as will be seen justifies it—say admitted and justified   that this permanence is contrary to an acknowledged principle of the constitution and considered by the public as such—not denied   that it is contrary to the express provision of an act of parliament   geo ii c   §  —not denied   that the permanence has packing for its cause n b the word packing not employed but the modes of operation indicated and certain official persons indicated as operators—not denied   that of the interference of the solicitor on one side viz the solicitor for the crown a selection chargeable with partiality is the habitual result—not denied partly by a regard to decorum partly by the want of that experience which was yet to come the sheriff was betrayed into two other assertions which proved erroneous   one was—that this permanence had not among the number of its causes on the part of the learned judge whom he was addressing either direction or connivance this was in april   0  but in september following we shall see him relating facts by which on the part of the judge connivance was rendered certain and direction the system of permanence being in the judges answer openly defended little short of it   the other was—that among the causes was either negligence or indifference on the part of the official persons by whom the jurors are fixed upon—which persons as the lord chief baron could not but know though the sheriff does not state who they were were officers acting under the authority of the learned judge but of this breach not only of constitutional principle but as virtually admitted of positive law neither negligence nor indifference had been the cause and the proof of its not having had either for its cause is given by the sheriff himself a little further on for on receipt of a remonstrance made by him we shall see the master packer giving up for the moment the supposed illegal practice but afterwards resuming it §   the letter in its own words—with observations here follows the letter in its own words phillips p     to the lord chief baron my lord— in obtruding upon you lordship on a question which has arisen in the exercise of the high office which i have the honour to fill and which appertains in an important degree to the practice of the court over which your lordship so honourably presides i am emboldened by that urbanity and liberality which i have discovered to be the leading and actuating traits of your personal character your lordship is doubtless aware that the public have viewed with peculiar interest for many years past the manner in which special juries are brought together and particularly the circumstance that they have consisted with little variation of nearly the same individuals in every cause for terms and years together     in causes between individuals this is a matter of minor consequence but in causes between the crown and the subject your lordship will readily conceive that it is a practice viewed with jealousy and does not accord with those other features of our jurisprudence which are so much admired at home and abroad the evil is not attributable to the connivance or direction of the judges nor to any defect in the law but it arises solely as i am told from the negligence or indifference† with which the juries are struck by the proper officers and from the interference in certain cases of the solicitors for the crown‡     the freeholders list is full and tolerably perfect but in calling over the names the solicitor is permitted to interpose and to say who will and will not attend so that instead     of the names being indifferently taken and dictated by the officer of the court and the attendance of those persons being compelled by the exaction of severe penalties the juries are chiefly composed of those who it is loosely stated will attend and these are frequently the same persons jury after jury and term after term your lordship will perceive from the inclosed letter† of mr    that the sheriffs have had some difficulty in their minds on the subject of summoning persons thus returned considering as they do that the clause of the  th geo ii applies equally to special and common juries yet as the correction of the evil is their object as public officers rather than any contention with the officer of the court i have felt it more respectful at once frankly to submit the whole matter to your lordship in the hope that it may tend to place everything on its proper footing in the pleasantest manner i beg at the same time to have it distinctly understood by your lordship that in making this statement and in writing the observations contained in this note i have had no design to implicate the conduct of any individual and that in stating the general facts my only object has been to justify the application which i have in this manner felt it my duty to make i entreat of your lordship to believe me with every sentiment of respect yours c c c r phillips bridge street april     0  chapter iii lord chief baron to sheriff sir richard phillips—avowries and defences §   substance of the letter four days after the sheriffs letter viz on the  th of april   0  comes from the lord chief baron to the sheriff an answer of the general complexion of which an intimation has been given as above—i admitted and     justified the permanence ii not denied—  that it is unconstitutional   that it is contrary to act of parliament   that the mode in which it is effected is by officers in his lordships dependence in collusion with the solicitor on one side none of all these phenomena coming in his lordships conception under the notion of inconvenience he declares—and on the authority of his own long experience—that not the least inconvenience has from the practice in question ever arisen during all that time on the other hand to the restoring special juries to that state of independence in which they are by the constitution intended and in fact supposed to be he opposes two decided objections these may be comprised under the following heads—   increase of vexation—viz eventual vexation to persons liable to be called upon to serve in the capacity of special jurors vexation a mischief the avoidance of which constitutes it must be confessed one of the collateral ends of justice   danger to justice—viz to the main and direct ends of justice—by the prejudice that may result to one side of the cause or the other as it may happen to wit by a partial loss of a species of instruction which in the class of causes in question he represents the jurors to stand in need of to make them do justice theoretical classifications such as the above are looked down upon of course with sublime disdain by the almighty creators and arbiters of practice but being my duty it is my endeavour to place his lordships arguments in what appears to me the clearest as well as strongest light of which they are susceptible of these supposed inconveniences such is the force with which the consideration operates on his mind that he concludes with using his influence with the sheriff to engage him to leave things as they are whether even supposing the inconveniences in question to exist—and that in the utmost degree of force in which they are capable of existing—whether even on that supposition they would in law constitute any sufficient warrant or so much as an apology for the malpractices the existence of which is admitted is a point on which not much seems to require to be said but the very existence of the inconveniences in point of fact seems to call for an inquiry which will be the business of another chapter §   the letter in its own words to sir richard phillips old balley april  th   0  sir— permit me to thank you for the very flattering manner in which you

officer or as chief baron to be worth while as i have never seen the least inconvenience arise from the manner of striking and summoning special juries during that time a great inconvenience to the special jurors must arise from summoning those from a distance† the causes in the court of exchequer are of a nature quite peculiar to themselves in many respects and the duration of any cause is particularly uncertain in order to obtain their attendance it has been found expedient to summon such as live near to london‡ otherwise there would be little expectation of having anything like full special juries∥ and almost all causes in revenue matters are tried by special juries     within the last half year i have had complaints in court by gentlemen summoned on the special jury of being brought fifteen miles from their homes whereas the persons living in the immediately adjacent parts of the county could attend without any inconvenience i may add too that some experience in serving upon exchequer special juries is far from being detrimental to the public or defendants inasmuch as the instructing jury after jury† in the conduct of     many species of manufactures and the laws on the subject exposes both parties to the hazard of the points being ill understood and hastily determined by them during the long time that i have been employed in the court of exchequer i have known few verdicts from which i should have dissented had i been one of their inestimable body and they have been cases wherein the determination has been favourable to the defendants†   0 having hitherto seen no reason to complain as far as my experience goes it must be left to your own discretion† whether you will risk the making us better than well‡ i am sir with great respect your obedient humble servant a macdonald chapter iv observations on the lord chief barons defences §   insufficiency of the defences in any case come we now to the consideration of the two inconveniences the pressure of which on his lordships mind became so irresistible as to force him at once upon two measures of such extremity as the violating an acknowledged fundamental principle of the constitution and travelling on for years in a course of persevering and openeyed disobedience in the teeth of the authority of the legislature not that had the advantages professed to be expected from this transgression been ever so many times as great as even by himself they could have been supposed to be they could ever have amounted to so much as the shadow of a defence on every imaginable supposition the operation thus performed by the subordinate by the judicial authority is indefensible the change thus effected would it if proposed to parliament have been approved and carried into effect by parliament—attempting it by judicial authority was needless—would it have been disapproved—attempting it by judicial authority was not fitting instead of that of george the third had the reign been such an one as that of elizabeth in which the intention of sparing the subject as much as possible—perhaps for ever—the trouble of paying their homage at the foot of the parliamentary throne was declared—declared from the throne itself and     merit grounded on it—at such a period—such usurpation might in such supposed advantages have found an excuse but now—in the   th century—when the return of the sessions is become no less regular than that of the seasons—is this a time when the plea of necessity can form so much as a veil—any even the slightest veil—for such usurpation yet though the work be but supererogation—and the words bestowed upon it little better than surplusage—let us take up the arguments one after another and look a little into their texture let us see whether when put together there be in them indication of any such mass of substantial inconvenience as could have served for a ground even for so much as a constitutional and regular recourse to parliament for the removal of it §   defence  —avoidance of vexation brought fifteen miles from their homes alas poor gentlemen brought fifteen miles each of them for no more than a few guineas—possibly even for no more than one—to a place to which everybody comes and to which but for the summons and the guineas without any guineas received and at the expense of guineas paid they would otherwise have come oh what a charming thing it is to be a gentleman if on the bed of roses you repose upon there be but a single leaf that has a pucker in it how tender the sympathy excited in reverend and learned breasts fifteen miles from the metropolis—and in the whole of this almost smallest and most compact of english counties exists there really any one spot banished to so tremendous and toilsome a distance what if it had been in one of the large or straggling counties—in yorkshire in lincolnshire in devonshire in sussex for example in any of those instances how many more miles would the maximum have swollen to but the imagination is appalled and shrinks from the research turn now to common jurymen—for the definitive trial of causes the only sort of jurymen which till tother day the constitution knew of place them in one of the large or straggling counties and fetch them to court each for his eightpence aye but these are low people—people who cannot say their catechism—their perceval catechism—see part i ch xi §  —people of no family—people as we shall learn from the observations of the learned templar whose observations are so perfectly just—people whose time if it be not absolutely worth nothing is at any rate in the estimate of exchequer justice—or say at once of westminsterhall justice—not worthy of a thought—people who except for the purpose of thus serving in it without recompence are thrust forth in a lump out of the temple of justice into the pit of outlaury lest the fund of rewards provided for learned merit should fail of being adequate to that exclusively important service as to the principles the true legal principles on which the value of time ought to be computed this topic will meet us in the next chapter §   defence  —benefit of instruction direction to judges advocates politicians and other debaters showing a safe method of defending the wrong side of any question especially where you have the advantage of situation on your side where the nature of the case is such as to afford you for the purpose of your argument no fact but what if relevant and particular enough would not only be false but too plainly so not to be seen to be so mount up into the region of generalities till you come to some proposition which being by reason of its generality neither true nor false is by that means saved from the inconvenience of being proved to be false by this means should you fail of convincing men those excepted who find their convenience in being convinced at any rate what is no small point gained you secure yourself against being confuted and among men of modesty and diffidence those who cannot exactly find out what your meaning is at any rate if your situation be a high one and they scholars bred up in blackstones school will if they do not plainly see your meaning to be false give you credit for its being a good and true one whether a rule to this effect was ever laid down in words is more than my slender stock of learning will enable me to pronounce—that it has been acted upon and that right frequently may be asserted with less diffidence witness ourselves at westminster et cætera and so forth—at westminster in all our courts and moreover in both our houses experience     far from detrimental      instruction needful to human ignorance—two lessons better than one—three better than two where two have proved insufficient—against maxims such as these where is the caviller so perverse as to pretend to have found anything to object proof against all disproof what at the same time does all this prove among those many species of manufactures had but a single one obtained a mention here it is that if in the general proposition thus cut down to a particular one a speck of error had found itself included the finger of detection might have been laid upon it—meantime in default of stronger handles let us look out for something     that for the moment may be taken hold of though it be but of straw or cobweb but before we proceed to observe upon it let us by way of necessary preliminary begin with the endeavour to interpret it or as they say in westminsterschool and in westminsterhall to construe it—or in plain english to find out the meaning of it or when the worst comes to the worst a meaning for it instructing jury after jury     exposes says his lordship parties to a hazard      not that from this we ought to conclude that taken in the abstract instruction is a bad thing—bad either for those to whom it is not or those to whom it is communicated no nor yet that in taking for the subject of instruction many species of manufactures there is more of hazard than there would be in confining the instruction to some of them and leaving the rest to go without it     but     but—lest to construction carried on upon this plan there should peradventure be no end let us lay aside construction and take up paraphrasis or as we say in english paraphrase instead of it many are the species of manufactures in the instance of each of which in respect of this or that part of the whole assemblage of instruments and operations which on the occasion of a revenue cause in the exchequer is liable to come in question the demand for instruction and explanation is so considerable that the utmost quantity of instruction that will generally speaking have been afforded on the occasion and brought within the compass of a single cause will not have been sufficient to satisfy it so that should the same part of the process be brought a second time under the notice and cognizance of one and the same juryman the probability is that with the help of the additional instruction which on this second occasion he will receive the conception which he will have obtained of the matter at this second trial will be more accurate and complete than the conception he obtained at the first trial whereby in so far as depends upon him the chance in favour of a right verdict will receive a proportionable increase §   mischievous doctrines involved in this defence meantime if this or any thing like it be the argument of this preeminently learned judge let us observe now where it leads we shall find involved in it the following doctrines—   that in respect of causes of the particular description in question jurytrial in the ordinary mode is not a fit mode of trial at any rate not so fit as the new mode which he has contrived to substitute to it   that for these causes the more proper if not the only proper species of judicatory is that which is composed of a board or bench call it which you please of permanent judges for example such as the board of excise which already to a considerable extent has jurisdiction in these same matters the principal difference being that in this specialjury board there is an overnumber of judges to make a kind of rotation which species of judicatory preserving to it still the name of judge and jury with the forms of jurytrial he has substituted accordingly   that the mode employed by him being such as renders this secretly formed board of completely dependent judges under the disguise of jurymen applicable with equal facility and in practice as there is reason to think suprà part i ch viii actually applied at the pleasure of dependent servants of the crown to crown causes in general capital and next to capital excepted and in particular to crown libel law causes the superiority of advantage attached to this sham jurytrial as compared with the genuine mode is such as warrants the departure made to so great an extent from the acknowledged principles of the english constitution   that this superiority is even such as not only would warrant the legislature in making the change but actually has afforded to a judge viz to himself a sufficient warrant for making it of his own authority and without warrant from the legislature §   acknowledged nothingness of the advantage such being the price paid at the expense of the constitution by this our learned improver for the sort of improvement introduced by him with such advantages as may be found belonging to it a question to which the mind of the inquirer is naturally and unvoidably turned is—what may be the amount of this advantage according to the estimate formed of it by the learned improver himself this being the advantage for the sake of which he has been content to give birth to all those other results the complexion of which is to ordinary eyes so far from being advantageous—and for answer to this question what we find certified to us by his own words is that in his own estimation this advantage amounts either to nothing at all or to something between nothing and next to nothing it amounts not so much as to the absence—total absence—of all detriment or inconvenience it amounts to no more than the absence of detriment in one particular shape viz in the shape of experience some experience says he in serving upon exchequer special juries is far from being detrimental to the public or defendants    whereupon immediately come those clouds in which we     have seen this preeminently learned person losing himself when he goes on to speak of the hazard to which both parties are exposed by the instructing jury after jury while puzzling myself with this glimpse of an advantage being curious to discover if possible what might be the amount and value of it in the eyes of the learned improver himself—and instead of recurring at once to his own estimate as above having fallen unawares into the error of endeavouring to determine it from the price i saw he was so well content to pay for it i had strayed insensibly into the inquiry what might be the real amount of it and in this view at the cost of some days of labour i had actually pursued to no inconsiderable length the analysis of it but upon turning once more to his own words and finding that it was not easy for any person whatever to sct this supposed advantage at any lower rate than it had been set at by the learned improver himself i saw at length and not altogether without regret at the thoughts of the time thus wasted that i had been all this while combating without an antagonist i therefore spare the reader for the present at least the labour of following or attempting to follow me through a sort of analysis so dry and intricate as to involve in the way of indication at least a mass of mathematical calculation but should it ever happen to his lordship or to any avowed advocate of his lordship at any such bar as that of the house of lords or even that of the public to draw into question by any arguments the propriety of this his estimate i mean in so far as it sets down this so dear bought advantage as amounting to next to nothing i am ready to produce this my analysis and upon the supposition in question to defend against these his lordships first thoughts any second thoughts either on the part of his lordship or on the part of any other such less dignified defenders and gainsayers §   short exposure of the supposed advantage meantime in demonstration of this nothingness one argument it being a short one and not involving any inquiries of detail shall not be consigned to oblivion with the rest on the part and in the person of and from the instruction that would be afforded by this our preeminently learned judge a jury of the old school were it permitted to serve would have the benefit not merely of some experience but of consummate experience now then after the benefit of such instruction though received in the course of no more than one single cause to wit the cause for the trial of which such jury had been summoned and was sitting what would be the utmost advantage derivable to any practical purpose from any other to wit any antecedent lecture or course of instruction that could even from the same preeminently learned lecturer have been received nothing no nothing at all is the answer i return with the utmost confidence where the points were such as to be either plain enough in themselves or made so by the one only lecture which till this our preeminently learned lecturer set up was ever designed by the constitution for an english jury his lordship would accordingly leave the decision to the opinion of these plain men when these same points had any such intricacy in them as entitled these plain men to the benefit of an opinion formed and ready made for them by this at present consummately experienced and from the first most incontestably competent judge he would not refuse it to them this incontestably competent opinion would it find them disposed to acquiescence acquiescence would take place accordingly and in the blackstones phrase everything would be as it should be would it find them disposed to refractoriness it is not by any antecedent experience that they could have been cured of so troublesome a vice but says some one with the proper expressions of regret the country alas cannot always enjoy the blessing it possesses at present in the services of this our veteran and consummately experienced judge that blessing withdrawn comes some other lord chief baron who though the adequacy of his general legal learning will be sufficiently proved by his situation will not with reference to causes of the class in question be at the commencement of his first cause altogether so completely endowed in the article of experience here then upon his lordships improved plan comes the benefit of an experienced and thence of a permanent jury—while the judge is learning to walk the jury will be able to go alone but upon the old plan what experience would there be—when the blind have no leader but the blind the consequence is such as need not be mentioned i answer—were the argument which has been shown to be worth nothing worth ever so much it could not to this purpose be of any use at a much cheaper rate than the violating of a vital principle of the constitution an adequate allotment of appropriate experience might at all times be seated upon the bench set a thief to catch a thief is a coarse proverb but on the present occasion not an uninstructive one in that division of the court of exchequer not to speak of the great lawofficers who might not always regard a presidentship which has so recently cried date obolum worth the honour of their acceptance there will be always some one learned gentleman at least by whom in the     character of licensed accessary after the fact or in two words standing counsel to the fraternity of smugglers an ample stock of experience—appropriate experience—cannot but have been laid in but replies the learned gentleman on the other side any rule to this effect would be an infringement upon the liberty of the prerogative that liberty being proportionably trenched upon by every rule the tendency of which is to secure the appointment of fitter functionaries in preference to less fit ones it would accordingly be injured if in his choice of judges it were rendered more difficult to his majesty than it has been to provide for the accommodation of the family connexions of persons in high situations prerogative i answer is an argument which is i must confess understood never to admit of any direct contestation but in the westminsterhall benches besides ten subordinate seats there are four chief or principal ones and the prerogative it is humbly submitted would not sustain much injury if for the superior purpose of private accommodation it were to apply itself to some one of the many other seats in which no such imperious demand for experience—appropriate chemicomechanicocommercial experience—as that of which by the unprecedented sagacity of the present lord chief baron the discovery has so recently been made §   mischievousness of the doctrine further developed but the material thing is that if his lordships sentiments have not been strangely misinterpreted by his words it is not merely in exchequer causes viz exchequer revenue causes that in his conception of the matter the substitution of a permanent and dependent board under the name of a jury to the jury of the old school ought to be applied but in all causes to which that antiquated species of jury has ever been applied in all such causes without exception but more particularly in libel causes for such is the nature of the reason thus held up by him to view that to the application of it any narrower extent cannot surely be assigned this reason consists of the ignorance under which each member of a jury cannot but be supposed to labour the first time at least of his serving in that character of which ignorance in his lordships view of the matter the influence—the morbid and debilitative influence—is such that nothing less than permanence can afford an adequate cure for it the points which he speaks of as being the subjects of this ignorance—of this ignorance to which there exists no remedy but in that experience which supposes permanence—the actually existing and thus defended permanence—are not only points relating to the conduct of manufactures many species of manufactures but points relating to the laws on that subject meaning on the subject of these same mannfactures unfortunately in comparison of what is to be found in the great body of the laws the utmost difficulty of comprehension and consequently of demand for instruction—for experience in receiving instruction and consequently again for permanence of situation the utmost demand created by those particular laws which have for their subject the conduct of manufactures is as nothing in the instance of every part of the rule of action which has any species of manufacture for its subject that rule is in the shape of statute law—a shape in which it is provided with a determinate set of words for the expression of it but in the case of the great body of the law remaining as it does in the shape or rather in the shapeless state of common alias unwritten law there exists no such determinate set of words in all this vast extent the two sources of difficulty and with it of demand for experience and permanence—viz law and manufacture—are combined in one judges the master manufacturers law or what to every purpose—of suffering at least if not of instruction or relief—has the force of law law itself the product of the manufacture in the case of every other species of manufacture—of every species of manufacture commonly known by that name the master manufacturer viewing in every misconception that may take place a source of loss to himself and having to deal with simple and uncultivated minds in the character of labourers has for one of his objects and that a constant one the rendering the conception of the operations to be performed and the instruments to be employed in his manufacture as correct and complete as possible and employs his endeavours accordingly in the case of the manufacturers of judgemade law interest being directly opposite endeavours have of course been correspondently opposite and results equally so whatsoever may have been the course of endeavour—whether with or against the stream of interest—the result is at any rate equally and indisputably notorious the demand for instruction and consequently for experience and consequently for permanence being then so much greater in the cases in which his lordship was not led to bring it to view than in the cases in which he was led to bring it to view and has brought it to view accordingly this demand covering the whole field of law in general and that of libel law in particular what his lordships opinions and wishes are and have been—what his lordships endeavours on all favourable occasions     may with justice be inferred and presumed to have been and to be about to be—need not surely be particularized this reason of yours—viz the demand for experience—will you abide by it or desert it desert it there is an end of the matter and your conduct remains without excuse if you abide by it will you abide by it wherever it applies with equal force if no there again you desert it—if yes you then mean to carry it upon occasion over the whole field of specialjury trial and in particular over that part which regards libel law meaning to carry it over the whole of that field of jurytrial and in particular over that part which regards libel law in packing into a standing board a set of dependent commissioners habited like jurymen for service in your own court that is for exchequer service it has then been your meaning to enlist and discipline them for kings bench service such in conclusion are the questions and observations that might be addressed to the preeminently learned author of this defence and as it should seem not altogether without some prospect of effect if the forms of the constitution were anything better than a cloak for despotism and if responsibility were in fact among the attributes of an english judge §   lawful improvement—track it would have proceeded in now suppose again for argument sake it had pleased this preeminently learned judge to think it worth while to allow to king lords and commons respectively their several votes in relation to this business more particularly to the commons whose attention is or used to be considered as in a more particular degree bespoken for regulations affecting the revenue in the house of commons besides the committees of the whole house there would probably have been appointed some select committee for the purpose thus appointed the committee would have set itself to work and begun with analyzing the general conception thus formed by the ingenuity of the learned judge—decomposing it they would have resolved it into such particulars as may be found involved in it—particulars the number of which is determined by that of the several manufactures the practice of which has under favour of that permanence which forms so really useful an attribute of the judicial seats been brought under the dominion of his lordships science the analysis thus performed they would in the instance of each such manufacture have proceeded to inquire into the truth and accuracy of that general conception and into the degree of force with which in each instance the argument deduced from it in defence of a select and permanent board in preference to a fortuitously determined and everchanging jury may be found applicable supposing that in each one or in this or that part of the whole number of these manufactures the quantity of instruction necessary to the giving the requisite assurance of a right verdict had respectively appeared so great that the quantity of time capable of being allotted to one trial by jury could not with propriety be considered as sufficient for imbibing it then and not till then would it remain for the consideration of the committee whether for the obtainment of whatsoever increased probability of correct judicature appeared capable of being obtained by the proposed substitution it would really be worth while that an innovation applying to so important a part of the constitution should be introduced supposing this question determined in the affirmative then would come upon the carpet for the consideration of the committee the question concerning the organization of the permanent board or bench of judges by which alone in the sorts of causes in question correct justice is by the supposition capable of being administered satisfied let us even suppose then that by a jury justice in this behalf was incapable of being done would any such determination be formed by them—would any such idea be so much as proposed to them as that of giving the name of a jury to a body of men in which it had been predetermined that none of the properties of a jury should be found would they—these representatives of the people—bring themselves to attempt putting any such imposition upon their constituents i hope and dare believe they would not deceit like this belongs to none but a class of men trained up in the application and formation of that art and science which is from beginning to end the art and science of imposture such as above or something like it is the course taken by king lords and commons when to them it seems good to take upon them to make laws to make laws taking as they must be content to do their chance for seeing or if it be more convenient to them for avoiding to see those laws overruled—overruled indeed but happily always by men of transcendent science by whom without the trouble of studying it the business of legislation is so much better understood but king lords and commons are a dull and slowpaced set—determining nothing about facts till after they have been poring over as well as prying into facts how much more easily are these things managed by a learned judge when at any time he thinks it worth while to make a law it need cost him but a word nor be it necessary even to that word to contain thought or any such heavy matter at the bottom of it     another thing might in this case be affirmed with some assurance viz that were parliament at this time of day to think fit to appoint for this not to speak of any other purpose instead of a jury a permanent board—in that case into the organization of any such board no such barbarous and flagitious feature would now be introduced as should put it into the power of any one dishonest member to overrule by his own single will the opinion and consequent will of eleven honest ones parliament would in this case do in this particular as it did in the case of the judicatory established by the grenville act which judicatory cannot be defensible but upon the supposition that what in the case of jurytrial is called unanimity is indefensible chapter v special jury corruption—devices by which it was protected §   device  —leaving to judges a covert ground for refusing to apply the act we come now to account for the flaw observable though by our triad of learned persons not observed in the reforming statute   geo ii c   —i mean its inapplicability to the principal the newinvented and most convenientlyframed seat of corruption viz the special sort of jury so far as concerned the trial of causes the use and the only use of a jury was as there has so often been occasion to observe the operating as a check to arbitrary power in the hands of judges this intended and supposed check by the invention of the sort of jury called a special jury and to the extent of the application capable of being made of it they had already and before the passing of this act given to themselves the faculty of converting into an instrument the determination of the individuals of whom in the instance of this novel species of jury the tribunal should on each occasion be composed being taken by them out of the proper hands and virtually into their own viz by being vested immediately in the hands of the permanent officer whom on that account there has been such frequent occasion to designate by the appellation of master packer—their own dependent and subordinate abuses respecting the appointment of jurors—of jurors of all descriptions and for all occasions—corruptions too flagrant to be any longer endured in silence—having engaged at length the attention of the legislature the necessity of doing something had to the conviction of the learned fraternity become inevitable in this emergency it became their manifest interest and consequently their care so to order matters that whatever it should be found necessary to do or suffer to be done for the prevention of abuse in the appointment of juries should be confined to common juries and should not either by design or through inadvertence be extended to those juries of their own nomination—viz to special juries but that on the contrary every pretext and every opportunity should be embraced for giving to the application of so convenient an instrument every extension of which it might be found susceptible at the same time this invention of theirs being incontestably repugnant to the universallyrecognised principles of the constitution it became a matter of prime importance that of whatsoever should be done for the extension or even for the preservation of it the true nature and operation should be kept as effectually concealed and disguised as possible the remedy therefore whatsoever it might be was to be made to possess two characters viz an ostensible one and a secret one in its ostensible character it was to bear upon all juries without distinction in its secret character it was so to be contrived that if at any time any untoward accident should happen to call for its being carried into execution and effect it should in the case of a special jury be found inapplicable which sort of jury should consequently remain the seat of corruption and abuse in every convenient shape notwithstanding any success which in the instance of the ordinary and vulgar sort of jury might have attended the measures taken for the extirpation of those mischiefs for this purpose various devices part old part new were set to work an old established one was—the rule they had long before contrived to establish—viz that the crown i e as many members of government as could contrive to get their interests included under that name was never to be considered as bound by any act of parliament unless expressly mentioned in it which of course all persons interested would on each occasion take care that if possible it should not be by this rule alone a great part of the design was already accomplished to their hands for by this rule alone special juries with the benefit of an exemption from the obnoxious restrictions which under the proposed new law operated as a bar to sinister choice and permanence might have been preserved to all causes in which according to the established forms the king was nominally a party but by this rule if alone the benefit of the exemption would not have been extended to all causes to which it should happen to have been brought under the cognizance of special juries under this cognizance they had already of their own authority besides the abovementioned criminal and other sorts     of causes brought in general all those which in contradistinction to criminal are termed by them civil causes comprehending together almost all sorts of causes and to this extension they had the assurance to ask and the good fortune to obtain the confirmation of the legislature in and by this very act   geo ii c    §    to complete the imposition it then became necessary to employ a further contrivance for concealing from nonlearned eyes the completeness of the exemption meant to be established the way in which they managed it is this—in the case of a special jury the jurors instead of being determined as in the case of a common jury were as there has been such frequent occasion to observe—were as they always had been—nominated as the word is in the books of practice by the officer of the court—the master the master then for one at least if not he alone would have been the or at least a person to whom had the corrupt practice been in this case meant to be prevented the prohibition would have been addressed but to apply to this branch of the corruption—to the branch which was under their own management—any sort of remedy was no part of their intention care was accordingly taken that to the effect in question neither to this officer nor to any other officer by the staying of whose hand that part of the plague which was of their own nursing would be staid or checked should the prohibition in question or any prohibition be addressed in the case of a common jury the sheriff as above observed was the person by whom out of a much more numerous assemblage supplied to him under legal rules by other hands in the first instance by the constable of the several townships the choice was made corruption having risen to such a pitch that the cries of the public had become troublesome it was become necessary that the mischief should in some quarter or other receive a check common juries were the sort of juries in whose instance in comparison of special juries the preservation of the faculty of corruption was to the purposes of the judges and the other lawyers of least importance the sheriff in whose hands the choice of jurors of this class was more immediately reposed was an officer on whose obsequiousness regard being had to his impermanence and comparative independence they could not place any such reliance as upon that of the master their own permanent subordinate the sheriff it was accordingly determined—the sheriff and he alone—should be included in the prohibition the master it was determined should not be included in it such being the determination what was the contrivance employed for carrying it into effect it consisted in the employing of such words and one word in particular viz the word return as while to an unlearned eye they would appear to bear alike in every case upon the officer be he who he might upon whom on each occasion the composition of the reduced occasional list see above part i ch iv §   and thence as far as depended upon him that of the actually serving list see above part i ch iv §   depended would be in case of litigation and in the meantime by learned and interested eyes would be seen to be in respect of the technical signification attached to the word return incapable of bearing in the case of a special jury upon any such person or in effect upon any person at all and thus it was that for want of a person on whom the words in question could be found to bear the supposed remedy was in that case to be rendered altogether inapplicable and without effect such accordingly will be found to be the virtue of that convenient and aptly chosen word—the word return the sheriff was and is the person by whom in all cases what is called the return was and is made—the return i e the list of the persons summoned or at least therein said by him to have been summoned to serve on the occasion in question as jurors which list was and is in all cases to be given in to the officer of the court the difference in this respect between the two cases was and is—that in the case of common jurors the persons chosen for jurors were and are a number of persons greater than    the number contained in the case of a special jury in the reduced occasional list and so much greater than    as to constitute an aggregate out of which in the case of a common jury the actually serving lists for any number of causes tried as belonging to the county or other district in question on the same occasion viz at the same assizes sittings or sessions are to be taken and these are all of them of the sheriffs own choosing as above in the case of special jurors they are chosen by the officer of the court—the master—the master packer out of a list furnished to him by the sheriff being the same gross list that the sheriff himself has to choose out of and the master having pitched upon the    sends an order called a writ of distringas inclosing the list called the pannel to the sheriff who has nothing to do but to summon the persons contained in that same list and thereupon in his answer called his return to declare and certify his having so done let it not for a moment be supposed that on this occasion in framing for themselves this valve of safety on the part of these scientific and ingenious operators any such cause     as inadvertence had any share return is the word by which they found the choice designated when made by the sheriff—nominate when made by the master the officer of the court that the sheriff never is said to nominate jurymen—that the master never is said to return jurymen—these are matters neither of which could to these learned persons or any one of them applying their thoughts to the subject for a special and to themselves highly important purpose have for a moment been a secret had it made any part of their intention that special jurymen the rich and wellpaid jurymen to whom alone the exemption could have been of no use should stand exempted from the overfrequent service as well as common jurymen the comparatively poor and unpaid jurymen to whom alone the exemption could be of any use in this case to the word designative of the act of the sheriff by whom common jurymen are chosen they would have added the word designative of the act of the master by whom special jurymen are chosen—to the word return when employed for the description of the act meant in this case to be prohibited they would have added the word strike or the word nominate but their design being the reverse of this such accordingly was the language employed by them in the execution of it to the return—the reiterated return—of jurors in the case of overserved jurors the prohibition they framed was accordingly confined to the nomination—the reiterated nomination—of jurors in the same case the prohibition was not extended to make it clear upon occasion that in the provisions against package permanence and corruption it could not have been the intention of this act to comprehend the case of special juries another argument was provided when a prohibition is addressed to a man care is usually taken that in some way or other he should find a motive for conforming to it the operation meant to be restricted being the act of the sheriff and he the person to whom the prohibition is accordingly addressed to constitute such motive an eventual penalty bearing upon the conduct of the sheriff is appointed and denounced accordingly in the act to the master of course no such nor any other eventual penalty is denounced now from this omission if the prohibition is understood to apply to the case of a special jury results a sort of incongruity by which the intention of the legislature under the guidance of these learned persons to exempt the master packers corps of dependent special jurors from being disbanded along with the common jury corps is put still more effectually out of doubt editor illegible word in the prohibition with the annexed penalty put upon the official act of which the service of overserved juries—viz the too frequently reiterated juryservice in the instance of the same individual would be the result—if in this prohibition special jurors are to be considered as comprised one consequence is that the sheriff would in case of prosecution have to pay the penalty for an act done in obedience to orders made by the master and contained in the writ called a distringas issued by authority of the court for as hath been seen it is in the case of a special jury by the master each time that the twentyfour persons to be summoned by the sheriff to serve on that jury are nominated and as such included in the writ as above sent by him to the sheriff now then to make a supposition instead of leaving between their times of service the interval appointed by the act in the case of common jurymen let the master in the case of two special juries who are to serve on two immediately following occasions compose the two lists altogether of the same persons this if the prohibition in question is to be understood as meant to comprehend special juries is a direct transgression against the act on this supposition though it is by the master the officer of the court that the offence is committed it is not by the master but by another person the sheriff that the penalty is to be paid such injustice it would naturally be argued cannot reasonably be supposed to have been the intention of the legislature therefore concludes the argument be the remedy what it may it was no part of the intention of the legislature that it should be applied to the case of special juries and the inference being if not strong enough to impose an obligation upon an unwilling judge quite strong enough at the least to afford a sufficient warrant to a willing one the eventual inapplicability of the remedy to the case in which it is most wanted may without much violence done to probability be concluded from these provisions against package and permanence provisions which ought in reason to have applied in common to both sorts of juries and which accordingly were in appearance made applicable in common to both sorts the sort called a special jury was thus in reality exempted—which was the thing to be done §   device  —rendering it unadvisable for a sheriff to resist the packing possessed with the now antiquated notions about the importance of real jury trial to liberty a meddling sheriff it might at that time of day have been apprehended might at one time or other start up who in the case of special juries observing juries packed and     formed into a standing corps in opposition to what might appear to him to have been the intention of the act might in relation to this most important application of it feel disposed to use his endeavours to give effect to it for the repression of any such quixotism it was expedient that provision should be made and provision was made accordingly if in the application of the act to special juries he would have greater cause of fear in the event of his using his endeavours to give effect to it than in the event of his contemning it the conclusion was—and it must be confessed not an unnatural one—that no such endeavours would be used contemning the act it was accordingly contrived—contemning the act in this particular and thus leaving the system of package and permanence undisturbed—he would run no greater nor other risk than that of having to pay a limited and that at the utmost a minute penalty—a petty sum not exceeding £    geo ii c    §   supporting the act he would in the instance in question for so also it was contrived find himself to be committing an offence—an offence called a contempt of court—and thereby subjecting himself to a mass of punishment altogether unlimited and which taking into account costs of defence whether unsuccessful or successful could not but amount to many times the amount of the penalty in the other case as above for if the master as above puts into a list of special jurors a list settled by him as above any number of overserved special jurors the order given thereupon to the sheriff to return those along with the other special jurors is a writ or order of the court disobedience to that writ or order an offence called a contempt of court and the punishment inflictable for that offence imprisonment for a time altogether unlimited with or without nobody knows what beside at the worst what was made clear was that in leaving the act in this respect in a state of nullity and the system of package and permanence undisturbed he could not have anything to apprehend called to account suppose him in any way though by whom should he be called to account for having returned this or that overserved specialjuryman the court he would have to say sent me a list of twentyfour persons to be summoned and returned by me to serve as jurors upon this cause and this mans name was upon the list—how then could i have done otherwise had i omitted him the court would have punished me as for a contempt thus much aloud continuing the conversation to himself—the king in parliament he would naturally say may for aught i know have forbidden me to return this man but what i am sure of is—that my lord chief justice has commanded me disobeying my lord chief justice the king i am sure would not protect me—disobeying the king my lord chief justice i have reason to think will protect me no man can serve two masters two oppositelycommanding masters a prudent man will serve the strongest—my lord chief justice being the strongest my obedience is for my lord chief justice §   device  —concealing the power of nomination given to the master packer another exertion of lawyercraft may be seen in the care taken to throw a veil of concealment over the arbitrariness of the power exercised by the master in the nomination of special jurors it is by him alone as we have seen that the nomination—the choice—of the fortyeight is made whatsoever appearance of judicial audience and impartiality it might in the year      and in a case of so much expectation and publicity as mr horne tookes case see part i ch viii p    and under a judge no less remarkable for timidity than for arbitrariness have been deemed advisable to assume at this time of day such is the progress that has been made this arbitrariness may be seen stated without disguise in the books of practice—books written by lawyers for the information of none but lawyers and without any apprehension of any such jealous eye as by accident might be cast on the business in the house of commons in the act   geo ii c    §    how is the description given of this operation worded answer—in such manner as to convey the conception that the choice was made somehow or other by somebody else and that auspices were all that were contributed on this occasion by this judicial personage—required upon motion as aforesaid    says the act to order and appoint a jury to be struck before the proper officer of each respective court before is the word and false as is the conception that will naturally be conveyed by it yet so artfully is it chosen that no charge of impropriety would be found to attach upon it by this proper officer it is true are the fortyeight nominated in the first instance but then the jury is not said to be struck that is the determination of the individuals that are to compose it completed till out of the fortyeight twentyfour are struck off by other hands viz twelve by the attorney on each side by and not before it may indeed be observed is however the word employed in another part of this same act §    but nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit and as every act of parliament is or is liable to be a pasticcio nothing is more likely than that the clause with before in it should have been the work of one hand that with by in it of another   0 §   learned advice given accordingly to sheriff phillips thus it was that this act which at a time of ferment and in the view of allaying the ferment was in show and pretence provided in the character of a check to corruption in the case of jurors in general special as well as common was at the same time in the case in which the mischief of the corruption was at beyond comparison the highest pitch being the case wherein the interest which its pretended extirpators had in maintaining and increasing it was also at the same high pitch converted as in the case of the latelyexhibited remedy against parliamentary corruption—converted by suitable management and with the happiest success—into a means of not only perpetuating but aggravating the disease of the state of things here depicted—of the nullity of the power of parliament—of the real supremacy of the judges—of this state of things the living oracles to whom sir richard phillips as above had at different times betaken himself for advice were both of them as will be seen duly sensible this sheriff being one of the speculative kind of men above supposed—ignorant as all such men are—ignorant of the real state of existing circumstances—had been amusing himself with the fancy that king george is our king that in consequence disobeying king george a man would be in peril and that to obey him was the way and only way to be safe these learned persons knew both of them better things your king george said they to let you into the secret is king log jump upon him do anything else upon him you please—king ellenborough king mansfield king macdonald these are your real kings these should you venture to disobey but the least of them you will find him a king stork as to your king george to appeal to the laws of that nominal king in justification of an act of disobedience committed against the orders of any of these real kings—doing so you would but make bad worse doing so you would but aggravate disobedience by contempt you might as well appeal to bonaparte such was their advice and very good and as the lord chief baron says of it perfectly just advice it was the language in which they gave it was of course their own language—their own branch of the flash language but the above is the honest english of it as for the speculatist the reformer he found means to understand it notwithstanding his ignorance accordingly by these lanterns were his feet directed as well as his paths lighted as to the lord chief baron—so little in use have he and his learned colleagues been to consider an act of parliament as anything when their practice or their pleasure has been contrary to it to him it was all the same whether in the case of special jurors the package and the permanence had or had not been prohibited by the act the exemption provided in that case having been a covert one it had escaped his observation and he determined accordingly to conduct himself as it seemed to him in disobedience to the law but to the sheriff who had he taken upon himself to give effect to what seemed to him to be the intention of the legislature would have had to expose himself to the resentment of the judges it was matter of serious anxiety to endeavour to ascertain what support he might promise himself from the letter as well as from the spirit of the law the learned framers of this law not having as yet attained for themselves nor daring to promise to themselves for their successors any such complete and dauntless assurance as hath now been declared by their existing successors had made provision of their covert exemptions and loopholes as above and of these loopholes our intended curtius the reforming sheriff though he did not receive a perfectly complete or correct draught received an intimation sufficiently instructive to save him from leaping to no purpose into the gulph into which he had been prepared to throw himself thus in the way of useful instruction—instruction which howsoever speculative may at any time be made to lead to a practical purpose—the quantity of written matter unavoidably expended upon this contrivance in the art of packing may be turned to as extensive an account as possible i would recommend it to your consideration gentle reader in the character of a sample of the mode in which in matters of law the public has been always served and may always expect to be served till by such service the destruction of society is completed so long as according to the existing order of things it continues in the line of legislative penmanship to be served by lawyers meaning feefed lawyers it will continue to be served as hitherto it has been served—always with the same honesty—always with the same views—always with the same effect §   special jury system—just suspicion entertained of it that all the artifice that could be mustered for the occasion was not more than the urgences of the case required may be collected from the particular recital prefixed by way of preamble to this very clause—a recital from which it appears that the indiscriminate extension of the special jury system to all causes at the pleasure of the party on either side of the cause had not been regarded altogether without distrust and opposition     and whereas some doubt says that preamble   geo ii c    §    hath been conceived touching the power of his majestys courts of law at westminster to appoint juries to be struck before the clerk of the crown master of the office prothonotaries or other proper officers of such respective courts for the trial of issues depending in the said courts without the consent of the prosecutor or parties concerned in the prosecution or suit there depending unless such issues are to be tried at the bar of the same courts thus far the preamble and then comes the enacting part still preserving the word before and giving to the party on either side the power to force upon his adversary the sort of judicatory thus corrupted as to doubt if we may believe what is said in the report of a case determined in the year      about seven years after the passing of this act there could be no doubt in the case the contrary to what is here insinuated was true beyond all doubt no more than about four years before the passing of the act a search had been made in this view in thirty years then last past that is from about the year      to about the year      no instance of the ordering a special jury without consent of parties on both sides had been found nor is it said that any instance had been found anterior to that period notices of the existence of such a power had indeed been now and then thrown out but which if that statement be believed and no reason can be found why it should not were without any foundation either in regulation or in practice were thrown out and not being true in fact it seems difficult to imagine with what view they could have been thrown out unless it were with the view of paving the way for this statute §   harmony between the astutia of    0 and do of   0  we come now to an observation which brings the consideration of the so long ago     enacted statute within the limits of the present epoch i mean the use which on the occasion in question appears to have been made of it by the lord chief baron with the privity of course and consent all along of his learned and reverend colleagues the deficiency by which in respect of the clause prohibitive of permanence the act was and is rendered inapplicable to the subject of special juries had probably been observed and understood but was not thought fit to be indicated it was not to be indicated—why lest peradventure attracting parliamentary notice it should be supplied but to the sheriff in pursuance of the advice that had been given him viz from the temple it might have happened to bring the question before the court viz in the mode in and by that advice recommended if so his lordship and their lordships were ready for him on arguing the matter on the ground of the statute its originally intended inefficiency as to this point would have been brought to light though not perhaps through malice the wouldbe reformer would have been found a trespasser and in addition to costs costs got by him in the negative sense in addition to such his costs accompanied with a reasonable dose of contempt in the form either of avowed contempt or pity he would have got his labour for his pains against the hypothesis thus advanced this or that passage may be objected in which the prudence of the serpent does not appear quite so conspicuous as the simplicity of the dove but should the fact be even admitted the inference has no need to be admitted along with it in a line of action to which a man is accustomed the most consummate skill is not incompatible with equally consummate awkwardness in a line to which he is strange the line to which an english lawyer and in particular an english judge is accustomed is that of making the most of the abuses of which the common alias unwritten law and in particular that branch of it which regards judicial procedure has been made up viz by the hands and for the benefit of his predecessors of making his advantage of them on every occasion of defending them as often as it may happen to them to be attacked opposing every effectual remedy and as often as remedial measures cannot be kept out altogether infusing into such as are forced in as large a proportion of insufficiency and mischievousness as it may be found possible and prudent to introduce the line which is altogether strange to him is the line of honest and beneficial legislation including the abolition of such mischievous and inefficient arrangements as may happen to have taken place already as above accordingly     it is not by mere ill will—the immediate result of adverse interest—that a truebred english lawyer bred in the school of coke and blackstone is prevented from doing anything well in the line of honest and beneficial legislation it is moreover by genuine and unaffected dimsightedness and awkwardness even though the task to be performed were of no stranger a complexion than that of making a pair of shoes the most expert as well as learned and eloquent advocate that ever pleaded at an english bar or judge that ever sat upon an english bench would probably find it matter of extreme difficulty to make with his own hands any such article but supposing the task to be the making of a code of laws in such case even though by some strange revolution or metamorphosis he were on a sudden to become personally reconciled to it he would find much less difficulty in the making of a pair of shoes than in the making of any such code of laws as should prove to be supposing such to be the quality required to be given to it a really useful instrument in the hand of impartial undilatory unvexations and unexpensive justice in the making of the shoes nothing more irksome could have happened to him than the employing in so relatively useless and unprofitable a work the necessary quantity of labour and time from the very first stitch to the very last he would not have found himself under any such unpleasant necessity as that of violating any maxim or opinion he had been accustomed to regard with affection and respect or acting in opposition to the interests opinions or feelings of any of his friends in the making of the beneficial body of the laws he would not only have to lament at every stroke of the pen the misapplication of so much labour and time but at every other line he would feel himself running counter to some such favourite maxim or opinion as well as running counter to the interests diminishing the profits disturbing the ease lowering the reputation galling the pride and in the words of lord ellenboroughs libel law hurting prejudicing injuring and violating the feelings of the companions of his youth and most familiar friends he would find himself or as now we say feel himself running counter to that which in lieu of the once universally pursued or professed to be pursued but now antiquated and exploded end and object—viz the greatest happiness of the greatest number has now of late openly deliberately and in black and white been avowed and acknowledged as and for the permanent end and object—if not of all government of the government of his majestys most favoured set of servants—viz the preserving from hurt prejudice injury violation and every other such unpleasant accident the feelings of great characters in high situations chapter vi learned advice from the temple learned advice in the shape of a letter from the temple having on this occasion borne no inconsiderable part in the business viz partly as having afforded guidance to the sheriff partly as having helped to afford legal notice to and been honoured by the declared approbation of the lord chief baron the     reader will probably expect to see it laid before him here instead of his being sent in quest of it to another publication i proceed therefore to exhibit a copy of it subjoining in the form of notes a few observations of the propriety of which the reader will judge to mr sheriff phillips dear sir— i agree with you in thinking that the clause referred to in the inclosed act of parliament applies to special as well as common jurymen for if it be inconvenient† for the latter to attend oftener than the act requires it must be much more so to the former on account of their rank and station in life‡     but with regard to the sheriff i think there is a very material distinction between common and special juries with respect to the former the returning them upon the venire facias rests with the sheriff and as he is required by the  th section of the statute   geo ii c    to enter or register in a book to be kept for that purpose the names of such persons as shall be summoned and serve as jurors on trials at nisi prius with their additions and places of abode and also the times of their services so i think that if he were to return any persons to serve as common jurymen oftener than he ought he would be liable to the penalties of the statute but with respect to special juries they are struck before the master of the kings bench and the remembrancer in the exchequer under the   th section of the above act of parliament which declares that the jury so struck shall be the jury returned for the trial of the issue and accordingly their names are specially inserted in the distringas if the sheriff therefore who has nothing further to do with the striking of special juries than attending with the freeholders book out of which their names are taken were to object to the nomination of such as had before served within the limited time and his objections were overruled he would not i think be liable to any penalty for summoning them upon the distringas and indeed if he were to refuse to do so he might incur a contempt of the court who would not suffer their process to be disputed in the execution of it by the sheriff if you should think it worth your while† however to rectify‡ the practice which has obtained of calling so often upon special jurymen to attend at nisi prius the proper mode i conceive would be when you attend with the freeholders book for the purpose of striking a special jury to carry with you the book containing the names of such persons as have already served within the last two terms or     vacations and apprize the master or remembrancer thereof requiring him not to nominate them afresh and if he does you might try the effect of an application to the court to set aside the nomination or have others nominated in lieu of those who had served before on the ground that you might otherwise by possibility be subject to a penalty for summoning them by this means the opinion of the court would be obtained† and they would probably direct their officers to alter the practice‡ in future it would not i think be prudent for you to hazard the incurring a contempt of the court by not summoning any of the jurors named in the distringas on the ground of their having served before within the limited time particularly as you would not i conceive for the reasons i have given be liable to a penalty for summoning them and though the jurors who had served before might be excused from serving again on producing to you a certificate∥ of their former attendance yet i think that the judge at nisi prius would not be inclined to fine the officer who had not¶ nominated them—i remain dear sir your obedient servant       temple march  0   0  chapter vii advice from lincolnsinn §   this letter why introduced here the authority of the learned gentleman who dates from lincolnsinn stands upon a footing very different from that of his learned brother who dates from the temple—a very different footing—and it must be confessed a very inferior one both luminaries are indeed alike eclipsed by stars such as      and by this common occultation both are placed in the scale of authority thus far on the same level but the templar whose observations are so perfectly just is by this adoption become the child of or rather quoad hoc one person with the preeminently learned judge to the purpose of the present inquiry he is in effect lord chief baron while his learned brother on the other side of fleetstreet less fortunate in the date of the application made to him missed thereby the having been admitted to so much as a chance of so honourable an advantage why then introduce him or his letter here says a natural question and by no means an irrelevant one the answer is—because it is upon the evidence of this gentleman that the existence of the guineacorps and the notoriety of such its appellation rest     as to his title to credence—a remark that has been made already is—how improbable it is that if a matter of fact stated as notorious were not really so it should be mentioned as such by a professional man circumstanced as this gentleman appears to be true it is that from the mention made by him of this guineacorps a suspicion might arise that feelings were harboured by him heretical and rebellious as towards the powers that be and that it was for the gratification of these wicked feelings that he had trumped up this story about the guineacorps that statement having in fact no truth in it but for the clearing of his character in which so far as concerns evidentiary trustworthiness the character of this inquiry is in some measure involved i feel it incumbent on me to show which i shall do in proper place that in his feelings—i mean in the feelings manifested in this his letter when taken in all its parts—there is nothing that does not harmonise with the purest jurisprudential orthodoxy which being the case it would be an injury done not only to this argument but to the reputation and prospects of the gentleman himself whoever he may be if any suspicion were left unremoved of his having anything in common but the formal place of date with any such reprobate as the author of these pages not but that in this busy age in which reform as in the days of balak and balaam prophecy is become contagious he too i mean the learned and practising gentleman as will be seen is a reformer but then his plan of reform is as will also be seen in the style of the perceval school a temperate one meaning by temperate a remedy which shall either leave the disease as it found it or by the blessing of the almighty meaning the almighty of the nopopery worship make it worse after the necessary preface follows the learned letter in hæc verba with a few occasional elucidations by another hand §   the letter with annotations to sir richard phillips lincolnsinn sept     0  dear sir— inclosed you will receive the act relating to the summoning of juries on trials at nisi prius and the three letters with the perusal of which you have favoured me in respect to the act itself it appears to have been passed with the sole intention of relieving those who are liable to serve on juries from the inconvenience which they were before subject to from their constant liability to be summoned from term to term without any consideration or respect paid to the labour of their previous attendances and it is most clear that it did not originate in any jealousy† entertained that men so summoned and serving would fail to act uprightly between the parties‡     mr     than whom no man can be better informed on the subject is perfectly clear and correct in his observations and in his statement of the manner in which special juries are struck one circumstance ought to be attended to which must remove all suspicion† on this subject it is this that special juries are struck under an order of the court only‡ and the practice is for the opposite solicitors to strike out a name alternately until the list is reduced to the proper number so that it must be the fault of the defendants own solicitor if he does not obtain a respectable list∥ for the trial of the issue     if any serious inconvenience were to arise from the present practice of striking and summoning special juries in middlesex i apprehend that it is the proper province of the courts above to interfere and introduce a reform without the interference of the sheriff who has as mr     states and in this he is supported by the statute nothing further to do with striking of special juries than to attend with the freeholders book to enable the parties before the proper officer to fix upon such as are to be returned for the trial of the cause and named in the distringas as under these circumstances the sheriff cannot by any possibility in my opinion be subject to any penalty for summoning the jurors named in the distringas although they may have before served within the time limited in the general act i do not think that the objection which you have taken is deserving of your further attention but if you think it otherwise the proper mode of obtaining the opinion of the courts on the subject is that which is pointed out by mr     there is one reform however which i conceive to be wholly within the power of the sheriff† and that is to correct the freeholders   0 list by expunging the names of all such persons who from low situations in life have crept into a little independence and by artifice and collusion with the inferior officers     get their names placed upon the freeholders lists with the proper additions with a view principally to their adding to that independence‡ by the fees payable for their serving on special juries i know several of this description who are ludicrously described as being deeply concerned and interested in the guineatrade∥ and a diligent scrutiny with     the assistance of the returning officers might lead to this reform i do not under this last observation mean to insinuate that even such characters acting upon oath are likely to do wrong or that they do not possess sufficient powers of discrimination to decide rightly but i think that the special jury fees should be received only in the way of compensation for actual expenses and loss of time and not as matters of profit† chapter viii maxims concerning reform deduced from the above letter §   the maxims themselves the subject of reform being at present on the carpet and a variety of opinions afloat a few maxims or aphorisms half a dozen or thereabouts and containing the substance of     so much of the above learned dissertation as regards that subject may perhaps in these unsteady times be found not altogether out of season lest the eye of the readers mind should find itself incommoded by too strong a blaze of light bursting in upon it at once to prepare it for the brilliancy of the more grand and comprehensive principles i place in front a rule or two confined in their extent to the only subject that belongs directly and necessarily to these pages—viz the institution of special juries—   when for the execution of a plan repugnant to the acknowledged principles of the constitution and to the equally acknowledged injunctions of an act of parliament    persons have been selected of whom for the insuring the success of that plan    or upon occasion a single one are in every individual instance sufficient the faculty of discarding    out of the    will if lodged in proper hands be in every such instance sufficient to defeat it for says the lincolnsinn letter one circumstance     must remove all suspicion on this subject     special juries are struck under an order of the court only     so that it must be the fault of the defendants own solicitor if he does not obtain a respectable list for the trial of the issue   if in the instance of a set of men of whom except their being in possession each of them of a portion of property which may be insufficient for the maintenance of any one of them nothing more is known than that they are all of them pensioners during pleasure under the authority on which theirs was intended and is said to serve as a check—if in the instance of a set of petty placemen so circumstanced there be any cause of apprehension lest on any occasion they should manifest as towards that authority a degree of obsequiousness inconsistent with probity and independence—in such imaginary case a sort of sanction which as often as any real difference of opinion has had and continues to have place among them is trodden under foot would as against such danger or cause of apprehension afford a sufficient security for i do not says our learned adviser mean to insinuate that even such characters acting upon oath are likely to do wrong such characters viz persons who by this same learned gentleman have just been described as persons who from low situations in life have crept into a little independence and by artifice and collusion with the inferior officers get their names placed upon the freeholders list with a view principally to their adding to that independence by the fees payable for their serving on special juries   if in the whole expanse of the allperfect system it were possible that a particle of imperfection should anywhere be found the imputation in so far as it were just would fall—no part of it on the most powerful every part of it on the least powerful of all the classes that could be found concerned in it no part of it upon those under whose eye and by whose authority everything is done that is done every part of it on those whose dependence on that authority is complete and absolute accordingly in the instance of the only reform which is represented as lying within the power of the only person in whose instance any inclination to that effect has been perceptible the reform suggested consists in the expunging the names of all such persons who from low situations in life have crept into a little independence thus far the suggestion of the learned reformer for the due understanding of which it is necessary to be considered that the consequence would be nothing less being sufficient to insure its continuance that if in numbers sufficient for the purpose persons sufficiently adapted to the purpose were not found remaining other persons of the necessary complexion and in sufficient number would of course be taken in to fill up the gap   every man—so he be high enough—is a proper—and except others seated on the same level and linked with him in the bands of the same interest the only proper—judge in his own cause accordingly as we have seen it is the proper province of the court above says our learned reformer who dates from lincolnsinn to interfere and introduce a reform   the hands by whose industry abuse has been created—by whose steadiness it has been preserved—and by which whether created or only preserved by them the profit has been and continues to be reaped—these are the hands at which the extirpation of it is to be sought   when for example as long as he has been sitting on his bench a judge has been in the habit of treading under foot with open eyes the authority of parliament the judge himself is the proper authority to apply to if you would have him cease doing so parliament not for the letter in which the lord chief barons determination to persevere in that same habit had been deliberately declared makes one of the three letters with the perusal of which says this learned gentleman to the sheriff you have favoured me §   corroborations from lord eldons scotch reform such are the articles which in substance and effect though not in words for words are ever under the command of existing circumstances     constitute so far as the most probable interpretation or as lawyers say construction which i have been able to find for the learned words in question may be found to be correct part and parcel of this our lawyers creed i might have said the lawyers creed for as already intimated with here and there a possible exception too rare at any rate to be to such a purpose worth noticing being all bred in the same learned school all cast in the said learned mould whoever sees one learned gentleman sees all nor are these articles of the number of those which to obtain acceptance and adherence require signature thus much must be confessed—viz that as yet it is only in so far as the individual learned mind in question can with propriety be deemed and taken as and for a fair sample of the genus that the propositions in question can in their herein alleged character of articles of the lawyers creed be with propriety received as genuine in that same character as far as concerns reform of law abuses can the genuineness of these articles find any man still sceptically enough disposed to doubt of it let him turn to the list of commissioners for the reform of scottish judicature see report of their proceedings as printed for the use of the house of commons in pursuance of an order dated june     0  let him see with what religious care the name of every person is shut out on whose part any the least desire to see defalcated any the least particle of abuse from a system composed wholly of abuse had ever been perceptible while those of the maintainers and defenders of the whole system are with correspondent carefulness collected and inserted taking for the basis of his calculation the number of twoandthirty reapers let him admire and calculate how rich a harvest of reward is destined to be reaped by learned industry occupied in the field of reform in the accustomed course of learned husbandry from what they have done already let him calculate what they are about to do let him pray—if haply into his religion be admitted any particle of regard for the welfare of the people and the ends of justice—let him pray that the ministers of such justice may in the sense most beneficial to the country be prevented in all their doings that what has been begun in doubts may be continued and ended in the same and that of these doubts the distribution of the matter of reward throughout the mass of learned merit may as being to the country the least bitter be the only fruit let him behold in idea and if so it please him in black and white a judicatory in which a business occupies as many years as in another sitting by the side of it† the same business would occupy hours or perhaps minutes and these learned persons not hesitating to attach their signatures to an opinion that the present forms are now or by the authority of the court may easily be rendered fully adequate for the purposes of justice and dispatch of business without parliamentary interference p   let him behold the signature of the author of marmion annexed—not to a receipt for the profits of marmion but—to the produce of the learned labours of this constellation of learned commissioners so worthy to have chosen the præses whom they chose—so worthy to be chosen as in fact they had been chosen by that præses let him give thanks that to his other offices the author of marmion does not add that of calling up the late earl in the forenoon or the afternoon and telling him what to do as soon as official advice has been received that the enemy is within his lines‡ after reading as above the history of the appointment and proceedings of the commissioners let him among the speeches of the edinburgh advocates∥ under the name of the author of marmion read a rhapsody of irrelevant buffoonery in which he will not find a serious word except what is employed in passing undiscriminating condemnation on every imaginable alleviation of judicial abuse including in such his condemnation everything which the noble and learned institutor of this commission either has given it him or unless it were in whispers could have given it him in charge to promote in these public documents including the abovequoted probationary ode in prose which if lord ellenboroughs ridiculeproscribing     branch of libel law were applied to it would be from beginning to end a libel—in these howsoever libellous as yet unpunished documents having read what lord eldon intended should be done and having predicted as any man may do without the gift of prophecy what will be done let him give thanks that no one of bonapartes dukes is as yet known to have been invited over to replace the duke of york and that if by that noble and learned oracle of the cabinet advice to any such effect has ever really been given doubts of the nature of those clouds which never cease to exhale from the same everpregnant source continue for the present to hang over it accordingly amongst similar articles of information furnished by those same papers may be found this p   viz that at a general meeting in edinburgh at which the judges of the court of session were invited to attend     several of the judges   th march   0  assisted     when the meeting finally resolved that     the present forms are now or by authority of the court itself may easily as easily as they always might have been be rendered fully adequate for the purposes of justice and dispatch of business without parliamentary interference and     that the late division of the court     has     for the present removed the necessity of any further innovation upon the forms and constitution of the court finally let him give thanks if so it be that no commission of review or revision has as yet passed the seals directed by his majesty to his trusty and wellbeloved james crawfurd john brickwood allen chatfield john bowles and alexander baxter esquires nominating and appointing them to review and revise and finally to audit and pass the accounts of them the said james crawfurd john brickwood allen chatfield alexander baxter and john bowles chapter ix transactions at the remembrancers §   the transactions themselves we have thus far attended our knight on his negotiation—an epistolary one we have seen it was—with the lord chief baron we have moreover thus far seen the fruit of it—instead of the justice called for we have seen him put off with a figure of speech a sarcasm some might call it others an oxymoron made at any rate out of an italian epigram in the shape of an epitaph and that so old as to have grown stale—instead of the fish prayed for a serpent given and with a sting too in the tail of it though perhaps not a very sharp one let us now follow him to the packing office whether it was that the advice couched in the epigram had not as yet been received or having been received the eloquence of it had failed of producing the effect it looked for so it was that our quixote sheriff took the irregular course of doing better than well besides the blame—for such it appeared to him—of acting in the teeth not only of a principle of the constitution but of an act of parliament he saw or thought he saw a penalty of £  for every transgression impending over his head raw and uninstructed as he was in the practice of courts led astray by a propensity to innovation speculation and the false philosophy of the times a conceit possessed him that the tide of corruption ought rather to be stemmed than swum with and that acts of the legislature were designed rather to be obeyed than to be contemned misled by theories parliament to his fancy presented itself as superior to judges it was not long before his error stared him in the face under such impressions it must have been that on a certain day to this compiler unknown our knight presented himself at the busiest of the two exchequer packing offices—the office of the deputy remembrancer—with the freeholders book in his pocket having previously provided himself with a list of persons who had served     within two terms viz in the hope of preventing if     practicable their serving again till the time should come at which their service would not be an infringement of the prohibition certainly pronounced by justice and supposed to be pronounced by law conceive who can the surprise of mr deputy remembrancer when the figure of the sheriff appearing before him—and with the list of overserved guineamen in one hand and the act of parliament instead of a pistol in the other advancing upon him—he heard himself called upon contrary to all precedent to pay obedience to the law this was rank innovation this was plain jacobinism meantime what was to be done the sheriff with his instrument of terror was present the reverend judge with his instrument of support his italian tombstone was not present—our felix trembled—the existence of the law was recognised its application admitted its authority submitted to submitted to for the moment though even then not altogether without wry faces during the continuance of the ague fit the instrument of terror being all the while in view two juries were struck and in striking them the official striker was to a certain extent—though only to a certain extent—influenced by this principle of the pockets which cause after cause and term after term had been used to come and load themselves with guineas some though some only were for the moment kept at home kept at home for awhile to empty themselves and make room for others others made of course as nearly as they could be found of the same materials and of the same cut obsequiousness having thus been produced—but in a quarter and in a direction very different from that in which by law i mean by the judicial makers of law it had been intended and been accustomed to be produced—a natural object of curiosity will be to know what length of time so extraordinary a phenomenon continued to have place the obsequiousness—the compliance continued just so long as the force by which it had been produced viz the instrument of terror above mentioned continued to be applied the acting force being removed reaction regained the ascendent the pliancy lasted but for two strikings the principle of elasticity displayed itself rigidity succeeded and regularity i mean what in westminsterhall is meant by regularity viz regular disobedience to law was restored† the cause of this return to regularity and social order lies at no great depth though between the titular remembrancer of the exchequer and his deputy there exists unless by accident no more connexion than between the emoluments of his principal and the duty on pretence of which the emoluments are received between the preeminently learned chief of that judicatory and his subordinate the aforesaid deputy the intercourse is necessarily close and intimate §   instruction gained—definitions and maxims of two things one either in this office an act of parliament is felt in the character of a binding force acting as a bridle upon private inclinations or it is not if it be the consequence is—its force having in the present instance proved ultimately inefficient—some external force must have been employed in overpowering it and if so we see without much danger of error what that force was but if not—if in that office an act of parliament is really not felt in the character of a binding force what in that office is the state of justice in that office—thence might have been added in the court under which it acts—thence again—in the other courts in the view of which it acts—but of this elsewhere upon the whole bench and office together—doctrine and practice together—doctrine leading practice practice expounding doctrine—we may obtain if not exactly that sort of instruction and satisfaction which an unlearned eye unversed in the practice of courts might be apt to look for—at any rate a definition a definition which having for its subject a word of no scanty extent and relation being had to its extent and the application given of it of no mean importance presents some claim to notice well considered as a quality of action—in any such phrase for example as acting well—is a relative term involving in its import an implied reference to the situation of the person whose agency is considered on the part of a chief judge notice having been received by him of an act of parliament prohibiting a certain practice and the application     of the act to that practice having been deliberately admitted acting well consists in defending the practice in black and white and after a momentary interruption produced in another subordinate station by present urgency causing it or at least deliberately suffering it to be resumed and continued as before on the part of a deputy remembrancer—an officer occupying an office subordinate to that of the chief judge—acting well consists in acting under the direction of the judge in the maintenance and support of such supposed prohibited and illegal practice and after notice and recognition of the illegality and a momentary stop put to the practice resuming it and with it the habit of considering the authority of a judge as superior to that of the legislature as to better than well in the unanimous opinion of all the commentators the use of the phrase is a flower of rhetoric—a figure of speech—some might call it oxymoron—others irong the opinion intended to be inculcated being the reverse or nearly so of the meaning which on the face of the literal sense stands expressed ill is the meaning really intended to be inculcated so that upon the whole the doctrine meant in and by the epistle in question to be inculcated may be comprised in two short and wellmatched aphorisms or maxims—he acts well who violates the law he acts ill who either obeys it himself or calls upon others to obey it part iii state of the packing system anno   0  chapter i commons debate   th april   0  packing and cutting §   abuses touched upon—packing and cutting the   th of april   0  forms a new era in the history of this art of the state of this branch of business a corner is now unrolled before st stephen—the eyes of the saint as in these cases must sometimes happen especially if the cry be loud and troublesome half open themselves to the abuse but then immediately as usual close upon it up stands mr whitbread and more or less light is thrown upon parts or supposed parts of judicial practice—   package of jurors viz in the offices which we have seen established for that purpose   bribery of do doubled double guineas substituted to single ones   unobsequious jurors dropped or in the fashionable and familiar phrase cut   where under the name of the crown the firm of judge and co is party double fees to judge and co—at whose expense need not be said package—a complex process in which properly speaking the operation of cutting is included—this being the very thing in question will together with cutting afford two sections to this present chapter double feeing—an operation in some respects included under package in others distinct from it but in all respects connected with it claims a chapter to itself §   packing on this occasion amidst the uncertainties to which newspaperreporting is liable one thing seems pretty clear viz that in respect of depth and extent the nature of the mischief was misconceived—misconceived and underrated by the honourable gentleman by whose public spirit the matter was thus brought forward—that the master of the crownoffice should have in his discretion the nomination of juries—this is what to him appeared—as well it might appear—a great hardship of the state of things thus spoken of the description thus given is thus far correct but when the mode in which the effect is brought about comes to be spoken of there it is that the description fails of the persons summoned on the pannel such names passed over as he thinks fit without calling them on their fines upon the mere plea that they could not attend and retaining such names as he thought fit     to apply a detailed correction to the several mistakes     contained in this part of the statement would after what has been said in the two former parts of this work be a useless operation the general result is clear enough viz that it is by a fraudulent contrivance and that such a one as requires to be renewed on each individual occasion—by irregular practice in fraud of the law and not by the law itself as constituted by the avowed and regular practice of judges—that the nomination and nullification of these supposed and pretended checks upon the despotism of judges is effected of these errors the origin appears sufficiently obvious though in several points not conformable to the view given of the case by sir richard phillips there remains conformity enough to render it probable that it is from his representation of the matter as given in his book that that of the honourable gentleman was taken i mean the passing over—and upon the mere plea that they could not attend—and so forth by this the conception conveyed we see is—that taken in its totality the gross list comes into the masters hands from some other quarter and that all that it is in his power to do is—to cause to be discarded out of it this or that individual and that even that cannot be done in any case without a fresh as well as false pretence whereas as we have seen over and over again the truth is—that of the persons whose names are put upon this gross list every individual without exception is constantly and regularly chosen by him and that if for ridding it of this or that obnoxious individual any such pretence should happen to be necessary it is not by him by that officer who is regular course nominates whom he pleases that any such falsehood need be or indeed could consistently be averred as to sir richard phillips happily for the public he neither was nor ever had been a lawyer on the particular occasion in question he plunged not—time would not have suffered him to have plunged—into any such fœtid mass of dead letter as the labyrinth composed of the books of practice he did—what in his place every nonlawyer would have felt the necessity of doing—he betook himself to the living oracles of the law such as were within his reach and what their responses were has been seen in another place the point here in question is of the number of those which may there be seen involved by them in some of their gilded clouds to what purpose these two paragraphs to serve as a critique upon a newspaper—no but to show that the real complexion of the ulcer is far more angry than that which it then presented to the eye of the honourable gentleman that the real depth of it had not then been sounded by him and that it continues to call and with increased energy for the renewed and more serious exertions of his healing but in the first place of his probing hand had it not been for irregularities as we have seen—some but supposed others as we shall see real—the subject as far as upon the face of this report it appears would never have received a visit from those experienced eyes which reflect so much useful light on every subject on which they fix for this wherever law is concerned is the general error ascribing whatever is amiss—not to regular practice but to irregularities not to the system but to a or b to whom on this or that occasion it happens to be acting under it this is the grand error of errors—supposing regular practice to have had not only justice but justice alone for its object whereas it never has had justice for any part of its object nor in the nature of men and things circumstanced as judges have been ever could have had §   cutting on the subject of cutting and being cut up rises mr marryat and speaks of one person viz himself to whom after verdicts given against the crown no such accident had happened and there the evidence or at least the report as above given of it stops but stopping there it proves nothing it has already been stated part i chap iv §  that verdicts after verdicts may be given against the crown and to every officer that ever calls himself the crown the event of the cause be personally speaking a matter of indifference on a question of revenue where is the chancellor of the exchequer—where is the solicitor of the treasury customs excise stamps assessed taxes or any other board who any more that the honourable gentleman himself would wish for a verdict against evidence up already had arisen mr attorneygeneral and here in the person of this great lawofficer may be seen the prudence of the serpent hiding itself under the simplicity of the dove—with respect to the partial summoning of jurors as he himself did not summon them he would not says the report undertake to say anything of the fact from his own knowledge as to summoning that must have been the mistake of the reporter summoning could never have been the word of the great lawofficer as to great lawofficers     what may happen to their science is—as to mere matters of fact to put on the mask of ignorance what never happens to it is—to misapply law words nominating is the word as well as the practice here and to the great lawofficer in question most assuredly it never had happened to nominate any more than summon a single juror in the whole course of his life but of the seven offices belonging to the three courts there is not one but what has its officer already designated so often by the name of the master packer by whom this nomination as so often mentioned is regularly and avowedly performed nor is there more than one if so much as one there be that has not its book or books of practice in which this nomination is regularly mentioned as being so performed if the practice of the courts in which they practise and the books in which that practice is delineated be to such a degree a secret to great lawofficers can it be wondered that they should be equally so to laygents such as sheriffs and members of parliament so much for ignorance the quality of the person considered i should have said nescience nescience the cause or accompaniment of so amiable a quality as simplicity we come now to confidence the result and fruit of it but he was confident continues the reporter that any officer of the court who would venture on such a practice would certainly lose his place thus far the great lawofficer for my part the confidence of which my ignorance has been productive is as strong as his can possibly have been it is however of a nature exactly opposite in each of the seven offices there is but one officer by whom unless it be as we have seen by his deputy see part i ch viii p  0  jurors are nominated—i should have said or are supposed to be nominated and he as we have seen is the officer who by whatever other titles designated to other purposes is to this purpose commonly styled the master but were there a hundred of them there is not one who for any such practice as the practice here though improperly designated under the name of a partial summoning—say partial nomination—of jurors could by any possibility be made to lose his place the nature of the case does not admit of it the very nature of the case—unless any such odd accident should happen to the officer as that of having an italian epigram ready cocked which he wants to bring down a reformer with—the very nature of the case as we have seen excludes all evidence stiles esquire for example is among those nominated by the master in easter term said esquire is not among those nominated by said master in trinity term make what addition you please to the number of terms during which poor mr stiles sees himself not nominated—what is there in all this to make the master or anybody else lose his place not that if the place could be lost it would be any such great person as a master—it would be as we have seen some scapegoat or other in the shape of a clerk that would be sacrificed upon the altar of official prudence no—this is the grand use and exquisite contrivance of corruption in this shape viz that be it ever so corrupt it is impossible to punish it—aye or so much as to point suspicion to it pleasant conceit indeed a master lose his place in any court of common law from the days of lord coke—aye or of the english justinian edward the first—did the great lawofficer ever hear of so much as a single case in which for malpractice in this or any other shape any such personage as a master ever lost his place—did he ever hear of so much as the rumour of any such case to form a ground or so much as a colour for such confidence no this is not the way that alma mater lex deals with her own children ah fie upon it darling dear child you must not do so any more do what mischief they will this is the very worst they ever hear from her if on any such occasion even in an age or any number of ages it ever happens to them to hear anything let him look to the statute of hen vi  0 hen vi c   and see    hen viii c  0   and   ed vi c    and    el c    masters and their brother officers with the assistance of feigned plaintiffs of their own feigning outlawing men by wholesale—taking all this trouble and to no other purpose than that of seizing their estates and distributing the produce in the shape of rewards for merit for learned merit displayed in these same offices by these same acts parliament takes up the matter and what does it it passes an act saying to all these learned persons—go and do so no more a master lose his place indeed what a place that he had purchased—purchased outright—of a chief judge what if such a thing were to happen would be the worth of any of these masters places not to speak of judges lord arden the earl of buckinghamshire the earl of hardwicke lord kenyon sir william scott mr perceval lord erskine lord redesdale the pair of honourable knoxes the pair of lord seymours lord manners lord eldon and above all lords lord ellenborough—could it rationally be supposed that these or any other illustrious persons concerned whether in the character either of incumbents or of patrons past present or future contingent in the security of official situations would suffer especially if nonfeasance were to be taken   0 as a cause of forfeiture any such injustice to take place where then would be their lordships plighted faith—the virtually and virtuously plighted faith plighted by learned lordships to fair purchasers chapter ii doublefee abuse plain and embroidered §   ground and embroidery explained the distinction requires explanation and explanation shall be given to it doublefee abuse plain—or as but for the apparent contradiction it might have been called simple—mere waste of public money—nothing worse embroidery to the abuse corruption of jurors and contempt of parliament—in a particular case the wasted money the second of two guineas receiving so particular an application as to operate in the character of a portion of the matter of corruption upon a certain class of jurors and this in defiance of an act of parliament viz of a clause    geo ii c    §   made for the express purpose of fixing upon one guinea—and that not as the regular fee but as the very greatest fee that by jurors of that description shall in any case be received from the several crown solicitors attached to the several boards doublefees to the law officers viz to the officers in the several offices belonging to the several courts of justice which they have to deal with—judges in their own persons included or not included in the persons of their officers whose fees they pocket or derive a profit from in other shapes included beyond doubt and here we see the plain and simple abuse from the same hands to each special juryman where the verdict in which he has concurred has been in favour of the crown an extra guinea where it has been in favour of the party no more than the one guinea the extra guinea being given in the teeth of the act which forbids the giving more than one and here we see combined in one rich mass of embroidery the corruption applied to jurors and the contempt put upon parliament §   doublefee abuse plain—mere waste but for the embroidery of which it forms the ground and for the explanation of which the mention of it is necessary the plain abuse—the mere waste of public money—would scarce be deemed worth a word or a thought anywhere nor indeed would it be in its place here as to our great lawofficer whom we shall presently behold breaking out into a burst of virtuous indignation rising even to abhorrence he had none to spare for a practice so excusable or rather so meritorious as that of applying doublefees in the shape of rewards of merit to merit personified in the persons of law officers to these lawofficers—officers the profits of whose offices find their way in so ample a proportion into the pockets of noble and learned tenants for life whose remaindermen are great lawofficers to this charge we have nothing but his silence nor need anything more be desired considering the admission it involves thus much then is established viz that it is become regular practice for the lords of the treasury in every cause instituted by a crown solicitor under their direction to give out of the taxes to every lawofficer twice as much as according to a rate settled by those whose interest it was to raise it as high as possible—twice as much as even to an estimate thus exaggerated his services are worth including in every instance of an office executed by deputy the fee of the principal by whom the reward is pocketed without the expense of service a list of the lawoffices and lawofficers thus remunerated would in one way or other be instructive the admission might have been as express as words could make it for any thing that any body could have had to fear from it when a tax has been called a tax john bull has now and then been heard to grumble call the tax a fee he is satisfied so as the contribution be but imposed by the men by whom it is pocketed pocketed by the men by whom it is imposed blackstones motto is john bulls—every thing is as it should be but if the imposers are judges and the persons on whom it is imposed are those children     of affliction called suitors—patients with emptiness in their pockets and perpetual blisters on their mind—then it is that he is not barely contented he is delighted he cries litigation is checked some men not being able others not willing to see that in this way wherever there exists a man rich as well as wicked enough to purchase the power of oppression thus offered him for sale it is only the honest and injured litigant or he who if the ability were left him would be litigant that is thus checked and that the dishonest litigant is instigated supported armed by this most mischievous of all taxes every fee exacted from the other side being an instrument of oppression put into his hands §   embroidery—corruption of jurors contempt of parliament we now come to the abuse in which the indignation of the great lawofficer saw its proper and safe mark an abuse of former times supposed to have vanished with the times further says the report speaking of mr whitbread—further he was informed that when a special jury found a verdict for the crown it was usual to pay each man two guineas where their verdict was against the crown they received but one guinea per man here we see the charge come we now to the great lawofficer and his answer mr attorneygeneral says the report in reference to mr whitbreads assertion respecting the two guineas given to special jurymen in cases of verdict against the crown     and the usage of discontinuing to summon special jurors who should once give a verdict against the crown utterly denied the existence of such practices in any of the courts within his memory so far the great lawofficer as to the passage included in brackets it is thus distinguished on the presumption that so far as concerns this practice the supposition of an utter denial must for the reasons already given chap i §   have been a mistake he believes indeed continues the report the former practice did sometimes take place many years since in the court of exchequer but had never occurred for a great number of years and it was a practice which he abhorred as disgraceful to the administration of justice and so there was really a time when corruption in this shape was in use and this corruption applied to the very class of persons—to the very class of jurors—which there has been such abundant occasion here to speak of the very jurors concerned deeply concerned in the guineatrade and the corruption had not as in the case of double fees to lawofficers meaning we may presume all the lawofficers without distinction and upon all occasions the praise of regularity for a cover to it no—it was given to them or kept back from them according as they had behaved—according as they had or had not earned it as to the court in which this abhorred and disgraceful practice was so recently in use it is the court of exchequer—that very court in which in the opinion of the preeminently learned manager himself things go on as we have seen so well—so well—that the idea of making them go on better is treated by him as something worse than needless it is the very court in which recruits for this service are received and trained and their characters if not put on record had in remembrance at least for other services and this practice thus abhorred by the attorneygeneral as disgraceful to the administration of justice how came it in the court of exchequer or in any court calling itself a court of justice ever and so recently too to have place and supposing it not to have place today is there anything and what to prevent its having place again tomorrow whatsoever the causes may be is there any thing unreasonable in the supposition that the same causes may at any time be productive of the same effects not that any such renewal presents itself as a very probable occurrence for the grand object viz dependence—complete and absolute dependence—being by this time so effectually secured as it appears to have been and in so snug and quiet a way corruption in any such barefaced shape would be altogether needless and the danger of and from exposure remote as it would however be is more than by learned prudence would when unsweetened by any ulterior advantage be incurred thus much for the corruption but in the corruption bad as it is we do not by any means see the worst part of the business the worst part of the business is the contempt—the open contempt put upon parliament disobedience such as it is impossible should not have been wilful manifested as towards one of its recent laws here we see the axe laid to the very root of government and by what hands not by jacobins and levellers—not by men who meet at taverns and get up upon tables but by the very husbandmen themselves—the very nurserymen by whom mr reevess tree—the tree that was so near falling upon his head and without falling on it prepared it for so many good plaisters—the very nurserymen by whom that nutritious and umbrageous sugartree ought to have been nursed and who are so well paid for nursing it but of this most serious state offence—this dissolutionthreatening offence—in comparison of which so ordinary and regular an     offence as corruption shews in the eye of a really loyal subject but as a peccadillo more will be said in another place see part iv chap iii be it meantime remembered that the fact is established other facts not altogether devoid of importance remain to be affirmed or disaffirmed by inquiry and evidence by what hand was it that the bribery guinea—the additional and prohibited guinea—was put into the ready hand of the exchequer guineamen in despite of the statute this is a question the answer to which but for forms sake needs no evidence that of the solicitor of the board whichever it was under the orders of which the prosecution was in each instance ordered two other questions—the master packer and the master packers master—the deputy remembrancer and the lord chief baron—were they respectively apprized of it at what time was it that this abhorred practice did sometimes take place—how many were these many years since it was known to do so in whose chief baronship was it in that of eyre—in that of skinner—in that of smyth—or in any part of the thirty years presidency of the old attorney knighted and made honest—as honest as to an english judge it is possible to be—by the title of sir thomas parker or was it at any time under the presidency of the present lord chief baron of whose services in that high station the country has had the benefit now for above these sixteen years if yes whether it has been with his privity that any particular individual instance of this practice has taken place and whether this has been among the means employed by him for the attainment of the object so effectually accomplished and so solicitously defended† these are among the secrets which may perhaps present themselves as worth knowing whensoever mr whitbread refreshed by a summer recess shall feel himself sufficiently refreshed to return to the charge to return to the charge and by one pull more—one pull sufficient in length as well as strength drag them completely and effectually out of the den of cacus should it ever happen to the great lawofficer on any future occasion to get up and come out with a speech of a mixed nature such as the above composed of part argument and part evidence mr whitbread or whosoever on any such occasion may occupy his place will perceive i am inclined to think the use and propriety of decomposing such speech and resolving it into those its component elements as to the argument it need not give him much trouble that may be left to answer itself but the evidence is quite another thing here he will see the use and necessity of that useful operation called crossexamination i dont mean that even upon the great lawofficer himself it should be performed in his own mode of that it would surely be better to leave the monopoly in his own hands i dont mean that he should be called the greatest fool that ever walked over earth with or without a keeper‡ i dont mean that he should be examined for no other purpose than to expose to contempt the witness nor with any other effect than to expose to the same fate the examiner and the judge the examiner who makes such examinations and the judge who suffers them what i mean is that he should be examined—crossexamined—in whatever mode may happen to be best adapted to the getting out the truth—which surely will be a very different mode     part iv— remedies proposed chapter i humble proposal for restoring the constitution in regard to juries §   introduction—necessity of a change in the system in the course of this inquiry two dangerous diseases have necessarily and continually been brought to view—  a rottenness in one of the most important organs of the body politic viz jurytrial   a sort of weakness about the head having for its symptoms on the part of judges and other subordinate members of government a confirmed habitual and scarcely disguised contempt as towards the authority of the legislature the existence of the disease having in both instances been brought to view next comes the more immediately beneficial task but for which that unpleasant one would never have been undertaken viz the indication of the proper remedy in this chapter will be proposed what presents itself as proper to be done in regard to juries that within the sheriffwick of the sheriffs of london and middlesex the institution of special juries composed as at present ought to be abolished—is supposed to have already been sufficiently demonstrated if so the consequence is—that within this district some different system will require to be set on foot but forasmuch as the establishing in one particular district though it be the district of the metropolis a system different from what is in use in the greater part of the kingdom might by infusing additional complication into a system of judicature already so overloaded with complication be productive of preponderate inconvenience hence we are led to the consideration of some plan which being grounded on principles universally applicable     may itself be susceptible of an application equally universal without preponderant inconvenience the remedy here ventured to be proposed is styled without scruple a restorative a plan for the restoring for the purpose of jurytrial the original composition of juries not that the plan is such in exact tenor and detail for if it were it could not be such in principle and effect all political institutions would be exposed to deterioration were it even by the mere change of circumstances and if where the change of circumstances is become material and extensive the original constitution is left unchanged in detail the consequence is—that howsoever in words and outward show it may be the same it is become in substance and effect in a proportionable degree different nor yet would i have it thought that in my vocabulary old is synonymous to good or better as in some vocabularies we have seen it synonymous to not so good or bad be the state of things ever so good to render them still better is in my view of the matter a good operation not a bad one the contrary opinion i leave to those in whose eyes the praise of letting off an old epigram is better worth than the consciousness of having rendered or the endeavour to render a public service accordingly in the endeavour to bring about a restoration of the jury system in principle i have not in detail neglected the opportunity of endeavouring to put it for the future into a state as much superior as possible to any state it ever was in before as to the existing special jury system my real quarrel with it is—not that it is a different one from the original jury system but that in comparison with it it is a bad one §   interests to be provided for—objects to be aimed at for remedy to the disorders in question before we enter upon the task of suggesting particular arrangements it may be of use to have before us a distinct intimation of the several interests requiring to be provided for and for the purpose of such provision of the several objects or ends requisite to be kept in view and aimed at—viz in the framing of a plan for the composition of jurors the selection of the jurors and the compensation if any to be made to them for their labour loss of time and expense the interests concerned are in the first place those of the suitors or parties on both sides of the cause in the next place those of the jurors themselves it is for the sake of the interests of the parties in each cause—or rather of such party or parties as are in the right viz in so far as he or they are in the right—that it becomes an object with the legislator to make such provision as the nature of the case admits of for securing on the part of jurors such degree of relative aptitude in all points intellectual as well as moral as shall render the general tenor of their decisions as conformable as possible to the ends of justice follows a brief intimation of these objects ranged under three general heads— i objects referable to the head of probity or moral aptitude   preserving jurors as effectually as possible from exposure to the action of such sinister influence as is liable to be exercised by or to emane from persons in power and more particularly by or from the presiding and directing judge or judges as above   preserving them as above from such sinister influence in the shape of intimidation corruption or partiality as is liable to be exercised by or to emane from individuals or classes of men in the character whether of parties or of persons having in any other way an interest in the event of each respective cause ii objects referable to the head of intellectual aptitude   in a judicatory so composed providing upon occasion a degree of extraaptitude in respect of intellectual qualifications viz in consideration of and in proportion to any degree of extradifficulty attached to this or that particular cause  —or in consideration of and in proportion to any degree of extraimportance iii objects having respect to the interests of the jurors themselves   reducing to its minimum the quantity of vexation and expense attached to judicial service in this line   providing compensation for such portion of vexation and expense as cannot be avoided without preponderant inconvenience viz without preponderant prejudice to the main object above mentioned §   arrangements proposed—  in common jury causes mix gentlemen with yeomen here follows a slight sketch of the arrangements that present themselves as promising to be conducive to the attainment of the above objects in case of conflict regard being had all along to their respective degrees of importance absolute and comparative—       the distinction between common and special jurymen to be still preserved the object aimed at by this arrangement is—provision for intellectual aptitude   in ordinary or common jury cases—i e in those cases in which at present the jurors are all of them of the class of common jurymen say for distinction yeomen jurymen—let some one or two of the class of special jurymen say for distinction gentlemen jurymen be regularly inserted into each jury—object intellectual aptitude—viz under the expectation that for the benefit of justice the influence of understanding upon understanding will exercise itself of course upon the lessinformed class by the instrumentality of the betterinformed   number of gentlemen jurors not more than one or two the interest provided for by this restriction is that of jurors—object avoidance of unnecessary vexation and expense viz of vexation and expense by reason of attendance viz on the part of an overproportion of jurors of this class   the district in which the gentlemen jurors are taken let it be a district as remote as on other accounts will be consistent with convenience from the district in which the yeomen jurymen are taken—object providing for moral aptitude on the part of yeomen jurors viz by preserving them from being subjected to sinister influence—viz to influence of will over will—whether in the shape of intimidation or in the shape of corruption—emanating from gentlemen jurors at the hands of the gentlemen juros—of the men of superior education—the salutary species of influence—viz the influence of understanding over understanding—of opinion on opinion—is looked for and desired the use of the distance proposed is—to serve as a bar to the exercise of will over will to men of the yeomen class—to shopkeepers handicrafts c living in the same neighbourhood with the gentleman it might frequently happen to view in his supposed disposition towards them a source of hope or fear by distance this source of corruption would be cut off §   arrangements continued—  special juries halfandhalf power to any party on either side to cause to be substituted to the common jury composed as above a halfandhalf jury† viz a jury—not composed of all gentlemen as in the case of the special jury constituted as at present—but containing any number of gentlemen not exceeding half viz out of twelve six the interest thus endeavoured to be served is of course that of the suitors the objects endeavoured to be secured are in the first place by the enlargement of the number of the gentlemen jurors intellectual aptitude viz by adding to the chance of finding a juryman qualified in an extra degree for taking the lead and guiding the decision in the next place by the restriction put upon the number of the jurymen of that class moral aptitude viz by preventing the preponderance of partiality as between rank and rank of the sort of mixture here proposed the importance is such as seems to claim a particular degree of development in every species of judicatory without exception but in a more preeminent degree in every judicatory of which a jury forms a part of all imaginable causes of misdecision what is commonly understood by the term partiality is that which the legislator finds greatest difficulty in coping with wheresoever the nature of the influence—the sinister influence—supposes two parties—one acting the other acted on—his task is comparatively an easy one all that in that case he has to do is—to keep them from coming together and with a moderate degree of probity exertion and intelligence how easy that is may have been seen already but the case of partiality supposes not any such parties it supposes not any tempter from without the tempter dwells within—within the very bosom of this occasional judge and being there in vain would legislators dislodge him he bids defiance to their utmost efforts religion or politics—it by the nature of the case any such cause of dissension happens to be called forth—called forth in such manner as to excite in the bosoms of any of the     jurors sentiments—whether of sympathy or antipathy—in relation to the parties on each or either side—against this source of partial affection—of corrupt affection as even though there be no corruptor it may be styled—against this source of misdecision all that in the station of the legislator can be done by human wisdom is here without avail in this shape corruption may have established in a mans bosom ever so complete an empire—there it must reign and reign uncontrouled you can never punish it for you can never prove it among jurymen a possible and not unnatural source of partiality on either or both sides of a cause and thence of dissension is that of which difference of rank and station in life is the instrument with partiality and dissension in this shape the proposed halfandhalf jury as well as any other jury stands exposed to be infected and indeed by the nature of its constitution and composition may appear and not altogether without reason to be exposed to that accident in a particular degree but while it contains in itself the seeds of the disease it furnishes at the same time a remedy—a remedy—such an one as cannot in any other mode be supplied take for example a case such as in the country at least where there is no guineacorps is frequently exemplified—a special jury with a deficiency in it made up by yeomen by common jurymen in the character of talesmen suppose as between a gentleman and a yeoman a cause so circumstanced as to awake in the bosoms of these different parts of the population of the jurybox—to awaken and to excite to a degree of excitation fatal to justice the passions and partialities congenial to their respective stations in this case let there be seven gentlemen to five yeomen the gentleman carries it but—suppose six and six as under the proposed constitution will constantly be the case—in this case partiality may reign without opposition in eleven bosoms so as one of the twelve even though it be but one be the seat of cool and impartial justice he who has right on his side be he gentleman or yeoman gains the cause of the proposed provision by which the number of gentlemen jurymen even on a special jury is limited to half the whole number viz to six out of the twelve the expected use is as follows—in ordinary cases for the purpose of guidance by means of intellectual aptitude one or at most two was as above §   regarded as sufficient for this same purpose the additional chance afforded by the substitution of six to two or one may it is supposed be regarded as amply sufficient even in any the most extraordinary cases as to the case of a contention between opposite classical partialities a case of this sort it is hoped and supposed will comparatively speaking be a rare one but that it should now and then find itself exemplified is no more than what ought to be expected and provided against accordingly here then comes in an occasion for applying to this case that beautiful feature of jurytrial which by the use thus proposed to be made of it can scarcely fail to have been already presented to the readers notice that no less politic than generous arrangement contrived by the genius of some now forgotten statesman for the protection of foreigners against those adverse interests and antipathies which are so unhappily apt to have place in the bosoms of natives a mind in which virtue in both her forms moral and intellectual shines thus bright can hardly have been that of a lawyer in matters of foreign politics—of political economy—in every branch of knowledge not immediately conducive to the advancement of their own personal or professional interests the breasts of lawyers especially in the highest situations are even in these comparatively enlightened times among the most noted tabernacles of ignorance of ignorance and of that error which when accompanied with the degree of presumption so natural to such situations is so much worse and more mischievous than simple ignorance when for the benefit of foreigners the halfandhalf jury was introduced it was not confined to the cases called civil cases nor among cases called criminal to those of inferior importance it covered the whole field of jurytrial as to specialjury trial slid in by lawyers for the advancement of their own interests and accordingly as it were by stealth introduced by them as we have seen in pursuit of those two grand sinister objects increase of power and profit to themselves they neither dared nor cared to give it any such allcomprehensive range but if needful for causes of property and in the case of offences comparatively trivial how much more needful must it not be in causes which to the individuals at least whose station is on the defendants side are of the very highest importance—causes of life and death a principle which in expectation of the superiority of intelligence expected from superiority of rank gives up the reins without controul to every prejudice and every partiality with which it can happen to that intellectual superiority to be accompanied is rotten at the core argument against and for a halfandhalf jury as a substitute to the existing special jury—dialogue between a gentleman and a yeoman gentleman—we are in possession of     having a jury of our own sort at pleasure that possession we claim to have preserved to us yeoman—more shame for you on no principle either of natural justice or of the english constitution can you defend this so recently usurped advantage as to us so moderate is our claim that with that equality of numbers which is all we ask for the advantage in any contest between you and us would still be most decidedly on your side on your side is the superiority of intellectual force in all its shapes—knowledge address habit of taking the lead on your side is the whole force of that influence which exerts itself on the understanding on your side is every element of what is called respectability education opulence power rank connexion on no other occasion does this your superiority ever find you backward in the assertion of it asserting it on every other occasion and to every other purpose—on this occasion alone to this purpose alone you will not surely take upon you to deny it on your side is the whole force of that still more irresistible influence which by will is exerted over will to your class ours looks up—looks up with hope—for employment custom protection everything yours to ours for nothing from your class ours has everything to fear yours from ours nothing without any the slightest ground or so much as a pretence a man of your class has but to bring an action against one of ours—or if an action be not oppressive enough to file a bill against him—his ruin follows of course this is what we are indebted for both of us to your good friends the lawyers i say yours for yours they are as against us and yours they would be if they were any bodys but to come to the point at once can you seriously think and seriously take upon you to say that in case of difference six of us can in general have as good a chance of persuading six of you as six of you of persuading six of us what we not merely consent to but propose and desire is—that in ordinary cases—in all cases but those in which this proposed equality of numbers happens to be insisted on there should be some two or one at least of you for our guidance—so far is this claim on our part from having for its principle any sentiment of hostility towards you—any sentiment inconsistent with cordiality respect and deference as to confidence unbounded confidence it is more than human nature can ever in the instance of any individual much more in any large class of individuals lay claim to with any colour of reason or justice and with political liberty in any shape or degree whatsoever it is utterly incompatible §   arrangements continued—  compensationmoney to jurymen   in the allowance to jurymen distinguish two parts one for demurrage viz at the place of trial the other for journeys viz thither and back demurragemoney the same to all journeymoney proportioned to the distance between the place of trial and each jurymans place of residence and rated at so much a mile   to save calculation and prevent disputes after taking in each parish a particular spot—say the site of the parish church—for the mark let the distances of the several parisbes from the place of trial be previously ascertained once for all and in the form of a table written or printed kept hung up in the court and also in the office in which payment is made to the jurymen   for demurrage let the allowance to each juryman be so much aday for the whole time of his necessary stay and without regard to the number of causes in which it may have happened to him to serve the amount being preappointed viz by a general regulation having for its object the fixing it at whatever sum is regarded as being at that time and place necessary and sufficient for the maintenance of a juryman of the yeomen class which fixation may consequently in respect of the change in the value of money require amendment from time to time       let the allowance be neither more nor less to gentlemen than to yeomen jurymen for if to the gentleman the expense of attendance will naturally be greater than to the yeoman it is because in general the gentleman in respect of his superior opulence is better able to afford it true it is that the rank of the gentleman is not exempt from indigence understand casual and relative indigence but neither is that of the yeoman and surely it is in the worstprovided class that the degree of indigence and consequent suffering is capable of being most acute §   arrangements continued—  fund on which the compensationmoney shall be charged   as well in ordinary or common jury causes viz where by the supposition no more than one or two gentlemen are upon the jury as in extraordinary or specialjury causes where also by the supposition as many gentlemen as yeomen are upon the jury let the expense of the above proposed compensationmoney say jurymoney be borne—not by the suitor on either side but by the public at large—viz by being added to the countyrates—unless for this particular purpose alone it were worth while to look out for a mode of assessment more equable the interest here provided for is that of the suitors viz on that side of the cause on which whether in the right or the wrong this part of the costs of suit would otherwise be imposed†   in a specialjury cause i e where at the requisition of a party on either side a halfandhalf jury has been ordered to prevent a disproportionate quantity of vexation in this shape from falling on the gentlemens class let an extra sum of money at the rate of so much ahead for the extra number of jurors allowed viz four or five be charged in the way of costs on the party by whom the requisition was made payable however—not to the gentlemen jurymen but to the county or other public fund on which as above the ordinary expense of jurymoney is proposed to be charged interest provided for—that of jurymen viz gentlemen jurymen—object aimed at—prevention of vexation—viz of vexation which     in the shape of juryservice might otherwise fall in an undue proportion on that class   immediately after the trial upon the bringing in of the verdict let the judge instead of leaving the expense of the extra jurymoney to lie as above upon the party by whom the halfandhalf jury was required have power either to impose it on any other party or simply to take it off in which latter case the contribution destined as above for the public fund will for this time not be received   in the event of his exercising in either way the above proposed power it ought to be under the notion and naturally will be that the cause is of the number of those which on some special ground or other will warrant the imposing on the gentlemens class this addition to the quantity of vexation imposed upon them in this shape this special ground will as above be either—  extra difficulty   extra importance or   demand for equality of numbers on the score of apprehended partialities—say more briefly apprehended partialities in the terms of his order let the judge specify on which of these several grounds it has been founded   for a further check upon the practice of making wanton demands on the time of the gentlemens class lest the simple charge of the extra jurymoney which at the present established rate will amount to no more than either four or five guineas should not be sufficient let the judge have moreover power to increase it at his discretion up to a limited amount suppose for example treble the amount of the simple charge   the form of the judges order may in any of the above cases be extremely simple—as for example—  this cause being by me deemed proper for the cognizance of a special jury viz on the score of then proceed to say extra difficulty extra importance or apprehended partialities any one or any two or all three as the case may be let no extra jurymoney be paid—or let extra jurymoney be paid—not by—being the party by whom the requisition of the special jury was made but by— mentioning some other party or parties   the requisition made of a special jury in this cause by— here mention the name of the party and his station in the cause being by me deemed groundless and wantonly made instead of—being the simple amount of the extra jurymoney payable to and in exoneration of the county fund let the sum paid by him be— here mention the sum   let fines for nonattendance be paid to and in exoneration of the fund on which the expense of jurymoney is imposed for further explanation and justification of the above proposed arrangements a few more words may perhaps not be ill bestowed as in the case of the yeomens class so in the case of the gentlemens class justice requires that as in any other shape so in the shape in question a disproportionate quantity of vexation shall not be imposed thence the ground for the preventive measures above proposed but rather than any extra pecuniary allowance in the name of compensationmoney should be given to individuals of the gentlemens class in contradistinction to and at the expense of those of the yeomens class better the money were thrown into the sea by any such extra allowance a pernicious principle—a principle of sordid and oppressive partiality—would be perpetuated and public service in this shape would instead of being a burthen indeed but an honourable and useful nor that a heavy burthen—imposed on all alike would as at present be an object of rapacity and intrigue sought for and obtained by such as are least deserving of it if upon this plan vexation in the shape in question should in a proportion a little greater and it could be but a little greater fall on the gentlemens class than on the yeomens the overplus would it is supposed find for its justification the following grounds none of which could have any application in the opposite case—   in the character of suitors to the lot of the gentlemens class fall in by far the larger proportion as well causes that are attended with extra difficulty as those which are attended with extra importance   when on the only remaining ground viz the ground of apprehended partialities a special jury is allowed i e a jury containing an extra proportion of gentlemen it is principally if not solely for the protection of the interests of this class in case of any conflict which it may have with the interests passions or prejudices of the other receiving this extra benefit they ought not to grudge a small portion of extra burthen   between the gentlemens class and the yeomens the characteristic difference is—that of the gentlemans time a portion may be applied to this public purpose—to the purpose of judicature without imposing upon him a loss of a pecuniary nature whereas in the case of the yeoman a tax upon his time is besides the tax upon his time a tax upon his purse   service in this line being a source of useful information and like a scholastic exercise a source of intellectual power whether it be or be not pleasant to the particular individual it is for the advantage of the public at large that each man should have his share of it and if this be true even in the instance of the yeomens class whose share in other branches of government is comparatively so small it must be so in a more eminent degree in the instance of the gentlemens class   0 whose share in other branches of government is comparatively so large by service in the department of justice in the character of juryman a man is in some measure trained and fitted for service in the field of government at large in the character of parliamentary elector   it may be of use that it should be distinctly seen on what ground stands the demand for an extra number of gentlemen jurymen on the score of extra difficulty or extra importance—in a word on any other ground than that of apprehended partialities to the prejudice of that same class for the purpose of guidance if by no other than the only useful and proper sort of influence viz influence of understanding over understanding one man of superior intellectual aptitude is as sufficient as any greater number could be to this purpose therefore the only advantage gained by any addition to the number of gentlemen in the jury is the additional chance it affords of obtaining the requisite degree of aptitude in this shape in the person of some one in regard to the fines for nonattendance the present system being inefficient and almost completely nugatory to give effect to them and reconcile at the same time to each other the antagonizing ends of justice would require some new arrangements which if intentions were but honest might easily enough be carried into effect on this head a few general hints are as much as room can be found for in this place—   the interest that individuals at large have in the general fund—say the county fund—not affording to any one of them a motive adequate to the purpose of engaging him to watch over its interest in this behalf with effect a special interest must be given to some one person—for example the person by whom the monies of this fund are received a special interest viz in the form of a per centage upon the amount   into the pocket of this one person the money ought to be made to find its way as it were of course viz without need of a lawsuit to be instituted by him much less by any one else for that purpose   on nonappearance of any person summoned to appear for the purpose of jury service let the money be by a certain day thereafter levied on him of course unless at the day appointed for appearance in lieu of the person himself there appear under his signature a paper exhibiting some one or more of a list of legitimate excuses to be allowed and mentioned as such in the form of the summons the facts of such excuses to be established by an affidavit with or without coattestators as the case may be according to printed forms preappointed for the purpose free of stampduty and every other avoidable expense were the arrangements left to him a member of the firm of judge and co would settle them on this occasion as he does on others from this burthen as from others application made for relief in the case where by accident as above the burthen has been rendered undue would be more burthensome than the burthen itself of an application thus made the burthen would be certain success precarious defaulters without excuse would remain unpunished defaulters with good excuse—defaulters from necessity—would be oppressed to each useful purpose the system would be inefficient suffering to particular individuals with pickings to judge and co out of the same would be the only fruit of it at the same time the whole business would be conducted with the most unimpeachable regularity precedent would have been pursued in everything that was done and thus as usual all complaining mouths would be shut unlearned mouths shut learned shoulders saved harmless—saved from every particle of burthen as in all other shapes so in the shape of blame §   arrangements continued—  formation of the qualified list—viz in other counties c as well as middlesex the basis of the jury system being the qualified list the plan here brought to view might appear chargeable with oversight or negligence if a topic so material were altogether passed by in silence but the relevant facts being in so high a degree diversified and for the most part so inextricably buried in obscurity the nature of the case precludes every such attempt as that of proposing in relation to this part of the subject particularly in such a place as the present anything like a detailed determinate and in a geographical sense allcomprehensive system of arrangements by change be it what it may—by innovation on this as on every other part of the field of law—inconvenience in some shape or other in some degree or other is sure to be produced unless therefore and until inconvenience in some specific shape can be pointed out as resulting or about to result from the arrangements actually in use this general consideration loose as it is will in each division of the country as well as at every period of time operate as a sufficient bar against any change that can be proposed but no sooner is any such specific inconvenience pointed out than the bar is provisionally removed and then comes the operation of making a comparative estimate of the amount of inconvenience on both sides in such sort that when placed by the mind in two opposite scales as in a balance a just conclusion may be formed determining on which side the preponderance has place     but in different territorial divisions counties and privileged boroughs taken together circumstances are in this respect so extremely different that independently of those changes which in some or all of them are liable to be brought about by time it can scarcely happen but that if the same course be in all of them pursued without variation inconvenience and to no inconsiderable amount would upon inquiry be found in some instances to have place hence it is that upon a general view of the subject and antecedently to such particular inquiry as no power other than that of parliament is competent to make with effect a general inquiry of the nature above intimated cannot with propriety be considered as superfluous for any such inquiry the present however is not the proper place the alarming political grievance the utter destruction impending over the palladium of the english constitution the liberty of the press—this was the consideration but for which the present inquiry would never have been engaged in of this mischief the county of middlesex has by the causes already spoken of been rendered almost the sole theatre to the exclusion of these mischiefs so far as depends upon the composition of the qualified list an assemblage formed upon the principles upon which the composition of that list has hitherto been grounded may for anything that hath as yet presented itself to my view be sufficient i mean of course with the help of such ulterior arrangements as may be conformable to the principles herein already brought to view on what persons ought the obligation of serving on juries to be imposed answer—on every human being but for some apt and special cause either of exclusion or exemption it is therefore by the indication of such causes with the reasons on which their aptitude in that character respectively depends that the proper abstract answer to that question will in its several ramifications be furnished so far as concerns exclusion these causes would be found to bear a considerable analogy to the causes of exclusion applicable to the function of parliamentary elector in some instances a cause that applies to the one function would be found exactly applicable to the other—while in other instances such coincidence will be seen not to have place but in the instance of every circumstance that in the character of a cause of exclusion can be proposed with reference to either function whether it be deemed applicable to both functions or to one only and whichsoever be that one considerable light would be seen to be thrown on the subject by the comparison thus proposed thus much may be said of both cases viz that consideration had of the great change in the value of money as well as in other influencing circumstances in abundance if the existing arrangements were proper at the times at which they were respectively made it is impossible that taken altogether they should be equally so at present at the same time from the mere existence of that comparative degree of impropriety it follows not that the advantages capable of being gained by the removal of the impropriety would be an overbalance for the inconvenience that ought to be apprehended from a change a state of things by no means incapable of being realized and which ought therefore to be kept in view is—that the arrangements having been in a less degree proper at the time when they were made have by change of circumstances been rendered more proper than at first—that for example the pecuniary part of the qualification having originally been set at too high a rate has by the depreciation of money been rendered more proper in the present less immature state of society than it was in the more immature state of things which gave birth to it for any attempt to penetrate any further into the subject it would be time enough if for any practical purpose the observations herein already submitted to the public should be found to have a claim to notice taking the county of middlesex in the first place for the local field it would then be time enough to extend the inquiry to the formation of the several original qualified lists for the several species of juries relation being likewise had to the several species of judicatories in which they have to serve it would then also be time enough to extend and apply the whole of the inquiry to the several other counties and judicial districts included in counties should any such inquiry come to be instituted the facts collected and brought to light in relation to the county of middlesex by the public spirit the activity and intelligence of sir richard phillips see his abovementioned work throughout will be found highly serviceable for out of them may be formed a basis for inquiry applicable to the several other cases just alluded to as to all these matters for the present at least i can therefore do neither more nor better than to refer the reader to that eminently valuable and meritorious publication     §   arrangements continued—  corruption by individuals how prevented—no party should foreknow his jurymen as well in specialjury causes viz with a halfandhalf jury as in commonjury causes with one or two gentlemen jurymen let matters be so ordered that to the parties on each side it shall to the latest moment be imposible to know who the persons are that will serve as jurymen in the cause the interest thus provided for is that of the suitors viz in each cause that of him who is in the right the object aimed at is—on the part of jurymen moral aptitude viz in respect of exemption from such corruptive influence—such influence of will over will—as it may lie in the way of individuals in the character of suitors to exercise on the decision of those their occasional judges on this occasion before we come to speak of the means conducive to this end observation will require to be taken of a sort of conflict which has place between interest and interest and thence between object and object between the interest of suitors viz such as are on the right side as above and the interest of jurymen if that of jurymen were the interest that possessed the sole or the predominant claim to regard rotation and that alone would be the principle employed for as will be seen in so far as that principle is departed from in so far on the part of jurymen vexation—the aggregate mass of vexation produced by the obligation of serving in that character must viz in respect of the number of them subjected to it be increased but in that case of the jurors who will have to serve in a given cause if no supernumeraries are summoned the whole number or if to make allowance for accidents supernumeraries are summoned but in no greater number than is necessary to make sufficient allowance for such accidents a large proportion of that number might come to be foreknown to the suitors in that same cause here then is a door open to corruption—to corruption in that shape—or at least in one of those shapes—in which the existence of it—the notorious and declared existence of it—gave birth to the first of the whole string of those statutes relative to juries in which any mention is made of special juries if the principle of rotation be taken for the basis two other principles ought therefore to be mixed with it mixed with it in the character of correctives and preservatives correctives viz to the tendency of that principle when employed crude and single preservatives viz against the danger of such sinister influence the one is—the principle of disconnexion as above explained disconnexion as between gentlemen jurymen and yeomen jurymen by means of local distance the other is—the principle of chance viz as applied to the determination of the individuals that shall serve together on the occasion of each several cause but when applied on the occasion in question to the purpose in question the principle of chance requires an increase of number—of the number of persons subjected to this vexation it requires for the purpose of each several cause the attendance of a number greater than the number of those who will have to serve on the occasion of that same cause for if twelve the number of those that serve on each cause were all that under and in virtue of the summonses delivered to them by the sheriff were capable of serving in that cause the consequence is that of each man in so far as it were certain that he would attend it would be certain that he would serve and in this certainty there would be no room for chance true it is that of his attendance even in that case there could be no absolute certainty for besides the accidents such as death and sickness to which all mankind are subject and over which the will of man has no controul if relation being made to the state of the law on one hand and the state of his own affairs and inclinations on the other it were to this or that man more agreeable to stay away in despite of the law than attend in obedience to the law he would do—as jurymen or at least as gentlemen jurymen are at present suffered to do by gentlemen judges—he would stay away accordingly but though to any good purpose certainty would not in that case be attainable yet to a bad purpose viz to the purpose of corruption in the way in question a probability but too little short of certainty would be attainable for the corrupter foreknowing—knowing as soon as the list of the persons summoned or about to be summoned for service in the cause in question were known to him—the corrupter knowing of twelve persons in the power of every one of whom it would be bating accidents to serve would at the same time know of so many persons of the attendance of any one or more of whom he would in the event of his succeeding in his plan of corruption in their instance be sufficiently assured in the case of common juries the statute so often spoken of   geo ii c    has in §   with or without intending it afforded for     this salutary application of the principle of chance a sufficient basis    being the greatest number    the least number which regard being apparently had to the difference between county and county in respect to local extent it allows to be summoned to appear on each occasion—for example at each assize—for the trial of whatever number of causes may happen to be ready for trial at that assize but not only of this least allowed number    but of a considerably less number it is evident that with the help of the principle of chance it might be made use of in such manner as to render corruption—previous intercourse and thence corruption—on the part of individuals practically speaking impossible for the first cause that comes on for trial immediately before the trial let the names of all such as are present be put into a dark box shaken together and so drawn out if of these twelve it were determined that after this first cause they required respite though for the judge who has the guidance of them there is no respite these might on the second cause be all of them set aside and for that second cause the lottery be confined to the remainder and the first twelve being after their respite replaced in the lottery so on through any number of causes but if in the instance of any one cause it be in the power of any one person of himself to determine or by any other means to know of a set of persons in the power of each or even any one of whom it shall be in the character of juryman to serve in the power of that one person it is whether by neglect or by design to introduce an intended corrupter to so many persons in whose power it will be if corrupted to secure to him the verdict he desires and the greater the number of the persons to whom it happens to be in possession of this knowledge the greater the number of such possible introductors and by that means the greater the probability that such corruption will take place let for instance the rule be such that it it is by a certain person—for example the sheriff that is to say the attorney by whom in the character of undersheriff the business is done—that it is by this person that the list of the persons who are to be summoned to serve as jurors on the occasion in question—for example on the assize in question—is to be determined—that at the assize in question the number of these is to be   —and that in the first cause that stands on the roll the    first of those that appear are to serve in this state of things it is evident that if to this attorney it should happen to find his convenience either in corrupting the requisite number of jurymen himself which might be attended with some danger or in letting in another corrupter upon them which might be done without any danger the regular practice will find itself altogether well adapted to the purpose in this state of things thus for illustration sake supposed we see in aid of the practice of corruption two auxiliary principles—viz choice and foreknowledge confederated but even without the aid of choice foreknowledge may very well be sufficient for the purpose suppose it settled that in the gross or total qualified list the names shall be entered in the order of the alphabet moreover supposing the whole number in a given county   0 and    the number to serve on each assize—that for the first assize the    whose names stand first in the alphabetical list thus composed shall be summoned to attend for the next assize the next    and so on on this plan if pursued without deviation it will not be in the power of the sheriff that is of the attorney his deputy to choose a set of eventual jurymen for the purpose of their being corrupted but what is worse it will be in the power of every litigant to whom the order of things in question is known to find his way to those on whom he proposes to himself to make the experiment—to find his way to them of himself and without the need of being beholden for introduction to an undersheriff or anybody else thus much as to juries in general—thus much as to common juries thus much as to what in that case is capable of having place as to what in that case actually has place it is what it might take up too much room to state and what at this moment the means of inquiring into are not within my reach as to the case of special juries what actually has place lies in a narrower compass and at the same time within reach in this case everything that for the furtherance of corruption by possibility could have been done has been done whether it be constant corruption administered and with certainty of success by and for the benefit of persons in high situations as such and without either risk or trouble on their part as above—or occasional and casual corruption to be on this or that occasion administered in his private and separate account by this or that particular person in or out of high situation to whom it may happen to stand in need of such assistance in the first place choice as we have so often had occasion to observe is put into their hands viz by the power of nomination vested in the hands of the master packer for that purpose in the next place among the comparatively small number    in the instance of which the choice is made and attendance accordingly commanded foreknowledge is rendered to the purpose in question absolute for out of these    who as per list are summoned of those that appear the    whose names stand first upon that same list are the    that serve     for the furtherance of corruption the utmost that could have been done having thus been actually done to what cause to what psychological cause having its seat in the breasts of learned and reverend lords and gentlemen shall the result be ascribed to design it would be of a piece with all their other designs and all their other doings to imbecility on the part of no other set of men would imbecility be to be found weak and palpable enough to match with it for note once more that it was amid the cry of corruption—actually experienced and acknowledged corruption that this state of things so exquisitely adapted to the purpose of that same corruption was in and by this very statute   geo ii c    part confirmed part organized §   unanimity increases the aid afforded to corruption by foreknowledge by the principle of forced unanimity so long as that abomination is suffered to continue an enormous degree of facility as already observed is given to the corruption of jurors since by any one of the twelve so that one be but sufficiently remunerated for the quantity of endurance necessary the suffrages of the remaining eleven may be forced and though in any given instance as matters stand it should not be capable of being foreknown to a certainty that this or that one individual will on the particular trial in question be upon the serving list—foreknown viz time enough for administering to him the matter of corruption with effect yet by gaining divers individuals each of them likely to stand upon the serving list the probability of success may in any degree be increased were that flagitious principle rooted out and the principle which gives the power to a majority seated in its place—were this done even a slight admixture of chance if it be too much to say the rational and honest principle of itself and without the help of chance would suffice to render corruption in this shape morally impossible if no number less than a majority viz less than seven out of twelve were sufficient to command a verdict palpably unjust upon the face of it no such verdict could be commanded without a completely successful application of the matter of corruption to that large number but taking the state of morality among the people upon the worst footing imaginable the chance of finding or creating on the sudden so much depravity on the part of so large a number and that out of a limited greater number cannot but be extremely small and ere he could give himself that small chance the corrupter would be under the necessity of putting it into the power of each of the seven to ruin him in character at least by covering him with infamy such would be his difficulty even supposing the twelve who are to serve on the trial—supposing them all of them in their turn at and during the quantity of time that lies open to the intrigue—all of them during all that time to a certainty foreknown and suppose such absolute foreknowledge unattainable—suppose for example fourandtwenty the number of the gross list of any of whom the twelve upon the serving list may happen to be composed it is easy to see that to this our supposed corrupter the improbability of success and at the same time the magnitude of the danger must in this case receive a prodigious increase for in this case to give him the same assurance of success as in the former case no smaller than nineteen is the number that would be necessary to be thus corrupted but upon the principle of sham unanimity—upon this principle which gives the command of the verdict to any one—not only if all twelve were foreknown might the corrupter by the corruption of a single juryman give himself a certainty of success but if no other knowledge were obtained more determinate than that of the fourandtwenty out of which the twelve would be taken the same success in the preparatory operation of corruption would still give him an even chance of succeeding in the ultimate object of the corruption viz the commanding of an unjust verdict and by every additional juryman whom he could contrive to gain this even chance would receive a proportionable augmentation until by the rising of the number of the corrupted to thirteen absolute certainty would even in this case be produced thus stands the matter upon the supposition of a gross list equal in number to twice the serving list augment the relative number of the gross list the difficulty of corruption will it is evident be in both cases increased and in each case by an amount that might be ascertained but is not worth ascertaining for the present purpose one thing will be evident viz that on the principle which gives the command of the verdict to a majority out of twelve under the most favourable circumstances in respect of the number of the gross list corruption could never obtain a chance nearly equal to what on the principle which gives the command of the verdict to any one corrupted juryman it possesses under the circumstances least favourable in that respect seventytwo is the greatest number that can in any county be returned and appear for the trial of all the causes that can at one and the same assize present themselves and even under so great a disadvantage if the power be in a single juryman the corruption though it were but of a single man of the seventytwo gives the     corrupter a chance of success viz as one to six whereas if the power be in the majority though the number resturned and appearing be no greater than the twelve who are necessary to serve insomuch that all who are to serve are foreknown the corrupter may have gained six or at least five without having as yet given himself any chance at all §  0 arrangements respecting form viz the form of the proposed new law for giving expression to the operations which under this head require in my view of the matter to be performed a very few words will suffice presenting themselves as requisite in relation to this part of the field of law the mention of these operations could not on this occasion be omitted but in relation to this part of the field the demand for these operations cannot be more urgent nor the propriety of them more indisputable than they are in relation to every other part of the same as yet scarce cultivated waste   consolidate into one act all laws relative to juries   repeal in the lump the whole of the existing chaos   place the whole of the rule of action on the footing of statute law of the practice of the several judicatories whatsoever is approved of adopt and give expression to whatsoever is not approved of abrogate in the lump   except in virtue of such special powers as shall in the tenor of the law be thought fit to be given for the purpose forbid all alterations and regulations that might otherwise be made in or respecting the field of practice in question in and by the authority of the respective judicatories chapter ii state of jury package in scotland on this head much stands expressed in a few words extract from an anonymous pamphlet published on the occasion of the scotch judiciary reform under the title of reflections on the administration of civil justice in scotland c edinburgh for blackwood london for longman  co   0 —page    note— the mode of appointing juries in criminal cases is most improper the sheriff may return fortyfive men chosen by him at pleasure the judge may select any fifteen of them to compose the jury peremptory challenges are unknown is it not obvious that these two officers have the fate of a prisoner often in their hands—in other words that they can return what is termed in england a packed jury nothing should be left in criminal cases to the discretion of persons over whom the crown is always likely to have influence and therefore it is much to be wished that a clause should be introduced in the bill which is to be founded on the resolutions in order to regulate the appointment of juries in criminal cases if in the statement thus made by an anonymous though not altogether an unknown hand there be a syllable of truth—and by known and wellinformed and trustworthy informants i am assured that it is correctly true—the packing system has in that kingdom been carried to a pitch of perfection equal in efficiency at least if not in dexterity to that which it has attained in england and this not only where personal liberty alone but where life and everything else is at stake if in the whole population of that kingdom electors and elected there be a human being fit for anything better than to serve as a tool in the chest belonging to lord melville or a commissioner in the committee of reform headed and characterized by that name behold an occasion for him to show himself     chapter iii humble proposal for restoring the authority of parliament §   unless the authority of parliament be vindicated package cannot be abolished i come now to the second of the political disorders here in question viz the contempt—the habitual and undisguised contempt—manifested by judges and other subordinate functionaries as towards the authority of parliament or rather for in this consists the malignity of the disorder the connivance—the habitual and unvaried connivance—by which this contempt has been encouraged and confirmed on this head a conception that will naturally present itself to everybody and at the first glance is—that the present is of the number of those occasions in which the difficulty consists—not so much in determining what it is that is proper to be done as in engaging men to do what is proper to be done whatsoever it may be to the justness of this remark i can find nothing to oppose accordingly of the two following sections the business of the first is—to do what can be done by so weak an instrument of communication as the present towards holding up to view the flagrancy of the disease of the other to present to view and in a specific shape what seems to be the proper remedy penetrated all the while with the clearest and acutest sense of the minuteness of the chance in favour of its being applied this bitter as it is is a cup which cannot be put by package it is true constitutes that particular abuse which is the object—the only direct object—of the present work but so intimate is the connexion between this disorder and that which consists in the habitual contempt of parliament that while this radical weakness remains uncured any remedy that can be applied to the derivative malady will either be from the very first inoperative or at the very best will in a short time cease to operate if the authority of parliament had not been set at nought by judges the package of juries could not have been established much less as we have seen it openly defended and while parliament continues as it has done to suffer its authority to be thus set at nought in vain would it endeavour to put an end to this package juries will as at present continue to be packed to apply to this abuse the only possible remedy—i mean the only possible direct and special remedy—it would be necessary that parliament should make a fresh law but if when the fresh law has been made judges continue determined to deal by it as judges have done hitherto by the existing ones viz to disobey it—and parliament to do as parliament has done hitherto viz to sit still and without a thought of giving effect to its authority see itself disobeyed the trouble of making fresh laws under the notion of applying a remedy to the other abuse may as well be spared §   contempt put upon the bill of rights by the lord chief barons package as to the statutes which bear in detail upon the subject of juries and even in respect of the clauses in question thought to bear upon special as well as common juries these it is true were on the occasion in question by the learned judge more particularly in question viz the lord chief baron violated in intention only and not in effect special juries having by the fraud of the learned penman been exempted as we have seen from those provisions against corruption the demand for which was so much more urgent in that case than in the instance of common juries but though in the manner that has been seen the contempt entertained by this preeminently learned person not to speak at present of any other preeminently learned persons as towards the authority of parliament failed by accident and by misconception to fall upon these statutes at which it was principally aimed it fell as we shall see without accident upon another statute i mean the statute commonly called the bill of rights† on looking into this muchvaunted law and in particular into those parts of it which bear upon the subject here in question the weaknesses betrayed in it are seen to be such as cannot be thought of without regret the imbecility if not the treachery of the learned penman in whom the unlearned found themselves as usual under the necessity of reposing their confidence being on the face of it but too distinctly visible propositions of the cast termed by logicians identical fit only for the mouths and pens of drivellers propositions which neither conveying instruction nor imposing obligation leave everything exactly as they find it propositions declaring that what is right ought to be done and what is wrong ought not to be done and so forth but this weakness though to a lover of the english constitution it cannot but be matter of regret will not to the preeminently learned person in question afford any thing like matter of excuse for to this so much vaunted law—to this law as to everything else that bears the name of law some meaning must be found and to this law viz in respect of that clause in it which is here in question no sooner will any meaning be found than what will also be found is—that by this preeminently learned person it has been violated     in the section in question §   two parts may be distinguished—the historical and the legislative in the historical the principal abuses of the then late reign are related under twelve heads in the legislative under an equal number of heads the repetition of these same abuses is to wit by a declaration made of their illegality reprobated in the historical part of the only article which touches upon jurytrial being the article which is numbered   the words are as follows—  and whereas of late years partial corrupt and unqualified persons have been returned and served on juries in trials and particularly divers jurors in trials for high treason which were not freeholders in the legislative part in the only article which touches upon this same subject being the article which is numbered    the words are as follows—   that jurors ought to be duly impanelled and returned and jurors which pass upon men in trials for high treason ought to be freeholders in each of these two articles there is a clause which does not bear upon the present subject viz that which speaks of high treason and freeholdership of the clause which does bear upon this subject it must once more be confessed that if it be not sad treachery it is sad dotage—that jurors ought to be duly impanelled and returned viz that what in this case ought to be done ought to be done in relation to the subject here in question the law having thus in itself no meaning to find a meaning for it we are sent to history—to the history of the times consulting history a fact that we find in every book of history that touches upon those times is—that in the two reigns then last preceding juries used to be packed that is that instead of being left to a mode of selection which with reference to the crown its dependent judges and its other instruments would have come under the name of accident or chance the persons serving as jurors were determined by choice viz by the choice made of them by these same instruments the choice having for its notorious object the causing unjust verdicts to be delivered persons who either of themselves were partial or were made so by being made corrupt were taken for the objects of such choice and if they were not found so were made so by that choice that in the exact bulk to which it has been swollen and in the exact shape into which it has been by our preeminently learned artist moulded the abuse relative to juries was not in the contemplation of the framers of those clauses must i think be confessed perfection such as this which we have seen realized by lord chief baron macdonald outstripped—not only the observations made by the maynards the somerses the hawleses the pollexfens—but the most sanguine hopes of the scroggses and the jefferieses with their et cæteras of those times but what on the other side cannot it is supposed be very easily denied is—that in the major abuse of these our maturer times the minor abuse of those immature times is included the abuse of those days was that after hard labour bestowed upon the matter on each separate occasion persons who were found or rendered corrupt—or in some other way partial were on great occasions now and then returned and made to serve on juries in trials the abuse of these days is—that under the arrangements made—made and in despite of remonstrance persevered in—persevered in either for that purpose or for none at all persons are on all occasions great and small caused to be returned and to serve—persons such as by the permanency with which they are invested and the habitual but ever withholdable bribes with which they are fed cannot but have been rendered corrupt—corrupt to a degree of corruption of which as surely as by any partiality it could be made to be injustice is upon every desired occasion the habitual consequence in vain would his lordship say—those whom i have caused to be impanelled and returned—as you would say not duly impanelled and returned—are not jurors they are in effect commissioners and members of a standing board of my own framing—persons whom into the box which ought to have none in it but jurors i have so managed as to introduce under the name of jurors those whom you take for jurors—those whom i have thus impanelled and returned under the name of jurors are not jurors and therefore in causing them to be impanelled and returned even though it should not be duly impanelled and returned i have not offended against the bill of rights my intention was not to maim and disfigure the man—my intention was to kill him and therefore if you punish me as for maiming and disfiguring him you punish me without law such was the plea of a very ingenious as well as learned person a mr coke who on the act of    and    car i c   was indicted for the maiming and disfiguring of a mr crisp—what i am accused of intending to do is the committing the lesser crime what i really intended to do is only a greater crime in which the other is comprised this plea did not avail mr coke and as little if there be anything like justice in the country will it avail the right honourable sir archibald macdonald but says somebody as one swallow suffices not to make summer so one act suffices not to make a habit what in this particular instance was done may not perhaps have been altogether justifiable but if for the express and sole purpose of correcting this error so     it should come to pass that a fresh law were made can you by this one instance of irregularity hold yourself warranted in apprehending that a law so made would not be obeyed i answer yes even by this one instance the disobedience being so deliberately and determinately and after such warning and remonstrance and upon such principle as have been avowed persevered in but of the existence of the habit and my expectation of the eventual continuance of it it is on this one act alone that i ground myself and to render it manifest and beyond all possibility of dispute that the contempt put upon parliament is determined and rooted in a sort of principle i proceed to bring to view out of a countless multitude that might have been produced another instance or two such as either the matter of the present inquiry or chance recollection has happened to throw in my way §   recent contempt of howards act by the detention of acquitted prisoners to enumerate all the instances in which the symptoms of the disorder in question have exemplified themselves would require a volume of the example which here follows the particular use is—to show the obstinacy of the disease and it is only by casual symptoms brought to light by rare occurrences such as accident may not either bring to light or so much as give birth to twice in half a century that this quality in the disease can have been made manifest in the books the contempt—the simple contempt—may indeed be seen breaking out continually—but it is only by extrajudicial conversations or correspondences that the obstinacy of it could have been displayed in its genuine colours by obstinacy on one part energy on some other part and acting in an opposite direction is implied but in any court of judicature on the occasion of a cause no such energy ever has been known to be or with any colour of reason could be expected to be displayed on the occasion of a cause the only sort of person by whom any such quality as energy can in any direction be displayed is an advocate but from the advocate whose contention is before and under the judge not with and against the judge at belonge not to the station of the judge to experience any thing like adverse energy one common interest—one and the same sinister interest—links them together in indissoluble bands accommodation to indolence gratification to vengeance unmerited reputation sinister emolument lawless power—whatsoever of all these good things the judge holds in possession the advocate beholds in expectancy the weakness of the legislature constitutes the lawless power of the judge and the present power of the judge is the future power of the advocate with the legislator his supposed superior the judge never comes in contact from the legislator he knows not what it is to experience resistance the legislator makes laws and the judge according as it happens to them to suit or thwart his views gives effect or inefficiency to them as he pleases in parliament be his rebellion ever so flagrant he beholds neither inspector nor denunciator much less an avenger two sorts of men alone does he behold there—admirers—ignorant and awestruck admirers—or accomplices or abettors thus it is that the king—i mean the king in parliament—being sunk into a kinglog not only the great bullfrogs but the meanest tadpole views his humiliation with complacency and beholds in it a source—an inexhaustible source—of power impunity and triumph for himself evidence of obstinacy in one quarter requires as above and supposes energy adverse energy in another on the particular occasien here in question thus it is that government being in this country in the state above described the energy necessary on one side and consequently all manifestation of obstinacy on the other might have been wanting for any number of additional ages had it not been for the tillnowunexampled union of public spirit and intrepidity—welldirected public spirit and persevering intrepidity—in the person of sir richard phillips materials i have none over and above those which have already been laid before the public by himself but in his work they stand mixed with other matter in abundance and for displaying their importance with relation to the design of the present work observations have been found requisite such as could not have come with equal propriety from any person by whose testimony the facts themselves were furnished in regard to the degree of credit due to it one very short observation may suffice a twelvemonth and more has elapsed since his statements on this head have been made public and in all this time not a syllable of contradiction has appeared from any one of the official persons whose conduct and language is here in question one of two things either he contradiction could be given—or in the style of the preeminently learned judge to give it was not thought worth while judges publicly charged and by a functionary himself in high however subordinate situation—charged with disobedience—wilful disobedience to parliament and in their estimation so trivial the imputation and the opinion of its truth so unproductive of all cause of uneasiness or apprehension to themselves that whether it prevail or not is to     them and their feelings matter of indifference this being the state of judicature in what a state is government the case that gave occasion to this display is as follows— by the statute    geo iii c  0 §   as copied by sir richard phillips it is enacted that every prisoner charged with any crime or as an accessary thereto against whom no bill of indictment shall be found by the grand jury shall be immediately set at large in open court without the payment of any fee c of an enactment thus clear and explicit the habitual violation is in a memorial addressed to the recorder of london—couched in the most respectful terms dated the  d of november   0  and presented in the names and with the concurrence of both the sheriffs—presented to the notice of that learned judge on the  d of november   0  for eleven days no answer on the   th of the month no answer yet received follows in the form of a note an address from mr sheriff phillips alone to the same learned gentleman for the declared purpose indeed of reminding him of the above paper but again in the most cordial as well as uniformly respectful terms the season of delay was now past now comes the season of promptitude at least if not of precipitation a few hours brought to sir richard an answer from which what belongs indispensably to the present purpose not to touch upon matter foreign to it the following is an extract— as the commission of gaol delivery at the old bailey is constituted of the highest and of all the law authorities in the kingdom the twelve judges of england the whole magistracy of the city besides other great and respectable names therein mr phillips upon consideration will surely see how indecorous it would be in the recorder of london to discuss and argue of the power authority and practice of that court with one of the sheriffs who however privately esteemed and regarded by the recorder is with respect to that commission but an officer and minister of the court business at least where the public has an interest in it does not we shall see linger with sir richard phillips not after an interval of eleven days but on that same day in reply goes another note from him to the same learned judge always in the same style of unvarying respect but expressing his earnest hope that the necessary measures would be taken for paying obedience to the law and stating amongst other matters that he understood in a late conversation with lord ellenborough on this very subject that points of practice in the old bailey court rest chiefly if not entirely with the recorder as the lawofficer of the corporation thus had it depended upon mr recorder would have ended the whole business fortunately within a few weeks after the sheriff as he tells us had an opportunity of pressing the subject again on the notice of the recorder when continues he he peremptorily told me that he never would consent to the alteration in the practice of the court which i proposed and as long as he lived it should continue as it is thus far sir richard phillips as to mr recorder of london for my own part if with any propriety i can be said to have any personal acquaintance at all with that learned judge it is of no other sort than what as towards him would tend to cherish in my mind those sentiments of respect and regard which were so uniformly manifested towards him by sir richard phillips but though a very obscure and insignificant person i have the honour to be a british subject i say subject for on that ground rather than on so technical and narrow an one as that of freeholdership do i choose to rest my claim i am a british subject and in that character i feel as strong an interest in the preservation of the english constitution as any one can feel in the preservation or even in the destruction of it and in consideration of this interest it is that it seems proper for me to declare—that although instead of being that great person to whom by the description of points of practice this part of the liberties of englishmen is it seems bargained assigned transferred and set over by the twelve judges he were my brother my opinion concerning him would still be this viz that if it really were the case that the continuance of the practice depended upon his life the last day of that life would to his country be a most happy one a conspiracy of the twelve judges with the recorder of london at their head for such it seems is the new order of things—a conspiracy of the twelve judges with their ringleader the recorder for mending the constitution of the country by resisting overruling and treating with avowed contempt the authority of parliament such is the state of things brought to view by this evidence such is the state of things which i would wish to recommend to the consideration the serious consideration of all such british subjects if any such there be in whose eyes the preservation of the constitution of the country is of more value than any share which in the character of lawyers or confederates with lawyers it may happen to them to look for in the plunder of it mr phillips upon consideration will surely see how indecorous it would be in the   0 recorder of london to discuss and argue of the power authority and practice of that court with one of the sheriffs who is but an officer and minister of the court no if in any such argument mr phillips could have seen anything indecorous his view of the matter would i will confess have been very different from mine indecorum in arguing in relation to the point in question the practice of the court no but something a great deal worse than indecorum in the determination—the obstinate and rebellious determination—to continue in such practice the house of commons—yes the house of commons—there is the place at which the discussion on this question should now be carried on as to argument of argument of further discourse—unless what as above is stated to have been his language be not only in tenor but in purport denied to have been so—of further discourse in any shape on the part of the learned gentleman there is no need—hearing is for him the only ulterior function needful hearing his function—genuflection his proper posture for the performance of it the inhumanity of the practice its rank and barefaced injustice the oppression thus heaped—heaped upon injured and established innocence—the contrast it makes with their principle of nullification—the instrument manufactured by their partnership for dealing out impunity at their own pleasure and their own price—for dealing it out not to merely possible only but to convicted guilt—all these are subjects which must for the present be discarded as being foreign to the design of the present work as well as of the present chapter the subject which alone belongs to the present purpose is the subversion of constitutional order—the contempt—the wilful the deliberate the confederated contempt—of that supreme power the supremacy of which is in words acknowledged and in grimace bowed down to even by themselves alas by what terms can such enormity be expressed the very language sinks under it† §   parliamentary operations proposed under this head a few short and compressed hints are as much as if not more than will     be found endurable especially under the perceval dynasty from a selfcreated censor who has neither a coronet in his pedigree nor so much as a place in the red book— i committee of inquiry to collect and report the facts subject of inquiry—cases of disobedience to acts of parliament on the part of persons concerned in the administration of justice limitation necessary at least in the first instance confining the remark to such cases in which misconception was impossible no fear that by this restriction the work would be left without materials to operate upon without such restriction the work would have no end to render the import of the restriction clear an example or two will suffice cases which have more or less of arithmetic in them will in general be found to afford the clearest samples—   one such has been brought to view already law prohibiting the giving on such or such an occasion to a person of such or such a description money to the amount of more than one guinea official transgression on an occasion of that same description to a person of that same description sum given two guineas—see above part iii   law in a case therein described giving to the successful party double costs—official transgression—and here the office is judicial—giving and that avowedly instead of the double costs single costs with an addition of only half single costs acts of parliament upon which contempt has been poured in this shape are to be found in swarms they are pointed out by the indexes   law as above giving to the successful party treble costs—judicial transgression giving instead of the treble costs single costs with the addition of only three quarters of the amount of single costs another swarm of statutes upon which the cup of contempt has thus been poured to the very dregs ii parliamentary resolutions the habit of transgression established what shall then be done the least that can be done is for the house i suppose it the house of commons to pass a string of resolutions condemning the practice and denouncing eventual punishment in future happily this house in conjunction with the other possesses in the right of addressing the king for removal a virtual power altogether adequate to the purpose—resolved that in case of any misinterpretation put from henceforward upon any act of parliament by any judge or judges should such interpretation be deemed wilful this house will address his majesty praying the removal of such judge or judges after wilful add if necessary and not proceeding from error in judgment merely something to this effect may serve as a sample but to fix the meaning and save it if possible from being explained away an example or two as above if the law of the medes and persians would admit of any such innovation might be of use as to retrospection in any shape on this question victory must for any part i shall presume to take be left as a prize to eloquence honourable gentlemen according to whose theory bulls take a pleasure in being baited may try it upon judges if the measure they so freely mete to others were to be meted to them again i speak of judges the question would be decided and the benches cleared but in my own view of the matter this measure being in every application that can be made of it a most false and mischievous one it depends not upon them by any use they can make of it to make it otherwise §   retrospective censure is it to be looked for the notion upon every occasion assumed and taken for granted among lawyers is—that to the judges—meaning the twelve judges and the chancellor—acting respectively in one or other of their many and various spheres—belongs the interpretation—the uncensurable as well as unappealable and thence the absolute and uncontroulable interpretation—of whatsoever goes by the name of law viz not only of that spurious sort of law which by the oscitantcy of parliaments they have been suffered to make—to make of themselves and for themselves—but also of that only genuine sort of law which is made by parliament in certain cases indeed but in certain cases only the transaction being in some shape or other capable of being brought before the house of lords the conduct of these official lawyers may to some purposes be weighed by other hands be weighed by nonlearned hands but forasmuch as where any judicatory composed of any one or more of these thirteen potentates is in question every idea of censure is excluded reversal or modification of the judicial transaction is the only purpose to which revision is considered as capable of being performed and though in point of right nonlearned lords cannot on these any     more than on any other occasions be avowedly debarred either from speech or vote yet in point of fitness and propriety the very appellation thus incontrovertibly applicable to them suffices to indicate how incongruous on these occasions any interposition from so weak a quarter would be deemed—if not for the purpose of reversal or modification of the interpretation itself at any rate for any such purpose as that of censure to be passed on the interpreters in the putting of any such interpretation being still but men—for this concession such is their candour and humility they may be depended upon for making—in the putting of any such interpretation they are liable to fall into error but be that error what it may at least so as competency of jurisdiction be out of dispute it never can be so much as censurable much less punishable now in this i cannot but behold a doctrine against which had i a hundred hands i would protest with all of them as being inconsistent with all government admit this parliament is but a tool—a corrupt as well as a blind and passive tool—in the hands of lawyers and their confederates admit but this transgression will be heaped upon transgression till the whole power of the country and with it in due season the whole property of the country will be avowedly in their hands—admit but this sooner or later they will construe the whole money of the country into fees as at one time the clergy were on the point of consecrating the whole land of the country into churchyards—since let them carry their usurpations their oppressions their extortions to ever so enormous a length they have never anything to fear—they have still everything to hope or rather to make sure of reading or thinking of those judges whose sanction was lent to shipmoney—ah how innocent were those a thousand times have i said to myself in comparison of these of modern times how much more clearly was their transgression a transgression against the common welfare—against law as it ought to have been than against law as it then was by what a host of precedents was it not sanctioned and when statute law is out of the question of what stuff is law made or so much as pretended to be made if not of precedents §   no fresh acts requiring obedience to existing ones but above all things let us have no fresh law i mean for the mere purpose of causing the existing ones to be obeyed no enacting or reenacting statutes still less a declaratory act a declaratory act—observe the consequences a falsehood committed the supremacy of the king in parliament abdicated surrendered surrendered to the lawyers and on so easy a condition—to them of all mankind so easy—as the employing false pretences in the exercise of it pretending to have had doubts where it is impossible they should have had any—pretending to have put upon a word a meaning which it is impossible they should have put upon it in the first place a falsehood committed whereas doubts have arisen   —doubts arisen doubts about what—whether immediately means immediately are lawyers the only persons who know what immediately means—are all but lawyers ignorant of it after this first falsehood—committed by parliament itself—after this falsehood and by means of it comes the abdication—the surrender—and the endless train of falsehoods—falsehoods bespoken of judges by an order so clearly given and which with such regular alacrity would be executed yes—to make a fresh act would be actually to yield the point to the lawyers to confirm the usurpation instead of checking it it would be allowing them the very negative in question the negative which without as yet daring to claim it they have been exercising a negative which they want but this allowance to exercise at pleasure and at any time upon all acts take at pleasure any one future act the negative having suppose been exercised upon that act the worst that could happen would be another act which act when passed would be just as completely subject to their negative as its predecessor was and so toties quoties by every such act the uncertainty—the glorious uncertainty of the law—would receive fresh confirmation and if possible fresh increase the uncertainty of the law and the certainty of ruin to every man not above the common ranks of life who with the words of it before him should be ill enough advised to ascribe anything like certainty to it taking cognizance of a murder and inflicting punishment accordingly the judges of the common pleas acting as such would themselves be murderers and as such punishable this is what our men of law themselves have not scrupled to declare why because in this purely ideal case if the authors of the transgression are lawyers so are they also who are to judge of it and to punish it here then is a transgression on which according to their own doctrine punishment may attach even though the transgressor be a judge acting in his character of judge allow then says a loyal subject to these disloyal usurpers allow then that where the law transgressed by you is a law of the kings making—made by the king in parliament—allow     that in that case if to the conviction of every man that sees the words of the law your trangression has been a completely wilful one you are not exempt from punishment—allow but this this is all we want of you what we do not want is—to see you in any such posture as that which in the case of your own putting you would figure in but what we do want to see you in is—a kneeling posture—if not literally at least figuratively—kneeling like one of king jamess parliaments upon the knees of your hearts yes and in this posture we must see you or parliament is a laughing stock—you tyrants—and we slaves the constitution in short is already at an end and the government a mere tyranny in the hands of the judges if to save them harmless against the punishment due for a transgression committed by them against the law it be sufficient to them in all cases or even in any case to say such is the construction that we put upon it if in the instance of this as of every other set of men for the purpose of condemning them and if guilty punishing them it be not to whatever authority it belongs to sit in judgment on their conduct competent if so it appear to pronounce that the allegation express or implied of their having believed such and such to have been on the occasion in question the intention of the legislature is not true to the meanest subject that is to be found—to him on whose part not only in relation to the particular import but in relation to the very existence of the law in question ignorance is at the same time most certain and most excusable such ignorance affords not in the breast of those arbiters of his fate either justification or so much as excuse and by the mere supposition of it and that an untrue one shall such ignorance afford not only excuse but justification to those in whose situation even without other transgression such ignorance—ignorance of the law—is itself a crime no—neither on this nor on any other occasion no on no occasion nor on any account on the part of learned gentlemen will there be any objection to fresh acts fresh acts besides evidencing on an occasion such as this the impotency of the authority that made the former ones make on every occasion fresh confusion and fresh fees fresh acts make the pot boil brisk in the little kitchen of the attorney fresh acts make the cauldron boil brisk in the great victualling offices attached to higher feed as well as feefed situations no on any occasion there will not on the part of lawyers in general be any more objection to fresh acts than on a particular occasion there was on the part of lord melville to the bringing in and carrying into a law a bill for preventing a paymaster of the navy from applying the money of the people to his own use on these subjects the understanding has been general and constant so far as the binding and punishing force of the laws bears upon men who neither are in power nor are to receive protection from men in power so far they are to be executed so far as they would bear hard upon men who are in power or under the protection of men in power so far they are to be laughed at in a word—to employ a system of classification the nomenclature of which is become as generally intelligible as the principles of it have been generally pursued—tinmen and great characters form the two species into which to this purpose the genus of his majestys subjects has been divided what then is the use of the law—bacon who started the question talked about it and about it but it was reserved for his successors to give a clearer answer to it what is now the use of the law to fall as a millstone upon the heads of tinmen to stand as a laughingstock to great characters §   prospect of redress but these remedies of yours by what hands are they to be administered—lawyers you will find none willing nonlawyers you will find none able     and when all lawyers and all nonlawyers are subtracted how many have you left i answer—to the difficulty of this remedy no eye can be more acutely or profoundly sensible than his are who thus ventures to propose it but under favour of the inexhaustible stock of varieties incident to the human character causes of a psychological nature inscrutable to human eyes have manifested now and then their power in the production not only of evil but of good yea and will continue to do so little by little of good in whatsoever shape good is at the same time conceivable and in a physical sense practicable in one age a proposes in another b moves in a third c carries into effect this is the rate at which reform and improvement travel when the surveyors of the highways are lawyers assuredly had it been my lot to find myself in the place where motions are made some fiveandtwenty or thirty years ago a motion for a real committee of justice would at least have stood upon the journals a committee of justice oh yes turn to the journals and there you may see—not a parliament in which you may not see—a committee of justice in that place you may see it but in that place you may as well content yourself with seeing it for until something which would be called confusion take the place of that which is called order you had better not expect unless you are fond of disappointment to see it anywhere else     regular as is the appointment of this regular committee the functions of it compose a sinecure a sinecure no less regular and profound than if the perceval allowance of £      ayear reduced alas to less than £  000 we are told by deductions that somebody or other knows of were attached to the situation of each of its members in recompence for the labour of receiving the emoluments added to that of being said without being so much as supposed to do the duties of it but when sinecures are gone justice with the committees necessary for her restoration may then come such is the state of things at present such will continue to be the state of things until in some shape or other censure—prompt as well as impartial censure—not to speak of punishment—shall take place of tardy and disregarded laws—of declaratory acts and explanatory acts passed some score or some halfhundred years after the acts those acts that wanted not to be explained but to be enforced had instead of being enforced been trampled on by great characters or explained and explained away—or what is shorter openly scorned and trampled upon by judges whether law or tyranny reigns is a question that will be decided by the notice or no notice taken in high situations and eventually in low ones of this grievance till now the tyranny had a mask but now the mask is gone great zeal everywhere for the maintenance of subordination subordination but of what sort not of that of which universal security is the fruit but of that by which for the benefit of great characters in high situations all but they their confederates instruments and dependents are kept in a continual state of insecurity and bondage observing the house of lords to have at length by the continually increasing accumulation of causes become in respect of its appellate jurisdiction converted into a sort of delayshop in which in pieces of an indefinite number of years length delay is sold to dishonest men with other mens money in their pockets—observing moreover the grievance to be to such a degree flagrant and notorious as to have been publicly and repeatedly held up to view in the house itself by the only persons by whom any plan of relief it is universally understood could with any prospect of success or according to received notions with any sort of congruity be laid upon the table—in the month of january   0  i took upon me to transmit to such of the members of both houses as could conveniently be reached the outline of a plan accompanied in every article with reasons which i had sketched out for that purpose under the title of a plan of a judicatory under the name of the court of lords delegates† in my own mind a still more important though not an inseparable part of that plan consisted in the transferring moreover to the proposed judicatory that part of the immediate jurisdiction of the house of lords which consists in the cognizance of impeachments the decision of the delegates in those cases to be final unless reversed or modified by the house at large on the declared ground of censurable misconduct on the part of those their delegates the main principle on which this plan was grounded was no other than that which whether ever expressed or no in words will in substance be found to have served as the main principle of the grenville act viz that the sense of responsibility without which there can be no tolerably adequate security either for probity or intelligence is less and less acute and operative in proportion as the number of those whose share in it is extensive it was at this price only as it seemed to me that impeachment already proclaimed in parliament as having sunk into an empty name could be restored to that character which it was originally designed and till of late was universally supposed to possess and which at different times it has in some degree possessed viz that of serving as a check upon political delinquency in high situations and this without consuming in judicature any part of that time which is so habitually found insufficient for the still higher and more important functions of legislation to the end that the judicial authority of the country might upon occasion be employed in checking removing and in case of need even punishing instead of being as at present exclusively and avowedly employed in protecting unfitness on the part of great characters in high situations‡ punishment being reserved for such low people as having the misfortune of suffering from such unfitness have the audacity to complain of it of a censorial tribunal so constituted what did not present itself to my view as the least important use was—the application of a check to that corrupt despotism to which as above except in name and empty show there exists not at present any check viz the despotism of the judges not only in my own mind but in my own papers the plan had in it yet other parts the object of which was to invest the lords by the instrumentality of these their appointed and periodically removable delegates not only with the power but with the interest without which power is nothing that seemed     necessary to engage and fix them in the habit of rendering to the community certain services which by the necessary changeableness of its composition the house of commons is disabled from rendering with equally assured steadiness and perseverance—one of these services being the instituting and keeping up an uninterruptedly periodical series of returns and accounts expressive of the state of the system of judicial procedure under a set of preappointed heads embracing the whole field of judicature and bearing specific reference to the several distinguishable ends of justice the other the taking occasion of such causes as should come before this judicatory in the way of appeal to facilitate the gradual conversion of the rule of action out of the purely conjectural tenorless uncognoscible and impostrous state of unwritten alias common law—the shapeless production of a set of notetakers compilers and publishing booksellers—into its only cognoscible determinate and unimpostrous state viz that of what is called written or statute law the joint and genuine work of the king the lords and the delegates of the people for such plan no efficient acceptance could either be expected or so much as wished if by the establishment of it the preponderant weight and influence of the more essential branch of the constitution were exposed to any danger of being lessened but that no such danger could attach upon it could easily and would have been actually put out of doubt that in the opinion of leading persons of opposite parties the above plan meaning of course such part of it as had in the above paper been presented to view possessed a claim to serious attention was a fact of which i found reason to make no doubt and on one part such and so public was the opinion expressed concerning it as to render it evident that in one event nor that altogether an improbable one should the same opinion continue to be entertained of it the establishment of it would be but a natural consequence had the expression of such opinion been in any instance addressed to or accompanied with any such intimation as that of a desire that it should be or a thought that it would be communicated to the person whose proposal was the subject of it the communication might have been ascribable to that sort of civility from which any serious thought about the matter is not always to be inferred but the communication having in every instance been the result of mere accident clear of all design and probably to this hour not merely unheeded but unknown the real existence of the opinion is in each instance but so much the less exposed to doubt in one instance my satisfaction would i must confess have been more entire if when reflecting on past occurrences it had been in my power to assure myself that that part of the plan which by the author had been regarded as a drawback though that an indispensable one from the mass of advantage expected from the institution had not in other eyes constituted at least a principal recommendation of it but among those who are agreed about measures it would be not only a useless but a pernicious refinement to look out for differences about motives nor would any such topic have been touched upon but that regarding the proposed institution as above as capable of operating in the character of a highly useful if not of itself a completely effectual remedy to the political disease of which so much has just been said the design of this work seemed to require that of the plan in question such part as has already seen the light should now receive the same degree of publication as this work itself does for which purpose copies of it have now been transmitted to the publishers of this increased publicity one consequence is—that in the mind of him by whom the observation shall have been made and by whom will the observation not have been made that a necessary part of the plan consists in the creation of several new situations of which some could not but be in a preeminent degree lucrative ones a supposition too natural not to follow in a manner of course will be that in this proposed mass of emolument some share had been looked for by the projector and that in his mind it was the advantage so looked for that had constituted—if not the sole at least one final cause—of the project it therefore as mankind are constituted appears to me to be if not absolutely necessary at any rate highly conducive to the unbiassed examination of the plan to declare as i do most distinctly that in any emolument that ever was proposed or may ever come to be attached to it i never had nor ever shall i have any more concern than any other person under whose eye the present page may be lying at this moment and that in the contrivance of it no person by whom for himself or any friend of his any expectation of any part in such emolument could have been entertained has ever been consulted with no person having been in fact consulted with upon the subject either before the paper went into circulation as above or since not that the plan is in itself a whit the better or the less bad for a circumstance thus collateral and incidental to it and should any plan for the same purpose ever be brought on the carpet by any other hand the author may be assured that no personal advantage that may be found included in it for his own particular benefit or that of any of his friends will by me be pleaded in bar to the acceptance     of it in my view of the matter be the measure what it may instead of a bar any advantage accruing to an individual constitutes i must confess a plea in favour of it the indication of any such advantage coupled with the appellation of a job—this argument as it is a very easy and a very common so is it a very commodious argument for such politicians as being conscious of their inability to form any direct and specific estimate of the advantages and disadvantages of any plan which requires hands for the execution of it have recourse to this circumstance in the character of an article of circumstantial evidence and that conclusive establishing and that at so small an expense as that of a single word not only the ineligibility but the corruptness of the measure—but it will not pass in any such character with any man who being duly aware that in all its branches government consists but in a choice of evils—evils produced that in each instance greater good may come—holds himself on the occasion in question not incompetent to the task of weighing the good against the evil and determining on which side the balance is to be found supposing the plan in question received as above in all its projected parts the court of lords delegates would without the name add to its other characters that of a school and that not only of judicature but of legislation a school in which such of our noble youth supposing any such to be found to whom the study might not any more than the practice of that art does at present appear beneath their dignity might find the means of instruction as well as exercise a school in which not only the exercise but by means of the exercise the prizes might instead of remaining a monopoly in the hands of those whose interest it is that the body of the law be in all its points in as bad a state as possible lie open to those also whose interest in the shape of reputation and conscience would on this occasion act in alliance with their duty and whose interest would not at any rate be in any shape at variance with it lastly being occupied in preparing with all expedition for the press a work on parliamentary reform in which if my own conception of the matter be correct the necessity of such a measure is placed beyond the reach of doubt followed by a plan for that purpose accompanied in each article with reasons and answers to objections a plan in the contrivance of which i saw but little reason to go in quest of novelty it seemed to me of use that it should be understood and that most clearly that to engage a mans opinions and affections in favour of such a measure no other propensity is necessary than a desire—not to pull down but to uphold—not to wrest power out of the hands of present possessors but to render them somewhat less generally and flagrantly inept than at present for as well as disdainful of the exercise of it that so when among those questions which sooner or later will inevitably be urged this also should be put—viz what are the occupiers of that room with the gilt chair in it good for unless it be to serve as tools in the hands of the—general who now and then comes in form and sits in it—a set of implements constituting when put together a clumsy piece of machinery for producing the effect of a simple negative—those to whom any such searching question happens to be addressed may have some better answer at hand than what has been furnished by the threadbare and transparent fallacies that have hitherto been seen to be employed upon that service the hospital of incurables was a name invented for that great room—not by any such plebeian as myself but by a noble practitioner the earl of chesterfield to whose penetrating eye the condition of all the wards with all the patients in it had by long observation and experience been rendered so familiar by him as the name thus bestowed bears witness the condition of the inhabitants was regarded as already desperate for my own part whether it be that being more given to hope and less to satire as well as somewhat more accustomed to look out for expedients than that veteran courtier my judgment has been led astray by my affections my views of the case are less desponding as hospitals are apt to be and as this in particular was once pronounced to be—pronounced so by the inhabitants themselves when not half so numerous as at present—it appears to me as it has done to others too much crowded in which case it is the less to be wondered at if of a species of vital gas known in the old nomenclature by the name of public spirit a morbific deficiency should be found—a deficiency of which the principal effects and symptoms are an habitual lethargy and prostration of strength admitting of no abatement but what may happen to be produced by the accidental pricking of some such stimulus as that of a canine appetite for fat sinecures for the overpopulation the remedy is too simple as well as by those whom it concerns most nearly too well approved† to need any further mention in this place as to the public spirit the apparatus for the injecting of it has been already indicated     swear not at all containing an exposure of the needlessness and mischievousness as well as antichristianity of the ceremony of an oath a view of the parliamentary recognition of its needlessness implied in the practice of both houses and an indication of the unexceptionable securities by which whatsoever practical good purposes the ceremony has been employed to serve would be more effectually provided for together with proof of the open

hands of a common friend he caused to be delivered into the hands of one of the reverend the heads of houses who had been mentioned to him as being of the number of those in whose instance the hydrophobia of innovation was supposed to be least rabid a copy of this tract and staid there long enough to hear of its having undergone his perusal of the communication thus made the motive was—a hope how small soever that possibly by means of the representation thus conveyed some course might in that seat of professed piety be taken for the abolition of a practice which not to profane only but to reverend and orthodox eyes had already in more instances than one presented itself and had accordingly in print and in multitudes of editions been held up to view as impious whatever other imputations the publication of this tract may be thought to be open to precipitation therefore will at any rate not be of the number neither on the one part precipitation—nor on the other part want of notice after all this tract might for any further length of time have slept upon the shelf but for the addition so lately made of the scourge of religious persecution to the yoke of despotism—for a pretence for punishment as for blasphemy—and that by imprisonment without trial infliction by every clergyman who is in the commission of the peace the so recently instituted practice of putting the

section   oath incongruity of the assumption on which its supposed beneficial efficiency is grounded by the term oath taken in its largest sense is universally understood a ceremony composed of words and gestures by means of which the almighty is engaged eventually to inflict on the taker of the oath or swearer as he is called punishment in quantity and quality liquidated or more commonly unliquidated in the event of his doing something which he the swearer at the same time and thereby engages not to do or omitting to do something which he in like manner engages to do correlative to the term oath is the term perjury and its conjugates to perjure oneself perjured perjurants among which perjury is understood as designative of the conduct whether positive or negative which stands in opposition to the conduct engaged for as above in so far as in a state of political society application of this ceremony has been made to the purpose of producing any practical effect other persons besides the swearer have commonly in some way or other borne a part in it one person at any rate viz the person by whom the oath is said to have been administered and commonly some other person or persons by whose authority and order or at whose instance at least it has been administered or at any rate taken the intervention of any such third person is not essentially and inseparably included in the notion of an oath but it is only in so far as some such intervention has place that it belongs to the present purpose by the ceremony thus described may be seen at the least two persons of very different descriptions over both of whom power is exercised or supposed or endeavoured to be exercised viz   man the individual swearer on whom by means of the eventual punishment in question the effect of a law whether prohibitive or compulsive is produced or supposed or endeavoured to be produced   the almighty who in the event in question is supposed or endeavoured to be engaged to inflict such punishment considered in respect of the purpose to which it is applied or applicable an oath has commonly been distinguished into assertory and promissory and in conformity to this distinction the assertory sort of oath it will naturally be observed is the only sort of oath which belongs to the present purpose—which bears any immediate relation to the subject of evidence—to the subject of testimony at least from this distinction a natural inference again is—that let it even be supposed that in the promissory oath condemnation should on any just ground be passed yet by such condemnation the assertory—the testimonial oath—the oath considered as confined to the purpose of securing trustworthiness to testimony—would notwithstanding such condemnation remain untouched in opposition however to this notion it must be observed and upon consideration will be acknowledged—  that the nature of the ceremony—the nature of the instrument thus employed—is one and the same to what purpose soever it be applied   that to every oath alike belongs in truth and propriety the quality and name of a promissory oath and that accordingly the assertory oath and thereunder the testimonial† are neither more nor less than the promissory oath applied to that particular purpose     by the promissory as opposed to the assertory oath that which a man may undertake for is—anything whatsoever that is in his power to do with the exception of the giving correctness and relative completeness to some assertion or other whatever it be to which for the purpose of securing to assertion those qualities it is applied by the assertory oath that which is undertaken for is—the giving to some assertion those same qualities but in both cases alike something or other is undertaken for engaged for promised in both cases alike an obligation is imposed or supposed or endeavoured to be imposed in both alike for the purpose of giving to such obligation a binding force—a force derived from the religious sanction—a ceremony and the same ceremony is employed on the supposition that by man over the almighty power should to this or any other purpose be exercised or exercisable an absurdity than which nothing can be greater cannot be denied to be involved—man the legislator and judge god the sheriff and executioner—man the despot god his slave if in any given instance on the part of the almighty executioner any exception to the rule of obedience be supposed in that instance the effect of the ceremony is nothing the case is exactly as if there had been no such ceremony but if in any one case it be thus inefficient how comes it to be otherwise in any other case yet this or nothing is what is supposed this or nothing if the supposition be that—after and in consequence of the promise thus made and the breach of it—the perjury—committed—punishment—the result of the will and act of god—takes place of course—that is to a certainty and in every individual instance if the supposition of absolute certainty being deemed too strong that of probability be substituted to it still so long as it amounts to something and that something produced by the mere ceremony independently of any other cause—though it be but a probability for example as   to  0—the supposition is in substance one and the same god is a negligent servant indeed but still a servant he disobeys the orders nine times out of ten but he pays obedience to them on the tenth the circumstance by which the supposition of the influence of an oath over the supernatural agent in question is saved from the ridicule that attaches upon the supposition of the influence of a magical incantation over the supernatural agent to which that instrument is applied is that in the case of the oath the scene of its influence is placed in a state of things of which no human being is in this life supposed to be or about to be witness whereas in the case of the magical incantation the scene lies here below and it is in this life that men are bid to look for it—the moon brought down upon the earth as according to the pagan system disembodied spirits of this or that denomination brought down or up to the same place as under the jewish and christian well or ill interpreted   quid non carmina possunt   carmina de cœlo possunt deducere lunam undertaking to defend the use of this mysterious instrument what will a man say of it that there ever has been or ever will be so much as a single case in which these effects have or will have been produced by it will that be his supposition if so then is the absurdity thus charged upon it admitted to be involved in it—that there never has been nor ever will be any such case if so then is the supposition admitted to be a mere fiction and in proportion as this admission is acceded to the ceremony is divested of its binding force and therewith of every useful influence that can ever have been ascribed to it or expected from it the effect to the production of which if possible man and god both are thus sought and supposed to be engaged—the line of conduct to the observance of which man is thus sought and supposed to be compelled—say that it is—say that it is not—such for the enforcement of which punishment to be inflicted by such hands—punishment in quantity as well as quality properly adapted to the purpose ought to be may with reason be expected to be applied—if yes the punishment     sought and supposed to be applied by the oath is needless and being needless it is superfluous and on that account improper and mischievous if no it is undue and on that account again mischievous mischievous in a double and more extensive degree mischievous in a limited extent by the useless suffering it inflicts on the individual so punished mischievous to an unlimited extent in respect of the mischievous line of conduct to which it seeks to engage him and with a degree of success of which presently but too frequently exemplified observe here another absurdity resulting from the supposition attributing a penal effect to this ceremony once more—the punishment which independently of it is attached to the transgression meant to be prevented—in the present case to mendacity—must in supposition be either adequate or not adequate if adequate then is there no need for any additional punishment—for any such punishment as in case of mendacity in which would be included the profanation of the ceremony would be the effect if not adequate then observe the consequence to his justice that being the attribute here in question god cannot give adequate exercise unless and until man gives him leave gods justice is thus kept in a state of dependence on human folly or improbity concerning the absurdity—the simple absurdity—of the supposition thus much may suffice note now the complex absurdity—the inconsistency—involved in it for this purpose set to work two swearers—with or without to each of them an administerer—with or without to each of them a prescriber an ordainer of the oath two swearers swearing and thus respectively engaging themselves to direct their utmost endeavours to the production of two opposite and altogether incompatible effects by the draughts thus drawn for eventual punishment what according to the current theory is the effect produced upon the almighty what but that he is compelled or if that word be too plain and clear engaged to lend his power at the same place and time to the productions of these same opposite and incompatible effects for the field of action meaning the geographical field take for example england for the political field religion—technical religion in it place two contending religions catholicism and churchofenglandism—swearers and proposed actors james and george two contenders for the throne—what james swears is—that in respect of wealth power dignity and other good things of all sorts the teachers and professors of the old religion shall so far as depends upon his endeavours be absolutely speaking as great as possible and speaking by comparison as much greater as possible than those of the new one—what george swears is—that so far as depends upon his endeavours the reverse of all this shall have place according to the theory of the binding power of an oath and the supernatural punishment attached to perjury what is the work thus cut out for the almighty to combat each religion and at the same time and place to defend it to combat it with one hand to defend it with the other to employ one person to combat it and at the same time and place another person to defend it pressed by these consequences yet unwilling to give up altogether an instrument of such antiquity and to which common opinion is in use to attach so much importance no says somebody this is going too far this inference about punishment is more than what the ceremony including the words and gestures of which it is composed could upon a closer view be seen to warrant so help me god says the royal swearer in the coronation oath so help you god says the administerer in other cases—what is there about punishment there—then comes the kiss given by the swearer to the book what is there about punishment in this kiss true says the answer nothing but among a great variety of forms by all of which in different ages and countries and in particular in this age and country an oath has been alike considered as being administered and taken this is but one and by all of them the effect considered as produced is of the same kind—by all of them that which has just been stated moreover in all these cases as often as the engagement so taken is considered as having been violated perjury—or what in the language in question is the equivalent of that word—is the name by which such violation is designated—the signs infinitely diversified the thing signified everywhere the same—everywhere either that which is above described or nothing section   mischievousness of this instrument considered in a general point of view from mere incongruity in this case as in any other any inference that could be drewn     might not when considered in a practical point of view be regarded as having much claim to attention from mere incongruity that is if so it were that of the institution in question the effects taken all together presented a balance on the side of utility true but on inquiry what it is supposed will appear clear beyond dispute is—that of its influence the real not to say the whole amount is on the contrary side to the here supposed or any other good purpose its inefficiency complete to bad purposes in no small variety as well as number and extent its efficiency indubitable of its inefficiency viz to any useful purpose—and in particular to the purpose of securing fulfilment to any useful obligation to which in that view it is attached—a view will be given presently of the infinite variety of applications of which this instrument of government is susceptible the only one which in a direct way bears upon the present purpose is that which regards the subject of evidence in the list of the mischiefs of which the use of it will be found productive it is to those which result from the application made of it to this particular purpose that the first place must accordingly be acknowledged to be due but the instrument being in all cases one and the same—the use of it not being in this particular application of it maintainable without being maintained in every other application that in this country at least continues to be made of it—hence it is that in the account of its mischievous effects to those which result from this particular application of it in its character of an assertory—testimonial—oath must be added those which result from its application in the character of a promissory oath at large before the consideration of its mischievous effects in this or that particular shape is entered upon notice is due to an observation which on this occasion will naturally enough be apt to present itself as in practice it has been in use to present itself in the character of an answer—an answer clearing the instrument in a great degree if not altogether of all imputation on this score when in the case of this or that application of it pure mischief is beyond dispute seen to follow from the observance of it the oath it is said is in this case void absolutely null and void in form and appearance it is an oath but not having the binding force of an oath it has not the substance this being the case the conclusion is—that upon the true and genuine instrument whatsoever mischiefs may be the result of the use made of any such spurious instrument ought not to be charged the oath is void—the expression is familiar enough but what meaning is there at the bottom of it the oath this particular oath is void i e is not really binding upon the almighty whom it undertakes to bind is this what is meant if so the truth of this observation must be admitted to be above dispute for by what human instrument under this or any other name can omnipotence be bound but in regard to mischievous effects be they what they may it leaves the case where it found it by man—by the men upon whose agency it may come to have a bearing—by them will it or will it not be considered—by them let its effects have been in ever so high a degree mischievous has it not been considered—as binding upon them the oath that jephthah took was it or was it not by jephthah considered as binding upon jephthah the oath that herod took was it or was it not by herod considered as binding upon herod the oath which george took was it or was it not considered by george as binding upon george such are the questions that call for answer when whether in speaking of it any such words as null or void be employed or not employed in speaking of it its effects good and bad together experienced and probable come to be weighed the oath says the casuist—the oath which herod took—was a void oath—what in the mouth of the casuist is the meaning of this phrase either this or nothing viz that in the situation of that tyrant the casuist had it happened to him to have taken such an oath would not have considered himself as bound by it may be so but the charger—the fatal charger—was it the less cruelly stained by innocent blood taken in the sense in which george is supposed or pretended to have understood it the oath which he took would says the casuist have been a void oath be it so but four millions of his own subjects in the breast of each of whom was inclosed a soul not less precious than his own a conscience not less entitled to consideration than his own—four millions of his own countrymen with their posterity to the end of time—were they the less peremptorily treated in the character of an everlastingly degraded cast composed of everlastingly dangerous adversaries were the hands of the sovereign less inexorably employed in sowing the seeds of rebellion broad cast and sharpening the axe for heads more than could find room in many a thousand chargers besides the irrelevancy of it as above shown—at the bottom of every observation for the expression of which any such adjective as null or void any such substantive as nullity is employed an inconsistency an irremoveable inconsistency will be found from the ceremony and that alone is the binding force whatever it be that is supposed to attach on the case derived from the ceremony     and nothing else—and the ceremony beneficial in any degree—pernicious in any degree in its application—the ceremony which except the application is all there is in the case is it not in every case the same section   its inefficiency in the character of a security against deceptious incorrectness and incompleteness in evidence of the utter inefficiency of this instrument when employed by itself and without either punishment or shame for its support the demonstration for such surely it might be made would for the completion of it require more room than can here be spared for everything but demonstration the bare term customhouse oath added to the perjurious unanimity secured in the case of jurymen as above by impending torture might of themselves perhaps suffice it is not without that extreme reluctance of which the causes may without much difficulty be imagined that the necessity is here yielded to of adding university oaths—english universitystatuteenforcing oaths when the question has been concerning a mahometan a hindoo a chinese—or even a christian if a catholic—great doubts have been entertained by pious and learned churchofengland men—lawyers—and nonlawyers—concerning the degree of binding force which in any such heterodox bosom ought to be ascribed to the ceremony of an oath but in the case of one of the two english universities—thence in the case of about one half of the english churchofengland clergy—the right reverend prelates not excluded—if conduct be any proof of opinion no room can be found for doubt ask what regard—answer not a particle ask what binding force—answer none whatever in the university of oxford on the admission of every member an oath is administered to him by which without exception all the statutes privileges and customs of the university and for aught appears present and future cognoscible and uncognoscible are promised by him to be observed of this treasure of antique wisdom—part polished part recast part originally cast—nobody knows in what proportions—by the hand of laud†—so much as is contained in about     closely printed latin pages and which makes but a part nor that a determinate one of the whole body‡ is at the same time put into the young mans hand—what else there may be of it remaining locked up in the archives invisible to every eye but those of the members of the governing aristocracy—the heads of houses amongst the provisions in these statutes are to be found articles in no small abundance which to every member without exception are objects of continual notorious and open violation every member violates them himself every member sees them continually violated by every other of the ordinances thus violated a great part not to say the greater are it may perhaps be said manifestly and completely useless and accordingly the violation of them not mischievous are they so indeed for the purpose then of the argument at least be it so but the inefficiency of the ceremony which is the only point here in question is not the less incontestable talk of customhouse oaths when such are the university oaths talk of merchants when of such is the bench of bishops in a customhouse men pure from perjury must surely be to be found so at least let us hope were it only for the credit of those who in the case of universal perjury would be the universal suborners in a customhouse many in the university of oxford—pure from perjury no man—for ages has been—or where the swallowing the abouttobecontinuallyviolated oath continues to be amongst other breaches of sincerity the price exacted for admission will ever be—to be found in that chief nursery of churchofengland piety on the part of the rulers at least never was perjury more completely unsusceptible of any such excuse as might be supposed to be afforded by inadvertence on the part of the same reverend persons in whose power it has always been either to keep the oath or to abolish it never was subornation of perjury more determinate not to speak of indirect though not the less intelligible charges—from one of themselves∥ for some thirty or     forty years past in another book which written by another member not only of the same university but of the same sacred function has gone through many more editions than the statutebook itself—the charge has been urged in terms so pointed as to take from this repetition of it all merit on the ground of originality and therefore surely to save it from all reproach not only of calumny but of unnecessary asperity from the perjury thus rendered habitual and universal ingenuity as will be seen further on was at an early period employed in the endeavour to remove the name but by this very endeavour as will also be seen the charge instead of being removed has been but the more directly pointed as well as the more firmly fixed what it may here be said—whatever inferences may be found deducible from this state of things is this then to be one viz that to the testimony delivered upon any occasion under the sanction of an oath by any of the reverend right reverend and other distinguished persons at whose instance the sort of perjury above exhibited has been constant and universal no more regard would be due than to that of an equal number of persons convicted of perjury viz of mendacious testimony delivered in a court of justice my answer is—by no means not more revolting would any such inference be upon the first mention of it than upon examination it would be seen to be unfounded as well as irrelevant with relation to the present purpose what is not here contended for is—that in the instances of those by whom this useless promissory oath has thus been violated testimony whether delivered with or without oath has a less chance for being pure from mendacity than in the instance of those by whom no such oath having been taken no such oath has been violated what is here contended for is—that in those same instances if after an assertory if after a testimonial oath taken testimony is pure from mendacity such purity has for its cause—not the force of this instrument but the force of those instruments one or more or all of them which have already been brought to view in the general character of the tutelary or improbityrestraining and in the particular character of the mendacityrestraining sanctions what in these same instances is denied is—not the existence of veracity in the character of an effect but the efficiency the relative efficiency of the instrument here in question in the character of a cause productive of or contributing to the production of that effect fear of eventual punishment in most cases—fear of eventual shame in all cases—fear of punishment at the hand of the almighty—these are the springs of action that have been brought to view in the character of improbityrestraining forces in general and mendacityrestraining forces in particular in the present case so it is that of these three forces the two first at least have notoriously no application in this case the oath is taken by everybody everybody violates the oath so taken nobody is ever punished for violating it nobody is ever put to shame by the violation of it and such then is the ground of the inference—viz that to whatsoever object directed whether to the prevention of transgression in any other shape or to the prevention of transgression in the particular shape of mendacity the instrument in question the ceremony of an oath is inefficient and useless in every case whatsoever be the force in which the legislator puts his trust it concerns him surely to know it for what it is and     if so indeed it were that by religion such force as that sanction is in possession of is actually employed in the endeavour to deter men from transgression in the shape in question—from transgression in the shape of perjury—it has now been seen what that force really amounts to and then would come the question whether supposing that sanction really to receive support from the enormously expensive machinery which is seen to be employed in the support of it or under the notion of giving support to it whether the value of the support be equal to the value of the expense a less grating supposition will surely be that in the endeavour to keep mens lips pure from transgression at least in this particular shape the force of religious hopes and fears does not employ itself but upon this supposition the ceremony its inutility considered will be parted with without reluctance always remembered that even by the articles of the church of england the use made of it is stated—not as necessary but simply as allowable section   recognition of its inutility by lords and commons by the house of commons is exercised—if in appearance relation had to the two other component branches of the sovereignty no more than a coequal or in some respects even inferior—in effect and experience a universally superintending and thereby superior authority in every department of government if in legislation it possesses but one out of three shares yet by the exclusive origination of the measures necessary to the giving to the body politic its daily bread that share is in effect corruptive influence apart rendered little less than the whole over the acts and thereby over the persons of the possessors of the several powers belonging to the administrative department the person of the monarch alone excepted it possesses that controul and superiority which is constituted by the direct as well as exclusive right of prosecution and the virtual power of dismission including to the extent of the suffering by loss of office and its emolument the power of punishment so likewise over the possessors of the powers belonging to judicature with the exception of the few persons in whose instances the virtual power of dismission requires the concurrence of the house of lords be this rough outline more or less correct on the manner more or less fit in which these several powers are exercised depends day by day not only the wellbeing but the very being of the state on the correctness and completeness of the conception formed in relation to the several matters of fact on which the acts done in the exercise of these several powers are grounded and thence on the correctness and completeness of the mass of evidence from which in each instance that conception is deduced depends in each instance the propriety or impropriety the salutariness or the mischievousness of the exercise given to those powers all this while—in so far as concerning what a man thinks it right for him to do any inference can be drawn from what he does—of all those several operations on each of which the life of the body politic is no less continually dependent than that of the body natural on respiration not one is there to which in the opinion of that assembly any necessary security against deceptions incorrectness or incompleteness is by this ceremony afforded—any useful service rendered here then comes the inference—dispute it that man by whom any the faintest colour of reason to combat it with can be found either by both these sets of trustees for the rest of the community their respective trusts have on every occasion been betrayed—betrayed by the commons by their not assuming this power—by the lords by their not conceding it—or on every occasion to the purpose of ascertaining facts by evidence in the opinion of both these authorities the ceremony of an oath is needless the proceeding for which a ground is to be made—will it be said that when it is of comparatively inconsiderable importance then indeed the fitness of the proceeding does depend upon the goodness of the ground but in the case where it is of the highest importance not this and nothing less must be maintained—maintained by him by whom the justness of the above inference is stated as open to dispute section   mischiefs—  contributing to the mendacitylicence granted by judges in the abridged work on the rationale of evidence—in speaking of the securities for trustworthiness there mentioned in the character of true ones—under the head of punishment explanation was given of the mendacitylicence—of the mode in which it was and is granted and in general terms of the mode in which the ceremony termed an oath was made subservient to that flagitious purpose on the occasion of judicial testimony be the mendacity ever so pernicious     punishment it has there been seen stands in general confined to the case in which as a security against the practice of that vice this ceremony had on the occasion of the delivery of the testimony been applied to it in this as in other cases where prevention has been desired by the application of punishment the effect of a prohibition was and is produced in this as in other cases where prevention has been matter of indifference or production an object of desire by omission to apply punishment whether the omission had for its cause design or inadvertency the effect of a licence was and is produced and so surely as the omission has design for its cause or observation of the effects for its accompaniment so surely is not only the effect of a licence produced but in whichsoever of a variety of imaginable forms the licence itself is in substance granted when for the purpose of revenue an occupation or transaction not meant to be prohibited     is thus clogged by a licence money with the effect though not under the name of purchasemoney is exacted for it and that money is applied to the use of the community at large through the medium and by the hands of government in the case of the licence here brought to view under the name of the mendacitylicence—the judicial or testimonial mendacitylicence a licence by which through the medium of wilful falsehood a man was and is allowed and empowered to work injustice to an unlimited amount the tax being imposed by the authority of the judges the produce of it was and is divided though in casual and not distinctly discernible  00 proportions between themselves their subordinates and other their confederates in various situations and of various denominations partners in the traffic of justice and injustice nothing could be more artful nothing was ever more successful than this their scheme of policy without any of the infamy they derived all the advantage of encouragement given to the profityielding vice and by the impenetrable secresy by which it was concealed the value of the profit so far from being diminished was proportionably increased to the purpose of this disguise the ceremony was in an eminent degree serviceable if for producing the effect of a licence no such ceremony being in use no instrument had been employable but punishment undisguised punishment—employable viz by the direct and manifest forbearance to apply to mendacity on one occasion that punishment which on another occasion and that not presenting any greater demand was applied to it—the device might have been too transparent to be hazarded but when in the character of an intermediate instrument the ceremony with its terrors was called in and set to work its mysteriousness served as a curtain behind which the eyes of the awestruck multitude were terrified from any attempt to penetrate what was conspicuous enough and to every eye was the assistance lent to justice in most of the instances in which this sanction was employed—for inefficient as on these occasions it would have been of itself—and as on every occasion in which it is without support from shame or punishment it is found to be—yet when backed by punishment as on these occasions care was taken that it should be it derived from the punishment such support as in each case it was in the nature of the punishment such as it was to give what was seen and by everybody was therefore the assistance that by this instrument was lent to justice in the cases in which it was applied what was not seen by anybody those excepted whose interest it was not to speak of it was the debility—the state of prostrate debility—in which the hand of justice was left in every case in which this necessary armature was not given to it had neither oath nor punishment attached upon any part of the mixed mass of evidence shame would in case of falsehood and with a degree of force proportioned to what was understood to be its degree of mischievousness have attached upon every such polluted part but when the distinction that was made was to such a degree conspicuous the two combined sanctions the only two which are under the direct command of government being to one part of the mass applied in combination while to the other part neither of them was applied shame could not in the unmarked part find any sure ground to fix upon unless it were the issuing in express terms a declaration pronouncing falsehood blameless neither licence nor so much as approbation could by these official guardians of public morals have in any other way been given to this their cherished and richly profitable vice not that even of declarations little if anything less express and open examples but too frequent might not be found a penitent criminal confessing his guilt the judge urging him to deny it—contests of this sort may be seen in print between a falsehoodhating felon and a falsehoodloving judge and lest the poison of mendacity should not with sufficient certainty and effect work its way into the public breast hypocrisy has thus been seen stirring in the honey of humanity to sweeten it  0  section   mischief  —weakening in various ways the efficiency of the laws various are the occasions on which—various the ways in which—the effect of this ceremony has been to confuse the texture and enervate the effective force of the whole body of the laws were the force of which it deprives the arm of justice no other force than its own the mischief as already intimated would be scarce worth taking into account but the performance of this ceremony having been rendered necessary—in some cases to the application of an adequate lot of punishment in case of the delivery of mendacious testimony—in other and indeed in most cases and these in the greater number to the very attempt to extract or receive the testimony—hence it is that throughout its whole field of legal action by the mere nonapplication of this stimulus the arm of the law is left in a palsied and inefficient state   in the first place may be mentioned exclusion—the virtual exclusion put by it upon the testimony of a numerous class of men and what men men whose distinguishing characteristic is—that in their instance a more than ordinary degree of sensibility to the force of the religious sanction is by the most unequivocal tokens put out of dispute before these pages are at an end the absurdity of any such exclusion will it is hoped be rendered plain if any thing can be rendered plain even in the case of the most flagrant and manifest improbity and untrustworthiness—here the object on which the stigma is made to strike is that class of men which stands most eminently distinguished for trustworthiness swear not at all says jesus at least in as far as to his biographer matthew credence may in this point be ventured to be given—swear not at all says jesus and as if unless inculcated and enforced by reasons a precept so simple should escape from remembrance reasons are subjoined professing himself a religionist of the religion of jesus—an obeyer of the ordinances of jesus—and of all the ordinances attributed to jesus—not seeing any ordinance more clear or precise than this a quaker refuses to disobey it for this refusal it is that between church and state matters are so ordered that in a case which has afforded no other witness than such as are of this persuasion justice—criminal justice at least—is deprived of all evidence licence being thereby granted to all such crimes as from time to time it shall happen to any man to feel himself disposed to commit other persons out of the question upon the bodies or in the presence of any number of quakers in england this same religion has been adopted adopted but how exactly with those same reservations with which a bill is at its first introduction adopted in the house of commons—viz with liberty of making amendments—amendments omissive interpolative substitutive—amendments of all sorts and in all cases—and in all cases to such effect as the convenience of that class of men by whose convenience every thing is regulated was found to require in regard to some of its clauses as where poverty or equality or nonresistance are ordained the amendment made has been of the omissive kind in the present instance for the purpose here in question it has been of the interpolative kind an amendment for giving admission to such oaths as for purposes such as those above described it should be found convenient to administer to administer amongst other occasions on the occasion of the delivery of judicial testimony what is certain is—that by jesus any such exception is not by any one of his four biographers represented as having been made not made by him and what then it is of the number of those which though he did not make he ought to have made   not so much as the profession of rendering  0  justice being to be made unless the performance of this ceremony be duly accomplished thereupon comes more complication more law learning more doubts more business a jews oath what shall it be must the hat be off or on and if on what shall in law be deemed and taken to be a hat and the book—what must it be and in what language jew or christian what is it that shall be kissed what if instead of the book it be the thumb that receives the salute what if to a book with the song of solomon in it by astutia or laches of the clerk those of rochester be found to have been substituted with such an instrument could a man commit perjury in westminster hall when a man takes an oath which is said to be administered by a judge or certain judges the judge or judges—must they be there or may they be not there not many years ago the writer of this was sworn in this way to the truth of a mass of testimony before a learned judge who was anywhere but there from beginning to end suppose it wilful falsehood was any of it perjury the mahometan—in his system of imposture does the ceremony find the necessary virtue does it in the still more extravagant imposture of the hindoo in the religion or the noreligion of the chinese is that magic to be found which in case of profanation draws down with such unerring certainty the everobsequious vengeance of the churchofengland god by whom all such magic stands prohibited in terms as plain as it is in the power of language to provide in this or that false religion suppose this ceremony to be misperformed—in the hindoo religion for example in which as exquisitely turned as if it had been in westminster hall the whole mass of ceremonies is a widows cruise of nullities   as often as a new statute is passed creative of new offences—and to such novelties not a year but gives birth by dozens—if to any judicatory other than the regular—if to justices of the peace for example one or more as usual cognizance of the offence be given power must by fresh words be given for the performance of this ceremony here then may be seen one of the host of causes from whose hydropic virtue the needless and endless unwieldiness of the body of the law and the impossibility of knowing and consequently of doing that which man is predestinated to be legally plundered and punished for not doing receives its daily increase the empowering formulary—is it omitted this is what has sometimes happened deprived of this necessary support down tumbles the paper edifice and with it perish the hundreds or thousands of pounds that have been spent in rearing it   exists there a case in which be the judge who he may it rests with him in collecting the information to perform or not perform the ceremony as he pleases here then is despotism here opens a door to safe corruption—punition or impunity being attached to mendacity according as it is the one or other that is heard called for by the sinister purpose   where for the creation of it the security such as it is requires on every occasion the interposition of human agency it stands necessarily exposed to all those accidents as well as to all those abuses to which the application of human power stands exposed where the oath is the security for the application of it there must be as above either a magistrate or some other functionary empowered quoad hoc to execute the office of a magistrate but unless by a casual charity not worth reckoning upon the magistrate will not still less the quasi magistrate join in the ceremony without his fee to those whose business with the law is to make it and if they please to execute it the fee is nothing but to those whose business with the law made or not made is to obey it—to the greater part of them at least—the fee is something half of what a man has to subsist himself and family upon for a day is always something to him especially if on that day he have no work if on the part of the justice of peace or according to the occasion the master extraordinary in chancery for such is the title worn by the country attorney when decked out in this one red feather from the magistrates crest—if on the part of this regularly commissioned possessor of power over the almighty either inclination—relation being had to the individual by whom the occasion on which and the person or persons for whose benefit the testimony is proposed to be delivered—either inclination or ability be deficient thereupon comes in another source of vexation nor that a very limited one neither the ordinary justice nor the extraordinary master can be any more obliged to receive testimony than when it is in the affidavit shape the proposed witness can be to deliver it and if in the breast of the only  0  extraordinary master whose abode is known to be within half a days journey of the proposed deponent or answermaking defendant so it be that in regard to witness or party it is more blessed to give than to receive—to give vexation than to receive a shilling—the consequences may more speedily be imagined than expressed   in the times of william the third—amongst other driblets of sham reform a show was made of substituting to a certain extent the purity of natural to the pravity of technical procedure under the name of arbitrators parties were empowered to choose their judges and to the decisions pronounced by such judges upon application made to one of the great shops in westminster hall the force of law was to be sold at an underprice the show was made—was it any thing—and if anything how much better than a show in giving jurisdiction by a fresh law to a justice or justices out of sessions that which to no one man of law in or out of parliament could have been unknown was—that unless for administering oaths to witnesses power were given by an express clause the law would be without effect in this act with all its fine professions no such power was given and why not the answer is already seen where was ever that justice of peace by whom for the purpose here in question as well as any other the judges part might not as well as by a daniel have been acted in this ceremony where is the justice of peaces wife by whom it might not be as well acted as by her husband not to speak of clergymen of whom each parish ought to contain at least one—and to whom for such a function there could not consistently have been a shadow of objection—what attorney is there who not being unfit to continue on the roll would be otherwise than fit for the pronouncing of the words in question seeing the book kissed and signing his name fit yes—nor less so than for the application of this same ceremony to testimonial instruments collected under the authority of the chancery court the same attorney would be if dubbed for the purpose as on paying his fees any attorney may be master extraordinary in chancery as above here there is another instance—nor that a scantily extensive one—in which this instrument of priestcraft has been made an instrument of deceit hypocrisy and mischief in the hands of lawyercraft suppose no such ceremony—suppose in manner as mentioned below that by an allcomprehensive provision punishment according to the nature of the mischief attached as of course upon all mendacity uttered upon a legal occasion to a legal purpose—in such case the remedy if not by other devices defrauded of its pretended object would instead of the sham remedy that it is have been a real one†   by the house of commons to whatsoever subject its powers are directed for obtaining the information whatsoever it be on which in the exercise of those powers it grounds itself—whatsoever is done is done without the assistance of this ceremony for security against deceptious incorrectness and incompleteness the means remaining in its hands consist of that shame which in case of detected and exposed mendacity takes place of itself and the punishment which under the name of commitment for contempt attaches in case of an order made for that purpose but as to the shame be the delinquent who he may the circle within which are included those by whose judgment delinquency is pronounced and by that declaration  0  punished is in general comparatively a very narrow one and as to the punishment as for contempt being in its duration limited to the life of the parliament the consequence is that from the birth to the death of the assembly the maximum of punishment is a continually decreasing quantity till at last being reduced to 0 mendacity to whatsoever subject applied obtains in this way too a licence—a licence at the hands of time section   mischief  —bewildering and enslaving the consciences of jurymen under the head of punishment in the case of a witness but principally in the case of a party who by the admission or extraction of his testimony is in that respect considered and treated on the footing of a witness it has been seen in what way by an artful use made of the ceremony of an oath means were found for producing or repressing mendacity at pleasure thus far and in these instances the purpose admitted at least if it did not absolutely require that the ceremony should be regarded as binding—should be the object of real and efficient as well as universal awe and reverence in the instance of another and infinitely narrower class of persons the like purpose required that it should—this selfsame ceremony should—be considered and treated on the footing of an empty form—that it should stand divested of all influence this was the class of jurymen—the assemblage of twelve unlearned individuals in whose name in certain cases what in englishbred law is done in the way of judicature is entered as done so to order matters that to one and the same individual with no other difference than that of the individual occasion and the station occupied by him on that occasion one and the same ceremony should be an object of awe and of contempt might upon the naked mention of it seem a problem too difficult for human ingenuity so much as to attempt the solution of the solution of it will be seen however to have been not only attempted but accomplished always remembered that in whatever case any real and practical effect has been produced produced—in appearance by the ceremony—in that case shame or punishment or both may be seen at the back of it and on the other hand that where its influence will be seen to amount to nothing so it is that in this case the ceremony has found no such extraneous force to give support to it the problem all along was to this effect—so to order matters that mendacity should be unrestrictedly practised or punished—according as the unrestrained practice or the punishment of it should be most subservient to the private interest of the judge and his fellowlabourers and to this end that in relation to this vital part of morality in such confusion should mens conceptions on this subject be kept involved as to take for the standard of right and wrong the practice of the judge as determined by the sinister interest of the judge—and that accordingly whensoever mendacity were punished by him it should be considered as immoral—whenever left by him unpunished indifferent—whenever encouraged or compelled by him either indifferent or meritorious to render the confusion the thicker and more irremediable a conception—and persuasion—that was to be rendered universally prevalent was—that the practice of immorality in this shape was throughout the whole course of judicial procedure necessary to the purposes of justice in pursuance of which principle matters have accordingly been so ordered that in the instance of that class of judicial officers viz jurymen whose part in the administration of justice is the object of the warmest share of popular favour and attachment mendacity should have been rendered an unavoidably incident accompaniment of everything that was done under the sacred name of justice at a period which seems even to have preceded the use made of the ceremony in the character of a security for veracity in the mouth of a witness or a party—at this early period a barbarian theology had led the rulers of nations to place their trust in this same ceremony in the instance of public functionaries in general in the character of a security for official probity at large and in particular in the case of functionaries of the judicial order including as well those of the professionally learned and permanent class as those their unlearned their occasional and everchanging assessors in the cases as yet mentioned the expedient by which the power of licensing falsehood was acquired consisted in keeping out of the reach of the ceremony the statements to which it was desired that the licence should extend itself if over the ceremony itself the power of the man of law could find means to extend itself insomuch that at his pleasure it should be considered as binding or not binding the punishment of the religious as well as that of the moral sanction being at his pleasure felt or not felt as attaching in case of violation—he would to the extent of such power possess himself of a species of empire not inferior to any which even the priest had been able to create for himself fortunately for this enterprise in the very operation by which alone this branch of authority  0  was exercised unthinking barbarism had suffered to be involved a cluster of declarations which they being in every case that with respect to the propriety of the decision left any difference of opinion necessarily untrue—necessitated in an equal degree of frequency the profanation of the ceremony of the only course by which profanation would be avoidable torture terminating in death having under cover of the same barbaric darkness been rendered the inevitable result—and reliance upon a mans own opinion—upon the suffrage of his own conscience—being thus rendered morally impossible—what in the situation of juryman could a simple man do to save himself from the wrath to come conscience which in such cases catches at every straw found for the burthen a proffered support in the stronger and well disciplined conscience of the judge—with this burthen whatever it was the learned conscience as often as suited with convenience was found ready as of course to charge itself—and thus it was that by rendering the sacred ceremony an object of universal and necessary contempt the man of law acquired over the decision of juries a sort and degree of mastery such as under any mode of suffrage that would have admitted of an escape from perjury would never have been attainable so many oaths so many nets in which conscience was perpetually liable to be entangled but on so easy a condition as that of a mans pronouncing a short word or two and thinking nothing about the matter a learned conscience was always at hand to cut the cords the violation of the ceremony and of the obligation supposed or pretended to have been created by it having thus been rendered habitual and universal its impotence in the character of a check upon the judge—its unfitness for anything but a cloak to him—followed of course the ceremony being considered as the only security against mendacity and a licence for the practice of that vice being considered as being effectually though indirectly included in every arrangement by which the application of the ceremony was forborne the habitual profanation of the ceremony having at the same time been rendered indispensably necessary to the exercise of the powers of judicature—in a word to what was called the administration of justice—no particular instance of the like profanation could on any consistent ground of reason find in the breasts of the violators any sentiment of repugnance but the looser the obligation sat upon them the more ready at the call of the living oracle under any the slightest impulse of sinister interest in whatever shape—power reputation† or even momentary ease—would each man be to shake it off on condition of earning it by these means a virtual power of pardon has accordingly in cases to no inconsiderable extent been in effect imparted to juries—and lest in the shape of power alone the encouragement held out to misdecision in this shape should not be of itself sufficient reputation in the shape of the praise of humanity has been occasionally added‡ plowing in confusion and perplexity to prepare the soil for the planting of obsequiousness—such is the husbandry which with so brilliant a success has been practised in the field of religion—such is the husbandry which with no less indisputable though less observed success has been practised in the field of law and judicature section   mischief  —giving aid and force to the enterprises of malefactors the application made of the ceremony of an oath to the purpose of securing observance of mischievous engagements of all kinds has in all places and all times been too notorious to stand in need of exemplification in the preceding instances the hands in which in the character of an instrument of evil it has been brought to view are the hands of government—hands at any rate in which this or that portion of the powers of government  0  has been lodged in the present instance the hands in which in that same character it remains to be brought to view are such as on one account or other—in a word on any account—come under the denomination of criminal ones the purposes to which it is applied by them being for example of the nature of rebellion sedition or mischief or depredation perpetrated or attempted in the two last mentioned cases on an extensive scale when of the complicated mass of mischief of which this ceremony is productive the branch here in question is brought to view an answer is ready—applied to such purposes the oath is null and void null and void yes but of this nullity this invalidity what is the meaning this and this only viz that in the mind of any one of a few and still fewer writing men by none of whom would any such engagement be ever taken it would not if taken be considered as being of the number of those by which he ought to hold himself bound—in a word that it ought not to be considered as binding it ought not true—but is it not to the question what are the actual effects of a thing a suggestion concerning what ought to be its effects is—not an answer but a subterfuge employ not the abuse as an argument against the use says a wide extending fallacy by which much confusion much deception much mischief has been produced by the use of a thing are meant its good effects by the abuse its bad effects what in taking account of the effects of a thing are you to omit all the bad ones—in taking account of profit and loss are you to omit all the items on one side meantime the plain truth is—that not only a natural but a preponderant tendency to serve the purpose of abuse is of the essence of the principle the principle is—that independently of any demand which on the ground of the principle of utility an act presents for punishment—be the act what it may—good bad or indifferent—fire stolen as it were from heaven may in this way he obtained and employed to punish it this or nothing is what is assumed and contained in the notion of the binding force of an oath not but that even supposing the nullity of the ceremony universally understood criminal engagements—engagements for any such criminal purposes as above—might be and under the stimulus of the same inducements might with reason be expected to be entered into as in time past true but of the actually binding force with which those engagements have been wont to be attended so much whatsoever it might be as depended upon and would have been brought into action by the ceremony would by the abolition or universally acknowledged insignificance of the ceremony be cut off—be kept from applying itself to the ceremony that hitherto on the occasion of any such mischiefbrewing confederacy the ceremony has in general been considered as possessed of and about to operate with such binding force is matter of experience since on occasions such as those in question it has in point of fact been called in and employed of all the drugs that are in use to be employed in the way of medicine there is not perhaps one which might not in the way of poison be made to operate with a murderous effect from hence does any sufficient reason result for the prohibition of the use of any of those drugs no—but of any known drug suppose it ascertained to be no less apt to be employed with effect to the purpose of destroying life than to that of restoring health—while with reference to every beneficial purpose to which it is supposed applicable others known to be applicable with equal effect without being equally applicable to its deleterious purposes are with equal facility obtainable—so manifest is the conclusion that it need scarce be mentioned a bad effect or none at all—such is the only alternative if it could be proved to be innoxious it would only be by being proved to be inoperative section   mischief  —furnishing pretence for misrule by abuse of prerogative if to any persons who with such a tale in their mouths should presume to call themselves as if for distinctions sake kings friends any credit could be due not merely the life of a single female but the internal peace of a great nation and with it lives in numbers that defy all limits have for years stood predestinated to eventual sacrifice by a sort of jephthahs vow what does not belong to the present purpose is the pretencelessness of the application what does belong to it is the principle and such is the principle that under and by virtue of it with religion on his lips and wickedness in his heart there exists not that system of tyranny and misrule which a king might not find or make for himself an equally good warrant for the perpetration of—make for himself by an apparent obligation covering a real licence at the pleasure of the wearer adamant or gossamer—such are the chains imposed by that sort of law of which the directive part being composed of vague generalities the sanctionative part is composed of the ceremony of an oath   that the course taken by government ought to be determined—not by the exigenries  0  of the existing times but by the exigencies to any degree different of times to any degree remote—   that in matters of law and government men ought to hold themselves precluded from the use of reason and from the benefit of experience—   that for the governance of the living the proper heads and hands are—not those of the living but those of the dead—   that by an idle and universally contemned ceremony for such it will be seen to be as often as destitute of support from punishment it is seen to stand alone—that by a trick thus flimsy it ought to be considered as being in the power of improbity or folly in one disastrous moment to preclude all imperfection from improvement all injury from reparation—all abuse from correction—all mischief from remedy—all wickedness from repentance opinions such as these supposing it possible for them to be sincere—might surely of themselves without anything more insane if anything could be more insane be considered as creating on the ground of insanity a necessity for taking the reins of government out of the hands of a monarch upon whom they could be proved coextensive with that portion to which in the field of administration and legislation it applied by direct words an opinion of this sort would if delivered in the character of a deliberate and determined rule of action be an act of actual abdication and in relation to the remaining part of the field consideration had of its utter and irreconcilable incompatibility with good government ought it not to be considered as having by necessary inference virtually the same effect come when it will is this of the number of those doctrines which are got up for the time no verily—but of those which apply to all times or to none section  0 misrule how to perpetuate—coronation oaths amended in the character in which this instrument has so often been employed viz that of an instrument of perpetuation applied to human ordinances let but the use of it be admitted—the instrument employed accordingly and employed with the effect intended—what shall it be said is the result the result is—that in every shape in which it can happen to the rulers of nations to have or to suppose themselves to have in any shape an interest in misrule in misrule in any shape perpetuity is secured to it as to the mode of operation nothing can be surer to this or that word of those which are in continual use and which without the aid of the instrument are actually and habitually employed to this same purpose—to any word of this sort—nor is there any scarcity of them—apply the instrument the problem is accomplished—the thing is done take for instance the word innovation on whatsoever occasion they are for the first time respectively carried into effect or proposed the best measures and the worst have this in common that they are new so long as any law or established practice in government exists to which the appellation of an abuse can with propriety be applied the removal of such abuse—in one word reform viz in relation to such abuse—must ever be among the measures to which if to any the epithet of good belongs with indisputable propriety—with a degree of propriety still more out of the reach of dispute than that of any measure the object of which confines itself to melioration or improvement—to the introducing in any shape a new and positive good of the number of those without the aid of which the business of society has hitherto been conducted under its own name consistently with the established forms of decency nor consequently with any satisfactory expectation of success abuse cannot in any shape be by any person defended as little can reform at least in so far as it is understood to go no further than the removal of acknowledged abuse be opposed but innovation—whatsoever may have been the import attached to the word—not only may find but continually does find opponents—numerous and most strenuous opponents innovation is a term applicable to anything whatsoever that is new by it is denoted the introduction of anything that is new and as everything whatsoever and therefore amongst other things reform in whatever shape and to whatever subject and in whatever shape applied is on its first being brought on the carpet new therefore so it is that whoever can succeed in getting condemnation passed on innovation succeeds thereby in getting condemnation passed on reform condemnation for everlasting on reform to whatsoever abuse applied in getting—if not perpetuation—actual perpetuation—at any rate judgment of perpetuation passed in favour of abuse in whatsoever shape it may then be or may thereafter come to be in existence  0  add and say—or may thereafter come to be for erroneous howsoever at first sight plausible would be the supposition that by the exclusion of new measures of government—by the exclusion of new laws—abuses would as well as new reforms be excluded reform cannot be effected without regulation—reform cannot be effected but by regulation abuse needs no regulation for the introduction of it not that it is in its own nature less capable of being introduced by regulation than reform is but forasmuch as things which cannot be introduced but by regulation cannot be introduced without being exposed to public observation while things that are capable of being introduced without regulation are thereby generally and comparatively speaking capable of being introduced without being exposed to observation—and since for example among the most frequently exemplified as well as most pernicious shapes in which abuse is apt to introduce itself is that which consists in the habit of profitable and unpunished transgression in despite of regulation—and forasmuch as the evading of such regulations by which sinister interest in any shape is opposed is among the naturally constant objects of every individual whose situation exposes him to the action of such sinister interest—hence it is that of any act of public authority by which exclusion were put upon new measures in the lump and without any particularized exception or distinction the effect in so far as it had any would be to shut the door for ever against reform in every shape—leaving it to abuse in every shape wide open—with full liberty to receive increase—in every shape and to any amount and at all times the above observations premised here then follows the recipe for the explanation of which they have been premised—a recipe or direction for employing with precision and effect on the occasion of the vast and complex ceremony termed a coronation the simple ceremony of an oath in the character of an instrument for the perpetuation of abuse clause the third in the coronation oath stat   w  m c    §  —archbishop or bishop—will you to the utmost of your power maintain the laws of god the true profession of the gospel and the protestant reformed religion established by law and will you preserve unto the bishops and clergy of this realm and to the churches committed to their charge all such rights and privileges as by law do or shall appertain unto them or any of them amendment proposed—to the above words substitute or add the following viz and will you to the utmost of your power resist all innovations in religion and government or in church and state king all this i promise to do     so help me god what is fortunate is—that in the above clause the antireformist possesses not only a most convenient receptacle already fitted up but a precedent of the most sacred texture—a precedent which having its manifest origin in this very purpose has already done whatsoever could then be done towards the accomplishment of it a more ingenious or successful operation of ecclesiastical policy never was performed taking advantage of the fears of popish tyranny excited in every provident as well as in every protestant bosom by the incidents of the day here was an instrument made and provided for the nipping of reform in the bud in whatsoever quarter in the field of established religion it should ever presume to show itself an engine serving with equal effect for defending protestantism against catholicism and churchofenglandism from reform and improvement in every imaginable shape preserving to the right reverend and reverend persons therein mentioned the full benefit not only of all such profitable abuses if any as they had already found means to introduce and establish but of all such others as by themselves or others means should thereafter and hereafter be found for introducing and establishing for or to their benefit to the end of time applied to government in its largest sense established religion included—among the characters of an instrument of perpetuation upon this model is—that of being in a peculiar and extensive degree adapted to the purpose of giving perpetuity or if that be impossible the utmost possible length of undue continuance to bad systems in contradistinction to good ones and the worse the system the greater is the need it has of this sort of instrument—the greater the service it is capable of receiving from it applied in particular to religion established by law it is in a like degree well adapted to the purpose of giving and securing the utmost possible degree of credence—or if not of credence of silent submission and acquiescence—to whatsoever is false in matters of religion in contradistinction to whatsoever is true in the mouth of a mollah or a bramin the first clause of it ending with the word god would with as much force and propriety and without need of amendment serve for the perpetuation of the religion of mahomet or  0  bramah as for any that calls or ever called itself the religion of jesus—will you to the utmost of your power maintain the laws of god applied to the tenets of any religion or of any of the various editions of any religion it includes in it moreover a certificate of the erroneousness and falsity of such tenets not that by this or any other human contrivance a religion that is true can itself be rendered false not that by this or any other contrivance a set of facts that have actually had place can be made not to have had place what it is not is therefore a proof of the falsity of any religion to which it is applied but what it is is—a proof nor needs there a more conclusive one—of a want of belief in affirmance of such religion in the breast of those who concur in the application of it what—if these notions or pretended notions of yours concerning your religion be conformable to truth—if it be the pleasure of the almighty that the alleged facts on which it rests shall obtain credence—is it not in the power of the almighty without your assistance to obtain credence for it you whoever you are is it that in yourself you have a power which has been denied to god but for such assistance as it may please you to give is the almighty impotent with equal force and efficacy is it adapted this same first clause to the purpose of insuring submission to the most absurd conceptions and to the most pernicious ordinances to the most pernicious ordinances and in their support in case of need to the most atrocious persecution and tyranny this or that ordinance which by any portion of the kings subjects is not regarded as of the number of the laws of god suppose for example that by the king it is regarded or pretended to be regarded in that light in the course of any exertion made by him in the endeavour to cause these refractory subjects to regard it in that same light or at any rate to act and speak as if they did suppose him to experience resistance resistance the effect of which—in whatsoever shape more or less gentle or vigorous it may happen to it to present itself—shall be to render it in his judgment impracticable to produce the effect he aims at the clause continuing to be understood as it cannot but be understood what is the practical consequence that so long as the effect remains unproduced—no measure is there be it ever so coercive that he does not remain still under the obligation of bringing up to the charge but the stores of his power are not nor therefore is the virtue of his obligation exhausted till all the expedients that ever have been all that ever can be employed by tyranny in all its shapes by force and fraud combined have been exhausted—till in his legislative character he has refused his concurrence to all laws tending to the alleviation of the established yoke—till in his executive or administrative character including the virtual initiative part which by the hands of his servants he bears in legislation he has exhausted all the stores of corruptive influence in the endeavour to overpower and subdue all resistance and given to the yoke every necessary and practicable increase of pressure to considerations of this nature a peculiar degree of importance is given by the circumstances of the time when from such numerous and in particular from such highstationed mouths the cry is so loud for one knows not what succedaneous manifestations of hostility under some such name as pledges or securities or guards—as if there were any real danger but from such guards what—more oaths—more subscriptions—more pretendedly perpetual laws—and this for the security of the majority against the minority of the wise against the foolish of the strong against the weak—yes when you have stocked both houses with gunpowder for security against fire what you may thus perpetuate is the remembrance of your own folly what you can not and will not perpetuate should men be weak enough to receive them are—any such perpetually foolish laws section    mischief  —corrupting the national morals and understanding—oxford university oaths thin are the partitions by which the moral and intellectual parts of mans frame are divided scarcely can corruption gain the one without making its way to the other when in the shape of an immense mass of unperformable engagements all sanctioned by an oath the seeds of perjury had been thus thickly sown it could not be long ere they began yielding such their fruits fruits more or less bitter to some stomachs but at any rate conspicuous to all eyes—a remedy was deemed necessary the simple course would have been to abolish the oath but this would have been contrary to more than one fundamental principle of ecclesiastical polity   one is—that the church is infallible that is that a set of professors who at the expense of the people are paid by the sovereign—such of them as do anything—for reading and endeavouring to explain a most important indeed but not the less obscure and mysterious book—written at different times before the use of printing in different dead languages—remain for ever as they   0 and their predecessors have been for two hundred and fifty years past under the happy incapacity of putting in any one instance a wrong sense upon it the influence of this attribute displays itself in both departments of the mind the understanding and the will opinions real or pretended are by it converted—that is the words given as containing the expression of them are converted—into articles of faith acts of the will of which when issuing from the pen of acknowledged authority the expressions become laws are converted into—what certain laws of the medes and persians were once pretended to be—everlasting and immutable laws or ordinances between the immutability that belongs to articles of faith and the immutability that belongs to laws—between the essential characters of these two productions of the one attribute infallibility—the nature of the subjectmatter has however produced some difference articles of faith admit neither of subtraction nor yet of addition nor consequently of change or substitution which is composed of subtraction and addition put together ordinances are equally unsusceptible of subtraction—but of addition consideration had of the changes and chances to which the affairs of this transitory life are subject—of addition so it be made but rarely nor then but with a sparing hand they are not altogether unsusceptible to herself holy mother church—sanctamater ecclesia—younger and revolted sister of the church of rome—reserved the superior establishment the manufactory of articles of faith it was set up and worked out—the moulds accordingly all broken up—the necessary assortment being completed completed for all eternity so long ago as the year      to her two daughters—kind mother oxford university and kind mother cambridge university—alma mater academia oxoniensis alma mater academia cantabrigiensis—for thus it is that as often as they talk in latin the two goodly fellowships of heads of colleges when acting in their legislative capacities respectively style themselves she gave up the subordinate establishment—the manufacture of ordinances ordinances by which the minds of the flower of the english youth were and are to be moulded—to the form at any rate whatsoever may become of the substance—of orthodox piety of virtue and of what little there may be that is conducive to such orthodoxy in knowledge the above how pregnant soever in practical consequences is itself no other than a theoretical principle another—itself a practical one the practical object and fruit of the theoretical one—is—that the minds of men are by these their rulers to be kept in a state of perpetual dependence of dependence as abject and entire as possible lest the conduct of these possessors of power should experience any inconvenient check in the opinions of the persons subject to it matters were accordingly and are to be so ordered that all notions of duty moral as well as religious religious as well as moral are to be resolved into one much more simple obligation the imagined obligation produced by skilful culture out of the liberty of submitting—submitting on all occasions and without reserve—to the opinion real or pretended and thence to the will of these the ruling and domineering few such being the end behold one necessary means when by the ruling powers such is the species of dominion aimed at a necessary condition is—and such accordingly is their interest—that on the part of the subject herd transgression should be as universal and as continual as possible that thus finding in their own consciences nothing but condemnation they should with an intensity of selfassurance proportioned to the enormity and multiplicity of such their transgressions behold in the authority of these their spiritual guides their only hope—their only prospect of deliverance from the wrath to come in every community—it is of the obedience of the men subject to authority that the power of the man possessed of authority is composed in proportion to the need which each person so subject conceives himself to have of the beneficial exercise of such authority will be the strictness of that obedience proportioned to the selfattested wickedness of the sinner is the magnitude of the demand he has for absolution in whatsoever shape and from whatsoever hand such deliverance may peradventure come thus it is that—the effective power of the confessor being as the multitude and enormity of the sins real or imagined of the penitent—it is in that respect the interest of the confessor that in the eyes of the penitent and thence that in reality these sins should be as multitudinous as possible and thence for example it is that without exception or distinction the words miserable sinners—us miserable sinners—are regularly     crammed into their mouths that so by a perpetual fever a perpetual demand for opiates such as the laboratory of the confessor is furnished with may be kept up under the church of rome the potion is administered in the retail way—drop by drop by hand as it were—to each patient by himself and accordingly it is under that one of the two churches that the subjection is most entire under the church of england under the dominion of its universities it can only be administered in the wholesale way it can only be administered as if it were by steam to the whole flock of penitents in the lump in this mode to administer it with any chance of effect required no small degree of art it has been or will presently be seen what that art has been and with what success it has been practised to the accomplishment of the design thus indicated the course thus pointed to being in the situation in question if not the only the most promising and directly leading course—so of the existence of such design the taking of that course which has thus been seen to have been and to continue to be taken cannot but be acknowledged to be evidence evidence the probative force of which is as the degree of pertinacity wherewith a system necessitating a constant and universal habit of perjury—a system having certainly for its effect the generation rather than the prevention of so many of the acts which itself prohibits—a system for which considered in these its peculiar features no other assignable use or object can be found—is upholden and persevered in persevered in in sullen silence without defence because without possibility of defence in the midst of repeated and persevering remonstrance and reproach a selfstyled explanation of the oath—bound up indeed in the same volume with the oath but neither referred to by it nor so much as by the operation of the press placed near to it—such has been and such continues to be the instrument employed to both these purposes in pursuance of this design a new principle in morals and legislation and that a fundamental one it was found necessary should be advanced a principle which in itself considered in an intellectual point of view will be seen to be not less glaringly absurd than in effect as well as in design pernicious advanced it required to be and advanced it was and continues to be accordingly by any being invested with authority and acting in pursuance of that authority—such an one excepted if such an one there be whose moral essence is composed of pure malevolence—punishment it seems now to be pretty generally understood unless it be where the influence of such contrary doctrine as is about to be mentioned has been prevalent is never aimed at or regarded in the character of an end—prevention viz of delinquency being in every case the end—punishment a means directed to that end—an instrument how unwillingly soever yet under the spur of necessity employed notwithstanding in the character of a means according to this other—this anile for such it may be called anything rather than maternal theory which it was found necessary for mother university to set up in opposition to the theory of common sense and common humanity—according to this theory punishment is not a means leading to prevention but a coordinate end placed by the side of it on the same level so that when by a person in authority—say a parent say a master say a legislator—any act is forbidden to be done—a punishment being appointed to be inflicted in case of its being done—in every such case whether the act be abstained from or the punishment be inflicted is—in his eyes and to his wishes—a matter of indifference in the world at large—in the case of murder for example—suppose a legislator taking up the pen and saying thou shalt not commit murder whoso committeth murder shall be hanged to this legislator according to the oxford theory it is matter of indifference how many murders are committed so long as for every man murdered there is another man hanged suppose in this case—not that there could be any use in it—suppose an oath taken by every man that he will never commit murder by this oath according to the same theory would any mans conscience be bound to abstain from committing murder not it indeed all that it could be bound to would be—in case of his committing murder and being unfortunate enough to be found out and prosecuted to conviction—all that the man would stand thus engaged for is—to stand still while the rope is putting about his neck as to the subject part of the community—as it was in the beginning so it is now—it is in this explanation including the theory on which it grounds itself that such of them as feel any need of any such remedy find an opiate such as it is—and that the only one—for whatsoever agitation their conscience may have been subjected to by the consciousness of continuallyrepeated perjury as to the rulers their wellseasoned consciences have needed neither that nor any other sedative from one sin alone could they receive any sensible spasm—and that is—the giving up the article of infallibility nominal or real as above mentioned sooner than give up that they would all of them promise and vow to say the bismillah—as some of them in the midst of their pious abhorrence of popery do     still it should seem to say mass as to lauds explanation if to them it were anything so far from an opiate it would be a caustic for by it are specially marked as perjuries those things which omissions included they are all of them doing every day and all day long under it they are all of them so many—is it the fault of those who thus act or of those who that it may be no longer acted thus speak of it—are all of them so many specially declared and posted perjurers† what is manifest all this while is—that to the purpose of prevention—which except under such tutorage is everywhere regarded as the sole object of every law considered in the character of a prohibitive one—the effect of all this apparatus binding and loosing together is less than nothing without any such system of contradictions the law of the land—not quite so well obeyed any more than quite so well in all points deserving to be obeyed as could be wished—does however upon the whole obtain a tolerably sufficient measure of obedience but this theocratical code—with its oath and its explanations and its perjuries and its equivocations—and under the name of principles of legislation its principles of misrule—what with all its ingenuity and all its piety has it done but to expose itself to contempt and its religion along with it such would be its inefficiency if prevention of mischief its pretended were its real object but its real objects being such as have been above explained sure too sure it is—that with relation to those objects inefficiency cannot with truth and justice be imputed to it‡     section    mischief   continued—ii cambridge oaths such in regard to oaths and perjury being the state of things in one of the two chief sources and seats of churchofengland piety what is it in the other     the answers—to the purpose of sincerity widely different but as will presently be seen to the purpose of the main position viz that of the impropriety of the ceremony much the same at cambridge on admission into the state and condition of a member of the university an oath to the same effect as above together with other effects in abundance is exacted but subjoined to the formulary and on the same paper is printed an explanation by which one point excepted and that an useless one it is declared to amount to nothing the engagement thus sanctioned is—what an engagement to pay obedience to these same statutes all or any of them no but only—in case of disobedience and prosecution and conviction and judgment accordingly and execution denounced—an engagement to submit to it and in so doing to be humble     excerpta è statutis acad cantabrigiensis c cambridge j archdeacon      on this occasion surely if on any is one of mosess commandments broken and the lords name taken in vain—if by taking in vain be meant taken to some bad purposes and to no good ones yet so taken in vain as that upon the so taking it no such thing ever takes place as perjury comparing together the state of opinions and religious feelings in these two seats and sources of churchofengland piety a few results—in an historical point of view at least not altogether devoid of interest—present themselves—   that at cambridge as well as at oxford there was a time at which perjury was not regarded as a matter of complete indifference   that at cambridge as well as at oxford some person or persons was or were found in whom symptoms of a desire to be exempted from it had manifested themselves   that by the ruling powers at cambridge as well as at oxford in compliance with such desire measures were taken for the relief of those consciences in which on the score in question symptoms of uneasiness had thus broken out   that in this view neither at cambridge any more than at oxford did it please these reverend potentates to pursue the simple and only proper course viz as above to divest of this extraordinary sanction the comparatively trifling regulations in question leaving them to the support afforded by those ordinary sanctions to which the general law of the land and with it not only the wellbeing but the very being of society is confided   that at cambridge as well as oxford the influence of the principle—above spoken of as being common to the ruling powers under every modification of the christian religion not to speak of others when by law established viz the assumption of infallibility—openly announced or necessarily howsoever covertly implied—is on this occasion discernible to the standard of opinion and conduct matter may in case of urgent necessity be added but from it none is ever to be taken away   that for the purpose in question at cambridge the course taken was such that thereafter whatsoever other objections it may remain open to as above still in that seat and source of piety on the score of a violation of the sort of oath of obedience in question no person living in a state of perjury has perhaps ever been or was likely to be found—while in oxford what seems highly probable not to say certain is—that bating rare and casual exceptions—as in the case of confinement by sickness—from that time to the present no member of the university by whom the oath which is administered to all above the age of childhood has ever been taken has ever dwelt in that seat and source of piety for two days together without living in the habitual commission of that sin   that the form of government under which at oxford perjury was thus rendered universal and perpetual—to this time and by the blessing of god to all future time—was monarchical viz during the vigorous part of the joint reign of charles i and archbishop laud—the form of government under which at cambridge it was abolished as above was republican viz that of the long parliament   that the religion under which perjury was thus established was the religion which in england having along with the monarchy been restored remains still established viz episcopalian churchofenglandism—the religion under which at cambridge perjury was abrogated as above was presbyterianism viz under the same long parliament without incurring the reproach of misrepresentation the distinction thus brought to view could not have been passed over without notice not that to the present or to any other practical purpose the importance of it presents itself as very considerable in both seats of piety so perfectly and universally does it appear to be understood that applied to the purpose in question at least an oath is a mere matter of form i e that it amounts to nothing and is of no use—and that where it is not punishable perjury is a sort of a thing that no man need put himself to the trouble of being ashamed of that no instance it is believed was ever known in which in the circumstance of being exempted from this perjury a member of the university of cambridge has been heard or seen in     public or in print at least to speak of himself as possessing any advantage true it is—that in both seats of well paid piety a man hears indeed now and then as of other good things so of a good thing called by the name of christian liberty but under this appellation whatever else be the meaning of it no such liberty as the liberty of not perjuring ones self appears in either of them with the exceptions above brought to view in the case of oxford to have been considered as comprised of a yoke which sits so light upon the shoulders by which it is borne it is not natural that by the mere force of sympathy the pressure should be rendered very grievous to others to which it does not extend itself on any such ground between the children of the one sister and those of the other have any symptoms either of sympathy or of heartburning ever presented themselves no never if on the shoulder of the oxonian a piece of a feather having been deposited by the wind it happened to the man of cambridge to observe it there what he might or might not do is—the picking it off—what it is certain he would not seriously do is the taking the relief so administered for the subjectmatter of boast or the burthen for the subjectmatter either of reproach or commiseration instead of the feather on the shoulder suppose the consciousness of perjury in the bosom the result will be the same piety is one thing sincerity is another in both seats of everything that is right and proper in all proper places on all proper occasions piety continues to be professed of sincerity—at least in so far as concerns an aversion to perjury or to falsehood in a declaration of opinion concerning religion—in a case where anything is to be got by it no such aversion seems ever to have been manifested except by here and there a scabby sheep or two who for that cause have upon occasion been cast out of the flock being not without reason regarded as not well assorted to the company into which they had been introduced in the house of lords the bench of bishops—in some proportion at least—but which unless it be to a father who has a son to prepare for the reception of the holy ghost seems not to call for any very anxious inquiry—is divided between the right reverend persons whose piety has had the milk of the one alma mater and those in whose breasts the same useful quality has had the milk of the other kind mother for its source on any of those occasions on which the influence exercised by a speech is understood to depend in so great a degree upon the personal reputation of the speaker was any cambridgebred ever heard to claim at the expense of any oxfordbred prelate any superiority in the scale of trustworthiness a stare as if lord stanhope had just spoken is the only reply which a question to any such effect could reasonably expect to receive the conclusion is—that in both of the two original sources of that piety the profession of which is so well paid for with public money as well as in that elevated reservoir which has its place in the house of lords an oath is universally considered as mere form and that the breach of it when not understood to expose a man to visible punishment—the breach of it termed in one word perjury is regarded as a matter of indifference—a sort of act of which no man need be ashamed the result here spoken of in the character of a mischief being the corruption infused into the system of public morals and it being among the positions here maintained that an oath is a ceremony devoid of use the contempt thus shown to be entertained for it cannot it may perhaps be said consistently with this position be placed upon the list of mischiefs true in so far as the contempt is confined to the ceremony—to the ceremony considered by itself but in that ceremony is included an assertion and by the falsity of that assertion sincerity is violated in the perjury a sort of insincerity is included and for and by every grain of insincerity which enters into the composition of it every human character is by so much the worse as matters stand at present while in the character of a security for sincerity or for good conduct in any other shape the nothingness of the ceremony is as yet unacknowledged—while on the contrary you will see it so frequently spoken of as the very basis on which society rests and without which the whole fabric would fall to pieces—so it is that by what is regarded as a profanation of the ceremony and a violation of the obligation supposed to be contracted by it—contracted by its own single virtue—indication is given of a looseness of principle as the phrase is or in a language somewhat more determinate of a comparative insensibility to the trangressionpreventing influence of the three tutelary sanctions as hath been elsewhere indicated and explained all this while to bear a man out in the breach thus made in what is universally and without any contradiction spoken of in the character of a most sacred duty to protect him against reproach—nothing whatever is there but custom custom and of what sort a custom of acting—not in conformity but in opposition to the dictates of honest judgment a custom analogous to a custom of smuggling or a custom of false coining a custom of doing that which he whose     custom it is believes to be wrong and feels himself unable to find anything to say in justification of it imports—this habit of perjury—it is produced by and itself goes on producing and fortifying the custom of regarding the distinctions between right and wrong as depending upon custom and nothing else if the difference between happiness and unhappiness depended upon custom so would that between right and wrong unfortunately this is not the case by the custom which men of one colour have so long been in of seizing men of another colour when they could get at them and keeping them in a state of slavery what is easy enough to see is how the sufferings of the men thus dealt with are created what is not easy to see is how they are lessened by the custom which men with one set of religious phrases in their mouths have so long been in of keeping in a state of humiliation and hopeless degradation men with another set of religious phrases in their mouths what is easy to see is how in the minds of men thus dealt with irritation is created what is not easy to see is how it is assuaged not that either under monarchy or under episcopacy perjury has ever eo nomine been put upon the list of essentials and the obligation of committing it considered as constituting the matter of a  0th article at the utmost the breaking of oaths can but be considered as of the number of those exercises which are left unprohibited in such sort as to be when the magistrate requireth lawful just as by article the   th the taking of them is to an eye which should confine its view to the state of things as in this respect it exists at oxford it might be apt to appear that in the eyes of those fathers of the church whose seat is in the high place the propagation of perjury has been and continues to be an object of importance turn however to cambridge and you will see immediately either that with the right reverend persons in question this has not been at all an object or that if it has the benefit that would result from it has been considered as out weighed by some inconvenience that would result from the putting of the business at oxford upon the footing on which it stands at cambridge for example a shake given to so pious and useful a doctrine as the doctrine of virtual infallibility as above things being as they are that with the right reverend persons in question the propagation of the practice in question either has never been at all an object or at least has never been an object of preponderant importance is demonstrated by experience for if it had been matters would before now have in such sort ordered themselves that the oxford instrument intituled explanatio juramenti would at cambridge have been substituted to the decree without a title by which the oxford perjuries have been prevented from establishing themselves at cambridge—and thus that uniformity which on other occasions has been so dear to the church i e to governing men and for which the church has i e men governed by them have been made to pay so dearly would there also and on this occasion have been established at present in this as in so many other instances the object of importance is—that oaths should be taken for the accomplishment of it effectual provision continues accordingly to be made the question of no importance continues to be—whether after having been taken they have been kept or broken and for this they have accordingly been left to take their chance after all this practice of taking oaths whatsoever may happen to them when taken to what is it that in these latter days it is indebted for its continuance answer—not so much to its absolute and intrinsic as to its relative importance relation being had to the grand object of objects—jargonicè the peace of the church in plain language the preserving from disturbance the ease of so many highseated persons spiritual and temporal sacred and profane a blessing which cannot but be subjected to more or less disturbance as often as the eye of scrutiny is directed to a subject so little able to abide it†     so again on the other hand in the case of the mischievous applications made of it—for example on the occasion of the recent associations among the malefactors called luddites what can not be proved is that in any one of the instances in which to the mischievous purpose in question an oath has been administered by them to one another it has actually by its separate influence been productive of any binding of any mischievous fidelitysecuring effect for independently of any such superstitious tie other forces acting in that same direction are but too plainly perceptible viz in case of fidelity the prospect of success in respect of the accomplishment of the mischievous object whatever it be which by the supposition is a common one in the case of defection the fear of vengeance at the hands of the associates who would thus be deserted and betrayed but at the same time what is proved is—that in the opinion of the persons by whom the oath is administered it does promise to operate with the desired effect upon the persons to whom it is administered and in their situation being by the tie of common interest and with the advantage of opportunity engaged each of them to form the truest judgment concerning the texture of each others minds and this for the express purpose of determining what sort of force is likely to operate upon them with the greatest effect thus it is that for regarding the instrument in question as likely to operate to the mischievous purpose here in question the public has the best evidence that the nature of the case admits of on the subject of university oaths another observation that may perhaps present itself in the character of an objection to the conclusion inferring the inefficiency of the ceremony as a security for testimonial verity from its inefficiency in the character of a security of habitual obedience to the regulations thus sanctioned may be thus expressed conclusive as is the proof given of the inefficiency of this ceremony to that purpose in that seat of distinguished piety among that class of pious men what does not follow is—that on the occasion of judicial testimony even supposing the profane checks to mendacity altogether removed this religious ceremony would even in the instance of the same persons be completely inoperative why because the oath against disobedience is administered once for all viz on entrance and not afterwards whereupon human weakness considered nothing is more natural than that of the impression made by the ceremony the force howsoever great at the moment should in general act more and more faintly at every successive point of time till sooner or later its action came to be equal to 0 but in the case of the judicial oath the time at which the act which it is employed to influence comes to be performed follows instantaneously upon the ceremony instantaneously and before the impression made by it whatever it may be has had time to lose any of its force that the observation has a degree of truth in it can scarcely be denied but on the other hand as in the case of the statutes in question occasions for the fulfilment and thereby for the breach of it are occurring every day—under these circumstances suppose the engagement to be renewed every day the ceremony to be repeated every day—exists there in this case any sufficient reason for supposing that from such an arrangement the degree of observance would in the whole body taken together receive any considerable increase—not it indeed a discovery would soon be made—and as soon very generally not to say universally received—that the ceremony was a matter of form—a mere matter of form and be it oath be it subscription be it what it will—no sooner is it understood that the operation is a matter of form than its efficiency if it ever had any is at an end he who speaking of an engagement of any kind terms it a matter of form says in other words—i do not hold myself bound by it in the case of an instrument derived from a supernatural and extraordinary source—such as is the fear of expected future—but never in this life experienced or observed—punishment—the impression made by it seems likely to depend for its force in no inconsiderable degree on the unfrequency of the     application made of it in the case of an instrument derived from a natural and ordinary source—such as is the fear of visible and frequently observed if not also experienced punishment—the force of the impression does not seem in an equal if in any degree liable to abate section    practice of receiving judicial oaths its repugnancy to the precepts of jesus how palpably repugnant to the precepts of jesus many of the observances are to which men are compelled under the notion of their being enjoined by the religion of jesus is what could not easily be conceived by any who on such occasions are not in the habit of using their eyes nor will be believed by many of those who are again says the account in matthew v    the only one of his four biographers by whom any account is given of this precept again ye have heard that it hath been said of old time thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths    but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for    c    nor by the earth for    c neither by jerusalem for    c    neither    by thy head because    c    but let your communication be yea yea nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil as to what is to be understood to have been here meant by old time the only passages of the mosaic law as reported in the old testament that have any bearing upon the subject at least as far as the marginal references can be depended upon are those which are in exodus xx   leviticus xix    deuteronomy v    in exodus xx   the words are these thou shalt not take the name of the lord in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain these are the words in the authentic translation of that portion of the jewish statute law which in the churchofengland liturgy and other offices is distinguished by the name of the ten commandments of which it stands third next comes leviticus xix in which the words are these—   ye shall not steal neither deal falsely neither lie one to another    and ye shall not swear by my name falsely neither shalt thou profane the name of thy god i am the lord lastly comes deuteronomy v    in which the words are exactly the same as in exodus will it be said that by the words but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths it appears that the sort of oath meant by jesus to be forbidden was the promissory oath alone and not the assertory oath but—  in the promissory oath the assertory oath it has been seen is included   and in the above passage in leviticus the assertory in which is included the testimonial oath is specially mentioned ye shall not lie one to another—ye shall not swear by my name falsely neither shalt thou profane the name of the lord—ye shall not swear by my name falsely—says the law of moses what says the law of jesus ye shall not swear falsely no but swear not at all ye shall not swear at all in this prohibition the words are general allcomprehensive if in respect of judicial occasions or any other occasions it had been his intention that any exception should be made would not such intention have been expressed—would not this have been the occasion for expressing it if of words thus plain and positive the only obvious import is not to be trusted to would it not be better that instead of being in such multitudes distributed all testaments old and new should be burnt and the churchofengland common prayerbook with its articles of faith and other appendages distributed instead of them   0   and accordingly comes the concluding passage of the words of jesus in which the word employed in contradistinction to swearing is communication under this word communication is not assertion—statement—narrative—whichsover be the name given to that application of the faculty of discourse which is most in use—is it not still more obviously and necessarily included than any such comparatively rare application as is made by what is called promise engagement—deliberate and solemn engagement the words of james—will they be acknowledged as the words of jesus or as conformable to and explanatory of the meaning of the words of jesus but above all things my brethren says that apostle v    swear not neither by heaven neither by the earth neither by any other oath but let your yea be yea and your nay nay lest ye fall into condemnation on either of these occasions respectively did jesus—did james—explain and say—on a judicial occasion or for a judicial purpose swear as much as you will for in such case swearing is not swearing on the day when this letter was written by james had such been the meaning of his master was it not high time for the disciple to have made known as much on this ground stands the system by which on pretence of christianity christians in such multitudes together with all such other persons to whom it may happen to stand in need of their testimony are thrust out of the protection of the law—of that branch of it viz the penal on which alone men are altogether dependent for whatsoever protection is afforded to them against the most grievous of the injuries to which mans nature is exposed all this while—without any the smallest innovation upon churchofenglandism—upon that system in comparison of which all perceptible happiness and unhappiness is as dust upon the balance—without any such horrible and impracticable temerity will men believe as much when they see it with their own eyes—the practice of administering oaths might be abolished no not indeed if so it were that by any one of the thirtynine articles the practice is enjoined but on the contrary so it is that by the only article which has any application to the subject what is declared is—not the obligatoriness—but merely the lawfulness of employing this instrument the lawfulness yes lawful then let it be at any rate so as the practice of employing it be done away the doctrine concerning its lawfulness taking the word lawfulness in a religious sense may without much mischief remain unquestioned and undisturbed if so it really were that in all testimonial cases the employment of this supposed security were obligatory what should be said of those by whom to so great an extent as has been seen it has been left unemployed obligatory or unobligatory useful or unuseful the practice at present maintained in relation to it will in either case be indefensible section    succedanea—true securities substitutible to this false one mendacity is an instrument applicable to the purpose of every wrong punished in any one instance why should it be left unpunished in any other punished in the character of an instrument of delinquency employed in the commission perpetrated or attempted of an offence—in what proportion should it be punished but according to the nature of the offence should the prevention of wrongs—should the prevention of offences—be purposely left to accident then to the prevention of wrongs in the commission of which mendacity has been or would be employed as an instrument the application of punishment should be purposely left as at present to accident mendacity is not an uniform offence it changes its colour according to the nature and substance of the offence to which it is rendered or endeavoured to be rendered subservient mendacity employed in drawing down upon an innocent head the destroying sword of justice is murder murder encompassed with all its correspondent terror mendacity employed in the obtainment of money is but depredation yet while predatory mendacity is punished with death the punishment for the murderous mendacity is in comparison but a fleabite the principle being admitted the application presents no difficulty by apt description performed in and by one allcomprehensive rule or short series of rules the punishment destined for mendacity might without difficulty be attached to it in every case in which testimony comes to be received for any legal purpose—in every case those included in which under the existing system it would be thought fit to employ for the purpose the ceremony of an oath for any warning that might be thought requisite to be given—given viz by the denunciation of the eventual punishment as at present by the ceremony—for any such     warning magistracy—public functionary—there needs none with or without reference to those denunciations of which so strong and ample a provision is to be found in the sacred books—a formulary being provided by the legislator for pointing out the punishment to the notice of the person in whose testimony he had an interest any the humblest individual would not be less competent than the highestseated magistrate judicature grounded on testimony delivered before mutually chosen arbitrators sitting in the seat of natural procedure might in this case and if not purposely debarred from it would—receive that adoption which at present is in effect refused to it—granted but in pretence for the eventual punishment to attach—and for that purpose to distinguish legal investigation from simple conversation—a short formulary might be preappointed not that at present under the existing system any such tutelary caution is provided for mendacity employed to no worse purpose than fraudulent and unterrific depredation mendacity is in various cases and without any such warning punished with death witness personation witness in an infinitely diversified set of instances forgery in the state of things thus ventured to be proposed another amendment much wanted might be made with as little difficulty falsehood though not accompanied with that evil consciousness which in common speech gives it the epithet of wilful—which in one word gives it the name of mendacity and if preceded by the ceremony the name of perjury—might if accompanied with blame in another shape—in a shape in which in the language of the roman school blame on the occasion of whatsoever mode of delinquency imputable receives and not unaptly the name of temerity—might be subjected to punishment according to the degree of blame at present under the system of oaths and perjuries misstatement from whatsoever cause—misstatement in what degree soever mischievous and blameable—is either perjury or nothing what is the consequence that where it has not been accompanied with that evil consciousness but has been accompanied with temerity—with that heat and passion by which adequate reflection has been excluded—it is either under the name of perjury punished on a false ground and to excess or—what is more common and not less pernicious—left unpunished at least if not successful and triumphant section    cause and origin of the practice in regard to oaths thus repugnant to one of the plainest precepts of jesus—to that one which may perhaps be stated as being the most pointed and specific of all the precepts of jesus—how happens it it may be asked that under a religion calling itself the religion of jesus the use made of this ceremony should have been so abundant after what has been said the answer to this question will surely not be thought to lie very deep in the case of this as of other institutions the final cause must be to be looked for in the particular interests of those by whom they were set on foot in so far as on the occasion of the application made of it the institution happened to be favourable to the general interest of the community in so far the operation and effect of it was beneficial—in so far as—the particular interest being repugnant to the general interest—the general interest was sacrificed to it the operation and effect of the institution was pernicious what has had place in the instance of other institutions may perhaps have had place in this—viz that at their origin the balance of their effect has been on the side opposite to that on which it has come to be afterwards at its origin—being employed—though in itself an evil—as an instrument and perhaps a necessary one to the combating of still greater evils—it may have been productive of a quantity of good which upon the cessation of these greater evils has come to cease on the occasion of the question concerning the effects good and bad of the use made of this instrument there are two distinguishable states in which society requires to be considered viz a barbarous state and a comparatively civilized state in the barbarous state that is until a certain degree of civilization has taken place it may probably be impossible to determine to any tolerable degree of certainty whether the good or the evil were predominant the chances may perhaps be found even in favour of the good—while in the civilized state the good effects being altogether or nearly evanescent the evil will as above be found preponderant in the balance if not alone in the early and barbarous state of the species anterior consequently to the days of history—take any number of human beings connected by no other ties than those of vicinity—could they or could they not have been knit together in the bonds of political society and thence gifted with a till then unexperienced degree of security without the aid of this or other kindred instruments—if not the preponderance on the side of utility seems to be out of the reach of dispute among the ancient greeks great and various was the use made of oaths among the     athenians more regard was supposed to be paid to them than in other parts of greece by theseus the scattered population of attica was for the first time brought to that degree of union and into those habits of submission by which political power and regular government are composed in the production of this effect the instrument in question would naturally be employed could the effect have been at all or equally well produced without it in the hands of the priest supernatural hopes and fears have sometimes been employed on the formation of society in bridling and leading the passions of the multitude—sometimes in a society already formed under the military leader in the bridling of his despotism suppose a case in which by the direction given to the force of the community the peace and welfare of the community would but for some such principle of restraint be destroyed—in such case let any such principle present itself and come into action here—although the nature of it be such as to rank it under the denomination of fraud deceit imposture—the preservation of the community may in this restraining principle how sinister soever in its nature find its cause suppose an infant in the cradle—and a madman with a sword in his hand about to destroy it if by any representation though it be false the hand of the madman can be staid—as for instance that an angel with a flaming sword is about to smite the madman—here the mischief which in illdirected force would have found its efficient cause finds in fraud its preventive next to the evils of anarchy are the evils of despotism political society once formed despotism is the predominant disease to the attacks of which it remains continually exposed despotism or misrule has place in so far as the force of the whole is for the benefit of the one or the few employed in a manner mischievous to the many if fraud could never be employed but to the promotion of happiness fraud would not be vice but virtue in its own nature fraud is equally capable of being employed on the side of force—of despotic force—as an instrument in the hands of force—or on a side opposed to it employed by force or on the same side it is an instrument of evil but if so employed—employed in such direction and manner as to oppose with more or less effect the mischief that would otherwise be done by force—in a word to serve as a check to misapplied force—in this way it may be an instrument of good in the society in question—in the hands in question the effect of military force unchecked would be let it be supposed a barbarous tyranny and lawless despotism in such a state of things imposture and superstition—on the part of a priesthood imposture on the part of the people that superstition on which imposture must always depend for its success—may if evils be necessary evils necessary evils and with reference to the disease remedies with reference to the impending calamity blessings take the case of jephthah in the sacred history the collection of facts actually reported is not ample enough for the present purpose but for the purpose of argument they afford a ground ample enough to serve as a basis upon which for the purpose of argument suppositions may be applied the facts are—that being commanderinchief of the army of the jews who were at war with the ammonites he vowed a vow—that in case of his coming off victorious he would in the way of sacrifice put to death the first living object that should present itself to him on his first visit to his own home that first object was his only daughter and accordingly put to death she was let this then be the supposition jephthah was the military leader in that quality his power was exercised in a manner dangerous to public liberty in the influence of the priesthood he beheld a rival power in that power his own power felt a check and that a salutary one the form and ceremony of an oath had all along been an instrument in their hands on the observation he had made of the efficiency of it on other occasions was grounded the application he thought fit to make of it in this in the utterance given to this his oath what he had in view thus eventually to deal with was neither more nor less than the first that should happen to present itself of the animals ordinarily employed on the occasion of sacrifice for though in the practice of employing human creatures on this occasion for victims there was not to the people over whom he presided anything new or even very strange—and though their common ancestor isaac would by his father have been thus dealt with and the whole race thus extinguished yet so it was that no such thing was in his thoughts least of all had he any such intention as that of all human beings his own daughter his only child should be thus dealt with unfortunately for the father and the daughter such was the looseness of the     expression employed or at least said to have been employed by him in the utterance of the oath or vow that human beings were not excluded by it when the time came for fulfilment his endeavours were of course applied to the causing that sense to be put upon the oath by which the dictates of humanity would have been conformed to and his own affliction spared but in an incident thus tragical and impressive the priesthood beheld an opportunity too favourable to be suffered to pass unimproved an opportunity of giving the utmost possible degree of force and efficiency to an instrument the management of which was in their hands the power thus possessed by them and employed was it or was it not with reference to the aggregate interest of the community in question—the jewish nation at the time in question—a beneficial one for a categorical answer to this question no sufficient data are to be found of a hypothetical answer the difficulty is not equally great the time was a time of war—a time during which the earlier and less experienced the state of society is the less distinctly does the authority of a commanderinchief differ from a despotism in this state of things the authority of jephthah did it stand in need of a check the sort of check which the priesthood were able and disposed to apply was it upon the whole a salutary one both questions determined in the affirmative the price paid for the keeping of this check in order and repair—that price great as it was was not perhaps too great one individual—the father—afflicted another individual—the daughter—sent out of the reach of affliction—what are these evils in comparison of those of a course of unbridled and tyrannically exercised despotism or of civil war its desperate and perhaps still more afflictive remedy thus much for jephthah and for the application made of the ceremony in his case upon the whole whatsoever it might have been in times thus remote and different from the present for a long time past its effects may surely without any considerable error be set down as altogether on the side of evil to the purpose of being employed as a security against transgression in any shape and in the shape of mendacity in particular it is—for so it has above been shown to be—altogether needless its effects then are purely on the side of evil of evil it is as hath been already seen an instrument in a variety of ways and it is—if not in a direct way in the evil of which it has been productive at least in an indirect way in the good which the ruling few have contrived to extract out of that evil—that the use made of this instrument has found its efficient or final cause and the upholders and employers of it their motive for thus upholding and employing it in many cases in the supposition of the event is involved that of the antecedence of its opposite relaxation supposes restriction condescension supposes pride prohibition forms the necessary antecedent to and ground of licence and when to profitable prohibition profitable licence is added the produce of misrule is doubled there are two modes of culture in which the produce of licence may be reaped—the general and the particular—the wholesale and the retail mode as to the wholesale mode in its application to mendacity its variations have been already shown viz omission and explanation forbearing to apply the security to this or that class of cases and explaining it away when applied the special or particular mode consists in the granting of special licences under the name of dispensations—granting them avowedly not covertly and indirectly as in those other cases the use derived in this shape from the system of oaths and mendacitylicences or perfidylicences by the church of rome especially in times antecedent to that successful revolt against its authority which has obtained the name of the reformation is sufficiently notorious by the ceremony of an oath obligation applicable to any purpose was created by a dispensation granted by the head of the church an obligation thus contracted was for the benefit of any person to whom on any terms it pleased the holy father to concede the indulgence done away it was on the occasion of the dispensation more particularly that the power of the spiritual ruler was most immediately profitable and most conspicuous in the creation of the obligation the tying of the knot was the operation of a prearranged machinery the part taken in the operation by the manager consisted in nothing more than watching over it keeping it in order and keeping it clear of obstructions the dissolution of the obligation—the dispensation—was a work that could not be performed but as it were by hand on no occasion could it be performed unless on that same occasion if not the mind the hand at least of the manager were employed in the execution of it at the time of the reformation when mens eyes had begun to open themselves this power of dispensation became too flagrantly mischievous to be retained by any priesthood that had revolted from that of rome the days were now over when by the power of the keys treaties might be made and dissolved—kingdoms given and taken back—war kindled—and peace sold     by the churchofengland priesthood it was accordingly with whatsoever reluctance along with so many other of the powers of the romish priesthood given up by land as the crown by cromwell the cardinals hat was refused the power of dispensation in the gross—the power of explanation was all that was by lauds power retained retained accordingly it was and in what manner retained and employed has been seen above in time past and thence in time present—the cause final or efficient of whatsoever is at any time found established—be it beneficial be it pernicious to the subject many—will always be to be found in the particular interest real or supposed of the ruling few of the institution here in question at the time of its creation the effects may—upon the balance as hath been seen—have been either good or bad—it is scarce possible to say which but those times having been long since passed the question now is—not whether it shall be set on foot but whether it shall be preserved the use now made of it—the support still given to it—these are the subjects which call for consideration in this our time appendix i among the rulers of the university of oxford perjury universal and constant as declared in and by an explanation given by themselves in their own statutes—its jesuitical style in page     in speaking of the rulers of the university of oxford mention being made of a document in and by which the guilt of perjury is in an especial manner declared to attach upon every person who shall comport himself in the manner therein described—the same being a manner in which to his own knowledge and in the sight of the whole population of that city and its university every such person does continually comport himself—an extract is thereupon announced as intended to be here subjoined for the purpose of bringing to view the contents of that document in so far as material to the present purpose in the original the following are the terms of it annexed to it is a translation in the penning of which polish being considered as

fidei violatæ ac perjurii teneri decernimus appendix to the laws or explanation of the oath which concerning the observance of the university statutes is by each person wont to be taken how far to wit or to what extent it is to be regarded as obligatory on the swearers forasmuch as in some men conscience is more strict and morose in others more lax and loosely girded the former are born to calumniate every the slightest of their own transgressions and regard themselves as not more unfrequently unobsequious than perjured the latter strive by their quibbles to elude all legal ties whatsoever the religion of an oath the nets of conscience and themselves put a cheat upon themselves it seemed to be not beside the purpose to explain to what length or how far each person ought to be considered as holden or bound by the religion of the oath taken touching the observance of the statutes of the university and therein to follow such a temperament that neither by too hardly interpreting it we may appear to fasten a cross upon the one nor by too benignly to unbutton a button for the other     wherein this is in the first place to be attended to that by the words of those statutes in which any one is made to take an oath the genuine sense as also the mode and measure of and to the obligation or tie of the oath is applied or prescribed by the mind and intention not of him by whom the oath is taken but of him by whom it is exacted to wit of the legislator himself for neither if any one in swearing affixeth to the words in which he is made to swear a sense foreign to that of which he the swearer is persuaded or on other grounds it is probable that it was that which was intended by the legislator that is to say such a sense as is favourable to indolence or indifference or repugnant to academic discipline or moral rectitude is it to be thought that he swears rightly or satisfies the statutes or the religion of an oath nor yet let any one think himself released from the religious obligation of an oath if to the act of swearing he brings the intention not of binding himself but of stopping at the bare bark of the words for that poetic remedy or rather shuffleboard to wrongswearing—sworn is my tongue but unsworn is my mind—neither can nor ought to satisfy a christian man in such sort that he ought to repute himself thereby excused from the crime of perjury forasmuch therefore as the measure of the obligation or tie of an oath depends chiefly on the intention of the legislator it would verily be worth the labour that all persons should have held the mind and intention of the legislator well seen through and explored to wit of what sort and of what sort of statutes the transgression involves in perjury those who are sworn to the promiscuous observance of all the statutes accordingly what is understood is—that those men bind themselves in perjury   first who  c   secondly who  c   thirdly who  c but as to other transgressions if contempt of statutes and punishments and gross and obstinate negligence are out of the case delinquents if they shall have submitted themselves to the punishments appointed by the statutes or otherwise to such as are arbitrary are by no means to be deemed to have violated the religion of an oath lastly on magistrates according as to them greater reverence is due than that it should be right that they should be coerced and kept in order by such punishments as are all along threatened so is a greater obligation of conscience incumbent to wit as being they who are bound not only faithfully to administer those things which belong to their functions but also diligently to take care that all others do perform their respective duties nor yet is it understood that they as often as they shall     have been wanting to their duties do altogether bind themselves in perjury but forasmuch as to their fidelity is intrusted the keeping and guardianship of the statutes if far be it from them they suffer through their own negligence or indifference any statutes whatsoever to be rendered obsolete by nonuse or desuetude and tacitly as it were to be abrogated them also do we declare to be bound in the bonds of violated faith and perjury these magistratus—these perjurers in grain—these ipso facto convicted and thus placarded perjurers—who are they—the reverend the vicechancellor—the reverend the heads of houses—the reverend and nonreverend but for the most part reverend masters of arts and other the graduates of higher degrees being members of the house of congregation and of the house of convocation respectively—for of these is the legislative body composed the reverend the vicechancellor—the reverend the proctors and proproctors all for the time being—yea and within the precincts logical and geographical of their respective jurisdictions the reverend the heads of houses with their respective local subordinates—for of these is the executive body composed quære as to the noble the chancellor and the noble the high steward upon their respective installations or whatsoever else be the term—by them respectively is not some such oath taken—for are not they too magistratus on the occasion of the catholic question an apprehension lest in the breasts of some or many or all of the religionists of that persuasion the ceremony of an oath should not always operate with sufficient power—lest in the person of the pope notwithstanding their protestations to the contrary they should upon occasion seek and find a power willing and in their opinion able to exempt them from the obligation of it—an apprehension to some such effect was on the part of many if not all these reverend persons among the reasons assigned for the wish to see now and for ever or thereabouts still withholden from between a fourth and a fifth part of the population of the two islands the common rights of subjects the obligation of an oath to be done away at pleasure by an old priest in or out of prison upon the continent as if in the bosom of every one of these reverend persons by whom the sincere milk of the word has been sucked from the breast of holy mother there sat not in the character of a perpetual pope with a sponge in his hand the image of archbishop and universitylegislator laud constantly sitting and constantly at work watching each perjury as it peeped out and passing over it in the manner that has been seen the sponge of dispensation the instant it came to view ii the manufacture of perjury persevered in and the produce repeatedly augmented—with open eyes and in spite of remonstrances in pages     and     the determination to persevere in a course of universal and continual perjury and the habit of enduring the reproach of it without flinching rather than acknowledge on the part of this eldest daughter of holy mother church the possibility of error are mentioned as among the arcana imperii inviolably observed in and by that closest of aristocracies—the government of the university of oxford if of so undeniable a proposition any further proof be requisite it may be viewed in abundance in the course pursued by that government in the field of legislation for these last fifty or sixty years revision not unfrequent—revision of this very title samples of which have here been brought to view—revision but with what effect with what view never with any such effect or view as that of taking anything from the number of their perjuries not unfrequently with the effect at least of adding to it at the time of matriculation—such is the technical term by which admission into the body of the university is there designated—under the title of parecbolæ sive excerpta è corpore statutorum universitatis oxoniensis in usum juventutis academicæ an abstract of the university statutes containing such of them as it is thought fit that a person who is not a member of the governing body should be acquainted with is

de moribus conformandis being the title from which extracts are here given as above in the edition of      the number of sections is    in the edition of             whence comes this variance the case is this between the date of the former edition and that of the latter two statutes—of the number of those which it was thought fit to make known to the individuals whose conduct was to be governed and whose fate was to be determined by them—two universally promulgated besides seven or eight secret or partially promulgated statutes of which presently—had been passed in the edition of      between §   de ænopoliis c and §   de nocturnâ vagatione reprimendâ is accordingly inserted a section intituled de vehiculis a section against phaëtons which being §   changes the number of that which follows next to it viz that de nocturnâ vagatione reprimendâ and makes it instead of §   as in the abovementioned earlier edition §   lastly at the end of this same title is moreover inserted an additional section intituled de reprimendis sumptibus non academicis and which accordingly is numbered §    as will be seen presently the day on which it passed is   th december      in the manual in question viz in the edition of      of neither of these additions is any intimation given neither by mention made of their respective dates nor otherwise but in this same interval at various times nine or ten in the whole the body of the statutes had been taken in hand for the purpose of amendment each time in the form of simple addition in no one instance in the form of simple repeal and since the date      of the abovementioned latest edition reckoning to the present time march      it has undergone amendment in four other instances of which presently of the interpolated section de vehiculis i have not been able to learn the precise date in the series of statutes at large the date of the earliest which my inquiries have succeeded in obtaining is   th november      of the latest   d june   0  the series as far as it extends being put into my hands as a perfect one and in this series no statute to that effect or on that subject is to be found the time at which it passed must therefore have been sometime between some part of the year      and the   th november      as above thus often has this same code passed under review to what cause then is the country indebted for this continually open exhibition—an enormous and multifarious mass of perpetually violated regulations together with the oath by which obedience is promised to them all left standing—standing together for so many successive ages—impregnating the whole population of this seat and source of churchofengland religion and from thence that of the whole country with a perpetually inflowing stream of perjury is it through inadvertence no but because in regularly reverend and right reverend not to speak of honourable and noble eyes if perjury be a bad sin innovation is still worse—innovation in which is included the removal of evil in every shape in which it exists at present innovation in the exclusion of which is included the perpetuation of abuse in every shape in which at the expense of the subject many profit is derived from it by the ruling few—an exclusion in which may be seen a fundamental—and not the less so for being so carefully locked up in the character of a secret—article in the only alliance ever spoken of that was not purely imaginary between church and state thus far as to the additions made to the subjectmatter of these oaths now as to the additions made to the list of the oaths themselves while all existing oaths continued to be thus dealt with fresh batches of the same species of piecrust have continued to be issued out from the same sacred oven may  st   00 a new system of examination instituted examination for degrees and the efficiency declared to be rested upon the strength of this perpetually broken reed tit ix sect ii de examinandis graduum candidatis §   de examinatoribus designandis et juramento onerandis per seniorem procuratorem sometime in the year   0  as may be inferred from the context for there appears no date to it comes another statute with the same title repealing but immediately in part reenacting that so lately preceding one innovating in this mode for the first time and then no otherwise than upon a recent innovation the first statute as far as appears by which since the days of laud so much as a single atom of the onceconsecrated mass was ever done away by the same reverend hands the same load is now carefully reimposed on the same reverend shoulders with what degree of pressure and effect would any man be curious enough to calculate—the data lie before him as above moreover though without any such idea stated as that of load or burthen oaths have all along been sprinkled in on other occasions and in other places in and by the series of statutes    or    in number passed in the interval between      and      thus much for revisions and enactments now as to representations and remonstrances in a book published by a reverend divine vicesimus knox then late a fellow of one of the colleges in this same seat of piety and perjury—a book of which an edition published so long ago as the year      was the tenth—a book which accordingly has had a greater currency and thus under the very eyes of the reverend rulers in question than     perhaps ever fell to the lot of any book in which in this or any other country the subject of education has been touched upon—is inserted a letter to the then chancellor lord north proposing a plan of reform in which the species of perjury here in question forms the subject of the first article in holding up to view the universality the constancy the notoriety of this sin together with the perfect consciousness of it in the minds of the reverend persons whose lives were passed in the commission of it are employed in different parts of this his work directly or indirectly no fewer than    out of its     pages in the representations thus made by mr knox are included others of the same tendency which at different periods had been made by three other writers viz in      by mr amhurst under the title of terræ filius in an anonymous periodical publication reprinted in   vols   mo in      in      by the rev dr newton principal of hart hall afterwards hertford college oxford in a tract intituled university education  vo pp  0  and in a year not specified by r davies m d of queens college cambridge in a letter to the rev dr stephen hales the natural philosopher that remonstrance though from a consecrated hand having been productive of no other fruit than that of exposing the reverend persons in question to a sort of censure which being rather a passport than an obstruction to preferment is of course to such persons a source rather of satisfaction than of uneasiness the present attempt by a lay hand cannot howsoever fruitless be charged with being needless iii the principle of infallibility adhered to and acted upon to the last in pages from   0 to     infallibility is mentioned as being among the attributes bestowed upon herself by the english holy mother church and accordingly acknowledged and worshipped and shared in by the academic part of her metaphorical progeny to the eye which either in the memorials of the puritan neale or in those of the orthodox and highly favoured strype can endure to look into it the whole history of the spiritual branch of the reign of elizabeth is one continued body of evidence concurring in the demonstration of this truth infallibility was the attribute of this church under the governance of those princes of this church whose thrones were subordinate to the throne of the virgin queen these holy men were themselves the church and the royal mistress of their lives and fortunes—who could have expelled any of them for schism or burnt any of them for heresy—being herself the church yea and more than the church—was not only herself infallible but the cause that infallibility was in them of the assumption of this attribute follows one proof out of a thousand if in such a matter words are less conclusively probative than deeds—yet in such a matter neither are words without their value anno      notwithstanding the charge of late given by your highness says archbishop whitgift in a letter to the queen dated the   th of march in that year—notwithstanding the charge of late given by your highness to the lower house of parliament for dealing in the canon of the church albeit also according to your majestys good liking we have sent down order     yet have they passed a bill in that house touching that matter     they have also passed a bill     contrary to the old canons continually observed among us and containing matter which tendeth to the slander of this church as having hitherto maintained an error to impute to this assemblage of constantlycorrupted and despotridden churchmen—corrupted by hope of preferment corrupted by dread of arbitrary and perpetuallyimpending deprivation with ruin and either banishment or death at the end of it—to such a set of men at a time too when reason had but just begun to recover the use of her limbs—the fact of having maintained an error—so much as one single error—this a slander a slander when coming from the mouth of parliament this church what church—the very church which after having so lately revolted from her ancient mother the church of rome was at that very time and in relation to these very points in a state of separation from perhaps all her sister churches—from all other protestant churches—and at this very time herself in a state of continual and not as yet completed change in the very facility of making this change by the same most reverend person is an argument found for the putting an end for ever to all pretensions so unsuitable to the limited and continually so it were quietly reducible authority of an english parliament if it pass by parliament says he it cannot hereafter but in parliament be altered     whereas if it is but as a canon from us by your majestys authority it may be observed or altered at pleasure in this document we have one out of a multitude in which taken together it may be seen how of this virgin queen and her little black husband so she was pleased to style this her favourite archbishop† it was the acknowledged purpose as well as practice to     persevere in a state of continual change secure of being as continually infallible in theory such a horror of change—and at the same time in intention as well as in practice so constant a state of change—all this selfcontradiction how is it to be reconciled the change was to go on till—under the name of puritans all those who in matters of religion refused to change their belief as well as practice at the word of command as often as issued—and whose real crime was the preferring a government by parliament to a government without parliament—were extirpated after which unless for some equally good reason there was to be no change and such exactly was the result as the laws of the medes and persians so the laws called the thirtynine articles cut down as they were from a greater number remained unchanged but above the one code as above the other sat a despot who with his subdespots kept the rule of action—the inforced and efficient rule of action—viz the will of those same despots—in a state of continual change so much for infallibility and the horror of innovation—the horror of innovation which being interpreted is—the holy love of abuse accompanied with the determination by the blessing of providence to give every practicable increase to it iv habitual perjury of the university magistracy—further proof of its wilfulness while this last sheet is at the press in comes the oxford university calendar for      of i know not what series of numbers the first that ever happened to meet my eye and in it i read p   the following passage— for the better government of the university there is also an hebdomadal meeting of the heads of houses who meet every monday and at other times when convened by the vicechancellor this meeting consists of the vicechancellor heads of houses and proctors who are empowered to deliberate upon all matters relating to the preservation of the privileges and liberties of the university and to inquire into and consult respecting the due observance of statutes and customs in the seven preceding pages may be seen moreover a more detailed explanation of those arrangements in the constitutional branch of the law whereby the principle of infallibility on the part of the legislature has been so systematically acted upon and in pursuance of it the property of immutability given to the body of the laws and with it that of incorrigibility to the defects with which they swarm and the vices which they generate   0     truth versus ashhurst or law as it is contrasted with what it is said to be written in december      first published in          introduction written august      a short time before the date of this paper a charge delivered the   th of november      to a middlesex grand jury by sir william ashhurst then a puisne judge of the kings bench was printed by the constitutional association of that time and circulated with no small industry in digging for other papers the present one has just been dug up the ms copy from which this is printed was taken more than thirty years ago and has not since been read by me if in season then let any one judge whether it be less so now or whether it is likely to be less so so long as the form of the government is what it is the comment is here seen the text was not found with it the fidelity of the quotations may however be depended upon jeremy bentham august             truth versus ashhurst ashhurst—i no man is so low as not to be within the laws protection truth—ninetynine men out of a hundred are thus low every man is who has not from fiveandtwenty pounds to fiveandtwenty times fiveandtwenty pounds to sport with in order to take his chance for justice i say chance remembering how great a chance it is that although his right be as clear as the sun at noonday he loses it by a quibble fiveandtwenty pounds is less than a common action can be carried through for at the cheapest and five times fiveandtwenty pounds goes but a little way in what they call a court of equity fiveandtwenty pounds at the same time is more than three times what authors reckon a mans income at in this country old and young male and female rich and poor taken together and this is the game a man has to play again and again as often as he is involved in a dispute or receives an injury whence comes this from extortion monopoly useless formalities lawgibberish and lawtaxes how many causes out of each of which mr justice somebody has been getting in fees while this speech of mr justice ashhursts has been printing more in amount than many a poor family has to live upon for weeks for so long as you have five pounds in the world no fee no justice o rare judges while their tongues are denying the mischief their hands are making it how should the law be otherwise than dear when those who pocket the money have had the setting of the price—when places that help to make it so are as all the world knows some given and some sold by them a list of places of this sort which mr justice ashhurst or those to the right and left of him sell directly or indirectly aboveboard or under the rose with the profits of each and how they arise would be no unedifying account but where is the parliament that will call for it what comes then into their own pockets heavy as the expense falls upon the poor suitor is nothing in comparison of what they see shared among their brethren of the trade—their patrons and bottlecompanions and relations and dependents ten thousand ayear the average gains of a firstrate counsellor and attorneys in proportion three hundred pounds the least fee that is ever taken for going from one circuit to the next three or four such fees earned sometimes in a day—country attorneys town attorneys and attorneys with purchased places attached to particular courts—conveyancers special pleaders equitydraughtsmen opening counsel and silkgownsmen—all separate and not unfrequently all to fee in the same cause when mr justice was a counsellor he would never take less than a guinea for doing anything nor less than half a one for doing nothing he durst not if he would among lawyers moderation would be infamy why is it that in a court called a court of equity they keep a man his whole life in hot water while they are stripping him of his fortune take one cause out of a thousand ten appointments have i known made for so many distinct days before a sort of judge they call a master before one of them has been kept three is the common course and as soon as everybody is there the hour is at an end and away they go again why because for every appointment the master has his fee some of these law places are too good to be left to the gift even of judges of these which bring in thousands upon thousands ayear the plunder goes to dukes and earls and viscounts whose only trouble is to receive† it as if law were not yet dear enough—as if there were not men enough trodden down so low as not to be within its protection session after session the king is made to load the proceedings with taxes denying justice to all who have not withal to pay them all this in the teeth of magna charta we will deny justice—says king john—we will sell justice to no man—this was the wicked king john how does the good king george he denies it to ninetynine men out of a hundred and sells it to the hundredth the lies and nonsense the law is stuffed with form so thick a mist that a plain man nay even a man of sense and learning who is not in the trade can see neither through nor into it and though they were to give him leave to plead his own or his friends cause which they wont do in nine cases out of ten     he would not be able to open his mouth for want of having bestowed the twenty years lucubrations which they owned were necessary to enable a man to see to the bottom of it and that when there was not a twentieth part in it of what there is at present when an action for example is brought against a man how do you think they contrive to give him notice to defend himself sometimes he is told that he is in jail sometimes that he is lurking up and down the country in company with a vagabond of the name of doe though all the while he is sitting quietly by his own fireside and this my lord chief justice sets his hands to at other times they write to a man who lives in cumberland or cornwall and tell him that if he does not appear in westminster hall on a certain day he forfeits an hundred pounds when he comes so far from having anything to say to him they wont hear him for all they want him for is to grease their fingers thats law and now you shall see equity have you a question to ask the defendant for no court of law will so much as let you ask him whether his handwriting be his own you must begin by telling him how the matter stands though your very reason for asking him is your not knowing how fares it with truth all this while commanded or forbidden according as a man is plaintiff or defendant if you are a defendant and tell lies you are punished for it if you are plaintiff and will not tell lies you lose your cause† they wont so much as send a question to be tried by a jury till they have made you say you have laid a wager about it though wagers they tell you are illegal this is a finer sort of law they call equity—a distinction as unheardof out of england as it is useless here to every purpose but that of delaying justice and plundering those who sue for it have you an estate to sell sometimes you must acknowledge it to belong to somebody else sometimes see it taken from you by the judges who give it to somebody else with an order upon the crier of the court to give you such another though had it been given to your heirs for ever you might have sold it without all this trouble is this specimen to your mind my countrymen the law is the same all over enemies to truth because truth is so to them they do what in them lies to banish her from the lips and from the hearts of the whole people not an atom of this rubbish will they ever suffer to be cleared away how can you expect they should it serves them as a fence to keep out interlopers ashhurst—ii the law of this country only lays such restraints on the actions of individuals as are necessary for the safety and good order of the community at large truth—i sow corn partridges eat it and if i attempt to defend it against the partridges i am fined or sent to jail‡ all this for fear a great man who is above sowing corn should be in want of partridges the trade i was born to is overstocked hands are wanting in another if i offer to work at that other i may be sent to jail for it why because i have not been working at it as an apprentice for seven years whats the consequence that as there is no work for me in my original trade i must either come upon the parish or starve there is no employment for me in my own parish there is abundance in the next yet if i offer to go there i am driven away why because i might become unable to work one of these days and so i must not work while i am able i am thrown upon one parish now for fear i should fall upon another forty or fifty years hence at this rate how is work ever to get done if a man is not poor he wont work and if he is poor the laws wont let him how then is it that so much is done as is done as pockets are picked—by stealth and because the law is so wicked that it is only here and there that a man can be found wicked enough to think of executing it pray mr justice how is the community you speak of the better for any of these restraints and where is the necessity of them and how is safety strengthened or good order benefited by them but these are three out of this thousand not one of them exists in france lawyers are very busy just now in prosecuting men for libels these prosecutions i suppose are among the wholesome restraints mr justice thinks so necessary for us what neither mr justice ashhurst nor mr justice anybodyelse has ever done or ever will do is to teach us how we are to know what is from what is not a libel one thing they are all agreed in—at least all among them who have had any hand in making this part of the law—that if what they call a libel is all true and can be proved to be so instead of being the less it is the more libellous the heavier too the charge of course the worse the libel so that the more wickedly a judge or minister behaves the surer he is of not hearing of it this we get by leaving it to judges to make law and of all things the law of libels protection for the thief punishment for him who looks over the hedge—oh my dear countrymen i fear this paper is a sad libel there is so much truth in it     i know of a young couple who had £  000 between them and who could not get married till they had given up £  00 of it the lawyers bill for the writings came to that money you mr justice ashhurst who know so well what is orderly and what disorderly tell us which is most disorderly—truth industry or marriage ashhurst—iii happily for us we are not bound by any laws but such as are ordained by the virtual consent of the whole kingdom truth—virtual mr justice—what does that mean real or imaginary by none do you mean but such as are ordained by the real consent of the whole kingdom the whole kingdom knows the contrary is the consent then an imaginary one only a fine thing indeed to boast of happily for you said muley ishmael once to the people of morocco happily for you you are bound by no laws but what have your virtual consent for they are all made by your virtual representative and i am he look at this law my friends and you will soon see what share the consent of the whole kingdom has in the making of it half of it is called statute law and is made by parliament and how small a part of the whole kingdom has anything to do with choosing parliament you all know the other half is called common law and is made—how do you think by mr justice ashhurst and co without king parliament or people a rare piece of work is not it you have seen a sample of it i say by the judges and them only by twelve of them or by four of them or by one of them just as it happens and you shall presently see how this same law they vow and swear one and all from coke to blackstone is the perfection of reason the reason of which you are at no great loss to see their cant is that they only declare it they dont make it not they who then not parliament for then it would be not common law but statute ashhurst—iv happily for us we are not bound by any laws but such as every man has the means of knowing in other words— every man has the means of knowing all the laws he is bound by truth—scarce any man has the means of knowing a twentieth part of the laws he is bound by both sorts of law are kept most happily and carefully from the knowledge of the people statute law by its shape and bulk common law by its very essence it is the judges as we have seen that make the common law do you know how they make it just as a man makes laws for his dog when your dog does anything you want to break him of you wait till he does it and then beat him for it this is the way you make laws for your dog and this is the way the judges make law for you and me they wont tell a man beforehand what it is he should not do—they wont so much as allow of his being told they lie by till he has done something which they say he should not have done and then they hang him for it what way then has any man of coming at this doglaw only by watching their proceedings by observing in what cases they have hanged a man in what cases they have sent him to jail in what cases they have seized his goods and so forth these proceedings they wont publish themselves and if anybody else publishes them it is what they call a contempt of court and a man may be sent to jail for it if then you can be in the four westminster hall courts and the twelve circuit courts and a hundred other such places at once—if you can hear everything and forget nothing—if the whole kingdom can squeeze itself into a place contrived on purpose that it may hold none but lawyers—if it can live in those places for ever and has always lived in them—the whole kingdom may have that knowledge which mr justice says it has of the law and then it will have no further difficulty than to guess what inference the judge or judges will make from all this knowledge in each case counsellors who have nothing better to do watch these cases as well as they can and set them down in their notebooks to make a trade of them and so if you want to know whether a bargain you want to make for example will stand good you must go with a handful of guineas in your hand and give half of them to an attorney for him to give tother half to a counsellor and when he has told you all is right out comes a counsellor of the other side with a case of his own taking which his brother knew nothing of which shows you were in the wrong box and so you lose your money some of them to drive a penny run the risk of being sent to jail and publish their notebooks which they call reports but this is as it happens and a judge hears a case out of one of these reportbooks or says it is good for nothing and forbids it to be spoken of as he pleases how should plain men know what is law when judges cannot tell what it is themselves more than a hundred years ago lord chiefjustice hale had the honesty to confess he could not so much as tell what theft was which however did not prevent his     hanging men for theft there was then no statute law to tell us what is or what is not theft no more is there to this day and so it is with murder and libel and a thousand other things particularly the things that are of the most importance miserable says that great lord coke miserable is the slavery of that people among whom the law is either unsettled or unknown which then do you think is the sort of law which the whole host of lawyers from coke himself down to blackstone have been trumpeting in preference that very sort of bastard law i have been describing to you which they themselves call the unwritten law which is no more made than it is written—which has not so much as a shape to appear in—not so much as a word which anybody can say belongs to it—which is everywhere and no where—which come from nobody and is addressed to nobody—and which so long as it is what it is can never by any possibility be either known or settled how should lawyers be otherwise than fond of this brat of their own begetting or how should they bear to part with it it carries in its hand a rule of wax which they twist about as they please—a hook to lead the people by the nose and a pair of sheers to fleece them with the french have had enough of this doglaw they are turning it as fast as they can into statute law that everybody may have a rule to go by nor do they ever make a law without doing all they can think of to let every creature among them know of it the french have done many abominable things but is this one of them have you a mind my countrymen to see two faces under one hood hear two juries charged—a grand jury and a petty—gentlemen of the grand jury you and everybody may know what the law is if you please you are bound by none that you have not the means of knowing—gentlemen of the petty jury the fact is all you ever have to do with it is our business to say what the law is for say what you will it is impossible that you should know anything about the matter this was the language of mr justice and his brethren till parliament tother day in spite of their teeth taught them a better lesson—god bless the parliament—no doglaw—parliament for ever mind this teacher of peace and subordination according to him if there are any laws which are made otherwise than with the consent of the whole kingdom or that every man has not the means of knowing we are not bound by them and this he calls a happiness for us† god ever keep us from such happiness bad as the law is and badly as it is made it is the tie that holds society together were it ten times as bad if possible it would still be better than none obey it we must or everything we hold dear would be at end obey it we must but to obey it must we not know it and shall they whose business it is to make and obey it be suffered to keep it from us any longer now i will tell you my dear countrymen what mr justice knows better things than to tell you how it is that what he would make you believe about every man being his own lawyer might be made true if what there is good of common law were turned into statute if what is common in both to every class of persons were put into one great book it need not be a very great one and what is particular to this and that class of persons were made into so many little books so that every man should have what belongs to him apart without being loaded with what does not belong to him if the general lawbook were read through in churches and put into boys hands and made into exercises when they are at school and if every boy when he came of age were to produce a copy of it written with his own hand before he were allowed a vote or any other privilege and if this general lawbook contained a complete list of the particular ones and measures were taken for putting them and each of them into each mans hand as soon as the occasion happened which gave him a concern in it but then the matter of these lawbooks must be made up into sentences of moderate length such as men use in common conversation and such as the laws are written in in france with no more words than necessary not like the present statutes in which i have seen a single sentence take up thirteen such pages as would fill a reasonable volume and not finished after all and which are stuffed with repetitions and words that are of no use that the lawyers who draw them may be the better paid for them just like their deeds such as you may see in any attorneys office each filling from one to a hundred skins of parchment long enough to reach the breadth or the length of westminster hall all which stuff you must carry in your mind at once if you would make head or tail of it for it makes altogether but one sentence so well do they understand the art of poisoning language in order to fleece their clients all which deeds might be drawn not only more intelligibly but surer in short sentences and in a twentieth part of the room a complete set of them might be adapted to all occasions to which there are any adapted of those at present in use and would have been drawn years     ago had there been any hope of seeing them made use of now god bless our good king george preserve and purify the parliament keep us from french republicans and levellers save what is worth saving mend what wants mending and deliver us out of the clutches of the harpies of the law a card to john reeves esq barrister at law chiefjustice of upper canada chairman of the society calling itself the society for preserving liberty and property against republicans and levellers held at the crown and anchor tavern in the strand mr reeves says he knows the english law and that he knows the spirit of it he has written the history of it in four volumes he ought to know it he ought to know whether what is here said of it is true he knows this charge of mr justice ashhurst he says it breathes the spirit of the english law he ought to know this charge and what spirit it breathes he adopts it he trumpets it he circulates it he says it is suited to curb the licentious spirit of the times and so well suited that it must be read with heartfelt satisfaction by every true englishman what is thought suited to produce an effect does not always produce it in one instance at least this charge instead of curbing has had the effect of provoking a spirit which it would be nothing wonderful if mr reeves were to deem licentious whether the spirit thus provoked has less in it of the spirit of a true englishman of a friend to subordination as well as good government—to strict as well as rational obedience than the spirit of those who wrote or those who answer for and trumpet forth this charge the reader may determine mr reeves will see this comment on it he will see whether there is any thing in this comment that he can controvert if he can and will he who wrote it is ready to defend it and if mr reeves makes that a condition to set his name to the defence mr reeves is amongst other things a judge and receives money for administering justice to canada instead of that he stays at home makes parties and circulates papers that deny and protect the abuses of the law how is this is it that justice is useless to canada or that mr reeves is useless to justice london december         note at the conclusion it is not altogether without compunction that this conclusion is suffered to stand so striking is the contrast which according to all accounts the intrepidity and gentleness manifested by this gentleman in the execution of a justly odious office has since been seen forming with the atrocity displayed in the creation and preservation of it next to the noncreation or abolition of the alien office would have been the keeping the powers of it in the hands of mr reeves—august                 the king against edmonds and others set down for trial at warwick on the   th of march    0 brief remarks tending to show the untenability of this indictment by jeremy bentham esq bencher of lincolns inn first published in    0   0 to the jurymen of warwickshire perhaps also to those of cheshire and such other persons whom it may concern queenssquare place westminster march       0 fellowcountrymen from the public prints i understand that antecedently to the late trial of sir francis burdett at leicester the jurymen or some of them had received an anonymous letter having reference to that trial and that that letter had been spoken of as a threatening one this paper is not anonymous and there are no threats in it that which to the purposes of substantial justice is of real and undeniable importance is—that those persons from whom the decision comes should have had before them whatsoever information may be of a nature to secure the justice and propriety of that decision those things which are of no importance to those same purposes are—the hands from which the information comes and the forms which accompany the delivery of it if in the mode of delivery there were anything of partiality or surprise—if of alleged facts communication were made without their having been subjected to the requisite tests employed as securities for trustworthiness thus far the mode of delivery might be censurable whatsoever credence if any were eventually given to the alleged facts in the delivery of the following paper care has been taken that no such partiality or surprise shall have place copies will be delivered not only to all persons who shall have been regarded as likely to be among the jurymen for the trial of this cause but to attorneys and counsel on both sides and even to the judge as to alleged matter of fact capable of operating in the way of evidence no such thing will the paper be found to contain in it with the exception of what relates to the state of libel law in the united states and that only in the way of illustration the rest is all of it matter of mere argument grounded on the state of english law as applied to no other than notorious facts whatever if any may be the guilt of this address the defendants in this cause are completely innocent of it not through any of their hands will it pass to any others with no one of them has any communication on the subject ever been made by me by no one of them is it any more expected than by any other person who will receive it jeremy bentham     brief remarks c a prosecution more palpably groundless than this upon the very face of it may be seen to be surely was never instituted in no part of it is any specific and determinate criminal act so much as charged this is the main thing to be shown and for the purpose of the individual prosecution in question this would be abundantly sufficient but worded as it is even if there were ever so many specific and determinate criminal acts not only alleged but proved still without an incontestable violation of the jurymans oath no verdict of guilty could be pronounced upon it of the proof that will be seen of this proposition the use looks much further even the proof would be found perhaps to apply to every indictment that for centuries past has ever been preferred the use will be seen to apply to every one that will be preferred unless kept clear from the foul spots which will here be brought to view i to begin with those grounds of acquittal which apply more particularly to this individual indictment not but that those of them which are of most extensive importance would be found to have a not less proper and pointed application to another which is said to be set down for trial on the same circuit namely that of the king against sir charles wolseley baronet and joseph harrison set down to be tried at chester assizes commencing on the  th of april in the same year    0   first then as to those grounds of acquittal which apply in a particular manner to this one individual prosecution as characterized by the bill of indictment on which the above defendants are about to be tried in this indictment i observe no fewer than nine distinct counts all that is material i observe to be comprehended in the first of them the enormous quantity of surplusage of which the matter of the others is composed—surplusage consisting of repetitions and distinctions without differences may serve to indicate the character of the prosecution but unless in the way above alluded to and which will be hereinafter particularized adds nothing to the demand for acquittal and with this remark may accordingly be dismissed in the indictment in the king against wolseley as above there are but two counts in the general character of the offence it differs not from this with equal propriety might the matter of the seven counts with which this is loaded have been stuffed into that and if the second count in it may be set down to the account of surplusage still the quantity of vexation and expense thereby manufactured in that instance will not be more than oneeighth of the quantity manufactured in this if throughout the whole field of thought and action there be any such things as innoxious and irreproachable acts surely those which are here charged as criminal will upon the very face of the charge be seen to be of that number to begin with the act which forms the characteristic article in the cluster of imputed crimes it consists in the appointment of an agent who under the denomination of legislatorial attorney shall it is intended claim—claim by letter to the speaker—admission into the house of commons in the character of member for the town of birmingham well—and in this what is there that is criminal on receipt of this letter the speaker either gives the admission demanded or he does not if yes here at any rate is no crime unless the speaker is an accomplice in it if no what is the consequence the legislatorial attorney takes his departure and there the business ends was it to force his way in that he was to be sent—to force himself in or to be forced in by others this is not so much as insinuated what claim at the hands of law or government was ever made that might not with as fair a colour of justice have been charged upon a man as a crime as to the thing claimed— claim of a seat in the house as preferred by petition in any the most ordinary mode claim of a pew in a church claim of a seat in a government or other public office claim of an apartment in a private house as to the mode of claiming it— in the case of the seat motion for quo warranto information to try the right of certain descriptions of electors or action at law aiming more or less directly at that same object in the other cases action of ejectment action of trespass or other action or suit of the most ordinary complexion as the case may be so much as to the end in view and the     last in the list of the means by which the accomplishment of that end is alleged to have been aimed at equally clear it will be that upon the face of the charge there was nothing at all criminal in any of the anterior means employed in relation to that same end here however if nothing criminal is charged something of a criminal complexion seems to be insinuated a large number is assigned as the number of the persons who on the occasion in question for the purpose in question were assembled—a large number and from the mere magnitude of the number the criminality of intention is required to be inferred that number is twenty thousand or more twenty thousand well and if twice twenty thousand what then not as yet was that law in existence under which the number of persons standing in the presence of each other without any evil act or perceptible evil intention has been made to constitute an offence twenty thousand well—and suppose it had been two hundred thousand of the multitudinousness of it what would have been the effect no mischief in any assignable shape having ensued the greater the multitude the clearer and stronger the proof of the innoxiousness of everything that was intended to be done why because the greater the multitude prepared to cooperate in a scheme of mischief the greater the facility for the accomplishment of it these were the means no power of resistance anywhere these were the irresistible means of mischief and no mischief done or attempted towards any such attempt not any the least preparation made instead of proof of mischievous intention here surely is as complete proof of the absence of all mischievous intention as it is possible to conceive well but something more is charged as having been intended and something more is charged as having actually been done the other things charged as intended—as being the things for the doing of which the meeting was brought about and took place are—the procuring the adoption of the assembly for certain written discourses alleged copies of which are accordingly set forth the things charged as done are—the giving the desired adoption to those same written discourses and the delivery of certain spoken speeches having for their object the obtaining of that adoption as to the written or printed discourses—of the accuracy of the alleged copies the defendants surely supposing them even to have just ground could scarcely as it should seem find any motive for starting a doubt in any one of them if there be anything criminal then of every newspaper that has been published for the last half century to go no further the publication has been a crime on this supposition unless it be in the way of undiscriminating praise nothing that in that time has been published on the subject of the constitution or any part of it can have been published without a crime remain the speeches alleged to have been spoken—spoken without having on the part of the speakers been committed to writing and of which accordingly no alleged copies are set forth these of course—for what could be easier than to say so—were seditious malicious inflammatory—in a word everything that was bad well this is what is said of them but the alleged speeches themselves of which all this is said what were they oh this is what the defendants were not to be permitted to know they might have questioned the evidence they might have opposed it by counter evidence they might have questioned the inferences they might have opposed them by arguments accordingly of these the tenor is not so much as professed to be given nothing but what is called the substance as to this alleged substance it so happens that i have not as yet obtained information what it was but what matters it for words alleged to have been spoken to the prejudice of an individual no action can be maintained unless the very words are set forth no action of which the worst result to the defendant is mere pecuniary loss in the present case to pecuniary loss to any amount may be added imprisonment to any amount as to these discourses written and spoken together suppose for argument sake there had been anything criminal in them if justice as well as vengeance had been the object they would would they not have been made the only matter of the indictment to add to them those other acts and designs which are so plainly clear of all criminality what better object can it have had than that of causing lawful actions to be confounded with unlawful ones confounded in the minds of the jury confounded in the sentence of the judge well then—in no one of all the acts here charged—in no one of them supposing them all proved—is anything either criminal or so much as in any way improper to be found on what then can have rested any hopes that may have been entertained of seeing the accusation followed by conviction on nothing but certain other imputations of supposed intention imputations in regard to which let it be judged whether they can have had their origin in any other source than the passions by which the prosecution was produced now then as to these ulterior alleged original intentions what are they     intentions yea and conspiracy to produce certain undesirable effects of a general description at indefinitely distant periods as to the conspiracy this will be considered by and by as to the undesirable effects they are—   discontent and disaffection in the minds of the liege subjects and so forth hatred and contempt of the government and constitution of this realm as by law established as to the contempt let it suffice to observe that from persons in the one situation towards persons in the other the existence of any such sentiment not being possible in any instance could not be possible in that instance hatred in any quantity yes but towards any man on whose will he sees his fate dependent no man who was in his senses ever entertained any such sentiment as contempt contempt on account of this or that particular feature in the others character yes but this is nothing to the purpose by no such particular contempt so long as fear remains can contempt to any practical purpose be constituted ferdinand the embroiderer was contemned yes but ferdinand the torturer was he the less feared remain discontent disaffection and hatred but these what are they but shades of one and the same sentiment call it what you will emotion passion affection or state of mind on a charge of this sort suppose a verdict of guilty to be pronounced and an uniform series of such verdicts for such a cause assured—consider what would be the consequence what is called the liberty of the press would thenceforward be not merely useless but much worse than useless supposing misrule to have place newspapers instead of being a check upon it would be exclusively an instrument of it and a support to it liberty of exposing it no liberty of justifying it and praising it oh yes full liberty and gain too into the bargain such if the system here pursued be constantly acted upon—such it will be seen will be the liberty of the press at this time behold already the system of libel law brought out in all its perfection first came this and the other indictments then as if in acknowledgment of their insufficiency and untenability came the statutes in which the same principle is adopted is applied to practice and is made to receive the sanction of the legislature the legislature—including that house by which its own acknowledged corruptions are thus defended against all possibility of remedy the principle is—that in so far as the conduct of the men in power whoever they are is in question or the state into which by their conduct the rule of action in all its several parts has been brought—no discussion shall have place either in spoken speech or in writing—neither evidence nor argument shall be employed—on any other than one side and that side theirs in a word it may be styled the principle of despotism as applied to political discourse talk of liberty indeed so far as depends upon the definition of a libel whether made under that sort of law which is made by parliament or that sort of law which on pretence of being declared is made by judges—the liberty of praise always excepted see and judge whether in speaking of the conduct of government or of the members of government there be any more liberty in england not to speak of scotland than in morocco look first to the sort of law the judges make look to the great manufactory of the political branch of penal law—the kings bench to go no further back than the middle of the late reign—for this will be quite sufficient— look to the year      see what lord kenyon says i think this paper in the morning chronicle was published with a wicked malicious intent to vilify the government and to make the people discontented with the constitution under which they live that is the matter charged in the information that it was done with a view to vilify the constitution the laws and the government of this country and to infuse into the minds of his majestys subjects a belief that they were oppressed and on this ground i consider it as a gross and seditious libel look onwards now to   0  see what lord ellenborough says† if in so doing exhibiting the folly or imbecility of the members of the government individual feelings are violated there the line of interdiction begins and the offence becomes the subject of penal visitation—if individual feelings are violated—i e in plain english if on the part of any one of the persons so situated any uneasiness is in this way produced—as often as any written discourse productive of this effect is published every person instrumental in the publication is to be punished for it now if there be any sort of proof by which more than by any other a mans having experienced uneasiness from the cause in question is effectually demonstrated and put out of doubt it is surely the fact of his having imposed upon himself the expense and trouble and odium of prosecuting for it admit but this the consequence is as satisfactory as it is simple it is—that in every case of     libel on the members of the government the very act of prosecution is conclusive evidence of the guiltiness of the party prosecuted and a verdict of guilty ought to follow of course look back for a moment at lord kenyon speak but a word in any such view as that of infusing into the minds of his majestys subjects any such belief as that they are oppressed—the writing in which you say this is a gross libel and your punishment—or as the piety of lord ellenborough phrases it your visitation is of course proportionable now suppose for argument sake that in any one instance it has happened to these fortunate subjects or any one of them to have actually been oppressed is he to presume to take any such liberty as that of saying so no not if lord kenyon or lord ellenborough or one may almost venture to say lord anybody else in that place with their penal visitations can stop his mouth a constitution—a government—a set of laws under which if all men were oppressed to the uttermost no man could without being punishable dare to say that any men are oppressed—punishable in a way which to ninetenths or nineteentwentieths would be utter ruin—such in this country are the constitution the government the whole fabric of the laws according to the view so repeatedly and uniformly taken and given of them in the kings bench the more closely the nature and consequences of this doctrine are looked into the more clear will be our conception of the influence it can not but have on the character of the constitution on the goodness of the government on the condition of the people the more grinding the oppression exercised and the more flagitious the conduct of those who exercise it the more flagitious must according to this doctrine be the crime and the more excruciating the intended punishment of those who presume to bring to view all or any of these things as they are the more corrupt and tyrannical the state of the government—of the law—constitutional branch and other branches taken together—the more flagitious and unpardonable must be the crime of representing it to be what it is how should this be otherwise in so far as he has any regard for the public interest his own share in it included—the more highly detrimental to that interest any measure of government any arrangement of law any misconduct on the part of the members of the government or any one of these is—the more intense the displeasure which by the view of the imperfection in question will have been kindled in the mind of that man but the more highly detrimental it is in his own conception the more pernicious in so far as depends upon him and his report of it will it be in the conception of all such other persons to whom the conception he has formed in relation to it shall have come to be known to use the words of the indictment the more intense the discontent the disaffection the hatred produced by the oppression in the breast of any man who speaks of it the more anxious and industrious will he naturally be to communicate the like affections to others and the greater the number of those to whom in so far as he succeeds he will have communicated it but the more intense and extensive the displeasure thus seen to be excited as towards them the greater of course the injury done to the beings in question—to the beings of both sorts spoken of to the ideal beings above mentioned and to the real beings those members of government whose individual feelings be their conduct what it may are thus to be kept from violation at any price as to the constitution with its et ceteras the more tyrannical and corrupt it is the more justly and severely visitable will be the crime of him who has dared to speak of it as being what it is as to the oppressor whom it has bred and who in his turn upholds it the more flagitious the oppression he exercises has been the more flagitious and severely visitable is the oppressed individual who has dared to speak of him as being what he is not to speak of any other indictment—to profess to give effect to the principles acted upon by this indictment and by the statutes by which it has been followed—to profess this and at the same time to profess to allow to go unpunished any writer whatsoever who presumes in any way to question the propriety either of any part of the rule of action—real or imaginary—statute law or common law—or of the conduct of any one of the members of the government is surely a contradiction in terms say what you will if it be to any such effect what you say either has no tendency at all or it has that same forbidden and punishable tendency in saying it either you have no view at all or you have that same forbidden and punishable view discontent disaffection hatred—the objects—the affections indicated by these words—who does not see that these are but so many degrees in the scale of disapprobation or displeasure but in the words disapprobation and displeasure we have the names of an affection or emotion the degrees of which rise one above another in a scale the lowest point of which is at apathy and the highest at madness and of no one of these degrees is it possible for words to convey any such description as can enable a man to distinguish the place it occupies on the scale on this occasion or on that other occasion—in a word on any occasion—what is the degree     a man may be allowed to feel what is the degree a man may be allowed to endeavour to communicate by the same object by which one degree of disapprobation is produced in the breast of one man another degree will be produced in the breast of another in the same breast it will at one moment be at one degree at another moment at another will men allow of no written expression of disapprobation or displeasure whatsoever then without selfcontradiction in terms they cannot allow of complaint not to speak of remonstrances away go all petitions for redress here would be an improvement how commodiously by this means would the business of government be simplified yes could it but be accomplished but as yet that may be too much to look for will they then allow of any such expression let them then make known what the degrees are which they will allow and what those are which they will not allow let them make known what on each occasion are the degrees which they will allow to be felt what the degrees which they will allow to be expressed what the degrees which they will allow to be endeavoured to be excited and stirred up of these several degrees let them give such descriptions as shall render it possible at least for a man to know what degree he may on each occasion give expression to without being visited and what he may not give expression to without being visited let them in a word construct and along with the statutes at large expose to sale an appropriate pathological thermometer an instrument by which shall be indicated the degrees of mental caloric allowed to have place as being favourable to the health of the body politic as in an ordinary thermometer in a line with the word temperate the degree of physical caloric regarded as most favourable to the health of the body natural is indicated this done then and not before will be the time for visiting with justice and with effect discourses tending to the production of the undesirable sentiments affections and states of things indicated by the words discontent disaffection hatred and whatsoever other similar ones may be in store this not done they not only leave exposed to undue punishment the restless men who stand exposed to the temptation of thus offending but what is so much worse they leave their own high pleasure continually unfulfilled and their own individual and precious feelings as continually violated oh but says somebody when lord kenyon spoke of the published intent of vilifying the government and so forth and thereby of producing discontent as a thing not to be endured what his learned lordship meant was—not the presenting facts to view—facts whatever were their tendency—but comments—comments pouring down in scurrilous and offensive terms reproach upon the persons ideal or real and thus violating the feelings of the real ones so it was with lord kenyon and therefore so it was with lord ellenborough for these two were one alas sir comments were indeed in their lordships view but facts were not the less so facts were what they had in view the suppression of and that with still greater anxiety than any comments how reproachful soever that could be made on any such facts on prosecution for a libel whether by indictment or information if the libel be a political one if the persons struck at are members of the government is not the truth of the imputation according to all manufacturers of kingsbench law no justification nor so much as extenuation—according to some of them even an aggravation of the crime now then if we come to individual feelings and the things that violate them by what is it that they are likely to be most sensibly violated is it by mere words of empty reproach—words by which nothing else is proved but the anger which the utterer feels or would be thought to feel as towards the object against which they are uttered and from which any bad effect that is produced upon reputation is no less apt to attach upon the reputation of the party reviling than upon that of the party reviled is it by such empty sounds or is it by words by which determinate facts are brought to light—misdeeds by which in proportion to their enormity the reputation of the misdoer is soiled and depressed which would give you most uneasiness answer me whoever you are to be called a thief or to be proved to be one now then if i were a juror under any such indictment would i for anything that a man had been proved to have said either in speech or in writing against any of those exalted personages ideal or real on any such ground as that of an alleged tendency to produce discontent disaffection or hatred—would i join in a verdict of guilty not i indeed with pride—with selfish terror—with malignity—on benches or in houses—suppose the members of the government—suppose them mad—would it be for me to infect myself with their madness and concur in giving effect to it ah no rather would i do what depended upon me towards staying the plague instead of spreading it hatred is it not a contagious passion—from the harbourer and proclaimer is it not apt to pass to the object of the hate nay but says somebody you have been too hasty when you saw what lord chief justice lord kenyon said you should have seen what mr attorneygeneral said the     right of every man to represent what he may conceive to be an abuse or grievance in the government of the country can never be questioned alas sir this may satisfy you whoever you are but it cannot satisfy me in the first place it is only an attorneygeneral that says this but an attorneygeneral may say what he pleases and nothing comes of it he may say what he pleases nobody is bound by it not even he himself in this or any other way he may be as liberal as he pleases and all without expense but in bringing to view this essence of liberality one drop there is which you have omitted this drop is a parenthesis and by this parenthesis the effect of the including clause is reduced to—let anybody say what if his intention in so doing be honest says the qualifying clause—if his intention in so doing be honest and the statement made upon fair and open grounds thus far mr attorneygeneral unfortunately his the defendants intention never is honest the special pleader or other draughtsman takes care it never shall be he makes it seditious malicious and everything that is bad and this is matter of form these are words of course and though they were never true would of course be taken to be true then as to the fair and open grounds what are the grounds open to him not any matters of fact to produce anything of this sort would be to attempt to prove the truth of the libel which as hath been seen is never to be endured oh but what is this you would have us do would you have us destroy the government would you leave the government of the country without protection its reputation upon which its power is so perfectly dependent—would you leave that most valuable of its treasures without protection would you leave it in the power of every miscreant to destroy it in such a state of helplessness is it in the nature of things that government should anywhere subsist subsist oh yes everywhere and be all the better for it look to the united states there you see government do you not well there you see government and no libel law is there the existence of the supposed deficiency you shall see and where libel law is the article you will see how much better deficiency is than supply in answer to a letter of inquiry written by me not long since—the exact time is not material—here follows all that relates to this subject of a letter written by a person whose competence to give the most authentic and in every respect trustworthy information on this subject is not to be exceeded— prior to what was commonly called the sedition act there never was any such thing known under the federal government of the united states in some of the individual states they have sometimes i believe taken place as a criminal prosecution for a political libel the sedition act was passed by congress in july      it expired by its own limitation in march   0  there were a few prosecutions under it whilst it was in force it was as you have intimated an unpopular law the party that passed it went out of power by a vote of the nation in march   0  there has been no prosecution for a political libel under the authority of the government of the united states since that period no law known to the united states would authorize such a prosecution during the last war the measures of the government were assailed by the party in opposition with the most unbounded and furious licence no prosecution for libel ever followed the government trusted to public opinion and to the spontaneous counteracting publications from among the people themselves for the refutation of libels the general opinion was that the public arm grew stronger in the end by this course i send you a volume of the laws of the united states containing the sedition act in question it will be found at page    ch    you will observe a departure from the common law in that it allowed a defendant to avail himself of the truth of the charges contained in the publication thus much for my authority whose name i cannot at this instant take upon me to make public this same sedition act pity it is that the necessary limits of the present paper forbid the insertion of it another occasion may be more favourable it will then be seen how complete the proof it gives of the needlessness and thence of the uncompensated mischievousness not only of our libel law—imported as it was from the starchamber by a single judge of king james or king charless making the lord coke—but of every one of the six new laws made by his most excellent majesty that now is with the advice of his ever faithful lords and commons made for the defence of everything that is rich and powerful supported by the whole body of the constituted authorities and an army of  00000 men against the attacks of perhaps as many unarmed men supported by their wives and children think not that—because if the reputation of an individual were left without protection at the hands of the judges it would be a defect in the laws—it would be a like defect if the reputation of the government—the ideal being or that of the members of government the real beings—were left in the same unprotected state     the individual would in such a case be exposed to injustice—the government the member of government in this same case is not exposed to any injustice he is not even under the government of the united states with its frugal means much less would he be under the government of this country with its unbounded means against attacks on reputation of the whole number of individuals it is but a small proportion that have any tolerably adequate means of defending themselves money in no small quantity is requisite for such defence in this shape as well as every other the means which government has are absolutely without limit an individual—be it ever so completely unjust it is a chance whether the attack upon his reputation finds him adequately prepared for his defence government—the members of government as such—are or might be and ought to be in a state of constant preparation for defence against every attack to which they stand exposed whatsoever inconvenience in consequence of any attack made upon his reputation it happens to an individual to sustain he remains without compensation for unless it be at the expense of the defamer the member of government—no inconvenience from any such cause can he sustain that he is not amply compensated for and beforehand he is paid for it in most instances in money as well as in power he is paid for it in all instances in power to the individual it may happen to have no other individual for support in any shape the member of the government has every other for his support in every shape we come now to the word conspire this word it will be seen has been thrown in as a makeweight separately or jointly its two accompaniments—combine and confederate—would not have sufficed to combine and to confederate is no more than in the language of the chancery branch of lawyers trash each defendant does with every other if the draughtsman by whom it is penned by authority of the lord chancellor who calls this equity is to be believed as to that which they the present defendants combined and confederated to do—whether any the slightest shade of guiltiness legal or moral be to be found in it has already been seen but some other word was to be introduced at any rate some word by which in this case as in any other a colour of guilt might be laid on a ground of innocence the word conspire was looked out and added for the purpose yet even with the aid of this word how is the case of the prosecution mended in the language of poetry to whom can it be unknown all manner of delightful persons as well as things are continually conspiring to produce the most delightful effects in the language of poetry yes and of ornamental nay even of ordinary prose thus far then no great progress is made by the addition but to conspire the verb has for one of its kindred its conjugates as the logicians phrase is conspiracy the substantive conspiracy yes and conspirator to boot but the sort of combinations to which the word conspiracy has been wont to be applied have very commonly been mischievous ones—extensively as well as intensely mischievous ones conspirators the actors in these combinations mischievous and therefore so far not only actually but justly odious men as to the word conspiracy into the body of the indictment itself the learning of the learned scribe has not suggested or at any rate has not produced the insertion of it but in a criminal calendar—at any rate in a court newspaper or in a placard—it was capable of being made—in fact it has been made—to serve at this moment trial of hunt and others for a conspiracy is to be seen in placards and the men of cato street—their name is it not everywhere the conspirators now of all this abuse of words what was the object the same as in the instance of those other words of reproach which have already been brought to view—the words malicious seditious and illdisposed by exciting and inflaming the passions—the angry passions—in the breasts of jurymen to lead astray their judgment and cause them to say and fancy they see guiltiness where nothing is really to be seen but the purest innocence in this endeavour such as it was no wonder if it was among the expectations of the lawyers for the prosecution to find themselves seconded and supported by judges in the manufacturing of that spurious article which they have to so unbounded an extent succeeded in palming upon the people under the name of law—even common law—among the instruments which the westminsterhall judges with the lawbookmakers their confederates have for so many ages been employing—have been an assortment of words and phrases to which after taking them out of the body of the language native or foreign they have on each occasion though on every occasion without explanation or warning attached whatsoever meaning presented itself as being best suited to the professional and official purpose great would be the instruction—not small one day perhaps the use—would any intelligent and benevolent hand bring together and lay before the public with apt comments the complete assortment of them meantime in addition to the present word conspiracy take for a sample the word libel to which may be added contra bonos mores blasphemy and malice     the more extensive and indeterminate the import attached to the word in the state in which they found it the better it was found to be for that same purpose for the more indeterminate its import the less the risk they ran of seeing on the part of juries discernment and firmness sufficient to detect and frustrate any such misapplication as the purpose required should be made of it now in regard to the word conspiracy from a slight sketch of the history of the law on this subject no small instruction may be derived along with the perfect groundlessness of the accusation in this not to speak of so many other indictments preferred in pursuance of the same system may be seen as a corollary a specimen of the manner in which the business of legislation has at all times and to so vast an extent been carried on and the formalities of parliamentary procedure thus far saved by a few nominees of the crown acting in the character of judges in its original physical sense to conspire a word of latin origin meant to breathe together in the original psychological sense it meant to cooperate more particularly in the way of discourse towards any purpose whatsoever good bad or indifferent these were its original senses but from or along with the verb to conspire came the substantive conspiracy and from the earliest times though the sense of the verb still continues to be unrestricted by any limitation on either side the substantive for anything that appears has never been employed in any other than that narrower sense which is termed a bad sense in this bad sense it means cooperating more particularly in the way of discourse to a supposed mischievous or on any other account forbidden or disapproved of purpose for the designation of a particular act or mode of conduct for the purpose of its being dealt with as a crime—the earliest use made of this word may be seen plainly enough in the law books the species of act is that which may be termed juridical vexation the applying to the purpose of injustice those powers which in profession at least are never given with any other intent than that they should be employed in the furtherance of justice now mind the misapplication the confusion and the unbounded power exercised under favour of it in regard to any act that has been dealt with as criminal the species of the act is one thing the number of the persons cooperating in the performance of it is another and widely different thing manifestly not to any one species of act exclusively but to every species of act whatsoever is the circumstance of number in this way applicable from this circumstance to deduce a denomination applied exclusively to the designation of one particular sort of act accompanied with an intimation of its having been or being about to be dealt with as an offence was surely a course as ill adapted as can well be conceived to the ends of language what can be more inconsistent with clear conception—what can be more amply productive of confusion—than the manufacturing a name for a particular species of offence out of a circumstance equally apt to have place in every species of offence be this as it may the species of offence which has been mentioned namely juridical vexation is the species of offence to the designation of which the word conspiracy was applied in the first instance this was as early as the reign of edward the first of this mode of working vexation and injury—of this or something scarcely distinguishable from it—cognizance in the way of penal prohibition may be seen taken by statute law as long ago as the reign of that same monarch year of his reign    year of our lord   0  thus it is that of the vast fabric which under the name of conspiracy may be seen reared by judges the first stone though no more than the first stone was laid by the legislature of a prosecution for this cause at common law an example occurs as early as the reign of henry vii† from that time down to the early part of the present reign thinly scattered in a space of nearer to five than four centuries reckoning from the time of the above statute are to be seen at the rate of not so many as one to a century instances of the application made of this word to the creation of new crimes of crimes having nothing in common either with the one first created or with each other except this same accidental and so completely uncharacteristic circumstance it was by lord mansfield that the example was set of giving to this word such an extension as should render it applicable to the purpose of affording a ground for the inflicting of punishment on the score of any act the contemplation of which should have produced in the mind of the judge a desire to cause punishment to fall upon the heads of the persons concerned in it when exercised by a mans sole authority without any other man either to say nay to the whole or to narrow the extent of it by limitations and exceptions—legislation is at once a quick and pleasant work first to move to bring in a bill then if leave be given to bring it in and then defend it not only against rejection but against amendment—defend it in person in one house and by proxy if procurable in another—is a tedious     process of the inconvenience of the latter mode no judge especially if to a seat on bench he adds a seat in house fails of being sufficiently sensible no man was ever more acutely and efficiently sensible than lord mansfield occasion happening to present itself he passed in this commonlaw form a dictum having the force and virtue of an act of parliament creating an entire new species of conspiracy consisting in the act of selling unwholesome provisions meaning doubtless as and for wholesome ones but to the only sort of wrongdoing act the punishment of which had under the denomination of conspiracy had the warrant of the legislature it bore no more resemblance as anybody may see than the most dissimilar act that could be named following the example of his illustrious predecessor it was but as it were the other day that lord ellenborough in the course of his reign passed another act of common law erecting the offence of endeavouring to raise or lower the price of government annuities by means of false reports into another species of conspiracy what is plainly useful and perfectly proper is—that the doing injury to the health of individuals known or unknown by means of unwholesome provisions if sold as wholesome should be made punishable what is no less so is—that the obtaining or seeking to obtain a profit by causing the price current of property in the shape of government annuities or in any other shape to rise or fall by means of false reports spread for the purpose should be made punishable it is one means of obtaining or seeking to obtain money by false pretences a species of fraud the proper name of which is not unknown having long been employed in statute law but so long as the people have the effectual filling of a seat in parliament though it were but a single seat it is very far from useful or proper that by a nominally independent but in reality everaspiring and everdependent creature of the crown who by his obsequiousness to highseated will on a small scale at the bar has been exalted and engaged to practise obsequiousness to that same will on a vast scale on a bench—that by any man so situated the conjunct power of king lords and commons should be exercised is very far from being either useful or proper even though it were to the best of all imaginable purposes for it is by applying it thus to good purposes that in those situations men acquire that power which as surely it has been made their interest it has been their practice to apply to the very worst of purposes thus plainly untenable on every ground of law as well as reason is the attempt made in the present instance to fix upon the defendants the charge of conspiracy in the character of a legally punishable crime not equally so would be an indictment if preferred against the several persons concerned in the institution and prosecution of the present indictment setting aside the very few innovations above mentioned and those so many palpable aberrations there would remain—for the original and sole commonlaw offence acknowledged as such in a series of cases covering a space of several centuries—the offence of juridical vexation and that commonlaw offence having as hath been seen its warrant in statute law—there would remain i say this offence coupled with the circumstance that persons more than one have been concerned in the infliction of it in addition to the vexation or though it were but the intention to produce it to invest the offence in the most unexceptionable manner with the appellation of a conspiracy requires nothing more than this—namely that the prosecution was groundless or at the utmost nothing more than on the part of the offenders the consciousness of its being groundless for upon the face of the book nothing more than the mere groundlessness appears to have been uniformly required not even the consciousness in the present instance who on this supposition would be the conspirators to know exactly what the course is which in this respect the business has taken has not fallen within my competence but for the title conferred by this word the following persons present themselves as candidates—  the learned counsel employed as counsel for the crown on the trial   the solicitor of the treasury or any other person employed as attorney in the prosecution   the special pleader or other learned penman by whom the indictment was drawn up   his majestys attorneygeneral and his majestys solicitorgeneral if it is by or with the advice of those great functionaries that the prosecution has been instituted and carried on   the lords commissioners of his majestys treasury if it was by their order that the prosecution was instituted   the members of that select body of his majestys privy council which is distinguished by the name of the cabinet council if it was with them that the business originated or if it be through them that it has passed but this indictment is but one out of a number of indictments all of them results of so many sets of acts performed in execution of the same general design treating on the footing of a punishable offence every endeavour which by persons acting elsewhere than in parliament shall have been made towards the obtaining of any change in the representation of the people in parliament construing   0 every such endeavour into a crime and thus in case of any imperfection in the mode of that representation rendering that imperfection for ever remediless in case of any system of oppression or depredation or other national grievance growing as a necessary effect out of such imperfections rendering all redress of any such grievance for ever hopeless oh but our oaths our oaths perish liberty perish the country we must not we will not violate our oaths well then my fellowcountrymen if such be your determination on no account to violate your oaths i desire nothing better this leads me to the circumstances which if in the present charge there were matter ever so plainly criminal—and ever so much of it and all of it proved—would in this case not to speak of other cases suffice to render it impossible for a jury consistently with their oaths to concur in a verdict of guilty of whatsoever there will be to say in proof of this position the ground is constituted by this uncontrovertible assumption—namely that it is not consistent with their oaths for a jury to declare their belief of anything which in their eyes has not been sufficiently proved by the evidence that has been before them still less their belief in the truth of any position of the falsity of which they have no doubt and therefore if so it be that whenever to constitute an offence as described in the indictment the concurrence of every one of a number of circumstances therein stated is required—then and in that case if of the whole number of these circumstances there be any one which either had manifestly no existence or what comes to the same thing has not been proved to have been in existence no defendant can consistently with the jurymans oath be pronounced guilty with relation to that same offence the circumstance thus left unproved—be it ever so plainly irrelevant or even ever so ridiculous its being so makes not in this respect any difference the accusation on which the jury have to pronounce is that which it is and not anything which it might have been and is not on another occasion i may perhaps give more latitude as well as more particularity to this discussion on the present occasion what is said on this subject must of necessity be as compressed as possible on the present occasion—to prove on the ground now stated the impossibility of a verdict of guilty without a violation of the jurymans oath—all that remains is—to point out in each of the nine counts in question—among the circumstances of all which in the description of the alleged crime the existence is alleged—one or more of which it will be plain either that they had no existence or that they have not been proved among all these counts should there be any one that shall be found altogether clear of these as well as all other unproved allegations—then if the verdict be taken upon that one count the other eight i am ready to acknowledge may every one of them be stuffed with the like excrementitious matter in any quantity yet from that quantity no valid objection to a verdict of guilty can be made the copy or rather extract which i have succeeded in obtaining does not furnish me with the means of speaking with that entire assurance which is afforded by actual inspection of the whole tenor in relation to any of the nine besides the first but in several of these instances the unbroken thread of the legal custom in this respect affords an assurance altogether sufficient for the purpose at any rate when a list of these unproved allegations has been seen as it here will be seen as contained in the first count no person whom it may concern can find any difficulty in applying the same list to the several other counts here then follows as taken from the first count a list or at any rate what will be found an abundantly sufficient sample of these unproved allegations any one of which will have the effect of rendering a verdict of guilty a violation of oath on the part of every juryman who has been concerned in it—   being malicious seditious and illdisposed persons whether to the persons by whom—without either proof or design to offer proof—dispositions and if dispositions habits and if habits acts thus designated are imputed to others—whether to these persons the imputations would not apply with more justice than to those to whom they are thus applied let any honest man—let any sincere lover of truth justice sincerity—declare   maliciously devising and intending to raise and excite discontent and so forth   with force and arms       in contempt of our said lord the king       against the peace of our said lord the king     of these allegations the two last will it is expected be found to have been inserted in each one of the eight other counts if so then are they each of them sufficiently infected with unproved matter in such sort as to give to the verdict of guilty if pronounced in relation to that one of them the illegal and immoral quality so often mentioned this eventual violation of oath being supposed let those say whom it may concern—let any juryman say to himself let the learned judge say to them all for himself—whether should it even from the very commencement of the institution of jurytrial be seen to have     been the practice of jurymen thus to defile themselves—should it have been the unvaried practice of the judge thus to connive at their defiling themselves or even to recommend it to them so to defile themselves—whether even in this case any member of the present or any future jury that sees this will in any such habit of defilement howsoever inveterate find any sufficient warrant for so defiling himself yes for argument sake if of his so defiling himself any preponderant advantage to the community in respect of judicature and substantial justice would be the result but if in any shape any such advantage were to be found to result it would lie on the defender of the defilement be he who he may to bring it to view now this is what has never yet been so much as attempted to be done and it seems to me that i risk little in venturing to assure the reader that it never will be attempted to be done on that side if anything be advanced it will be in the strain of vague generality and in the form of one or other of those fallacies of which i have been at the pains of forming a catalogue which i hope will erelong be published in english as in the greater part of it it has for some time been in french in a certain number of instances let but the jurymen of this country shew the determination to refuse thus to defile themselves—not any the smallest difficulty will attend the giving to all instruments of accusation not to speak of other legal instruments that shape which will render it not only perfectly easy to juries to declare guilt to have had place wherever in their opinion it has had place—to render it perfectly easy i say for them so to do without any such defilement—but shall even render it much more easy than it either has been made already by that same defilement or would or could be made by the like defilement if swollen to a pitch ever so much more enormous than it has ever yet been seen to be         the king against sir charles wolseley baronet and joseph harrison schoolmaster set down for trial at chester on the  th of april    0 brief remarks tending to show the

immediately follows precedes the present address not only in principle but in so large a proportion of the details the two cases are in so many points coincident that for the present purpose to draw up a paper distinct in all its parts from that other would have been labour without adequate use on this present occasion i proceed therefore on the supposition that by what persons soever any remark of mine on the subject of the indictment in the case of the king against wolseley may be regarded as presenting any claim to their notice the following preceding remarks which had for their more immediate object the warwick case above mentioned will in the first place have been perused this being supposed to be done all that will remain will be to subjoin such remarks as apply exclusively to

the peace remarks on the above indictment taking for their subject divers words and phrases in the above indictment these remarks have for their principal object the shewing that on either of the two counts in that indictment concurrence in a verdict of guilty would be a violation of the jurymans oath   being persons of a turbulent     disposition that the pronouncing anything on the disposition of the persons in question whatsoever were the disposition so ascribed would as to so much be the pronouncing a verdict without evidence has been shown in the remarks in the warwick case p   0 on the present occasion to the ungrounded assertion respecting disposition in general is added in the first place the assertion by which the quality of turbulence is ascribed to the disposition of the persons thus accused here then the jury are called upon to pronounce that the disposition of the persons accused is in the instance of each of them a turbulent one but to do so will be to pronounce them in that respect guilty and that without evidence by the word turbulence no distinctly conceivable act is indicated on the present occasion if there be anything of which any distinct indication is afforded by     this word it is the sort of temper and the state of mind which on the part of the persons concerned in the prosecution has place or is pretended to have place to whomsoever applied it is a word of vague vituperation and nothing more   and seditious disposition of the word disposition enough has just been seen seditious disposition is a disposition to commit acts of sedition by the phrase acts of sedition what are the sorts of acts that are or those that ought to be understood to be designated presently we shall see this same adjective or epithet seditious employed to designate certain speeches and discourses but the first thing to be considered is the act at large sedition an act of sedition what sort of an act is it for of the phrase—the act of speaking a seditious speech and of the phrase—the act of publishing a seditious written discourse the import will depend on that which is attached to the phrase—an act of sedition taken at large be this as it may the idea attached to the word sedition being no less obscure and indeterminate than it is practically important the consideration of it is here deferred to the occasion on which it will be seen presenting itself anew in company with the words speech and discourse   wickedly and maliciously two other words these which as here employed amount to nothing better than another sample of vague and ungrounded vituperation to these again the remark may therefore be applied namely that the imputations conveyed by them not being susceptible of proof the consequence is that supposing a verdict of guilty applied to the count of which they form a part here would be another violation of the jurymans oath here too would recur the question—if on the ground of the ungroundedly abusive language any person ought to suffer—on whom with most propriety would the suffering be made to fall—on the persons who are the objects of it or on the persons who concur in the utterance of it but the king says the current maxim can do no wrong no say the crownlawyers nor the crownlawyers neither if not in words at any rate to every practical effect such is the addition made to it what would be wrong and criminal if done by any other person is wherever they do it right and legal right though it be for no other reason than that it is by them that it is done   devising and intending to excite tumult tumult forsooth behold here another word without any determinate meaning what is the criminal intention imputed here answer—the intention of exciting tumult now what is tumult this is surely among the things which every man ought to be informed of and informed of in time before he is punished for any such cause as the exciting it or the endeavouring or intending to excite it if for the purpose of forming a ground for punishment there be any word—any name of an act—that requires to have the import of it fixed by an authoritative definition surely this one is of the number but any such definition where is it to be found absolutely nowhere the law knows not of any such word neither statute law the only real sort of law nor the sort of sham law commonly called common law in no statute in no law report or authoritative law treatise is any such definition to be found no says somebody nor need there be for tumult is a word belonging to the common stock of the language well and when employed as an article of that common stock what then is the import attached to it nothing can be more indeterminate on the slightest scrutiny this indeterminateness will appear unquestionable and to warrant the application of a word to a legal purpose it suffices not that the word be familiar the idea attached to it should moreover be determinate if there be any idea constantly associated with it it is this—namely the idea of a something generally unpleasant and undesirable that something being a noise in the making of which a number of persons greater than one are instrumental noise—in the composition of the idea attached to the word tumult—noise then one might venture to state as an essential and indispensable ingredient motion—violent motion—of other bodies besides air—motion on the part of a number of persons—and what number would this be another ingredient but suppose both ingredients to have had place—both the ingredients thus designated—would they both together suffice to constitute a punishable offence no intimation to any such effect having as yet been given by any authority would the ideas thus associated suffice to constitute for the purpose of punishment the complex idea of an offence in addition to the above ingredients injury to mans person—injury to any subjectmatter of mans property—immoveable or moveable—injury of either of these descriptions and in either case injury in any shape might suffice it is supposed—might suffice to constitute such an offence—so that the effect thus given to it were but sufficiently known but in regard to injury to person still comes the question—would a single person suffice or shall any and what greater number be requisite in this case shall tumult be regarded as distinguished—and by what circumstance or circumstances distinguished—from common assault whatsoever be their subjectmatter and     their shapes the injuries commonly regarded as included in the import of the word tumult can scarcely be regarded as of a very serious complexion that which in this indictment is brought to view in the character of a punishable crime is in the most illustrious periodical publication that ever appeared in any country considered as to such a degree beneficial not to say necessary to good government that the author of the article in question the avowed adversary of radical reform scruples not to employ his endeavours to the avowed purpose of preventing the exclusion of it were the causes of tumult destroyed says the edinburgh review no    p     elections would no longer be nurseries of political zeal and instruments for rousing national spirit the friends of liberty ought rather to view the turbulence of the people with indulgence and pardon powerfully tending to exercise and invigorate their public spirit it is not to be extinguished but to be rendered safe by countervailing institutions not that in regard to the utility of tumult in any sense of the word i can bring my own conceptions to anything like a comcidence with the ingenious reviewers in addition to the word tumult may be seen included in this same justification the word turbulence—another of the words in which the science of the drawer of the indictment has beheld the matter of a punishable crime   intending to excite     insurrection much more serious is the charge now but still indeterminate—on the current and but too well justified supposition that by the jury under the direction of the judge assertion not only unproved but ungrounded will in this as well as so many other instances be in a way to be regarded as proved—most conveniently indeterminate insurrection then what on this occasion for the purpose of their verdict are the jury—what for the purpose of their defence are the defendants—to understand to be meant by it insurrection is rising up rising up for what purpose if against any person or persons against whom at any rate in what consists the crime in the act of rising up there is not any crime in the act of rising up against this or that person there is not necessarily any crime for example not when it is but in selfdefence against unlawful aggression rising up against the government against the government for any such purpose as putting down the government nothing of all this is said nothing of all this is charged and how happens it that nothing of this is charged the government—was it on this occasion out of the penmans thoughts no such thing for presently when hatred and contempt are the affections the excitement of which is alleged to have been intended government is expressly stated as being the object of them why then is it that when the horrible word insurrection is thus brought forward it is thus hung up over the heads of the defendants—hung up as it were in the air and without any determinate meaning attached to it why unless because somebody was conscious that neither in that nor in any other criminal sense of the word was insurrection intended nor therefore was any intention of producing any such criminal effect capable of being proved in the insertion of this word what then was the purpose in view once more only by influencing the passions to mislead the judgment of the jury and cause them to concur in a verdict of guilty against two men in whose instance no guilt had place see what is said a little lower down on the subject of seditious speeches now then no such intention as that of rising up against government for the purpose of putting down the government or for any other and minor purpose—no such intention suppose is proved at the same time this being numbered among the other words of course—the assertion contained in it being numbered among the assertions which though not less plainly false than scandalous it is customary because it has been customary for the jury on their oaths under the eye of the judge acting under his oaths to declare to be true—suppose it accordingly in and by the verdict declared to be true what is the consequence that when the defendants come up for judgment the judge fancies or pretends to feel himself in his speech and in his sentence not only authorized but compelled to consider the defendants as insurgents—as everything but traitors not exactly as traitors neither the word traitorously nor any of its kin being in the verdict but nevertheless as next kin to traitors for now comes in to his aid the sense in which the word with its kindred are so continually employed in the body of the law—employed not only in all histories but in all newspapers the citizens of the united states ere they became acknowledged citizens—were they not insurgents and insurgent traitors so likewise the men in spanish america in spain and everywhere else on the continent insurgent traitors in england insurgents everywhere and in the court newspapers insurgent traitors   with force and arms nothing can here be plainer than the existence of an allegation that in the course of the acts done in prosecution of the criminal intentions alleged and for the purpose of giving effect to those same intentions force and arms—not only force but arms—were employed well then if on that same occasion neither force nor arms are proved to have been employed—or even though force were proved to have     been employed if no arms are proved to have been employed no verdict in and by which they are declared to have been employed can be concurred in without a violation of the jurymans oath so likewise though arms were proved to have been borne if no force is proved to have been employed now as to arms what in the sense that belongs to the subject arms are—is pretty well understood by everybody arms are either offensive or defensive and in either case to help to constitute the alleged guilt they must not merely be such arms as are customarily carried for the purpose of being eventually employed against assault by beasts but such arms as by their construction appear designed to be employed against men   to disturb the public peace unlawfully and to disturb the public peace it was to this intent that they did assemble and gather together says this part of the charge disturb the public peace once more if not by injury or endeavour to do injury to person or property by persons acting together for this same purpose in considerable numbers the public peace was endeavoured or intended to be disturbed by what other means—in what other mode could it have been endeavoured or intended to be disturbed or in this case to the words disturb the public peace what other determinate and intelligible import is left if then neither injury nor endeavour nor intention to do injury in either of those modes is proved here there is another ungrounded assertion by the adoption of which the jurymans oath would be violated but even suppose injury in both modes proved still would a verdict of not guilty be warranted though it were upon this single ground why even because for want of those same determinate expressions or what is equivalent to them the defendants have been deprived of that precise information which was necessary to furnish them in case of innocence with the sufficient means of defence against this part of the charge disturbance of the public peace is not plain language but rhetoric—rhetoric which for the purposes of deception and injustice has been as it was originally inserted so is it still kept in the body of the language employed by lawyers eminently useful has indeed the word peace been to those who in that course of perpetual encroachment which limited power in whatever hands is destined to pursue are waging their neverceasing war against liberty though in its original import this word was far from being so determinate as those which the subject required and as above might have found—it was still farther from including one important point which in these later times has been forced into it in its original and proper signification it belonged to international law only not to internal law peace is the absence of war and if it be applicable to injury between members of the same state it could only be on the supposition of a civil war such as that between two pretenders to the monarchy or that between a monarch and his aristocratical subordinates of that sort of civil war from which in those feudal times in which most of our institutions took their rise the country was seldom free except when relieved from it by a war of depredation in which all parties joined for the sake of the plunder hoped to be obtained from france injury to person to properties to reputation to condition in life—to one or other of the four shapes expressed by these denominations may all injury considered in so far as individuals are the objects of it be seen to be reducible that which as between monarch and monarch would be signified by the words breach of the peace—that and nothing else would be signified by that same phrase when applied to injury as from individual to individual in the same state or from subjects to rulers in the same state that is to say injury to person or property when accompanied with physical force—or with the appearance of it in any such shape as should produce fear of ulterior injury in one or both of the shapes thus signified in either of these cases a measure obviously conducive and in some circumstances even necessary to prevention of ulterior injury is the bodily arrestation of the evildoer and for a time more or less considerable the     subjecting him to ulterior bodily restraint were it not for a power to this effect somewhere no one could say to what extent injury in the two shapes here in question might not swell itself as between monarch and monarch so between individual and individual it is only by injury to the persons or properties of men not by mere injury to their reputation or condition in life that except of late and in prosecution of the abovementioned implacable internal war of the ruling few against the subject many that peace has ever been considered as being broken or disturbed with or without commission from the king of great britain suppose a spanish captured by a british ship and men in the ship killed or wounded here is disturbance of the peace here is breach of the peace thus stands the matter so far as regards injury to person and injury to property now as to injury to reputation at this time scarcely does that day pass in which the reputation of the spanish monarch does not receive its figurative wounds by the instrumentality of the public prints yet by none of those figurative wounds is peace between spain and england either broken or disturbed still in the import of the word peace there was nevertheless something of a loose and figurative cast which by the enemies of the liberty of the press was regarded as affording a colour applicable to their purpose already to every written and published discourse which it was their wish to suppress or punish for they had succeeded in affixing the character of a criminal and punishable libel and on the part of the people they had found either a stock of prejudice or a degree of blindness and negligence sufficient to produce submission to the injury but to punish a man for an alleged libel and thereupon to suppress it after it had been proved or pretended to have been proved such was one thing under the notice of his having published a libel to punish a man for the publication of a written discourse and to suppress the discourse before it had been proved or so much as pretended to have been proved a libel was another and a very different thing this however they have been seen to do and in the word peace with the cloud in which it still continues so unhappily involved they found a pretext such as by them was deemed and as yet has been found a sufficient one still however the phrases disturbance of the peace—breach of the peace were not of themselves regarded as sufficient the idea of tendency was still requisite to the phrase a breach of the peace the words tending to were added and thus the thing was done tend to a breach of the peace in what manner by what means is it that a libel of the sort here in question—a libel tending to incite and point against the person or persons in question sentiments of displeasure tends to a breach of the peace upon these or any other persons such it is true may be the effect of injury in this shape just as it may be the effect of injury in any other shape for there is no injury by which a man weak in mind and strong in body may not be engaged to make retribution for it by means of injury in some shape or other of the sort of those by which peace in the original determinate and proper import of the word is broken or disturbed but let this be law every act by which any man may be made angry is a breach of the peace and thus between acts which are breaches of the peace and acts injurious or not that are not breaches of the peace all difference is expunged thus then so it is that let the law be but uniformly carried into effect all liberty of discussion on the subject of those affairs which are the common concerns of all men is rooted out—all by so sweet and soft an instrument as the word peace issuing from the lips of the reverend and scarcely the less pious for the not having as yet been supernaturally consecrated ministers of peace a man defiles your wife before your face this if it be with the consent of the person so defiled—this though is suffices to acquit you of murder in case of your avenging the injury by the death of the injurer upon the spot has not yet been discovered either to be a breach of the peace or to have any tendency to produce to any such effect as that in question—to any such effect as that of arrestation on the spot and at the time any such thing as a breach of the peace the reason is plain here is no libel published not but that it is among those injuries which by intendment of law—meaning always english law—are never committed without force and arms but in this case the force and the arms being but the product of mendacity and nonsense under the garb of science neither breach of the peace nor so much as tendency to any breach of the peace is among the imputed accompaniments of it thus it is that with words at command the nominally independent but really dependent creatures of the crown continue to have as they always have had but for here and there an act of perversity on the part of juries at equally absolute command the life of man as well as everything from which life derives its value and so it be by a man with justice in his mouth and a certain quantity of fur and false hair flowing over his shoulders how they are dealt with has to the good people of this country been at all times a matter of little less than complete indifference   0   by seditious speeches and discourses now then as to sedition in this clause by which the jury are called upon to pronounce the defendants guilty of an alleged crime thus denominated ought to be considered as of course included the supposition that to every one in their situation it had been rendered possible to know and understand—to know and understand in time—what the sort of acts are to which the appellation is applied and from which if committed the penal consequences attached to it will be made to fall upon the actors but in this instance as in so many others no such possibility it will be seen has place in this instance as in every other what the possessors of power have in view and at heart is—under the name of punishment to cause suffering to fall upon any such persons to whom it shall have happened to have offered opposition in any shape to their will—determined as it is by the conception entertained by them of their own interest now by the word sedition what is it then that is expressed opposition in some shape or other to that will this and little more if anything at any rate nothing the shape of which can be said to approach in any degree to a determinate shape look for the meaning of it in statute law look for it in common law look for it as long as you will in both you will look in vain as to the word sedition in statute law it may unquestionably be found in places more than one but in each place for the import that will be attached to it reliance is placed on the import whatsoever it may be which by each reader shall happen to be attached to it unfortunately various as well as numerous are the imports which with almost equal pretension to propriety may present themselves as attached to it imports correspondent to which are so many species of mischievous acts differing widely from one another in quality and quantity of mischievousness a sample may perhaps be brought to view before these pages are at an end now of the immense and undigested mass of statute law in what portion will any exposition—any attempt to give an explanation and fixation—of the import of this important word be found in the instance of this as well as almost every other denomination of offence nowhere in the manufacturing of this species of law no man ever scruples to assume and to any extent those things to be universally known and understood by everybody the possibility of knowing and understanding which has not been allowed to anybody to the manufacturers the very idea of definition is an object of a not altogether illgrounded horror—of real horror—and therefore to escape from the indignation due to such neglect of duty of affected contempt—absurd pedantic wild visionary and impracticable—such are the epithets kept in store to be poured down upon the head of every presumptuous innovator whose audacity shall dare to propose the extending to this most important of all sciences that instrument of elucidation which is never regarded as being misapplied when applied to the most trivial be they what they may of the several other branches of art and science lastly as to common alias judgemade law not that the definitions which occur here and there in the books called books of common law are any of them possessed of any binding force or authority to each such exposition whether repeated as having been given by a judge speaking as such or exhibited by an unofficial and uncommissioned treatisemaker each succeeding judge on each occasion bestows such regard and no other as it happens to him to find his convenience in bestowing for nothing can he ever see that if so determined can have any such effect as that of restraining him from the freest exercise of such his pleasure still however in such expositions definitions exemplifications and illustrations as are to be found in lawbooks a man who is rich enough to possess a law library of adequate magnitude and at the same time has leisure enough to make this use of it may in most cases find some guide to reflection—some help to conjecture accordingly in books of common law words may here and there be found which have been taken for the subject of declared definition examples are—the words high treason riot rout and unlawful assembly not to speak of others which have no immediate bearing upon the present subject but in the number of them the word sedition is not to be found on the present occasion besides indexes to statute books hawkins the latest of the authors of crown lawbooks who can with any confidence be cited as authority has on this occasion been recurred to and in vain such is the case with regard to the word sedition such is moreover the case with the still more appalling word insurrection between sedition and high treason—between a crime punishable with nothing beyond fine and imprisonment and a crime subjecting men to an excruciating death with etceteras punishing with elaborate reflection the unnumbered innocent along with the guilty one—where is the difference nobody has ever told us nobody has ever attempted to tell us nobody is there who is able to tell us for one and the same individual act or series of acts for which a man is prosecuted editor illegible word for high treason if the cognizance of it is thought fit to be trusted to a     jury and of the evidence of two witnesses or a body of other evidence construed to be equivalent to it can be found—for the same offence he has been made prosecutable and accordingly prosecuted as for sedition and by a single justice of peace convictable and convicted on the testimony of a single witness    g iii c   but between these as compared with one another and as compared with such other offences as strike against the authority of the government is it possible to draw any clear lines of distinction oh yes abundantly possible actuality it is hoped may be received as tolerably satisfactory evidence of possibility and this evidence would here be produced were it not that space and time press and that on the present occasion any such sample might by those whom it concerns be regarded as uncalled for and irrelevant look at that statute every act in the nature of which any real mischievousness is included is expressly declared to be high treason—every act which is allowed to be punished with the less atrocious punishment as above is the act of criticising in terms displeasing to the members of government anything that at any time has ever been done by government and forasmuch as in the preamble in company with the words high treason the word sedition is inserted what is said about hatred and contempt as above i e about unacceptable criticism may by any one that chooses be taken as a definition of it to convict a man even of high treason on as good ground would not require a construction more intensely strained than some of those by which in addition to the treasons created by parliament new ones have been created by judges mr hunt and his associates—on a late occasion were not endeavours used to send the knife of the hangman into their bowels yes—and for what offence for one of those offences which are between high treason and nothing the one or the other according as audacity or timidity are the accompaniments of despotism         official aptitude maximized expense minimized as shown in the several papers comprised in this volume by jeremy bentham first published in editor illegible word         paper i— preface to the whole of the matter which under nine or ten different heads is now in the compass of one and the same volume published under the same general title—belongs one and the same design and it is believed one and the same result but it being composed of no fewer than besides this nine different papers published mostly at different times on different occasions and under titles by which no intimation of such unity of design is conveyed—it has occurred that that design may in no small degree be promoted by holding up to view in this preface the way in which they are regarded as being respectively conducive and contributory to it the work from which they take their common origin was an allembracing system of proposed constitutional law for the use of all nations professing liberal opinions volumes three the first of which after having been some years out of the press is at this time now first published of this work a main occupation was of course the showing by what means the several members of the official establishment—in other words the public functionaries of the aggregate body of whom what is called the government is composed—might be rendered in the highest degree well qualified for rendering to the whole community the several services which are or ought to be looked for at their hands or say for giving fulfilment to that which is or ought to be the end of their institution—namely the maximization of the happiness of the whole community under consideration in any one of these forms of words may be seen expressed the whole of the benefit in view but in the very nature of the case connected with this benefit is a burthen without which the attainment of this same benefit is in all places and at all times utterly impossible of this burthen the principal and most prominent part being of a pecuniary nature is designated and presented to view by the word expense hence it is—that with the object designated by the words official aptitude becomes inseparably associated the object designated by the word expense of whatsoever benefit comes to be established the net amount will be—that which remains after deduction made of the amount of the burthen a notion which in the course of this inquiry whether really entertained or no i had the mortification of seeing but too extensively endeavoured to be inculcated was—that the net amount of the benefit reaped would in this case increase and as of course with the amount of the burthen imposed and—to speak more particularly that the aptitude of official men for their several situations would in a manner of course receive increase with and with every practicable degree of exactness in proportion to the expense employed in engaging them to enter upon and continue in their respective situations on the contrary for my own part the more closely i looked into the matter the more thoroughly did i become persuaded—not only that this opinion is erroneous but that the exact reverse of it is the real state of the case in regard to each of these so intimately connected objects—maximization of official aptitude and minimization of official expense—to show by what means the best promise of the obtainment of them might be afforded was of course an object of my inquiries from the words official aptitude maximized expense minimized—from these five words might this design receive its expression and of the design or purpose of this work might intimation be thus afforded by its title but in addition to this a further idea which it is my wish to see associated with these words is—that of these two states of things—these two mutually concomitantly desirable objects—one bears to the other the relation of cause to effect for that from the same arrangement from which the expense so employed will experience diminution the aptitude in question will in the natural order of things receive increase in a word that cæteris paribus the less the expense so bestowed as above the greater not the lesser will be the aptitude     now for the painful part of this inquiry— never to any subjectmatter—considered as a source of happiness or unhappiness or both—have my labours on any occasion been directed but with a view to the giving increase to the net amount of happiness but so intimately blended and intermingled throughout the whole field are those two fruits of human action—never could the sweet be brought to view but the bitter would come into view along with it and as the sweet would in great measure come into view and be reaped without effort—the consequence was that in clearing away the bitter consisted the great part of the labour necessary to be employed in such part of the field—for obtaining of the bitter—in a word of the unhappiness—produced by deficiency in the aptitude—a perception sufficient to put me in search after the most effectual mode of supplying that same deficiency—a very slight glance would commonly suffice but this object accomplished then has come the task of showing the needfulness of the research that had been made showing this by showing the bitterness of the fruit with which the whole field was overrun and the magnitude of the evil actually and continually coming into existence from the want of the supposed discovered appropriate and effectual remedy painful i may truly say has on every occasion been this part of my task for never has it happened to me to witness suffering on the part of any creature whether of my own species or any other without experiencing in some degree or other a sensation of the like nature in my own nerves still less possible has it been to me to avoid experiencing the like unpleasant situation when it has happened to myself to have been contributory to that same suffering yet without bringing to view the evil—utterly incomplete would have been the good produced by the invention and description given of the remedy for by all those whosoever they were by whom for the sake of the benefit derived by them from the evil the existence of the evil would of course be denied and their endeavours applied to the keeping it out of view—correspondent illwill harboured towards those by whom this source of the good is endeavoured to be dried up is a necessary consequence here then in connexion with every particle of the good endeavoured and supposed to be done—come three distinguishable particles of evil evil from the contemplation of the suffering endeavoured to be prevented evil from the contemplation of the suffering producible on the part of the evildoer by the application made of the remedy evil apprehended from the desire of vengeance produced in the mind of the evildoer by the loss of his accustomed benefit happily it follows not in this case that because the particles of evil bear in number to those of the good the ratio of three to one they must in the aggregate be superior in value to the good happily for if such were the consequence—scarcely where between man and man contention had place would good to any net amount be ever produced moreover a few hints there are to which coupling together two considerations namely that of the extent of their usefulness if any they have and the narrowness of the space into which they may be compressed i could not refuse admittance and for such admittance no other place than the present could be chosen with any advantage disappointmentprevention or say nondisappointment principle for the purpose of retrosusception or say resumption as well as for that of original distribution—in this principle may be seen the chief and alldirecting guide in this may be seen on the ground of utility and reason the foundation of the whole law of property penal branch as well as civil in another place application has already been made of it to the subject of what is called real property—and thereby explanation given of it in the present volume may be seen ulterior application made of it and explanation given to it namely in the immediately ensuing paper intituled introductory view in the train of it come now a few proposed rules and observations—  —rule i so long as expenditure continues running through any pipe or channel which can be stopped without production of disappointment—disappointment to fixed expectations already formed—forbear to stop it in any pipe or channel by the stoppage of which such disappointment will be produced  —rule ii on this occasion by appropriate delineation draw a clear and express line of demarcation between fixed and floating expectations every solicitor who sends a son of his to one of the inns of court expects to see that same son on the chancery bench with the seals before him as the lord bathurst of queen anns creation saw his behold here a specimen of floating expectations correspondent to fixed expectations in ordinary language are vested interests in technical language  —rule iii the amount of the sum proposed to be retrenched being given and the amount of suffering of every sufferer by it being the same the less the number of the sufferers by it the better     application—case supposed in the department in question mass of expenditure proposed to be retrenched £ 000 ayear one sum of £ 000 ayear forms the salary of one commissioner of a board another sum of £ 000 ayear the aggregate of the salaries of ten clerks these situations all eleven of them are on examination deemed needless but without production of disappointment they cannot any one of them be struck off direction in consequence strike off the one commissioner rather than the ten clerks or any one or more of them  —rule iv remember always—that on both sides the amount of the provision probably obtainable by each such dismissed functionary in lieu of what he thus loses requires to be taken into consideration   example of a channel of expenditure capable of being stopped up without disappointment of fixed expectation this namely salaries of the ostentatious class of functionaries sent on foreign missions secretaries of legation consuls and viceconsuls not included offers of service at reduced salaries to every diversity of amount—offers of gratuitous services not to speak of offers of purchase—let all such offers be called for and received before choice is made of purchase yes for if a fit man there be who instead of being paid for taking upon him the burthen is willing to pay for the permission to bear it—why even against any such offer should the door be closed as to the general indication afforded of aptitude for a political situation by the proof given of relish for it by the smallness of the sum required for taking it or the largeness of the sum ready to be given for it—see on this head what is said in paper iii extract from the constitutional code   note that—by striking out any individual in whose instance fixed expectation either of continuance in possession or of acquisition of possession has place—nothing is gained upon the whole by the community of which he forms a part not more is the community thus benefited—than by the removal of a weight from one side of a ship to another the ship is lightened   as often as at the public expense money is given in the name of indemnification complete or incomplete for loss sustained by him without his default—so often is acted upon a principle the reverse of that which would produce the disappointment of a fixed expectation by the uncompensated extinction of a profityielding office to apply this observation to the matter of the present volume in the three first of these papers will be seen nearly the whole of the sweet part of the compound task in the four next will be seen predominating the bitter the first thing done will consist accordingly in laying down all along what in my view of it is right that to this as a standard for the purpose of detection and exposure may all along be applied that which in my view is wrong as to the ninth of these papers—of the subject of it the militia the extent is comparatively narrow—and the relation of it to the rest must wait for its explanation till some other matters have been brought to view occupied principally in showing how the aptitude in question may be maximized and the expense minimized and that by every diminution effected in the expense augmentation may be given to the aptitude—are the three first and the eighth† of the ensuing papers occupied in showing that in fact on the part of the rulers of the british empire in its whole vast mass and of the english part in particular of them the endeavour has been and continues to be and so long as the form of government continues to be as it is never can cease to be—to maximize the expense and minimize the aptitude—occupied in the establishment of this position are the remaining numbers that is to say the  th  th  th and  th‡ of these same papers specially connected with one another will be seen to be papers  th and  th∥ mutually connected in like manner with one another papers  th and  th¶ in papers  th and  th may be seen occupied the leading minds of the two parties between which the statesmen of those days respectively were divided years    0 and    0—occupied in the endeavour to obtain the approbation of the community for principles by which if carried into practice not an atom of the fruits of human labour over and above what is necessary to bare existence would be left in the hands by the labour of which it was produced so much for principles—or if another word be more agreeable theory in papers  th and  th¶ may be seen—with what consummate consistency and perfection those same principles have been and down to the present time continue to be carried into practice to how enormous and endless an amount has been swelled the mass of expense employed under the notion of securing appropriate aptitude on the part of the head functionary in one of the departments namely in that of justice—and the degree of perfection in which in that same instance the quality of inaptitude has had place and how effectual the provision that has been made for addition altogether boundless to that same expense moreover in paper  th may be seen—how by the head functionary in another     department namely that of the homeaffairs—not only was support given to the system of predatory exaction and thereby of expense just mentioned—and to the continuance of the official inaptitude also just mentioned—but in his own department an addition with it is believed unexampled wantonness made to the expense of offices subordinate to his own and thereby to his own emolument coupled with the inexorable establishment of a set of regulations having for their most obvious and incontestable effect not to say their avowed object the exclusion of every efficient cause and assignable presumptive proof of official appropriate aptitude sole qualification required eating and drinking qualification decidedly rejected—of the several powers belonging to the very office in question the habitual exercise thus then may be seen—not only unrestricted but by every days practice continually confirmed and acted upon—the theory to which expression may be given by the words—official expense and official inaptitude both maximized when in the career indicated by the words expense maximized—aptitude minimized the ruling powers have proceeded for a certain length of time—it will sometimes happen—that by the fear of seeing their power drop from under them they will be induced to stop and even not simply to make a stand but actually to make a retreat and that this retreat when applied to expense will be declared under the name of retrenchment all this while the original opposite design—the design of advancing in that same career—continues of course in unabated force for the same cause which first gave birth to it will so long as man is man make it grow with his growth and strengthen with his strength the design however not being altogether so acceptable to the people at whose expense as it is to their rulers by whom it is entertained and pursued—hence the endeavour to impress on the minds of the people—instead of the apprehension of its existence—the opposite confidence but such is the force of truth and of the nature of things that whenever a design of this sort really has place so it is that by means of the very endeavours employed to dispel the apprehension of it it is liable to be brought to light whether in the several instances of edmund burke and george rose this result has not had its exemplification—is among the questions on which the reader will have to pronounce should his patience have carried him through papers the  th and  th not unfrequently those who by delusive arguments are labouring to inculcate an erroneous opinion have by those same or some other considerations been themselves involved in the like delusion such is the influence exercised on the judgment by the affections in the mind of george rose the existence of the power of selfdeceit in quantity more or less considerable presented itself to me i remember as not improbable in the mind of edmund burke not a particle in the mind of george rose means for observation not being wanting there seemed to me to be no small portion of downright honesty and goodness of intention in that of edmund burke nothing better than matchless artifice to return to the subject of retrenchment just now a show of a design of this sort having been made and in that track even some short steps taken—among the topics for sometime proposed to be included in this miscellany was that of retrenchment but after some progress made in relation to it came into view what ought to have presented itself from the first namely that the field of retrenchment is no other than the whole field of expenditure the only difference being—that the points of view in which that same field has to be contemplated are on the two occasions opposite this being borne in mind time and space were seen joining in putting a peremptory veto upon any regular progress in that track any progress presenting upon the face of it any pretension to the character of a comprehensive one seeing however as above one supposed proper seat and source of retrenchment—the militia in relation to which what had occurred to me had already assumed a determinate shape—the quantity of space occupied by it being but small admittance it seemed need not be refused to it it forms accordingly the matter of paper  th   what is the navy good for answer—to help to defend colonies what are colonies good for answer—to help to support the navy quere what part of the national expenditure is kept up on the ground of this circle   on the question—by the metropolitan country shall this or that distant dependency be kept up—there are two sides—two interests—that require consideration that of the metropolis herself and that of the dependency to great britain and ireland—say in one word to brithibernia—would it be matter of advantage or disadvantage to surrender the dominion of british india to the inhabitants as it surrendered to the inhabitants the dominion of the new angloamerican united states on the question whether it would be for the advantage of brithibernia much might be said on both sides on the question as applied to the nation of british india—in the minds of those who have read the documents and in particular the work of the so wellinformed intelligent and incontestably     wellintentioned bishop heber—scarcely can there be a doubt by the withdrawal of the english regiments from british india in what respect or degree would hindoos or mahometans profit answer—in much the same as did the ancient britons by the withdrawal of the roman legions  0 if in the case of the several european powers and other civilized nations and governments security against one another were all that were sought for at the hands of standing armies and permanent navies—no less effectually might this security be procured and retained by proportional diminution than by proportional augmentation but by all of them permanent military force in one or both branches whether needed or not is prized at any rate as an instrument of security for themselves against their own subjects security by means of intimidation and security by means of delusive show and corruptive influence    now for deadweight after having so

tract as the title of it imports has for its subjects the appropriate aptitude of public functionaries and the expenditure employed at the charge of the people in engaging persons to subject themselves to the obligation of rendering the correspondent services it is composed of four sections detached from the ninth of the thirty chapters or thereabouts of a proposed constitutional code the entire of which wanting little of completion will be published as soon as circumstances permit a table composed of the titles of the chapters and sections of it is hereunto annexed the class composed of the members of the official establishment taken in its several branches was the only class in contemplation when the plan here delineated was taken in hand in the progress of the work the idea occurred that supposing the plan well adapted to its purpose in the case of the class thus distinguished it might be so in no small degree in the case of any other persons whose situation in life would without any particular view to office admit of the expenditure of the quantity of time and mental labour which with that view is here proposed to be employed but what further may require to be said in relation to this secondary and as it were collateral subject will be rendered more intelligible by being postponed till after everything which belongs to the primary and sole relevant subject has been brought to view such being the subjects now as to the objects or say ends in view these are as the title of these pages intimates maximization of the degree of appropriate aptitude in all its branches on the part of the functionary in question—and minimization of the expense employed in the creation and purchase of that same aptitude in this same title a proposition fully expressed is—that in the plan to which it gives denomination both these objects are endeavoured to be accomplished a proposition not so fully if at all expressed but which will be seen maintained is that the accomplishment of the financial object far from being as seems but too generally supposed at variance with that of the intellectual and moral is on the contrary in no small degree capable of being made conducive to it a notion but too extensively entertained is—that whatsoever quantity of public money is employed in engaging individuals to step into official situations relative aptitude in proportionate degree will follow as a matter of course and that for example if in the case of a chief judge for £ 000 ayear salary you get a certain quantity of appropriate aptitude double the salary and without anything further you double the aptitude such at any rate is the opinion which in england whether inwardly entertained or not is outwardly and generally acted upon with this opinion that which gives direction     to the here proposed arrangements so far from harmonizing approaches more nearly to the reverse insomuch that supposing a number of competitors so far as instruction will go endowed with equal degree of aptitude—a man who if any such there be in the situation in question is willing to take upon himself without emolument in any shape the performance of the duties of an office is likely to perform them better than another man who would not undertake it for less than £ 000 ayear or even better than he himself would have done if on stipulating for that same sum he had obtained it in the course of the section entitled remuneration being the first of the four sections of which this tract is composed this opinion together with the grounds on which it rests may be seen developed first comes the appropriate aptitude and the problem is how to maximize it when for the performance of a certain work an individual finds himself in need of a helper before he fixes upon any one he naturally puts questions to any one that offers—questions having for their object the obtaining satisfaction as to the relative aptitude of the candidate if instead of one only a number more than one presented themselves he would as far as time permitted put those same questions to them all and in the putting of these questions he would address himself to them separately or all at the same time as he found most convenient in either way by so doing he would examine them he the examiner they the examinees in private would the examination be of course performed in this case for on this occasion of no person other than the individual himself would the interest or convenience be in view by publicity if obtainable he would and in proportion to the number of persons present be embarassed and in no way benefited to the functionary in chief who for aiding him in the business of his department feels the need of helpers in the businesses of the several subdepartments their aptitude cannot in the nature of the case be a matter of indifference his property will not it is true as in the case of the individual be at stake upon the aptitude of his choice his property no but his reputation yes if the subordinate chosen be to a certain degree unapt the reputation of the superordinate will suffer in two distinguishable ways by the badness of the work done under his orders and by the weakness or something worse evidenced by the badness of the choice under these circumstances what can he do for making in his own person any such examination as that which the individual as above has it in his choice to make power is altogether wanting to him for time is altogether wanting to some person or persons other than himself he must therefore have recourse for the formation of his opinion and the determination of his choice who then shall they be if in each instance the reporter who in this case will be the recommender be this or that individual—what is not certain is—that the giver of the advice will have had any better grounds for the choice than the asker what is certain is that he will not have had so great an interest in the goodness of the choice for the goodness of his choice the individual employed is not responsible to anybody but himself the functionary is responsible to everybody in so far as he is proof against the temptation to serve his own particular interests and affections at the public expense his wish will therefore be to see located in each situation the individual in whose instance the maximum of appropriate aptitude has place unable as he is of himself to perform the examination the persons to whom it will be his desire to assign the task will in consequence be those in whom the maximum of appropriate aptitude with relation to this same task is to be found by this most general description the next most general description is settled they will be the persons that are most distinguished in the character of instructors in the several branches of art and science in which it is requisite the persons to be located should be proficients in regard to the number of the persons present the examination must in this case be either private or public which shall it be private it might or might not be as satisfactory as if public to himself to the public it would not be but supposing him wise it would not be so satisfactory even to himself for the more complete the cognizance taken of the proceedings of these examiners by the public the stronger the inducement they would have each of them for rendering his proceedings as well adapted to the purpose as it was in his power to render them thus then we have the maximum of publicity as a necessary condition to the maximum of appropriate aptitude of appropriate aptitude—in the first place on the part of the examiners in the next place on the part of the examinees in their quality of persons locable in the several situations—say in one word locables evidenced by the answers will be the aptitude of the examinees by the questions that of the examiners such then should be the examination judicatory as to the examinees by the opinion expressed by the votes of the members of this same judicatory they will at any rate be placed in the list of persons more or less qualified for being located in the several official situations as to their respective degrees of aptitude in the judgment of the judicatory taken in the aggregate they can be expressed by the several individual members     as to the manner in which the deduction may be made it will be seen in §    of which locable who is the title next subject the expense problem how to minimize it first expense that of the instruction next expense that of remuneration for the services to be rendered by those by whom the instruction has been received for the instruction there must be the necessary apparatus of instruction lands buildings furniture for every branch appropriate implements according to the nature of each branch for administering the instruction there must moreover be instructors and for the instructors subsistence and remuneration in quantity sufficient to engage their services as to the pockets from whence the expense is drawn so far as regards subsistence—bare subsistence together with the apparatus—they must in the first place be those of the public for in this way alone can the sufficiency of it be secured this being thus settled such part of the remuneration as is over and above bare subsistence—from what source shall it be drawn answer from the pockets of those by whom alone the most immediate benefit from the instruction is reaped those to wit by whom it is received from them it cannot come without being accompanied with willingness and followed by retribution and the quantity of it will of itself increase in exact proportion to the number of those benefited by it in which case it will in the same proportion be a bounty upon industry on the part of the instructors drawn from persons other than those by whom the immediate benefit is reaped it would neither be accompanied with willingness nor followed by retribution—and if it were as it naturally would be a fixed sum—a sum not depending for its quantity on the exertions of the instructor to whom it is given—it would be a bounty upon idleness next comes the expense of the remuneration to the intended functionaries remuneration for the time and labour requisite to be expended on their part—before location in qualifying themselves for rendering their several official services—after location in the actual rendering of those same services for this purpose the nature of the case presents three distinguishable modes—  in compliance with appropriate calls offer to take a less salary than that which has been proposed   offer to pay a price for it   offer to submit to its being reduced to a certain less amount and then to pay such or such a price for it after it has been so reduced the two first modes are simple the third a compound of the two all these will have to be considered a point all along assumed is—that in each office there is but one functionary in a word that no such implement as a board has place anywhere assumed and why answer for these reasons all advantages that can have been looked for from a board are better secured by other means in particular by maximization of publicity and responsibility and because the exclusion of this instrument of intrigue and delay is not less essential to aptitude than to economy moreover these reasons may as will be seen be applied with still greater profit to the judiciary than to the executive branch of government after all neither by the intellectual competition nor by the pecuniary competition nor by both together can the individuals by whom the situation shall be filled be finally determined for the formation of this determination there will still be need of some one person or set of persons in quality of locator or locators by reasons the essence of which is contained in the word responsibility the choice has in this case likewise been determined in favour of number one this one person can be no other than the functionary in chief under whose direction the functions belonging to all the several situations in question are to be exercised as to his choice it cannot but be influenced not to say directed by information which the examinations have put the public in possession of as to the merit of the respective candidates but it will not because it cannot be determined by any positive rule by all that has been done or can be done towards divesting the power—the patronage for that is the name of it of the quality of arbitrariness—it will not therefore be by any means divested of value or sunk beneath the acceptance of a person competent to the task of exercising it in the annexed table of chapters and sections paper xi will be seen a list of the several ministerial situations to be filled prime minister will be the natural appellation of him by whom those are thus filled and by whom the exercise of the functions respectively belonging to them is directed in §    intituled located law will be seen how this consummation is proposed to be effected but once more as to the instructors after whatsoever may have been done for engaging them remains still the question—where can they be obtained three sources of obtainment and no more does the nature of the case afford they must be found at home they must be made at home or they must be imported from abroad in each of these three modes invitation is necessary formation is in this case an operation preeminently tedious and the formators where shall they be found to find or make them would be to remove a smaller by a greater difficulty different according to the circumstances of     the community in question will in this particular manifestly be the eligible course now as to the collateral subject national education and the assistance which the arrangements proposed for the instruction of official functionaries would give to it what is manifest here is that whatever is good as applied to functionaries will not be otherwise than good as applied to nonfunctionaries whatever promotes useful instruction in any shape in the one case will promote it in that same shape in no less degree in the other the only difference is—that in the case of national education that is to say in the case of a youth educated at the charge of his parents—for occupations other than the exercise of a public function—there will be no service for the public to buy no salary for the public to sell and the taking the benefit of the instruction provided will on the part of each individual be—not matter of necessity as in the case of an official situation but matter of choice it was of course with a view to office alone that the idea occurred of bringing to view the several branches of instruction that appeared requisite to give to public men the best qualification possible for the several classes of offices but as far as it goes this same exhibition will be of use with a view to no small variety of private occupations when proposing for his child this or that occupation the parent will find in this table if not a sufficient body of information a memento at least reminding him of the need of his satisfying himself as to what are the branches of instruction to which the mind of his child shall be directed and of his looking out accordingly for an appropriate set of instructors as to instructors—of whatsoever degree of aptitude will have been given to persons of this class for the purpose of the instruction to be given by them to functionaries the benefit will be open to nonfunctionaries they who are able and willing to instruct the one will not be less so to instruct the other so much as to aptitude and as to expense—of the expenditure necessary to the instruction of functionaries a part more or less considerable will have been employed in the obtainment of means of instruction which without detriment to the one may be employed in the instruction of the other of all such means the nonfunctionary class may have the benefit without paying for it any further than in their quality of members of the whole community they had necessarily been made to pay along with all others for the instruction of the functionary class to a plan of this sort various objections will of course present themselves these as far as they could be anticipated are here collected and such answers as seemed sufficient subjoined for conveying a general conception of them the few words following may in this page perhaps suffice— i objection to the publicity of the examination—timid aptitude excluded ii objection to the probationary period proposed for the instruction—time thence aptitude insufficient iii objections to the pecuniary competition—   pecuniary responsibility diminished—thence corruption and depredation probabilized   venality established   unopulent classes excluded and thus injured in the perusal of the here proposed arrangements one thing should all along be borne in mind the sort of government supposed by them is a representative democracy the time in question that of the infancy not to say the birth of the state in that same form such being the state of things in which in the largest proportion the information endeavoured to be conveyed could have any chance of being listened to but in the several subordinate situations even supposing the highest to be filled by a monarch not inconsiderable is the number of those of the proposed arrangements which in the eyes even of the monarch himself might be not altogether unsuitable for setting aside any such heroic endowment as that of sympathy for the people under his rule—to a monarch however absolute neither can appropriate aptitude on the part of his official servants nor frugality in respect of the pay allotted to them be naturally unacceptable the more completely security in all its shapes is given to the subject many the greater is the quantity of wealth they will acquire and the greater the quantity they acquire the greater is the quantity that can be extracted by him from them for his own use in particular for the maintenance of his standing army—that highpressure highpriced and most supremelyprized engine which is at once an instrument of supposed security for the timid of depredation for the rapacious—of oppression for the proud—of boasting for the vain—and a toy for the frivolous and the idle and as to frugality the less is expended in the comfort of any part of the subject many the more is left for the fancies of the ruling one setting aside the case of a pure aristocracy—a form of government nowhere exemplified to any considerable extent—one only form there is in which maximization of official aptitude and minimization of expense are of course objects of congenial horror to the rulers this is that the composition of which is a mixture of monarchy and aristocracy with a slight infusion of democracy in the     shape of a shamrepresentative body in the formation of which the subject many have a minute share in this state of things expense of official emolument is maximized and why that the possessors may be pampered by the receipt of it the people intimidated by the force kept up by it corrupted by the hope of it and deluded by the glitter of it aptitude is at the same time minimized and why because if the contents of the cornucopia were distributed exclusively among the most apt those junior partners of the allruling one with their dependents and favourites would have little or no share in it four distinguishable sorts of matter may be seen pervading the whole texture of this extract the inactive the expositive the ratiocinative and the instructional of these the enactive the expositive and ratiocinative have already been exemplified in the threevolume work entitled traités de legislation civile et penale being the first of the four works published in french from the authors papers by m dumont had the political state to the circumstances of which the codes in question were to be adapted been as mathematicians say a given quantity—the instructional might not perhaps have been brought into existence at any rate it would not have occupied anything near the quantity of space which it will be seen to occupy here but the indeterminateness of these circumstances impossibilized on many occasions the giving to the matter the form of a positive enactment capable of standing part of the text of the law as in the case of a code emanating from authority necessitated was therefore the expedient of employing instead of determinate expressions general descriptions—for the purpose of conveying such idea as could be conveyed of the matter of the provision which the nature of the case presented itself as demanding by the instructional matter is accordingly meant the sort of matter the purpose of which is the giving instructions to the legislator if the tide of events should ever carry into that situation a man or body of men to whom it seemed good to give to such part of the matter as could not here be expressed in terminis a character conformable in principle to those parts for which an expression thus completely determinate has already been proposed such being the distinctive characters of the parts in question by some minds it was thought it might be found a commodious help to conception if as often as they presented themselves applicable indication were given of them throughout by prefixing to each portion of matter its appropriate denomination as above to any person to whom these additaments appear useless they need not offer any annoyance—for he has but to pass them by and read on as if no such words were there of a code to which the stamp of authority had been affixed these distinctions would afford a commodious method of exhibiting so many authoritative abridgments abridgments of the only sort on which any safe reliance can be placed by the enactive part if published alone the most condensed of all the abridgments would be presented by appropriate types and figures of reference intimation of the existence of the omitted matter might be conveyed without any sensible addition to the bulk of it in another edition might be added the expositive matter in a third the expositive and the ratiocinative in conjunction in england a highly laudable disposition has of late shown itself and from a quarter from which it might be followed by effect—a disposition to raise the language of the legislator to a level in respect of propriety somewhat nearer than that which it occupies at present in comparison with the worst governed among other civilized nations whichsoever that may be a design so extensively useful would indeed stand but an indifferent chance of being carried into effect if the fraternity of lawyers professional as well as official could not find adequate inducement for giving it their permit but neither is such toleration altogether hopeless what that particular interest requires is—that the rule of action shall continue in such a state that without their assistance comprehension of it to a degree sufficient for the regulation of conduct should to all other members of the community continue impossible but such is the excess to which the bulkiness and disorderliness of it have been carried—such in consequence even to themselves the difficulty of stowing it and keeping it stowed in the mind in a state capable of being applied to use as wanted—that for their own relief under that difficulty the risk of rendering the oracle too extensively and effectually comprehensible may perhaps appear not too great to be hazarded this being supposed—a result that seems not altogether out of the sphere of possibility is—that even those to whom the matter of all such codes as those here exemplified is—it need not be mentioned by what causes—rendered the object of insurmountable abhorrence—the form as far as regards arrangement and expression may in a degree more or less considerable be regarded as a subject for adoption to any person by whom it may have happened to be viewed in this light the intimation conveyed by the words enactive expositive and ratiocinative may perhaps appear not altogether devoid of use in the case     of the series of codes to which the present extract belongs—in proportion as the matter presented itself the form in which it might be presented it was thought to most advantage came along with it thus it was that as they were committed to paper explanations belonging to the head of form became so many materials for a short disquisition which may perhaps be submitted to the public in a separate state but even from the small specimen here exhibited it may be perhaps in some sort conceived how great would be the contribution to condensation as well as precision if the expedient were employed of substituting to the continued repetition of a portentous pile of particulars that of a single general expression in which they were all contained the import of that expression having once for all been fixed—fixed by an appropriate exposition in the ordinary mode of a definition per genus et differentium—or where that is inapplicable in such other mode as the nature of the case admitted of between the several sorts of matter distinguished from each other as above—the actual separation it cannot but be observed has not with any approach to uniformity been on this occasion made in one and the same article two or even more of these species will not unfrequently be found exemplified in an authoritative code this want of symmetry might supposing it worth while be remedied in the present unauthoritative work the difficulty of separating the proposed enactive and the instructional from each other was found so great that the necessary labour and time which would have been neither more nor less than that of writing the whole anew was felt to be too great to be paid for by any possible use in like manner in other instances the ratiocinative will be seen blended with the enactive in an authoritative code the labour might perhaps in this case though this does not appear altogether clear be paid for by the use for example for the purpose of an authoritative abridgment such as the one above proposed but in the present unauthoritative sketch a mixture of the ratiocinative presented itself as desirable not to say necessary were it only to the purpose of humectating the dryness of the enactive matter and diminishing the aversion which a set of arrangements so repugnant to commonlyprevailing notions and affections would have to encounter if inducements to acquiescence were not in some shape or other mixed up with it in a civil or say a rightconferring code for civil expresses so many different things that it expresses nothing and in a penal or say a wrongrepressing code especially if made for a given political state the separation would be a work less difficult than it has been found in the present one accordingly in the traités de legislation it may in both instances be seen effected in that part of the present proposed code which regards the judiciary establishment the heads of which may be seen in the annexed table paper xi the separation will be found much less imperfect another particular which will naturally call forth observation is the practice of adding to the numerical denomination of a section when referred to the title by which it is characterized in authoritative codes an additament of this sort is not however without example in the present unauthoritative sketch it has been matter of necessity by the author nothing he writes in the character of a proposed code or law can ever be regarded as perfected so long as he lives in the proposed code in question alteration after alteration have in great numbers at different times been actually made further alteration after further alteration will continually be contemplated and wherever in regard to an entire article either insertion or elimination have place all the articles which follow it in the same section will require a fresh numerical denomination and the anterior reference if preserved will be found delusive and so in the case of sections or chapters into what is new in point of form a further insight will it is hoped ere long be given by another and larger preliminary extract from the present constitutional code to wit the judiciary part above alluded to the enactive matter combined with what seemed the indispensable portion of the other sorts of matter is already in a state fit for the press as likewise a considerable portion of the ratiocinative and instructional in a detached state from the annexed table of the titles of chapters and sections for the whole an anticipation more or less extensive may be formed of the instruments which have been contrived for the purpose of compression and may be regarded as a sort of condensing engines a principal one may be seen composed of the general word function followed by the several specific adjuncts attached to it in several of its parts the matter of this same judiciary code could not be determined upon without correspondent determinateness being given to correspondent portions of the procedure code a code for this purpose is in such a state of forwardness that all the principal and characteristic points are settled and nothing remains to be done but the reducing to appropriate form some portion of the matter which has been devised in this work will be included as far as circumstances admit an allcomprehensive formulary exhibiting forms for the several written instruments of procedure in particular     the instruments of demand and defence for suits of all sorts as also forms for the mandates required to be issued by the judge on the several occasions for the several purposes and for each mandate an appropriate denomination has of necessity been devised on this

with the regret that may be imagined does the reflection occur—that as far as regards the diction there are but too many political states in which the abovementioned views supposing them approved of could not be carried into any such full effect as in those in which the language in use is the english for with the exception of german there exists not it is believed anywhere that language which will lend itself anything near so effectually as the english to the formation of such new appellatives as will be necessary to precision and condensation in particular ineffectual is the french which notwithstanding its scantiness unenrichableness and intractability still seems destined to continue—say who can how much longer—the common language of the civilized world for a particular purpose the present extract has been sent to press before the proposed code to which it belongs and in which it is designed to be inserted could be completed hence it is that but for this information—the numerical figures in the titles to the several sections might be taken for so many errata or have the effect of giving to the whole publication the appearance of a fractional part of a work that has been lost this same circumstance will serve to account for the headings of the pages it may not here be amiss to observe that of the bulk of the work in its complete state no judgment can be formed from the space occupied by the three first of these four sections the enactive part of the first four chapters together for example does not occupy so large a space as does the least of these same three sections amid so much innovation a short caution may be not altogether unseasonable in the frugality here recommended no retroaction is comprised by the taking away of anything valuable either in possession or even though it be but in expectancy so it be in fixed expectancy whether on the score of remuneration how excessive soever or on any other score—pain of frustrated expectation—pain of disappointment is produced in the import of the above words fixed expectancy is contained whatever is rational and consistent with the greatesthappiness principle in the pertinacity manifested by the use of the english parliamentary phrase vested rights and note—that by forbearing to apply the alleviation which by the defalcation in question might be given in respect of the public burthens to persons of all classes taken together no such pain of disappointment is produced as little ought it to pass unheeded that supposing a highpaid functionary divested of a certain portion of wealth thus misapplied he is not by a great many the only sufferer with him will be sufferers all persons of all classes in proportion as their respective means of expenditure were derived from his supposing indeed the overpay derived from crime—obtained for example by false pretences—by this supposition the case is altered—but add the supposition that all by whom the punishment should be ordained or that all by whom a part should be taken in the infliction of it are sharers in the guilt then comes the question—by whom shall be cast the first stone an englishman need not look far to see this supposition realized prudence might in this case join with sympathy in the constructing a bridge of gold for carrying to the land of safety all opponents only at the expense of those who would otherwise have been but never will have expected to be receivers—can retrenchment on any other ground than that of punishment be except in case of public insolvency without hesitation justified on the occasion of the ensuing proposed arrangements mention of divers periods of years has of necessity been made it might have been some help to conception if on the occasion of this or that train of suppositions a determinate day could have been fixed for the commencement of each period this however could not be done for different countries different days would have been requisite for this country—england to wit—the     day may be fixed by imagination with something like precision the day for the commencement of this code with the stamp of authority on the first page of it is the day which will give commencement to the hundred and first year reckoning from the day on which the author will have breathed his last in the meantime to those who have the faculty of extracting amusement from dry matter it may serve as a second utopia adapted to the circumstances of the age of the original romance it may however be seen to be—not so much a continuation as the converse in the utopia of

extracts from the constitutional code being chapter ix §       and    with the accompanying supplement will be found in their proper place it is not thought desirable to reprint them here paper v— defence of economy against the right honourable edmund burke first printed in      advertisement the paper here presented to the reader under the title of defence of economy against the right honourable edmund burke together with another containing a defence of the same more useful than welcome virtue against the right honourable george rose were written as long ago as in the year    0 at that time the joint destination of the two papers was—to form a sequel to a tract of no great bulk having for its title hints respecting economy for its subject it had taken the whole of the official establishment and for     its objects two intimately connected practical operations viz minimizing official pay and maximizing official aptitude operations the mutual subservience of which in opposition to the universally convenient universally received and acted upon and in truth but too natural opinion of their incompatibility was maintained the circumstance by which the publication of it and in some degree the completion of it was suspended was the expectation of obtaining certain documents which in the way of exemplification and illustration afforded a promise of being of use meantime the turn of affairs produced some incident or other by which the authors attention was called off at the moment to some other quarter and thus it is that altogether the three papers have been till now lying upon the shelf as to the two objects in question so it was that the plan which had presented itself to the author as that by which both of these objects might be secured and the only one by which either of them could be so in any degree approaching to perfection having the misfortune to find itself reprobated with one voice by the two distinguished statesmen above mentioned the removal of the impediment opposed by so strong a body of authority presented itself of course as an object of endeavour altogether indispensable in the order at that time intended a statement of the principles which had presented themselves as claiming the direction of practice would have preceded the examination here given of the principles which it was found necessary to combat—hence the reference which may here and there be found to portions of matter which neither in any other place in which they could be referred to have made nor in this place can make their appearance by a change in the order thus originally intended that one of the two defences which will here be found for in the present receptacle there was not room for the other cannot it will therefore be evident enough but appear under more or less of disadvantage but to the rendering them perfectly intelligible as far as they go it did not seem that to either of them any of the matter which belonged to that by which they had been designed to be preceded was necessary and by the forms of warfare especially considering the situation and character of the person against whom it was unavoidably directed the attention of many a reader it has been supposed may be engaged whose perseverance would not carry him through the dry matter of a sort of didactic treatise the principles of which are in a state of irreconcilable hostility to the personal interest of that class of persons which forms the subject of it—to which it cannot but look for the greatest number of its readers—and without whose concurrence how far soever from being accompanied with any degree of complacency it could not at any time be in any degree carried into effect at the time when these papers were penned not any the slightest symptom of official regard for public economy was it the authors good fortune to be able anywhere to recognise everywhere it seemed an object of contempt—of contempt not only to those who were profiting by but to those who were and are the sufferers from the want of it under this impression the wonder will rather be how the authors perseverance could have carried him so far into the subject as it did than how it should happen that by the sense of a slight deficiency the suspension should have been commenced and by a series of intervening avocations have been continued at present in this respect for a time at least matters seem to have undergone some change surely enough if it does not at the present small indeed must be its chance of obtaining any portion of public attention at any future point of time but should it happen to the two or either of them to obtain any portion of favourable regard the more favourable the greater will be the encouragement afforded for the labour necessary to the bringing the plan to that degree of maturity which would be necessary to its producing any assignable effect in practice short as it is in the intimation above given of the nature of the plan one circumstance will already be but too undeniably visible viz that not only without any exception in respect of the first of its two connected objects viz minimizing official pay but likewise and with very little exception in respect of the other viz maximizing official aptitude nothing can be more irreconcilably opposite to the particular interest of that class of persons without whose concurrence no effect whatever could be given to it yes even in respect of this latter object for if in the instance of every office so odd an effect as that of an exclusion put upon all who were not the very fittest for office or even upon all who were not flagrantly unfit for it were to be the result an exclusion would thus be put upon all those for whom—and their connexions and the connexions of those connexions and so on—for whom gentlemen are most anxious because in every other way they find it most difficult to provide but if on the part of the plan in question the objection is grounded on the opposition of interests and consequent unwillingness were to be regarded as a proof of impracticability it would be a proof not only that in government nothing good will ever be done but moreover that in government in general and in our own in particular of all the good that has ever been done the greater part has not ever been done among the points on which   0 government turns some there are relative to which the interest of the ruling few be they who they may coincides with the universal interest and as to all these points in so far as it happens to them to know what that same universal interest is—as to all these points gentlemens regard for that same universal interest may be reckoned upon without much danger of error or much imputation on the score of credulity unfortunately under most governments and under this of ours in particular other points there are in which that partial and sinister interest is in a state of implacable hostility with the universal interest and of this unfortunate number are the two just mentioned and so far as this hostility has place so far is the universal interest as being the least condensed sure of being overpowered by and made a constant sacrifice to that which is most so in this state of interests the subjectmany may deem themselves particularly happy when to make up a provision worthy of the acceptance of a member of the ruling few nothing more than the precise amount of that same sum with the addition of the expense of collection is taken out of the pockets of the subjectmany an unfortunately more common case is—where for each penny put into the privileged pocket pounds to an indefinite number must be and are accordingly taken out of all pockets taken together from privileged ones in this way with more than adequate compensation—unprivileged without anything at all thus it is that while wars are made to make places places are made to secure commencement or continuance to wars and lest this should not be enough distant dependencies—every one of them without exception productive of net loss—are kept up and increased yes productive of net loss for this is as uncontrovertibly and universally the case as that two and two make four for which reason no man who has a connexion to provide for or to whom power and glory might majesty and dominion in the abstract are objects of concupiscence can endure to hear of it as to war so long as in the hands of those who have speech and vote in parliament or of their near connexions offices are kept on foot with emolument in such sort attached to them as to be materially greater in war than in peace who is there that will venture to affirm that of a parliament by which an arrangement of this sort is suffered to continue the conduct is in this respect less pernicious in effect or when once the matter has been brought to view less corrupt in design than it would be if in that same number the members of that same body were by masses of money to the same value received under the name of bribes engaged by one another or by any foreign power clandestinely or openly thus out of an ocean of human misery to extract so many of these drops of comfort for themselves in both cases the same sums being pocketed—pocketed with the same certainty and under the same conditions—in what particular except in the language employed in speaking of them and in that chance of punishment and shame which would have place in the one case and has not in the other do these two cases present any the smallest difference tell us good sir william—tell us good your lordship lord of the freehold sinecure—exists there any better reason why emoluments thus extracted should be retained than why bribes given and received to the same amount and by the same means without disguise should if received repose in the same right honourable pockets in a certain sensation called uneasiness locke beheld as his essays tell us the cause of everything that is done though on this occasion with all his perspicuity the philosopher saw but half his subject for happily neither is pleasure altogether without her influence sure it is that it is in the rougher spring of action that any ulterior operation by which the constitution will be cleared of any of its morbific matter will find its immediate cause yes—in the returning back upon the authors some small portion of the uneasiness which the sufferers have so long been in the experience of—in this necessary operation for which the constitution with all its corruptions still affords ample means—in this if in anything lies the peoples hope the instrument by which the god silenus was made into a poet and a prophet—it is by this if by anything that noble lords and honourable gentlemen will be fashioned into philosophers and patriots it is by this if by anything that such of them whose teeth are in our bowels will be prevailed upon to quit their hold submission and obedience on the one part are the materials of which power on the other part is composed whenever and in so far as the humble materials drop off the proud product drops off along with them of the truth of this definition a practical proof was experienced in      by king james in the case of england and scotland in      it was experienced by king george and his british parliament in the case of ireland in the character of ancient pistol eating the leek in that same year was the first lord camden seen and heard in the house of lords by the author of these pages demonstrating by the light of an instantaneous inspiration to ears sufficiently prepared by uneasiness for conviction the never till then imagined reasonableness of the termination of that system under which that island was groaning under the paramount government of a set of men in the choice of whom it had no share in the same character in the     event of a similar expediency might his most noble son be seen in one house and his right honourable grand nephew in the other holding in hand—the one of them a bill for the abolition of sinecures useless places needless places and the overpay of useful and needful places the other a bill for such a reform in the commons house of parliament as may no longer leave the people of great britain in a number more than twice as great as the whole people of ireland in a condition from which the people of ireland were liberated as above at the instance of the learned founder of an illustrious family which was in one instance at least not ill taught in a word such a reform as by divesting the ruling few of their adverse interest by which so long as they continue to grasp it they are rendered the irreconcilable enemies of those over whom they rule will leave to them no other interests than such as belong to them in common with the people who are now groaning under their yoke what belongs to the only effectual remedy which the nature of the case admits of viz a restoring change for such in no small degree it would be in the constitution of the house of commons—may perhaps be spoken to elsewhere it belongs not directly to this place what does belong to it is the nature of the principles established on the subject of public expenditure principles not only acted upon but avowed not only avowed but from the connected elevations—the alas but too closely connected elevations—the mount of the houses and the mount of financial office preached in these principles it was long ago the fortune of the author to behold causes of themselves abundantly adequate to the production of whatever sufferings either are felt or can be apprehended and if it be without any very great demand for our gratitude yet will it be seen to be not the less true that to two distinguished statesmen one of whom is still in a condition to answer for himself we are indebted for the advantage of beholding these same principles in a tangible shape—in that tangible shape in which they have been endeavoured to be presented to view in two separate yet not unconnected tracts viz in the present defence of economy and in the other with which it is proposed to be succeeded november      titles of the sections   i defence of

burke section i burkes objects in his bill and speech i begin with mr burke and this not only because as compared with that of any living statesman the authority of a departed one unites the advantages that are afforded to authority of the intellectual kind by anteriority and by death but because it seems but natural that in the delivery of his own opinions the junior and survivor should have drawn upon his illustrious predecessor for such assistance if any as in the way of argument he may have regarded himself as standing in need of such as they will be seen to be being the notions advanced by the orator—such their extravagance—such their repugnance even to the very measure they are employed to support—what could have been his inducements what could have been his designs questions these in which if i do not much deceive myself the reader will be apt to find at every turn a source of perplexity in proportion as the positions of the orator present themselves to view stripped of those brilliant colours by the splendour of which the wildest extravagances and the most glaring inconsistencies are but too apt to be saved from being seen in their true light in the hope of affording to such perplexity what relief it may be susceptible of i shall begin with stating the solution which the enigma has suggested to my own mind—showing what in my view of the ground was the plan of the orators campaign—what the considerations by which he was led thus to expose his flanks laying his principles all the time so widely open to the combined imputations of improbity and extravagance here then follows the statement by way of opening on the mind of the intelligent and candid reader it will make no ultimate impression any farther than as to his feelings the charge stands in each instance sufficiently supported by the evidence needy as well as ambitious—dependent by all his hopes on a party who beheld in his person the principal part of their intellectual strength—struggling and with prospects every day increasing against a ministry whose popularity he saw already in a deep decline the orator from this economical scheme of his bill and speech together proposed to himself on this occasion two intimately connected though antagonizing objects viz immediate depression of the force in the hands of the adversary and at the same time the eventual preservation and increase of the same force in the hands of the assailants in the event of success which on the like occasions are by all such besiegers proposed to themselves and according to circumstances with different degrees of skill and success pursued for the more immediate of the two objects viz distress of the enemy it was that the bill itself was provided and to this object nothing could be more dexterously or happily adapted opposition it was certain of and whatsoever were the event advantage in some degree was sure suppose the opposition completely successful and the whole plan of retrenchment thrown out together here would be so much reputation gained to the promoters of the measure so much reputation lost to the opponents of it suppose the plan in any part of it carried in proportion to the importance of the part so carried the reputation of its supporters would receive an ulterior increase while that of its opponents the weakness betrayed by them increasing in proportion to the conquests thus made upon them would in the same proportion experience an ulterior decrease but as it is with the war of hands so it is with the war of words no sooner is the conquest effected than the weakness of the vanquished becomes in no inconsiderable degree the weakness of the conquerors—of the conquerors who from assailants are become possessors to this eventual weakness an eventual support was to be provided to this service was his speech directed and adapted we shall see with what boldness and—in so far as the simultaneous pursuit of two objects in themselves so incompatible admitted—with what art such in truth were the two objects thus undertaken to be recommended—recommended at one and the same time—to public favour a practical measure a measure brought forward by his bill—a measure of practice and in the same breath a set of principles with which necessary as they were to the main and ulterior purpose the measure so far as it went was in a state of direct repugnancy the problem therefore with which his ingenuity had to grapple was—so to order matters as that the economical measure should be pursued and even if possible carried with as little prejudice as possible to the necessary antieconomical principles     of principles such as these which have been submitted to the reader—of principles really favourable to frugality and public probity—of principles in which waste and corruption would equally have found their condemnation in whatever hands—in the hands of whatever party—the matter of waste and means of corruption were lodged—of any such principles the prevalence would by its whole amount have been in a proportionable degree unfavourable to the orators bright and opening prospects once in possession of the power he was aiming at the only principles suitable to his interests and thence to his views would be such principles as were most favourable to the conjunct purposes of waste and corruption so far as was practicable his aim would therefore be and was—to preserve for use the principles of waste and corruption in the event of his finding himself in possession of the matter and the means—to preserve them in undiminished and if possible even in augmented force for this purpose the only form of argument which the nature of the case left open to him was that of concession or admission such accordingly as will be seen was the form embraced by him and employed by the portion comparatively minute as it was of the mass of the matter of waste and corruption of which his bill offered up the sacrifice his frugality and probity were to stand displayed by the vast and as far as depended upon his exertions the infinite mass preserved—preserved by the principles let drop and as it were unwillingly and as if wrung from him by conviction in his speech his candour his moderation his penetration his discernment his wisdom—all these virtues were in full galaxy to be made manifest to an admiring world all this while an argument there was by which had there been any lips to urge it this finespun web with purity at top and corruption at bottom might have been cut to pieces if of the precious oil of corruption a widows cruise full and that continually drawn upon be so necessary as you have been persuading us to believe why by any such amount as proposed or by any amount seek to reduce it true had there been any lips to urge it but that there were no such lips was a fact of which he had sufficient reason to be assured to urge it probably enough not so much as a single pair of lips—to listen to it most assuredly not any sufficient number of ears and where ears to listen and eyes to read are wanting all the lips in the world to speak with all the hands in the world to write would as was no secret to him be of no use thus then by the craft of the rhetorician were a set of principles completely suited to his purpose—principles by a zealous application of which anything in the way in question howsoever pernicious might be done—anything however flagrantly pernicious defended—collected together as in a magazine ready for use a magazine too the key of which was in his own pocket and with an adequate assurance that on the part of no enemy whom he and his need care for would any attempt ever be made to blow it up suppose now the orator seated at the treasury board—the marquis of rockingham on the seat of the first lord looking great and wise—the orator himself thinking and writing and speaking and acting in the character of secretary let him fill his own pockets and those of his favourites and dependents ever so rapidly ever so profusely no man can ever say to him you have belied your principles for as will be seen so long as there remained in the country so much as a penny that could be taken in a quiet way his principles were such as would bear him out in taking it all this while honourable gentlemen on the other side might have grumbled and would of course have grumbled undeserved undeserved would have been the exclamation produced by every penny wasted but welldeserved welldeserved would be the countercry all the while and the ayes being in possession the ayes would have it unprincipled unprincipled would be an interjection from the utterance of which honourable gentlemen would by their principles—their real principles—their operating principles—not their principles for show—but their principles for use—be on both sides alike as lawyers say estopped as to the principles thus relied upon by the orator they will be seen to be all of them reducible to this one viz that as much of their property as by force or fraud or the usual mixture of both the people can be brought to part with shall come and continue to be at the disposal of him and his—and that for this purpose the whole of it shall be and remain a perpetual fund of premiums for him who on each occasion shall prove himself most expert at the use of those phrases by which the imaginations of men are fascinated their passions inflamed and their judgments bewildered and seduced whereupon he—this orator—whose expertness in those arts being really superior to that of any man of his time to which perhaps might be added of any other time could not but by     himself be felt to be so would in this perpetual wrestlingmatch or lottery—call it which you will—possess a fairer chance than could be possessed by any other adventurer for bearing off some of the capital prizes section ii method here pursued thus much as to the purpose pursued by the orator in this part of his speech a few words as to the course and method pursued in the view here given of it the passages to which the development of the principles in question stand consigned are contained most if not all of them in that part of the speech which in the edition that lies before me occupies out of the whole    pages from    to part of    inclusive this edition is the third—year in the titlepage    0 being the year in which the bill was brought in and as between edition and edition i know not of any difference my object is to present them to the reader in their genuine shape and colour stripped of the tinsel and embroidery with which they are covered and disguised for this purpose the course that happened to present itself to me was—dividing the text into its successive component and distinguishable parts—to prefix to each such part a proposition of my own framing designed to exhibit what to me seemed the true and naked interpretation of it next to this interpretation—that the best and only adequate means for forming a correct judgment on the correctness of it may not in any instance be for a moment wanting to my reader—comes the correspondent passage of the text viz that passage in which as appeared to me the substance of the interpretation will be found to be more or less explicitly or implicitly contained lastly follow in general a few observations such as seemed in some way or other conducive to the purpose of illustration and in particular as contributing and in some instances by means of extraneous facts to justify the preceding interpretation and clear it of any suspicion of incorrectness to which at first view it might seem exposed in some instances the truth of the interpretation will i flatter myself appear as soon as that portion of the text which immediately follows it has been read through in other instances two or three such extracts may require to have been read through before the truth of the interpretation put upon the first of them has been fully proved in others again this or that extraneous fact may to this same purpose seem requisite to be brought to view as it has been accordingly together with a few words of explanation or observation without which the relevancy of the facts in question might not have been altogether manifest as to the order in which the propositions here succeed one another should it present itself to the reader as differing in any respect from that by which a clearer view of the subject might have been exhibited he will be pleased to recollect that the order thus given to the effusions of the rhetorician is the order given to them by himself and that by their being exhibited in this order of his own choosing the thread of his argument is delivered unbroken and the parts of it untransposed having thus before him two sets of principles—one of them in the preceding part suggested by a perfectly obscure—the other in this present part laid down by a transcendently illustrious hand—the reader will take his choice section iii propositions deduced from burkes economy speech   concerning public money—what the proper uses of it propositions       proposition   on condition of employing upon occasion in conversation or elsewhere the word reward in phrases of a complexion such as the following viz furnishing a permanent reward to public service† public money ought at the pleasure of kings and ministers to be habitually applied to the purpose of making the fortunes of individuals and that in such manner as to raise their families to a state of grandeur and opulence proposition   to this power of parcelling out the property of the public among the nominees of kings and ministers there ought to be no limit none to the quantity capable of being thus put into the hands of each nominee none to the whole quantity of public property thus disposed of proof whoever says he seriously considers the excellent argument of lord somers in the bankers case will not he bottom himself upon the very same maxim which i do and one of his principal grounds for the alienability of the domains in england contrary to the maxim of the law in france he lays in the constitutional policy of furnishing a reward to public service of making that reward the origin of families and the foundation of wealth as well as of honours     then to the word england comes a note which says before the statute of queen anne which limited the alienation of land observations proof at the time of this excellent argument of lord somers  th will iii the whole of this domain was alienable alienable to the utmost farthing and so faithfully and efficiently had it been applied to this its destined and as we are desired to persuade ourselves properly destined purpose as to have brought the subjectmatter of it to that state of which a description may be given in the words of the existing committee on finance the right of the crown over its own demesne lands was formerly say they  d report p     as complete as its power of conferring offices and yet the use which was made of that part of its prerogative occasioned parliament frequently to interpose and particularly after the crown had been greatly impoverished an act passed whereby all future grants for any longer term than thirtyone years were declared void the misfortune continue they is as mr justice blackstone remarks that the act was made too late after every valuable possession of the crown had been granted away for ever or else upon very long leases such was the observation suggested by the case to mr justice blackstone viz that it was made too late but according to the excellent argument of the excellent lord somers it was made too soon for the use of it—the principal use—at least if the excellent mr burke is to be believed was in the conception entertained on the subject by the excellent lord somers the supplying the requisite matter for this constitutional policy to operate upon—viz the constitutional policy of furnishing a permanent reward to public service of making that reward the origin of families and the foundation of wealth as well as honours now of this statute of queen anne as far as it went the effect was to counteract the constitutional policy and render it together with the excellent maxim on which the excellent law lord is said to have bottomed himself incapable of being pursued and to a plain and unlawlearned understanding they cannot both be good viz the policy and the statute the policy by which the alienation of the property in question for that purpose was prescribed and the statute by which the alienation of that same property for that or any other purpose was prohibited† proposition   the progress of this revolution ought not to be stopped till it has received its consummation as above described     i e so long as any part of the property of the public understand of the people remains unapplied to the purpose of giving effect to this maxim with its constitutional policy viz the furnishing a permanent reward to public service of making that reward the origin of families and the foundation of wealth as well as honours     proof observations for already at the time of this excellent argument had this quiet and gradual revolution made such progress that within a trifle the domain in question—a mass of property originally sufficient for the peace establishment of the country—had been thus disposed of there remained it is true and still remains in part at least as yet undisposed of in the same unconstitutional way the private property of individuals but a principle adequate to this purpose had already been established—established by the same or another provident set of hands—and at the time of this excellent oration still continued to be acted upon yes and still continues to be acted upon under the eye and cognizance and without censure from the abovementioned existing committee by which a diamond from this same excellent oration has without acknowledgment been picked out—picked out and employed in giving additional lustre to the jewel for which we are indebted to their hands section iv concerning title to reward proposition   in the course of the disposition thus made of the whole property of government with the growing addition of the whole property of the people the plea of its having for its use and object the furnishing a reward to public service ought never to be any other than a false pretence at any rate nothing ought ever to be done to prevent its being so proof observations four modes of disposing of the public money under the notion of reward for public service—extraordinary public service—all of them in frequent use lay open to the rhetoricians view—  remuneration by act of parliament   allowance out of secret service money   pensions granted by the crown without concurrence of parliament   sinecure offices granted by the crown without concurrence of parliament in the case of remuneration by act of parliament everything is open to view everything is open to discussion—  the nature and reality of the service supposed to have been performed   the part taken by the person in question in the rendering of that service   the importance of the whole service and of the part taken by him in the rendering     it   the magnitude of the proposed reward in the case of remuneration out of secret service money all these particulars are left in     darkness and in time of war and thence at all other times since there are none in which the approach or danger of war may not be imminent it being necessary that in the hands of the administration there should exist means of purchasing services such as under any apprehension of disclosure would be unobtainable hence a fund for this purpose ever has been and ever ought to be on foot in the case of pensions some of the above four particulars are open to discussion two of them and two only are open to view viz   the person on whom so much of that matter viz money which is in use to be applied and in this case is applied to the purpose of remuneration has been bestowed—  the quantity of that matter thus bestowed what is not open to view is—whether it is under the notion of his having rendered any public service that the money has been bestowed much less whether such notion supposing it really entertained be in any degree just or no   in the case of sinecures he saw all these helps to misapplication having place and as compared with the case of pensions acting in much greater force in the case of a pension what is bestowed constitutes a new article put upon an already existing list a list which if not already public is liable to become so at any time—a list which in the meantime whether made known or not to the public cannot but be kept constantly in view by various members of administration if it were only lest the fund on which it is settled should be overloaded—a list such that no fresh article can ever be placed on it without producing a fresh sensation as constituting a manifest addition to the mass of public burthens and in relation to which it is impossible but that to many persons the question must occur—on what grounds and with what propriety has this addition been made in the case of sinecures not one of these spurs to attention had in his view any more than they have at present any existence sinecure list none no nor so much as a future possibility of making out any such thing without a course of intricate inquiry such as even now in the fourth year of the sitting of a second finance committee has not been completed a sinecure office falling   0 vacant the vacancy is in case of this inefficient as in the case of any efficient sort of office filled up in course—filled up under no other impression than the general one viz that in the list of offices as often as one name drops out another must according to usage be put in the room of it in two different situations he saw the same set of hands viz those of the servants of the crown habitually employed in disposing of the property of the public whether to the purpose real or supposed of remuneration or to any other purpose in two different situations viz out of parliament and in parliament in parliament since without their concurrence even in parliament no such power can under the established rules be exercised of this difference what is now what in his view could have been the consequence disposed of in parliament the money had never been disposed of but that to the misapplication of it there had been some check though how far from being so effectual a one as might be wished is but too notorious disposed of out of parliament as in the shape of a sinecure emolument the misapplication of it had never experienced nor in the nature of the case was capable of experiencing any check whatever it is in this shape that we see him defending it of this state of things the consequence was and is as obvious and natural as the existence of it is incontestable when at the expense of the people on the ground of service rendered to the people a case can it is supposed be made be it ever so weak a one recourse is had to parliament and parliament is the hand by which the favour is bestowed when no such case can be made—when the very mention of public service might be regarded as mockery and insult when the annihilation of the precious matter thus bestowed would be a public blessing a secret hand acting out of parliament is the hand occupied in such service windfalls are waited for tellerships are bestowed whatever you want in force of reason make up in force of assertion whatever is wanting in merit make up in eulogy maxims these the use and value of which are perfectly understood by sophists of all classes our rhetorician goes on it is indeed meaning by it the principle which prescribes the dividing the substance of the people—among great families and families that are to be made great by such means—it is indeed the only genuine unadulterated origin of nobility peculation the only genuine and unadulterated origin of nobility what a character of nobility—what a plea for the house of lords—what a lesson to the people it is continues he a great principle in government—a principle at the very foundation of the whole structure o yes such a principle exactly as a running stream would be running under the foundation of a structure erected on a quicksand section v concerning virtuous ambition gratitude and piety propositions         proposition   when ambition is virtuous nothing but money is capable of acting with effect as an incitement to it power in whatever shape—power of management—power of patronage dignities honours reputation respect—by whatever cause created are all without effect proof indeed no man knows continues the rhetorician no man knows when he cuts off the incitements the incitements i e the sole incitements to a virtuous ambition and the just rewards of public service what infinite mischief he may do his country through all generations such saving to the public may be the worst mode of robbing it the incitements meaning those alone which are composed of money for thereupon comes a panegyric on the virtue of money—an eulogium composed of a string of phrases which in the commonplace book of a university poemmaker might if the subject of the poem were the virtues of money perform the sort of service performed to genius in the bud in that useful manual called the gradus ad parnassum under the head of synonyms or phrases the means for the repose of public labour—the fixed settlement of acknowledged merit—a harbour into which the weatherbeaten vessels of the state ought to come a retreat from the malice of rivals from the perfidy of political friends and the inconstancy of the people how pitiable under this view of it must be the condition of every man who without a certainty of raising a family into overgrown opulence at the expense of the people employs his time or any part of it in any branch at least in any of the higher branches of the public service—of every member of parliament at least for to honourable gentlemen of this description do the regards of the rhetorician appear on this occasion to have confined themselves—of every member of parliament who ventures his bark in any such stormy latitude without the certainty of a harbour in the shape of an auditorship or a cutdown tellership at least storms and tempests forsooth yes such as we see on canvas at covent garden and hope to see again at drury lane labour as severe almost as what is undergone on the cricket ground or at the card table and standing     about as much in need of remuneration at the expense of the people labour such as without receiving the value of a farthing from any hand that did not itself cheerfully take the money out of its own pocket mr gale jones and his company would have undergone and continued to undergo if the honourable house could have prevailed upon itself to suffer them labour far short of that which on the same ocean the newspaper reporters were in the habit of undergoing and if mr yorke and his honourable and worthy nephew had suffered them would have continued to undergo without ceasing and even how incomplete soever and indeed wholly insufficient for that purpose for that public service must as mr burke says be those means of rewarding that public service yes even without further reward for that service than the daily wages received during pleasure—daily labour beyond comparison more compulsory more assiduous more severe than that which besides so many contingent sweets has present honour for a sweetening to it—daily labour without pension of retreat without provision for superannuation—provision actual or eventual for widows or mistresses children or grandchildren uncles or aunts brothers or sisters nephews or nieces without power either of management or patronage—without either possession or prospect of honour dignity reputation or respect in any shape proposition   so as the place be permanent the hope of receiving it how large soever the mass of emolument attached to it does not operate as corruption—does not produce dependence proof many of the persons who in all times have filled the great offices of state have says he been younger brothers who had originally little if any fortune there ought to be continues he some power in the crown of granting pensions out of the reach of its own caprices—caprices the hand by which the whole property of the people is thus to be disposed of has it then its caprices o yes for the moment and for the purpose of the argument what is it that it may not happen to a thing to have or not have for the purpose of the argument the entail of dependence continues he is a bad reward of merit i would therefore leave to the crown says he viz to the caprices of the crown the possibility of conferring some favours which whilst they are received as a reward do not operate as corruption—as if to this purpose call it a good call it a bad one a pension might not be made to operate with the same effect as a sinecure both being equally for life proposition   when a man is in parliament whatsoever be the conduct of the servants of the crown and whatsoever be the quantity of money he may gain or hope to gain by giving them his indiscriminating support virtue requires that to protect him against the charge of corruption he be provided with the plea of gratitude which plea pleaded acquittal follows of course when men receive obligations from the crown through the pious hands of a father or of connexions as venerable as the paternal the dependencies says he which arise from them are the obligations of gratitude and not the fetters of servility such ties continues he originate in virtue and they promote it proposition   when a man happens to have children piety on his part consists in filling their pockets with public money proof the epithet pious applied with so much unction to paternal hands thus occupied observations in the wolfs bible piety would indeed naturally enough consist in providing lamb as much as she could lay her paws upon to feed her cubs with but in the shepherds bible at least the good shepherds bible piety will probably be found rather to consist in keeping the lambs from being disposed of to such pious uses the orator though not a nopoperyman was fond of his bible and here we have a sample of the uses he was fond of making of it section vi concerning partymen and their principles propositions    0 proposition   men who have at any time joined together in the way of party ought not ever any one of them to differ from any other nor therefore to act any one of them according to his own conception of what is right sinecures if not absolutely necessary are highly conducive at least and thence proportionally useful to the purpose of preventing all such differences proof they such ties as above continue men says he in those habitudes of friendship those political connexions and those political principles we have seen what principle in which they began life they are antidotes against a corrupt levity instead of causes of it observations sinecures according to this account of them seem to be as necessary to secure fidelity at the expense of sincerity in parliament as test oaths and subscriptions are to secure various good things at the expense of reason or sincerity there and elsewhere two things here call for notice the proposed end and the proposed means proposed end each mans persevering in the principles     whatever is meant by principles in the professions and habits right or wrong in which he began life i e which it happened to him to have imbibed from the instructors under whom it had happened to him to be placed and the society in which it had happened to him to have lived proposed means his having got into his hands as much public money as his parents and other connexions could contrive to put into them by means of sinecures means and end it must be acknowledged are not ill matched proposition  0 on a change of ministry were it not for the sinecures the comersin would cut the throats of the goersout whereupon the sons of the goersout would cringe to the same comersin now ins and kiss their hands proof what an unseemly spectacle would it afford—what a disgrace would it be to the commonwealth that suffered such things to see the hopeful son of a meritorious minister begging his bread at the door of that treasury from whence his father dispensed the happiness and glory of his country why should he be obliged to prostrate his honour and to submit his principles at the levee of some proud favourite shouldered and thrust aside by every impudent pretender in the very spot where a few days before he saw himself adored—obliged to cringe to the author of the calamities of his house and to kiss the hands that are red with his fathers blood no sir—these things are unfit they are intolerable observations and so there are it seems such things as proud favourites but if so what sort of food is their pride fed upon sinecures and if so is not one of these proud favourites on every occasion a dangerous rival to the hopeful son of a meritorious minister but the plan was—that there should be enough of them for everybody and thus everything would be as it should be section vii concerning ministers and their duty to themselves propositions             proposition    the danger of a mans being too bountiful to himself when in and by the adjudication of reward claimed on the ground of service said to have been rendered to the public he is allowed to be judge in his own cause affords no reason at least no conclusive reason against the allowing him to act in that character as to abuse says he i am convinced that very few trusts in the ordinary course of administration have admitted less abuse than this efficient ministers have been their own paymasters it is true but their very partiality has operated as a kind of justice and still it was service that was paid when we look over this exchequer list we find it filled with the descendants of the walpoles of the pelhams of the townsends names to whom this country owes its liberties and to whom his majesty owes his crown it was in one of those lines that the immense and envied employment he now holds came to a certain duke the duke of newcastle says a note whose diningroom is under the house of commons who is now probably sitting quietly at a very good dinner directly under us and acting high life below stairs whilst we his masters are filling our mouths with unsubstantial sounds and talking of hungry economy over his head for merited wealth and honour he declares his respect respect which accompanies it through all its descents through all its transfers and all its assignments in plain english the object of his respect is wealth itself whatever hands he sees it in as for original title and first purchase and the epithet merited prefixed to wealth all this is for decency and delusion for as to merited the orators notions about merits have surely by this time become sufficiently apparent and as to title—what is it that on the subject of title specific title so much as asserted not to speak of proved he ever drops so much as a hint of his looking upon as requisite no with him to the purpose of approbation though without reason as in a lawyers point of view to the purpose of protection for the best reason possession of wealth acquired at the public expense is regarded as proof of title and that proof not only presumptive and provisional but conclusive as for transfer and assignment—wealth sure enough is transferable and assignable but merit is merit too a subject of bargain and sale a manor yes but manners those manners which in the language of edward the thirds chancellor maketh man are these manners with an e appendages and appurtenances that by the attraction of cohesion adhere to and are rendered inseparable from the manors with an o wealth or power wherever you see them prostrate yourself before them cringe to them and though they be red with your fathers blood kiss the hands that grasp them this is what you are obliged to do and that which is matter of obligation how can it be matter of blame such are the     precepts which call for the observance of that pupil whose preceptor is edmund burke after the predilection thus declared—predilection for vicarious reward—in short for anything that can afford to political rapacity a colour or a cloak to complete the system of corruption and tyranny what more can be wanting than a like declaration in favour of vicarious punishment observations but continues the orator he is the elder branch of an ancient and decayed house joined to and repaired by the reward of services done by another thus far the orator done by another yes done by george the seconds old favourite minister the duke of newcastle whose culinary profusion and political inaptitude were alike proverbial—whose inefficiency the efficiency of the first pitt had for such a length of time to struggle with—and whose services consisted in the sacrifice made of his patrimony to his palate and his pride i respect continues the rhetorician the original title and the first purchase of merited wealth and honour through all its descents through all its transfers and all its assignments may such fountains never be dried up—may they ever flow with their original purity and fructify the commonwealth for ages may such fountains never be dried up exclaims the ejaculation poured forth with fervency with almost the solemnity and with at least the sincerity of a prayer may such fountains never be dried up—as if he had not all this while in full view a fountain of this sort the patrimony of the crown all but dried up and that almost a century before the utterance of this prayer as if anything could operate more speedily or more effectually towards the drying up of all such fountains than the acting up to those laws of profusion to the keeping of which it was the object of this prayer to incline mens hearts proposition    if it be admitted that the masses of emolument respectively attached to the great efficient offices are not excessive this admission will be sufficient to justify the possessors of them in putting into their pockets additional masses of emolument to an unlimited amount on condition of creating or keeping on foot inefficient offices to which such additional masses of emolument shall respectively stand attached proof if i were to give judgment says he with regard to this country i do not think the great offices of the state to be overpaid when the proportion between reward and service resumes he is our object we must always consider of what nature the service is and what sort of men they are who are to perform it what is just payment for one kind of labour and full encouragement for one kind of talents is fraud and discouragement to others observations true enough but what is it to the purpose and what is it that it amounts to and what is it that by volumes of phrases thus floating in the air would be proved not overpaid for the purpose of the argument let it pass not overpaid admitted but does it follow that they are underpaid £ 000 ayear or £ 000 ayear not excessive good but does it follow that £  000 ayear or that £  000 ayear must be added proposition    to justify the leaving to the possessors of public offices in an unlimited number the power of putting each into his own pocket and into the pockets of his relatives and friends and dependents and their respective descendents such supplemental masses of emolument each to an unlimited amount it is sufficient to point out one office and one class of offices which present a reasonable claim to larger masses of emolument than what are attached to the rest proof many of the great officers have much duty to do and much expense to maintain a secretary of state for instance must not appear sordid in the eyes of ministers of other nations neither ought our ministers abroad to appear contemptible in the courts where they reside in all offices of duty continues he there is almost necessarily a great neglect of all domestic affairs a person in high office can rarely take a view of his familyhouse if he sees that the state takes no detriment the state must see that his affairs should take as little proposition    in the case of a real efficient office no mass of emolument which either is or can be attached to it ever is or ever can be too great proofs i am not says he possessed of an exact measure between real service and its reward i am continues he very sure that states do sometimes receive services which it is hardly in their power to reward according to their worth i do not continues he think the great efficient officers of the state to be overpaid he edmund burke who in so many words has just been saying if i knew of any real efficient office which did possess exorbitant emoluments i should be extremely desirous of reducing them others continues he may know of them i do not observations of the sincerity of this declaration no question need be made if so it had been that any such office possessing     emoluments which in his eyes were exorbitant had been known to him a desire and that an extreme one of reducing those exorbitant emoluments would have been the result of such knowledge but in his eyes no such emoluments could be exorbitant therefore in his breast the formation of such desire must notwithstanding the extreme desire he could not but have had to form such a desire have been impossible at that moment and for the purpose of the argument such was the ignorance of edmund burke that he was not possessed of i e he knew not of an exact common measure between real service and its reward but except edmund burke no man is thus ignorant any more than edmund burke himself could be at any other time than that in which such ignorance had its convenience between real service and its reward the exact common measure is the least quantity of the matter of reward that he who is able to render the service consents to take in return for it this is the measure of all prices this is the measure of the value of all good things that are at once valuable and tangible this is the measure of the value of all labour by which things tangible are produced as also of all labour by which though nothing tangible is produced valuable service in some other shape is rendered this was the common measure by which the exact value had been assigned to the coat he had on his back this was the exact common measure of the value of those real services which had been rendered him by the person or persons by whom his coat had by means of one kind of brush and his shoes by means of two others been qualified for their attendance on the lips by which this brilliant bubble was blown out but says the sophist or some disciple for him there is no analogy says he between the service rendered to the public by a minister of state and the service rendered to one individual by another individual who removes extraneous matter from his coat or puts a polish upon his shoes o yes there is—and to the purpose here in question analogy quite sufficient—   they stand upon the same ground the two services in point of economy there is no more economy in paying £  000 ayear for the wearer of the coat if he can be had for nothing than in paying £ 0 for a coat itself if it can be had for £ 0 for the wearer of the coat—i mean of course for his services his services—i mean his services to the public if so it be that he be capable of rendering any but the misfortune is that when once the reward for service has swelled to any such pitch any question about the service itself—what is it what does it consist in who is it that is to render it what desire or what means has he of rendering it of rendering to the public that sort of service or any sort of service any question of this sort becomes a joke where sinecures and those high situations in which they have now and then become the subjects of conversation among great characters are taken for the subject of conversation among little characters in their low situations questions and answers are apt to become giddy and to turn round in a circle what are sinecures of £  000 ayear good for—to maintain the sinecurists what are the sinecurists good for—to maintain the sinecures thus on profane ground thus again on sacred ground—what are bishopricks good for—to support bishops what are bishops good for—to support bishopricks   so again as to probability of efficiency and meritoriousness on the part of the service competition—preference given to the best bidder among candidates bidding upon each other under the spur applied by that incentive—competition affords in the instance of the party chosen a better chance of fitness for the office and its services than will in general be afforded by preference given either without a thought about fitness for the service or about merit in any other shape or with thoughts confined to such merit of which parliament is the only theatre and in the composition of which obsequiousness is the principal ingredient and that an indispensable one but of this proposition the truth it is hoped has been rendered sufficiently apparent elsewhere section viii concerning gratuitous service and the profligacy involved in it propositions       proposition   — if a man were to decline receiving at the public expense money which it were in his power to receive without danger either of punishment or of disgrace it would be a conclusive proof that his designs were to endeavour to filch money from the public in some mode that would subject him to danger in one or other of the two shapes or in both proof i will even go so far says he p    as to affirm that if men were willing to serve in such situations viz offices of duty all offices of duty p    without salary they ought not to be permitted to do it ordinary service must be secured by the motives to ordinary integrity i do not hesitate to say that that state which lays its foundation in rare and heroic virtues will be sure to have its superstructure in the basest     profligacy and corruption an honourable and fair profit is the best security against avarice and rapacity as in all things else a lawful and regulated enjoyment is the best security against debauchery and excess observations—if men were willing to serve in such situations without salary they ought not says he to be permitted to do it here we have the theory—the wasteandcorruptiondefending sophists theory what says experience in part i of this tract may be seen a list nor that yet a complete one of men of various classes serving in such situations and not merely without salary but without neat emolument in any shape and as for the not permitting them to do so whether in such nonpermission in whatsoever manner effected whether by prohibition or otherwise there would be any and what use let the reader if any such there be on whom this rhapsody has passed for reason or for reasoning learn from it if he be able ordinary services says the orator must be secured by the motives to ordinary integrity in part i the reader it is hoped has already seen that for the securing of ordinary service to furnish any motive whatever is not in the nature of salary that in so far as ordinary service comes to be rendered it is by apprehension of eventual punishment that it is produced—that all that by salary can ever be done towards the production of it is by engaging a man to subject himself to such eventual punishment and that if so it be that without salary he is content to subject himself to such eventual punishment the service it being ordinary service is not merely as likely but more likely to be produced without salary than with it that state which lays its foundation in rare and heroic virtues says the orator meaning for there is nothing else to which the word virtues can have any application the disposition manifested by him who without salary is willing to serve in such situations now in a disposition of that sort though there be great use there is nothing that can bear the name of virtue for as is sufficiently proved by every morsel a man puts into his mouth and every draught or sip he takes so it is that out of mere utility even though it rise to the height of absolute necessity no such thing as virtue can be made not that in these situations or any of them whether served in with or without salary virtue rising even to heroism may not perhaps by accident be displayed but any such accidental display is quite another business now if even by actual service in such situations no virtue at all is displayed or by the man himself who thus serves is so much as conceived to be displayed whether in the mere willingness so to serve there be any room for rare or heroic virtue may be left to any reasonable person to pronounce proposition    in any office of duty to be willing to serve without salary is to pretend to rare and heroic virtue and is a sure indication of the basest profligacy and corruption proof in all offices of duty says he p    there is almost necessarily a great neglect of all domestic affairs a person in high office can rarely take a view of his family house—i will even go so far as to affirm continues he p    that if men were willing to serve in such situations without salary they ought not to be permitted to do it i do not hesitate to say continues he that that state which lays its foundation in rare and heroic virtues will be sure to have its superstructure in the basest profligacy and corruption observations in part i of this publication may be seen a list though by no means a complete one of offices willingly served not only without salary but even without emolument as also a list of others by and for the obtainment of which men are found who are willing to be out of pocket observations the office of member of the house of commons—the office of delegate of the people in parliament—is that or is it not in the number of his offices of duty is that or is it not in the number of his high offices members of the house of commons as such—the members of the house of commons taken together—have they not in conjunction with their duty more power than the members of administration taken together in the members of the house of commons taken together do not the members of administration taken together behold their judges to whom for their conduct as such they are continually accountable and by whom under the form of an address to the king they are in effect displaceable this assertion then to the absurdity of which men are to be made to shut their eyes by the violence the unhesitating and audacious violence with which it is endeavoured to be driven down their throats—try it try it in the first place upon the members of the house of commons a member of the house of commons who in that his office is willing to serve without salary ought not to be permitted to do it whoever does serve on any such terms is a most base and corrupt profligate from this charge of base and corrupt profligacy having for its proof the fact of a mans performing public duty without salary the impossibility of obtaining any portion of this his specific against corruption may it is hoped according to the orators system serve in the character of an extenuation in a case where the inability is real and unaffected     but within the compass of his knowledge what man public or private can be at any loss to find public men—men of distinguished talents—men even of distinguished eloquence—who in that very station have served and for a longcontinued course of years with as much assiduity as it is possible for men to bestow even for and with the most overflowing measure of reward—serving and toiling with an assiduity equal to that of the most assiduous minister all the time yet without factitious reward in any shape—all the time having at command rewards to the highest amount and even at the public expense of these base and corrupt profligates as edmund burke called them and would have persuaded us to think them i had even began a list—none of them unknown even to edmund burke—when i was stopped at once by a concurring cluster of considerations the personality of the detail my own incompetency for it the room it would have occupied and as it seemed to me the superfluity of it as between individual and individual that without expectation of money or moneys worth in any shape in return it may not happen to an individual to render a service to another—nay even to persevere as towards him in a course of service of any length and degree of constancy and this too without any sort of prejudice to probity not to speak of base and corrupt profligacy is surely more than any man even the orator himself was ever heard to assert why not then to the public at large—to that all comprehensive body of which individuals taken together are component parts for the labour or the selfdenial necessary to the rendering the service to the individual pure sympathy pure of all selfregarding considerations is frequently the sole and being at the same time the efficacious is thereby the selfsufficient motive but when the public is the party to whom the service is rendered in this case in addition to whatsoever emotion of sympathy is called forth by the contemplation of the welfare of this aggregate body in aid of that purely social spring of action comes the prospect of gratification to the selfregarding affection—love of reputation accompanied or not with the love of that power which whether put to use or not reputation brings with her in her hand besides the shape in which he would receive payment for the service if no more than a single individual were the better for it he who renders service to the public receives or at least may not unreasonably expect to receive payment for it in those two other shapes besides yet in the eyes of the orator if he is to be believed so unnatural and incredible is the disposition to be on any occasion content with this treble payment that should any such disposition find any man to manifest it what the orator is quite sure of and insists upon our believing is that that man belongs to the list of base and corrupt profligates such is his sincerity or such his knowledge of human nature after an answer thus conclusive it may be matter of doubt whether the inanity of the arguments considered with reference to the state of things the orator saw at that time before him be worth touching upon as in a magic lantern the scene shifts every moment under his hands on the occasion in question to be of any considerable use the view taken it was necessary should embrace the whole field of official emolument—the whole field of office so in his hands but a page or two before it accordingly did now and without warning the extent of it is shrunk perhaps to that of half a dozen offices perhaps to that of a single office to a single office confined it must be—to a single office viz that of the chief minister if of the plan of hypocrisy he speaks of the sort of despotism he speaks of is in case of success to be the consequence unfair advantage to ostentatious ambition over unpretending service—invidious comparisons—destruction of whatever little unity and agreement may be found among ministers—all these words what is it they amount to—words and nothing more realized they might be—all these supposed disasters and still on the part of the people the question might be—what then what is all that to us—how is it that we should be the worse for it   says a i dont want all this money says b i do here the thing which a is ambitious of is power and power only the thing coveted by b is the same power with the money into the bargain on the part of a where now is the ostentation where the ambition more than on the part of b and if there were where would be the specific mischief of it in any tangible shape   invidious comparisons what is choice without comparison and if invidious meant anything where is the comparison which being made for the purpose of choice is not invidious what is parliamentary debate—what is any debate but a topic of invidious comparisons   destruction of unity and agreement among ministers according to circumstances such destruction is either a misfortune or a blessing misfortune to be sure it is and nothing else with reference to the ten or a dozen persons spoken of but with reference to the people and their interests a destruction of this sort is perhaps the most efficient though it be but a casual check upon misrule in case of that system of misconduct which it is so constantly their interest and almost constantly in their power to persevere in it     affords the only chance—of punishment it cannot be said for of that never for this last half century has there been any chance—but of exposure and in this character the people thanks to able instructors begin to be not altogether insensible to its value but a government in the quondam venetian style—a government in which under the guidance of upstart machiavelism titled and confederated imbecility should lord it over king and people and behind the screen of secresy waste oppression and peculation should find themselves for ever at their ease such was the utopia of edmund burke to dispose men if it be possible to distinguish from solid argument empty froth such as this of edmund burkes—to distinguish it and whenever found to cast it forth from them with the scorn which is its due such has been the object such if they have had any has been the use of these four or five last paragraphs section ix a prophecy and by burke—the king will swallow up the whole substance of the people proposition    the king with the advice and consent of lords and commons will infallibly one of these days possess himself of the whole property of the country proof for says he p    as wealth is power so all power will infallibly draw wealth to itself by some means or other and when men are left no way of ascertaining their profits but by their means of obtaining them those means continues he but the argument it will be seen required him to say those profits will be increased to infinity this is true continues he in all the parts of administration as well as in the whole observations of these doctrines—i mean of the exposure thus made of them—the use is to show what extravagances imagination is apt to launch into where to bring down an ignis fatuus for the defence of an indefensible proposition it mounts without rudder or compass into the region of vague and aërial generalities the result to any such extent as that in which for the purpose of the moment the sophist tried or pretended to regard it as infallible is as far let us hope from being in any degree a probable one as at another time he would have been from speaking of it as such in the situation of chief minister or in any other situation if by means of an artifice which long before it had travelled any considerable length in the tract of success must have become transparent and visible to the whole people it depended upon a single individual to possess himself of the whole power and by means of it the whole wealth of the country what is it that should have prevented this conquest of the whole wealth from having been achieved—achieved ages ago by those who have had the whole power in their hands to the power that exists in the hands of the members of the sovereignty as such—to this power is to be ascribed as to its cause the aggregate mass of the several portions of the matter of wealth which in their individual capacities are at any given point of time respectively possessed by them to the power itself there are not any legal limits there ought not to be any but to the aggregate mass of wealth actually possessed by them how excessive soever limits there always are limits comparatively narrow and at all times seeing what that mass is we see what those limits are the king with the advice and consent of the lords and commons might if such were his pleasure might viz by act of parliament take into his hands the whole wealth of the country and share it between himself and them nothing could be more correctly lawful but as few things would be more manifestly inexpedient it is what never has been done and what nobody sane or insane is afraid of seeing done not but that the advances made towards this point of consummation have been somewhat nearer than could have been wished and in this way as in every other in the eyes of those who profit by what is wrong whatever is is right yes and not only right but necessary but of the necessity where lies the proof here as elsewhere it lies in the existence of the practice which where the thing to be proved is the necessity of that same practice is according to the logic of practical men proof abundantly sufficient pressing on the people with so heavy a pressure as this vast portion of their burthen does on what ground is it that it is concluded to be to wit in the whole of it necessary on this ground viz that it is—that in the whole of it it is—customary and how came it to be customary because those whose interest it was to make it as great as possible as great as the people would endure to see it made found they had power and without preponderant inconvenience in the shape of danger to themselves viz from discontent on the part of the people to make it what it is this power—the word power being here taken in the practical sense—is all that to the purpose here in question has ever been attended to as to need demand in respect of public utility—of that utility which is such with reference to the interest of the whole people—need or necessity in this sense never     is—never has been—felt to be worth a thought as to all those things in respect to which it is the interest of rulers that the mode of government should be bad it of course always has been and of course always will be as bad as in their judgment the people will quietly endure to see it this economy bill of edmund burke for example was it produced by virtue by public spirit on the part of edmund burke no nor so much as by policy alone—if by policy be meant any spontaneous policy on his part how personal soever and pure of public spirit towards the production of this measure such as it is prudence meaning apprehension of nearer inconvenience howsoever assisted by policy meaning hope of more or less distant power with its concomitant sweets operated and with no small force as it should seem on his mind the proof is in certain petitions which he speaks of as to these petitions they are such as could not have been all of them of his calling forth at least not all of them of his dictating since some of them were troublesome to him amongst the things called for by them was in the instance of several of them the thing which in this place is more particularly in question viz the reduction of exorbitant emoluments to efficient offices this though spoken of by him as an article which seems to be a specific object in several of the petitions is an object with which he expressly declares himself not able to intermeddle section x gratuitous service burkes objections to it reputed—necker—burkes eastindia bill the orator continues—if any individual were to decline his appointments it might continues he p    give an unfair advantage to ostentatious ambition over unpretending service might breed invidious comparisons it might tend to destroy whatever little unity and agreement may be found among ministers and after all when an ambitious man had run down his competitors by a fallacious show of disinterestedness and fixed himself in power by that means what security is there that he would not change his course and claim as an indemnity ten times more than he has given up to these arguments such as they are against gratuitous service my answer so far as regards the plan above alluded to is a simple and decisive one to the plan of adequate salary coupled with sale so far as applicable for the account of the public with the benefit of competition they have not any of them any application for ostentation under that plan there is no room the retrenchment whatever it may amount to being to all competitors matter of necessity—to none more than another matter of choice and if it be in this ostentation that the two other alleged mischiefs whatever they may be meant to be denoted by the words invidious comparison and destruction of unity have their supposed source the ostentation being out of the case so will these other supposed mischiefs be likewise here to speak in his own words there would be no such declining—no such unfair advantage—no such peculiarly invidious comparison—no such mischievous destruction of unity and agreement—no such running down of competitors for one and the same call would be given to all competitors—no such selffixation of one man alone in power and by means peculiar to himself and after all continues he as above and after all when an ambitious man had run down his competitors by a fallacious show of disinterestedness and fixed himself in power by that means what security is there that he would not change his course and claim as an indemnity more than he has given up gratuitous official service—and under the name of gratuitous official service reduction of official emolument being the object still contended against here we have a quite new argument till now it was in other shapes though indeed in all manner of shapes other than that of frugality that in case of any such reduction the service was to suffer now it is in the shape even of frugality itself     whatsoever a man the sort of man in question gives up in appearance in reality says our sophist he will take to himself ten times more to the above proposed plan of retrenchment the objection such as it is has not it must have been seen already and for the reasons already given any the slightest application but even with reference to the then existing state of things what could be more extravagant on the part of the orator suppose on this occasion any the smallest particle of thought and at the same time of sincerity what must have been the opinion entertained by him of the state of government in this country and how profound at the same time his indifference to it the state of government such that on so easy a condition as the giving up a mass of lawful emolument for a time a man might make sure of gaining in the way of base profligacy and corruption ten times as much in the long run and this sort of speculation promising and feasible enough not only to be worth guarding against but to be necessary to be guarded against and that at such an expense as that of making an allcomprehensive addition to the mass of official emolument and this too an addition without bounds oh no cries the orator not make sure—those were no words of mine claim was my word—claim and nothing more oh yes mr orator claim was indeed the word you used but make sure was the idea it was your object to convey by it for sure enough where public money is the subject it is only by what a man gets and not by what he claims and without getting it that any mischief can be done in writing no man ever weighed his words in nicer scales no author ever blotted more to find for each occasion a set of words that shall comprehend two meanings—one for attack another in case of necessity for retreat and selfdefence such throughout is the study of the rhetorician whom devotion to a party reduced to that species and degree of servitude with which sincerity is incompatible—in this sinister art no man ever laboured more—no man surely ever made a greater proficiency—no man one may venture to say ever made so great a proficiency as this edmund burke here we have a picture shall we say or a plan of machiavelism sketched out by his own hand in itself it is but a loose sketch for by anything like a complete and correct draught too much would have been brought to view but in its exact shape no small part and in outline the whole was already in his own breast nor so far as concerned his own portrait was it from fancy but from the lookingglass that he drew the treasury bench—the castle of misrule—stood before him shameconomy an instrument of young ambition the ladder by which it was to be scaled already the ladder was in his hand a bill for independence and so forth—and for economical reformation and so forth—was the name—the wordy name—he had found for it at the end of a long contest the ladder performed its service but when the fortress was in his hands a buttress was deemed necessary to enable him to maintain his ground the buttress fell and he in it and along with it the buttress fell and great was the fall thereof and what was this buttress few readers can be at a loss for it four years after when under the pressure of the mass of corruption in the hands of the secret advisers of the editor illegible word they betook themselves for relief he and his party not to the legitimate influence of the people as it would have been manifested in an equalized representation accompanied with the exclusion of dependent votes but to a countermass of corruption to be drawn from the east indies—it was to the fallacious show of disinterestedness made by this his economy bill already carried and turned into an act that he trusted for that blind support which he had looked for at the hands of a supposed blinded people the result is known to everybody as to the picture we here see him drawing it was at the time of his thus drawing it half history half prophecy the prophetic part left unfinished as everything in the shape of prophecy must necessarily be the picture dramatized the characters and other objects in it might stand as follows—   ambitious man edmund burke   fallacious show of disinterestedness the show made by this economy bill of his with the inconsiderable retrenchments £ 0000 ayear or some such matter effected by it   competitors run down by means of it in addition to the force derived from other sources such as the unpopularity and ill success of the american war together with the exertions of arbitrary vengeance in the case of wilkes c lord north and his ministry then in power with the secret advisers of the crown for their support   instrument attempted to be made for the fixing himself in power burkes east india bill a steadiment containing in it a sort of pump contrived for drawing from the east indies the matter of wealth to be applied in the character of matter of corruption by hands of his own choice to the purpose of engaging a sufficient number of workmen for the fixing him and his party as above to wit with such a force of resistance as it should not be in the power of the secret advisers of  00 the crown with all the assistance they could get from the people to overcome as to the particular course which for the purpose of reaping the fruits of his conquest had this machinery of his succeeded it might have happened to him to take and with the word indemnity in his mouth the quantity of public money he might have claimed—so it is that his grand instrument of steadiment and fixation having failed all these together with so many other quondam future contingencies remain in darkness inscrutable but supposing the indemnity no more than ten times the amount of the sacrifice still would it have fallen short as anybody may see of the ground prepared for it by this his speech some years after viz about the year    0 a decent quantity of public money even though not in office he did contrive to get but forasmuch as for this donation there was a pretence made out of a pamphlet with the help of which the embers of war between britain and france were blown into a flame and for security against anarchy the good people of great britain driven as far as by his pious endeavours they could be driven into the arms of despotism so it was that the bread of sinecure—the sacred shewbread destined and appropriated to the chief priests of the temple of corruption—was not any part of it profaned and diverted to this use reward in the ordinary shape of pension being regarded as applicable to and sufficient for this ordinary service section xi burkes objection to the application of the principle of competition to this purpose—its frivolousness after denying that the great efficient offices are overpaid the service of the public continues he is a thing which cannot be put to auction and struck down to those who will agree to execute it the cheapest cannot why cannot it upon the face of it the proposition bears not so much as the colour of reason nor in the sequel is either substance or colour so much as attempted to be found for it of possibility what is the sort of evidence that in this case he would require would fact have been regarded as admissible the service of the public is a thing which a year afterwards after the orator had been in and out again pitt the second did put up to auction—did strike down to those who would agree to execute it the cheapest and this to such an extent that in comparison of the saving thereby effected whether money or improbity be the article considered the utmost saving so much as projected by this our shamreformer shrinks into insignificance† this it is true the pseudoreformer had not as yet witnessed but there was nothing in it that was not in the most perfect degree obvious what difficulty there was in the business consisted not in the thinking of it but in the doing of it but what the sophist trusted to was the word auction and the sentiment of ridicule which if applied to the subject in question he hoped to find prepared for the reception of it in mens minds mention the word auction the image you present is that of a man with a smirk upon his countenance mounted on the burlesque of a pulpit with a wooden hammer in his hand expatiating upon the virtues—sometimes of statues and pictures—sometimes of chairs and tables the hyperboles employed by orators of that class while expatiating on the virtues of the vendible commodities consigned to their disposal are as he in common with everybody else must have remarked every now and then such as while in some parts of the audience they produce the desired impression excite in the minds of others the idea of the ridiculous but no panegyric that was ever bestowed by any such orator on the picture or the screen of a marquis or a duke had more of exaggeration in it than the pictures which this vender of puffs was so expert at drawing naming them after this or that one of his most noble patrons and originals his piece of still  0  life called the marquis of rockingham—his duke of portland into the picture of which a kneller or a reynolds would have put more thought than nature and art together had been able to force into the original—that original whose closest resemblance to a picture that had thought in it was the property of being vendible—that puppet whose wires after playing for a time so easy ran rusty at last under the hand of mr canning—viewed through the rareeshow glass of edmund burke these and so many other great characters appear no less fit for their high situations than the counsellors of king solomon when with punch for their interpreter on the drawing up of the curtain they are displayed in the act of paying tributes of wisdom to the wise competition—this word would not as auction so well did serve the sophists purpose to the word competition no smirk stands associated—no pulpit—no hammer—competition—a power the virtues of which had already been so well displayed by adam smith not to speak of sir james stewart in competition he beheld that security against waste and corruption which would have been mortal to his views section xii concluding observations—burke why thus examined erasmus wrote an eulogium on folly but erasmus was in jest edmund burke wrote an eulogium—he wrote this eulogium—on peculation—and edmund burke was serious in thus exhibiting the orator in one of those fits of extravagance to which he was but too subject—in exhibiting the orators own figure according to the monstrous caricature we have seen him drawing of himself viz that of a man in whose estimation nothing but money has any value—a man by whom all breasts that have anything in them that is not sordid are to be marked out as fit objects of abhorrence—let me not be accused of wasting time and paper it is out of this his book—meaning always such parts of it as are found suitable that our statesmen of the present day may be seen taking their lessons it is out of this his garden of sweet flowers that the still existing finance committee—and without acknowledgment—have culled as we have seen a chaplet wherewith to decorate their brows it is in this his school that by another right honourable teacher of economy those maxims have certainly been found and to all appearance learnt which we shall come to presently had the purpose of his argument or of his life required it—here in this very place instead of declaiming and writing for money and trying to persuade men that nothing but money is of any value the orator might and naturally would have declared against money—shown in the way that so many other declaimers have shown that it is of no value that it is even worse than useless and that without the basest profligacy and corruption no man—no public man at least—can ever get or try to get any of it in exaggerations improbity or folly may behold a use on either side but to common honesty nothing is here needful but common sense money is a good thing—a very good thing indeed and if it were not a good thing scarce would anything else be for there are few good things which a man may not get by means of it—get either in exchange for it or what is still better even without parting with it but the misfortune is that from us the people for paying orators of the class of edmund burke it is not to be had without our being forced to part with it and if the orator suffer in case of his not having it—in case of his never having got so much of it as he could have wished we the people who after having had it find ourselves for the use and benefit of the orator forced to part with it suffer still more thence it is that if there be anything else which the people not feeling themselves forced to part with it the orator can persuade himself to be satisfied with so much the better upon this plan everybody is satisfied—orator and people both whereas upon the orators plan only one of the parties is satisfied viz the orator—the orator who is the agent and spokesman of the ruling few while the other party viz we the people are suffering and grumbling and as it should seem not altogether without reason for we are the many and in our number consists our title to regard a very unpretending title but not the less a good and sufficient one  0  paper vi— defence of economy against the right honourable george rose first published in      advertisement while committing to the press so free an examination as this will be found to be of mr roses declared principles as published by him on the subject of public expenditure there would as it strikes me be something ungenerous at least if not unjust in the omission were i not to make acknowledgment as without any communication direct or indirect with the right honourable gentleman i hereby do of such proofs of due regard for economy as by incidents falling exclusively within my own observation have been furnished by his practice of the measures alluded to—two in number—both were in a very considerable degree important one of them in respect of extent as well as difficulty preeminently so and on both occasions in his instance as well as that of mr pitt by such tokens as in the nature of the case could not have left room for doubt in the mind of any person in any situation it fell in my way to be assured that a real regard for economy forming a striking contrast with the mixture of waste corruption and dark despotism which in one of the two cases has since been exemplified was an actuating motive and that with the spontaneously expressed desire of receiving those suggestions which had not circumstances above their controul stood in the way would accordingly have been received any such design on the parts of either of them as that of giving on the particular occasions in question any such increase as on one of those occasions has since been given to corruptive influence was plainly incompatible as to the tract itself with the exception of a few inconsiderable verbal alterations which the nature of the case necessitated it is exactly in the state in which it was written which was in the months of april and may    0 for contents vide suprà p     section i introduction having taken my leave of the departed orator i have now to pay my obeisance to the surviving statesman who though in the line of politics not always conjoined with him will in the track of principle be on the ground here in question found as there has already been occasion to observe separated from him by no great distance for principles such as on this same ground may serve as a standard for comparison i must on this occasion as on that other take leave to refer the reader to these closely compressed thoughts which are about to take their chance for obtaining a small portion of his notice vide advertisement p     for the convenience of such persons whose taste or whose disposable time shrinks from any such mass as would be formed in the union of all three papers i detach in advance these two parts from that which had been intended to precede them but forasmuch as throughout this third part reference either express or tacit is all along unavoidably made to the principles laid down in the postponed part and enforced by that by which this one has now lately been preceded i find myself in this respect reduced to the necessity of supposing or at least writing as i should do if i supposed the postponed as well as the already published part to have already made its experiment upon the readers patience  0  in the production of edmund burke the quantity of matter taken for the subject of examination was that which happened to be contained between the   d and   th pages both inclusive within the pages designated by the same numbers happens to be contained the only part of mr roses work to which the like tribute of unremitted attention has on the present occasion been paid a coincidence rather more material is—that of the discrepancy not to say the repugnancy which in this instance as in that will if i do not greatly deceive myself be seen to have place—by the one architect as by the other to the same virtue viz economy a temple erected in the first part beaten down in the second† section ii mr roses pleas in bar to economy plea  — vastness of the expenditure   the first of his pleas thus pleaded in bar to any defalcations that might be proposed to be made from the mass of public burdens is that which with that ingenuity which will not pass unobserved has been made out of the very magnitude of the mass the whole revenue of great britain says the right honourable gentleman p    is more than £ 0000000 ayear the charge on which of £   000 for pensions and sinecure employments at home and abroad is between three farthings and one penny in the pound by the extinction therefore of all sinecures and pensions a person paying taxes to the amount of £ 0 ayear would save about  s such a saving continues he we who are we are far from thinking should be treated as trifling or insignificant it would ill become the author to do so on the other hand how infinitely short would this fall of the expectation that has been held out but if continues he from the total sum received from sinecures places and pensions deduction were made of such as have been given as rewards for public services the amount would be very greatly reduced pensions to foreign ministers in particular whose appointments are hardly in any instance sufficient for their maintenance it is to sinecures and pensions alone that this argument has by the ingenious author been applied to the extra pay of overpaid places not but applying as it does to both branches of expenditure and with equal force it would be wronging the argument not to give to both of them the full benefit of it now true it is that were this argument to be received in the character here proposed for it it would it must be confessed be a very convenient one and save others in abundance for every  s ayear which you wish to give away without any public use contrive to spend £ 0 ayear for which such a use or the appearance of such a use can be found and your justification is then made meantime some reasoners there are to whom the contrary inference would appear the more reasonable one—unnecessary or even necessary the heavier the mass of our burdens is already the less able are we to bear any addition to it or even this or that existing part of it in my own view of the matter i must confess the consideration of the magnitude of the mass is a consideration to which on a question such as the present there can be no necessity nor any great use in recurring whatsoever it be that at the expense of the people is by the trustees of the people given to this or that individual without equivalent and that an adequate one—i mean without either receiving or reasonable expectation of receiving on account of the public a preponderate advantage is so much waste—and if given with eyes open to the misapplication of it so much peculation when by indictment a man is prosecuted for theft or by bill in equity for a breach of trust in the way of peculation that of the pecuniary circumstances of the party to whose prejudice the act of dishonesty has operated any account should be taken is never looked upon as necessary or so much as admissible and not being so on that individual scale i see not why it should be so on this allcomprehensive scale but if so it were that i found myself under an obligation of bringing this topic to view it seems to me that in the vastness of the existing burdens i should be more apt to view an argument for decreasing it than either for giving increase to it or so much as keeping it from decrease the misfortune is that without being thus expressed this consideration has in experience operated and with too much effect in  0  disposing the people to acquiesce without remonstrance under unnecessary pressure turn over the book of history you will find that the heavier the burdens have been with which the people have been loaded the greater the facility that has been found for rendering the load still heavier or what comes to the same thing look backward and you will find that the more considerable the load they had been accustomed to the greater was the difficulty that was experienced in persuading them to submit though it were but for a year or two to any addition to it if as the facility of engaging them to submit to increased burdens increased the suffering produced by those burdens diminished this disposition of mind would be as desirable as it is natural but unfortunately this is not the case by heaping law taxes upon law taxes and law fees upon law fees you may ruin a thousand families one year two thousand the next year and so on and the greater the number that are thus ruined the better enabled and the better satisfied will the man of finance and the man of law be to go on receiving more and more it will be to both of them as it has been to both of them and to both in one a motion of course but it does not appear or to speak intelligibly to learned gentlemen non constat that when the number thus ruined is two thousand the affliction is to each or any of them lighter than when the number was but one thousand for forming a gag to stop complaints in the mouth of the party tormented as well as a callus to case the heart of the tormentor precedent is indeed a mighty good thing and the more manifold the precedent the more effective the gag as well as the harder the callus and the latter use is that to which these several pleas against economy and this first plea in particular seems more especially destined and adapted the misfortune is that by the callus formed round the one heart the affliction that rends the other is not assuaged oh but sir cries somebody what is it you are about all this while and how sadly have you been misrepresenting the right honour able gentleman here are you imputing to him this sad purpose and that immediately after having read and passed over fie upon you a paragraph in which he tells you himself the purpose he had in view and that a very different one true it is that i have read that paragraph but as to the purpose spoken of in it i feel myself under a sort of embarrassment which i shall proceed to state the opinion already alluded to says the paragraph p    as prevailing to a certain extent that if sinecures and pensions were entirely suppressed the burdens of the country would be instantly lightened to a great amount and by some entertained that they would in that case be removed altogether renders it necessary that a comparison should be made of the beforementioned total viz of sinecures and pensions large as it is with the amount of the taxes raised upon the people now then—what is expressly averred here is—that an opinion to the purpose in question is prevailing to a certain extent what seems to be insinuated—i should rather say—what from the idea of necessity thus brought to view some readers might be apt to imagine is—that the purpose the right honourable gentleman had in view was only the setting the people right in respect of this supposed prevalent error and not the persuading the imposers of public burdens to consider the enormity of the mass as affording an argument for not diminishing it now then as to this supposed error what seems to me is that it must have been in some vision or some dream and nowhere else that any persons not in the care of a keeper could have presented themselves to the conception of the right honourable gentleman as entertaining it the interest of the debt paid without money—the expense of the army defrayed without money—the expense of the navy defrayed without money—all this not to speak of anything more must have been believed by any person in whose mind any such opinion should prevail as that if sinecures and pensions were suppressed the burdens of this country would be removed altogether another thing that passes my comprehension is how should it be that supposing them to have found to a certain extent whatever that extent be—that is to a certain number whatever that number be—a set of people among whom any such opinion was prevalent how it should be that it should have entered into their conception otherwise than in dream or vision as above that for the purpose of setting right any such people and weaning them from their error there could be either necessity or use in bringing forward any such ingenious and accurate calculation as that which has just been seen and which he was thereupon immediately about to treat us with as if supposing the existence of any such swine such pearls could be of any the smallest use to them if to so right honourable a gentleman anything could be attributed that would bear any such appellation as that of artifice—no i will not call it artifice—i will call it astutia—and then everything will be as it should be—what on an occasion such as this one should be tempted to suppose is that the agreement thus brought forward and put in front of the battle was the result of a consulation  0  with some learned or quondam learned as well as right honourable or honourable gentlemen profoundly learned in that superior and purer branch of the law called equity one of the rules of which is that in the drawing of the initiative instrument called a bill to entitle yourself to ask a question of the defendant you must in the first place impute to him the having told some story or other no matter how extravagant which he never told to serve him in the character of a pretence for defrauding the orator your client of his due he himself neither having heard of the defendants ever saying any such thing nor believing him to have ever said it which falsehood having thus with all due regularity been come out with serves by way of licence as well as introduction to whatsoever other falsehoods mixed with whatsoever truths it may have been deemed convenient to introduce section iii plea  — need of provision for decayed nobility c   the next plea is that which is founded on the alleged necessity of making provision for noble and respectable families fallen into decay the pension list continues the right honourable advocate p    also contains provisions for noble and respectable families fallen into decay this is however continues he an exertion of national generosity if not of justice which the most scrupulous economist will hardly consider as improper something continues he must certainly be allowed for mere favour but when the instances are clearly improper and it is not meant to contend there are no such they are at least open to public animadversion as they are now regularly laid before parliament and printed from time to time which certainly affords a considerable if not an effectual check against abuse thus far the right honourable gentleman for my own part i am doomed to fall into sad disgrace with him the conception entertained by him of any the most scrupulous sort of person in the character of an economist is far outstripped by me under what denomination it may be my lot to fall in his black dictionary i know not if it were that of jacobin or leveller it would be no surprise to me of the sort of justice which can so much as permit not to speak of commanding any such disposal of public money i have no conception nor yet of generosity unless it be of that pernicious and hypocritical sort which gratifies itself at the expense of justice my protest is in the first place against the principle as being founded on oppressive extortion and breach of trust as affording encouragement to extravagance and to every vice that is fed by extravagance as being still unjustifiable even though there were a certainty of its not having either vice or extravagance for its consequence any more than for its cause my next objection is to the amount as being without limit as scorning all limit and being of itself capable of effecting a revolution in the state of property if it did not in a revolution in the state of power find a preventive remedy i in the first place as to principle now to a provision of the sort in question what is it that according to the right honourable gentlemans law is to constitute a mans title it is decay—mere decay—the having fallen into decay i e the being at the time in question in a state of indigence mark well that to indigence at that degree to which the next degree is death or at least disease his argument does not look for indigence in that shape provision is made already—made to wit by the species of tax called the poor rates a tax which even by the right honourable gentleman himself on whose feelings public burdens sit thus lightly has never been spoken of as a light one this provision then is not the sort and degree of provision he has in view of the sort and degree of provision which he has in view what more adequate or unexceptionable description can be given than that which has been given in and by his own words for noble families then it must be noble for respectable families it must be respectable against provision of even the scantiest kind an objection that by many has been regarded as a peremptory one is that it operates as a provision for idleness and extravagance by myself any more than by the right honourable gentleman it has never been regarded in that light not seeing that so long as it is confined to what is absolutely necessary to keep a person alive and free from disease and given on condition of working where work can be made profitable and beyond this i undertake not for the defence of it subsistence is capable of acting to any preponderantly formidable extent in that character and considering that without some such provision multitudes there are that by infirmity the result of infamy or decrepitude or disease would without any default of their own be exposed to perish and would accordingly perish by lingering disease or famine but by any such provision neither the generosity of the right honourable gentleman nor so much as his justice is to be satisfied for noble families satisfied it never can be by anything less than a noble provision for respectable  0  families by anything less than a respectable one in the provision already made by law—a provision neither limited nor unfortunately for the country capable of being limited—some have viewed a gulf capable of itself of swallowing up one of these days the whole produce of national industry of any such disaster i have not for my own part any serious apprehension but of the generosity of the right honourable gentleman or by whatever other name this article in the catalogue of his virtues be to be called of this virtue if once admitted to operate and in the character of a principle set the law to practice i cannot but regard this catastrophe as an inevitable consequence ii for now let us think a little of the amount and to this the right honourable gentleman has not attempted to set any limits vain indeed would have been any such attempt the principle scorns all limits taken by itself nobility—had that been the only source of demand on this score—would not have scorned all limits noble families for example so many—in each family generations reckoning downwards from each peer to be regarded as still noble so many—minimum of the pension to each individual in a state of decay according to the rank occupied by the family in the scale of the peerage is so much here would have been one exercise for the right honourable gentlemans skill in figures but neither for the right honourable gentlemans generosity nor for his justice is it enough that for noble families in decay a noble provision be thus kept up for respectable families in the same state there must moreover be a respectable one here all powers of calculation even those of the right honourable gentleman would find themselves at a stand for the moment let me take the liberty of proposing for them an analogous though a somewhat different exercise by the taxes as they stand at present—i presume it is out of taxes and not out of heavendropped manna or heavendropped quails that according to his plan the noble and the respectable provision would be to be made—by the taxes as they stand at present a certain number of families are every year pressed down from a state of independence into a state of pauper and parochiallysupported indigence now then for every branch of a noble and respectable family which by the noble or respectable provision respectively is kept above indigence—meaning that which to the noble or respectable family would have been indigence—how many branches that without being either noble or respectable or as yet independent would be pressed down into that which really is indigence if thought be too much to ask for a calculation of this sort from a right honourable hand in which figures are so plenty and so much at command might at any rate be not undeserving it is hoped of a few figures another exercise for the mathematics of the right honourable gentleman the respectable families—let them for the moment be laid out of the question—let the calculation still confine itself to the noble ones after observations taken of the rate of the increase given to nobility by his still present majesty or even of that part of it that was given with the advice of the right honourable gentlemans departed hero let him with cocker in his hand carry on the increase through a portion of future contingent time considering that neither scotland nor ireland nor anything that is noble in either kingdom can on this occasion be left out of the account let him inform us what are the number of years that will have elapsed antecedently to that point of time at which the amount of the provision made on his plan for noble decay will have outstripped that of the provision at the same time made for ignoble indigence oh but you are confounding classes—you are confounding species this is the way with you jacobins and you levellers you confound every thing the noble and respectable families are of one species the ignoble and unrespectable families are of another the ignoble and unrespectable families are of the species that are sent to walcheren the noble and respectable families are of the species that send them there the families whose branches are to be preserved from decay are those whose feelings have a right to be consulted the families that are to be helped on in the road to ruin are those whose feelings have no such right a smile beams on the countenance of the right honourable gentleman he calls for his extinct peerage he foresees his triumph he beholds the confusion of the jacobin when at the end of the calculation it has been made as plain as figures can make anything how many centuries will have elapsed before any such outstripping can have taken place well then having by the success of the operation thus performed upon the noble families given vigour to his hand let him try it upon the respectable ones what has just been seen is what the right honourable gentleman has not anywhere said true—but it is what i fear much from the beginning of this pamphlet to the end of it is but too much like what he has thought something says the right honourable gentleman such is his candour something must certainly be allowed for mere favour good sir you already forget your own argument it is all mere favour or it is none  0  decay not service decay not merit in any shape real or imagined was your title decay by what cause soever produced as well as in whatsoever quantity produced by eating and drinking—produced by carrying about seraglios in foreign missions—produced by horseracing—produced by dice or e o is decay less decay is nobility the less noble is respectability i mean your sort of respectability—the respectability which consists in having or spending money of ones own or other peoples the less respectable talk of justice and injustice so long as any one individual is whether on the score of nobility or of respectability preserved in this way from decay it is not mere disfavour it is no better than mere injustice to refuse it to any other but where the instances are clearly improper—and it is not meant continues the right honourable gentleman to contend that there are no such they are at least open to public animadversion good sir once more your candour carries you too far what you do not mean to contend for i must even i indeed sir there are not any such instances your principle admitted there cannot be any they are at least open to public animadversion your pardon sir indeed they are not individually they are not they are not common to the public two things altogether necessary to the purpose are wanting viz information and time mr brown has £  00 ayear two miss vandals have £ 00 who knows who this mr brown or those miss vandals are at the moment when the necessity of providing for noble or respectable decay in the person or persons of this mr brown or these miss vandals has by some noble or right honourable person been whispered into the royal ear the whisperer knows but the next moment nobody knows even now there are more of them than the public patience can endure so much as to count and shall we talk of scrutiny more than can be so much as counted even now and what shall we say when your principle being in full operation there are with us in england as you know when there were in france enough of them to fill a red book and that like the army list no small book of themselves no sir individually open to public animadversion they are not even now much less at the time in question would they be but in the lump in the principle on which they are proposed to be multiplied and that to infinity they are open to animadversion and on this consideration it is that the presumption betrayed by the present weak and inadequate attempt at animadversion has found its cause on the wing who can think to catch who can so much as follow all such wasps but in the egg if the people have but spirit enough they may be crushed something says the candour of the right honourable gentleman must be allowed for mere favour yes and something must also he allowed for an affection of an opposite nature this candour of his shall not go unrequited it shall be paid for in the same coin if profusion be as it appears to be all that is meant by the abuse a check that abuse certainly has—and that check but too certainly is considerable though unhappily it is far from being an effectual one of itself profusion were that the whole of the disorder would have no check but complicated as it is with another disorder corruption in that other disorder odd as the case may seem at the first mention of it it does find a sort of a check the diarrhæa finds in the septic diathesis a sort of astringent the paradox will disappear immediately when it happened that the right honourable gentleman by whom the case of the sprig of decayed nobility or respectability had been submitted to royal generosity or royal justice had been voting on the improper side the instance could any such hopeless intrusion be supposed on the part of the right honourable gentleman would be one of the clearly improper ones and the decay would be left to its own natural course when so it happened that on all occasions the patron had properly understood as in duty i mean in loyalty every such patron is bound to understand what on each occasion is the proper side the decay would find its proper preservative and the profusion would be left to the operation of that check with the virtue of which the right honourable gentleman is so nearly satisfied i mean that certainly considerable if not effectual check against abuse which is afforded by the pensions forming when the mischief is past remedy part and parcel of that almost completely unintelligible and effectually inscrutable mass of information or noninformation which is now so regularly laid before parliament section iv plea  — need of subsistence for official persons   a third plea is that which is composed of the alleged nonexcess or even insufficiency of official incomes if we look to official incomes it will be found they are in most cases says the right honourable gentleman barely equal to the moderate and even the necessary expenses of the parties in many instances they are actually insufficient for these  0  under the modest guise of a plea against retrenchment we have here a plea for increase and that again an inexhaustible one in this plea two points present a more particular call for observation one consists in the indefiniteness and thence in the universality of the terms by which the incomes in question and thence the incomists are designated by official incomes unless some word of limitation be annexed—and no such word is annexed—must be understood all official incomes less than all cannot be meant for if anything less be meant the argument falls short of its undissembled purpose in most cases scantiness being asserted and in many insufficiency—and that even without a view to the single purpose of a bare subsistence whether there be any of these incomes that are more than barely equal to that object is left to conjecture   the other the word necessary viz in the application here made of it to a mass of expenses that are to be defrayed at the public charge an aggregate composed of the several individual expenditures of all these several official persons and when the present mr rose comes to be in the situation poverty excepted of the late mr pitt let any one calculate whose skill in calculation is equal to the task how many are the hundreds of thousands not to say the millions ayear that will depend on the construction of these two words to assist us in this calculation an example though unfortunately but one has been afforded us by the right honourable gentleman and so far as this carries us it will appear that even where by the frugality of the right honourable gentleman it is confined to what is necessary the inflexibility of this virtue not suffering it to rise to so high a pitch as even to be moderate what in speaking of an official person is meant by his expense is composed of the official income whatever it be which he finds provided for it by law together with a capital to the amount of between eight and nine years purchase of it or reckoning by the year about    per cent upon it the persons own patrimony if he happens to have any included or not included but of this under another head section v plea  — need of money for making fortunes for official persons and their families   the next plea is that which is founded on the alleged necessity of enabling persons in official situations—all persons in all official situations—to provide for their families at the public expense may we not then venture to ask continues the argument from the passage last quoted—may we not then venture to ask whether it is reasonable or whether it would be politic that such persons should after spending a great part of their lives with industry zeal and fidelity in the discharge of trusts and public duties be left afterwards without reward of any sort and their families entirely without provision the skill of the right honourable gentleman in arithmetic is above far above dispute but if we may venture to say as much his logic seems to be not altogether upon a par with it his antecedent as delivered in the last preceding sentence is that the official income of the official man is in many instances insufficient even for his necessary expenses meaning his necessary current expense and in this next sentence the consequent or conclusion drawn is that in plain english and to speak out he ought to be enabled to make his fortune always at the public expense and that to so good a purpose that after his decease his family may in respect of current expenses so long as it continues find itself—in what plight in the same plight we are left to conclude or thereabouts as its founder the official man himself as to the being preserved as long as it lasts—preserved in all its branches from decay—that any such provision would be short of the mark though not to what degree short of the mark is what we are assured of for if the family of an official person be a respectable family and if not what family can be a respectable one if this be admitted trusts or no trusts public duties or no public duties the being kept in a state of perpetual preservation from decay is a right that in the preceding paragraph has been claimed for them by the right honourable gentlemans generosity supported by his justice the form of the argument is indeed rather of the rhetorical than the logical cast—may we not venture to ask the answer is good sir no apology—ask boldly but ask one thing at a time first let us make up the deficiency in respect of current and present expenses and as the supply we are to provide for these dischargers of trusts and duties is to keep pace with their expenditure—with the expenditure of each and every of them for your generosity makes no exception—may we not then venture to ask on our parts for a little breathing time if so then after we have taken breath a little will be the time for entering on the further employment you have found for us viz the making provision for the families of those official and therefore meritorious persons whose industry zeal and fidelity as we have not the honour of being acquainted with them it is impossible for us to dispute  0  to this industry zeal and fidelity the reward which your generosity and justice your reason and your policy have in store for them is doubtless to be proportioned for otherwise those virtues of theirs would as to a part of them more or less considerable be left without reward—virtue left without its reward—and as in the estimate to be formed of the degree in which these several virtues will by the several official and therefore meritorious persons be displayed your policy under the guidance of your generosity will not find itself under any restraint the quantity of the reward will be as little in danger of finding any such limits as would pinch and straiten it the insufficiency of their respective official incomes for the respective necessary expenses of these officially industrious zealous and faithful persons—as such is the title on which the generosity justice reasonableness and policy of the right honourable gentleman rest their right to have their necessary expenses defrayed for them and at the same time their fortunes made for them and as no other man can be so good a judge of what is necessary for a man as the man himself is—there is a sort of comfort in the reflection how small the danger is that upon the principles and plans of the right honourable gentleman virtue in any such shape at least as that of industry zeal and fidelity meaning always official ditto will be left without its reward having got your official situation you spend in it so much ayear as you find necessary having so done thus and then is it that you have entitled yourself to the benefit of the right honourable gentlemans conclusion—his logical conclusion embellished and put into the dress of a rhetorical erotesis—that you are entitled to receive out of the taxes as much more as will secure to your family that provision which in virtue of your industry zeal and fidelity speaking without partiality or with no other partiality than that which according to the headmaster in the school of official economy is a kind of justice it appears to you to deserve after so exemplary a pattern of diffidence as has been set by a right honourable gentleman whose grounds for confidence are so manifest and so unquestionable a plain man who feels no such grounds nor any grounds for any such pleasurable sensation can scarce muster up enough of it to put a question of any kind for fear of being thought encroaching but if any one would save me harmless from that charge i would venture to ask whether it may not have been by a too unqualified adherence to these principles a too rigid adherence to these precepts of the two great masters and without taking the benefit of those precautionary instructions which the prudence or even the example of one of them might if sufficiently studied have furnished them with that their right honourable friend mr steele and the honourable mr villiers and the till the other day honourable mr hunt and the gallant general delancy and the industrious zealous and faithful mr john bowles with his et cæteras and so many other et cæteras were led into those little inaccuracies which time after time have afforded matter of so much though happily as yet fruitless triumph to jacobins levellers and parliamentary reformers it is necessity alone and not inclination that in the performance of the task i have set myself in the school of economy so frequently imposes upon me so great a misfortune as that of being seen to differ from so great a master as the right honourable gentleman and accordingly wherever i am fortunate enough to be able to descry between us anything like a point of coincidence it is with proportionable eagerness that i lay hold of it and endeavour to make the most of it his plan is—that official persons among whom for the purpose in question he includes i presume persons proposed or proposing themselves for official situations should determine for themselves what mass of emolument is sufficient for their own expenses and what for the expenses of their respective families in present and in future now thus far this is exactly my plan thus far then we are agreed but now comes the unfortunate difference my plan it will be seen is that having formed his own calculations each candidate in taking his determination should take it once for all and moreover that as in the case of stores in which instance instead of skilful labour itself the produce of skilful labour has with such wellgrounded approbation on the part of the right honourable gentleman been ever since the time he speaks of† regularly furnished for the public service there should be a competition whereupon that one of them whose judgment concerning what is sufficient for him and his is most favourable to the public interest should unless for and to the extent of special cause to the contrary be accepted thus far my plan but according to the right honourable gentlemans the accepted candidate who without any such competition is to be accepted viz in considerations of that industry zeal and fidelity which will be so sure of being found in him—this accepted candidate after his calculation has been formed and the office with its emolument taken possession of is to have the convenience   0 of remaining at liberty to correct by the light of experience as we shall see the illustrious chief and pattern of all official men did any such errors as the calculation shall from time to time have been found to contain in it by this practical test having ascertained what is necessary for his own present expenses he will have put himself in a condition to determine and ought accordingly to stand charged with the trust and duty of determining what further provision will be necessary for the necessary expenses of his family considered in its several branches present and future contingent for and during the continuance of that portion of time called future time another unfortunate difference is—that according to my plan no exclusion either express or implied is put upon such candidates to whom it may happen to have property or income of their own unable as i am to discover any such office for the trusts and duties of which any such property or income can reasonably be considered as constituting in any point of view a ground of disqualification or to understand how it can be that a hundred ayear should in the case of its being a mans own private money go less far towards the defraying the necessary expenses of him and his than if it were so much public money received in the shape of official emolument out of the public purse what in regard to my official man my plan accordingly assumes is—either that he has more or less property or income of his own or what in my view comes to much the same thing what if anything remains to the official situation after the offer made by him in relation to it has been accepted is in his own judgment sufficient for his expenses necessary and unnecessary upon every imaginable score of this assumption that which seems all along to have been proceeded upon by the right honourable gentlemans plan is exactly the reverse true it is that no disqualification act excluding from official situations all such persons as shall have either property or income is anywhere proposed by him—no nor is so much as any recommendation given by him to the wisdom of the crown in the choice it makes of persons for filling these situations to act as if a law to some such effect were in force but all along the supposition proceeded and argued upon by him is—that there exists not in the quarter in question any such relatively superfluous matter a state entirely without provision is the state in which afterwards to wit after a great part of his life spent by the official person in the discharge of trusts and duties his family is spoken of as being left and it is upon this supposition that at least the policy of the right honourable gentleman not to speak of his humanity grounds itself in the appeal it makes to that same endowment which he beholds as fixed in the breasts of those honourable persons for whose use this lesson of economy is designed would it be reasonable—would it be politic—are the questions which on this occasion he asks leave to venture to ask section vi plea  — need of money for buying men off from professions   a fifth plea is composed of the alleged necessity of buying off men from private pursuits in other words of the want of wisdom there would be in failing to allow to official men—to all official men—in the shape of official emolument as much money at the least as anybody can gain by trade or manufactures it would hardly says he p    he wise on reflection to establish a principle which would have a tendency at least to exclude from the service of their country men likely to be useful to it great numbers of those who engage in trade and manufactures than whom none are held in greater estimation by the author or who enter into various professions frequently acquire very large fortunes very true indeed and seldom if they have talents and perseverance fail to obtain independence what fairness justice or reason is there then in marking the character of the official man alone with disrespect and himself as unfit to have reward in any case beyond an annual stipend for his labour and services just sufficient for his current expenses however faithfully and diligently he may have discharged an important trust for a long series of years surely concludes he it is not unwise or unreasonable that the public should be in a situation to bid to a limited extent for talents in competition with other honourable and lucrative professions and various branches of trade and manufactures thus far the right honourable author—as for the obscure commentator perplexity is once more his fate the right honourable author speaks of a principle a principle which such as it is he disapproves of but what this principle is the obscure commentator can no otherwise take his chance for declaring aright than by a very random guess the omitting in the instance of an official person to make for his family a provision such as he the official person or the right honourable author or somebody else and who else shall pitch upon as being necessary and according to the justdescribed plan of estimation sufficient an omission     to this effect is it the thing to which by the style and title of a principle the right honourable gentleman on reflection means to attach the censure for gentle and considerate as it is it is still a censure—attached to it viz by saying of it that it would hardly be wise yes this must be it at any rate it is the nearest approach to it that the perplexed commentator is able to make but of this principle which it would hardly be wise to establish though unfortunately we have no such specific and particular description as were it only to save us from wishing to see an unwise principle established we cannot but wish for we have at any rate a general description viz such a description as is given of it by the designation its imputed tendency—and that in so many words—a principle says he which would have a tendency at least to exclude from the service of their countrymen likely to be useful to it now in this principle if so it be that the perplexed commentator has succeeded in his humble endeavours to pierce the cloud that covers it—in this principle we have another measure of the quantity of emolument which on this single score not to speak at present of any other—on this one account viz that of money to be employed in making the fortunes of their respective families the right honourable author did it depend on him would in the situation of minister annex to office—annex to every office let us distinguish what requires to be distinguished what under the last head we learned was one of the purposes for which the official emolument was necessary—what under this head we receive is a sort of standard of reference from which the quantity of that necessary emolument may be estimated and finally set down in figures true it is that on the present occasion not that same purpose but a fresh purpose is named and brought to view there the purpose was enabling the official man to make his family here it is—inducing a man not as yet official to become such by buying him off from other pursuits—from all pursuits how lucrative soever in any one of which if not thus bought off it might have happened to him to engage but if the quantity allowed for this fresh purpose viz the buyingoff purpose be ample enough and the necessity of not being niggardly on this score will be no secret—the consequence is that by the help of a little economy such as at the hands of so enlightened a professor of economy it might not be too much to venture to ask for one and the same mass of money might be made to serve both purposes the reason is—that on the occasion of the two purposes two different periods are in question viz that of possession and that of expectancy when actually in possession whatsoever it be that is necessary to a man for the good purpose whatever it be which is in question making a family for example and so forth that it is that he must have in hand but before he has taken possession and till he has taken possession it is not necessary how desirable soever on some accounts it might be that at the public expense he should have anything so as you do but give him in prospect and sufficiently secured as much as if in possession would be by ever so little more than any man ever got into possession of by means of trade or manufactures—a million for example—that same million will when the time comes be accepted of upon account at least as and for the money necessary to make his family of this same million the eventual possession being sufficiently secured the bare expectation will suffice to buy him off from all trades and manufactures in the lump so that in fact if when measured according to the standard laid down by this fifth plea the allowance made on the sum mentioned in plea the fourth be sufficiently liberal the advantage mentioned in this same fifth plea is so much got for nothing money it must all this while be carefully kept in mind—money is the only sort of matter which according to the principles of our right honourable author is to the purpose here in question viz to the purpose of providing recruits for the official establishment capable of officiating in the character of matter of reward even so substantial a thing as power—power of management—power of patronage—titles—honours not to speak of any such empty bubble as reputation—all this in the estimation of the right honourable author is to the purpose here in question at least without force or value money therefore and in the same quantity as if there were nothing else that had any value is the matter of which the reward or whatever it be that is to constitute a mans inducement to engage in the service of the country is to be composed but as is very truly observed by the right honourable gentleman so it is that in virtue of the money the prospect of which they present to those who engage in them there are not only other honourable and lucrative professions but various branches of trade and manufactures that enter into competition with the money which in the character of official emolument stands annexed to official service equally true it is that every instance in which in case of a mans engaging in any of those nonofficial lines of industry and in particular in any branch of trade or manufactures it might happen to him to get more money than he could by official service the     difference whatever it may be has to use the words of the right honourable gentleman a tendency at least to exclude from the service of their country men likely to be useful to it true on the other hand it is that the character in which this tendency operates is not that of a physical bar no nor so much as that of a penal statute it is however in the character of that sort of obstacle the resisting force of which is in his eyes so powerful that the whole paragraph with the whole of the deobstruent force therein contained is devoted to the sole purpose of removing it viz by persuading those on whom it depends so to order matters that by this discharge of trusts and duties more money may so be got by somebody or anybody than can be got by anybody in the exercise of any lucrative profession trade or manufacture now then to get the better of so troublesome a thing as this principle of exclusion and enable the service of the country to have as good a chance as trade and manufactures have for engaging men likely to be useful to it what is then to be done two courses there are and in the nature of things but two by which any such effect is capable of being produced one consists in lessening the quantity of money capable of being gained in the way of trade and manufactures the other in increasing the quantity of money capable of being gained in the shape of official emolument in the way of official service to the quantity of money capable at present of being gained in trade or manufactures there are no limits a million or more one hears spoken of as the amount of the money gained in this or that instance and even from no very considerable beginnings of half that money or thereabouts one hears in numbers of other instances fixations of this sort must remain exposed not only to original uncertainty but to continual variation by a select committee with the right honourable gentleman at the head this point however is one that needs not despair of being settled settled if not with mathematical exactness at any rate with that rough degree of precision which is sufficient for practice true it is all this while that on behalf of the public—that public which he has thus taken under his protection—the sum which the right honourable gentleman requires for this purpose is but a limited sum to enable the public to maintain on the occasion in question the proposed competition with so formidable a host of competitors as the other honourable and lucrative professions and various branches of trade and manufactures all he asks is—that it should be in a situation to bid to a limited extent but the limits here alluded to—at what point shall they be set if set at a sum the effect of which will leave to these rival pursuits so much as a tendency to exclude from the service of their countrymen who are likely to be useful to it they will exclude from the faculty of regulating practice on this head the right honourable gentleman with those wise principles of his which he is thus supporting against the unwise ones he complains of for a maximum beginning with the highest situation shall we to make sure say for example a couple of millions to be laid up over and above his necessary current expenses by an official person who with that industry zeal and fidelity the union of which the right honourable accountant gives him credit for as a matter of course shall in that highest situation have spent in the discharge of trusts and public duties a great part—say for example fiveandtwenty years—of his life for our maximum taking then these two millions or even so scanty an allowance as a single million and setting out from this point shall we proceed downwards till after the manner of that other state lottery which is commonly so called we have got for our lottery a number of prizes equal to the aggregate number of official situations this is what on reflection the wisdom of the right honourable gentleman requires us to do on pain of seeing established the principle against the exclusive tendency of which we have been seeing him remonstrate so pathetically this in short is what we must do unless embracing the only other branch of the alternative and going to work in the other quarter we set ourselves to restrict the quantity of money that a man shall be in a situation to gain by any of the various branches of trade and manufactures in the bidding thus proposed by him for talents if on his plan the public service is to have any chance of bearing off the prize or prizes there remains therefore but one other expedient and that is the limiting and thus eventually lessening the quantity of the emolument which men shall have it in their power to make in trade or manufactures but this is what the right honourable gentleman would never permit himself to endeavour at for this would be to mark with disrespect the character—not now indeed of the official man but what in the right honourable gentlemans estimation would be quite as improper a character thus to mark viz that of the mercantile man it would be to stigmatize by this invidious mark great numbers of those who engage in trade and manufactures—persons than whom none not even the official man himself are by the author as the right honourable author is himself pleased to assure them held in higher estimation this then is the objection     to the setting limits to the sum which a man shall be in a situation to gain by trade or manufactures and after an objection thus conclusive it were lost time to look for minor ones section vii digression concerning the value of money such as we have seen is the course one or other branch of which is on reflection in the sight of the right honourable author so necessary that the omitting to pursue it is considered by him as that which would have the effect of marking the character of the official man with disrespect—which to do would—as in the way of interrogation the right honourable gentleman with most incontestable propriety observes—would be to act without fairness justice or reason now as to disrespect for this protégé of the right honourable gentleman—disrespect for him i do protest that i feel none but as to the allowing to him out of the taxes all that money which the generosity and justice and reason and policy and wisdom and fairness of his right honourable patron lays claim to on his behalf—without knowing exactly what it is thus much i know that so expensive a proof of the absence of disrespect is more than i could afford to pay my share of mine being one of the many instances in which income even though not official is insufficient to borrow the right honourable gentlemans words actually insufficient for these what i am therefore reduced to is—the plea that my declining to do that to the doing of which my limited means are so far from being sufficient is not a mark of disrespect to anybody and by this plea in so far and so long as it can be maintained as i humbly conceive it may be to the very last without disrespect to the right honourable gentleman i am determined to abide my notion of him i mean the official man is—that besides money there are other things that are capable of being objects of his regard other things that are capable of engaging him to take upon himself the obligations of office in the words of the right honourable author of the value of which when they are to be had i am too fully sensible to take up with any other to spend even a great part of his life in the discharge of trusts and public duties and in proof of this regarding fact as no bad proof of possibility i have referred to several most conspicuous and happily very extensive lines of practice if it be by either of us—if it be by anybody—that this same official man is treated with disrespect i would venture to appeal to every man in whose eyes there may be anything besides money that has a value whether it is not by the right honourable gentleman himself whose sympathy can so ill brook the imputation and whose imagination paints to him a set of unreasonable people—a set of people into whose company spite of all protestations i cannot but expect to find myself forced—people who being sworn enemies to this same officially industrious zealous and faithful person exercise themselves in marking his character with disrespect in despite of fairness reason and justice—p    what the right honourable gentleman insists upon—and in a manner much stronger than by direct assertion—what he insists upon in the way of assumption is—that upon the mind of his official person there is nothing in the world but money that is capable of operating whether in possession or expectation with any adequate degree of efficiency in the character of reward now in regard to this same sort of person my notion is quite opposite quite opposite and so determinately so that the supposed contrariety of his disposition to the character given of him by the right honourable gentleman is all that that plan of mine which has so often been alluded to has to ground itself upon money money—nothing else sir is of any value in your eyes     many things there are sir besides money that have their value in your eyes     the first is the language in which this respectable person is addressed by the right honourable gentleman his declared patron the other is the language in which he is addressed by the obscure man his supposed enemy in which of these two modes of address is there most of respect—most of disrespect—gentle reader judge between us for my part the former mode of address is one that i could not prevail upon myself to use to any man no not even to the right honourable gentleman himself not even his own licence clear as it is—not even his own express command would prevail upon me neither to him nor of him could i prevail upon myself ever to say any such thing for i do not—no that i dont—i would say it to his face—believe it to be true i beg pardon for the seeming contradiction that i put upon what he says i mean not anything of disrespect to him in this shape any more than in the other i mean not that should he absolutely insist upon giving any such account of himself he would at the moment be saying that of which he would be conscious of its not     being true all i mean is that if such be his opinion of himself he does not do himself justice that for want of leisure engrossed as his attention has been by the discharge of trusts and public duties he has not looked closely enough into a subject—a human subject—which if he were to become a little better acquainted with it than he appears as yet to be might afford him more cause of satisfaction than he seems to be aware of yes on this ground defend him i will though it be against himself and fierce as his attack upon himself is it is not pushed with so much skill but that i will make him parry it for this purpose i do insist upon it—i will take no denial—that he shall look once more at the last of his own pages but one after reading marking and learning there that the most degrading corruption of a statesman or his friends is indeed by the influence of money he will find it written—and that immediately after—that public men may be corrupted by the love of power as well as by lust of gain now then if by this same love of power men may be corrupted by this same love of power i say they may be operated upon and if operated upon to a bad purpose so may they and let us hope still more easily and effectively to a good one for when operated upon to a bad purpose they must be strange men indeed if they do not find themselves operated upon with how little force and effect soever by some principle or other in a counterdirection in a counterdirection by some principle or other call it fear of disrepute call it conscience call it what you please—which they would find acting not in opposition to but in concert with the love of power in any case in which the purpose towards which it operated upon them and towards which it tended to direct their exertions were a good one and is it really any opinion of the right honourable gentlemans that to the love of power it is impossible to act upon the mind of man in any direction but a sinister one—impossible to act upon it with effect in any other way than by corrupting it no that it is not for if it were he would shake off from his hands whatsoever in the shape of power he felt sticking on them he would shake it off as he would a viper adieu all treasurerships adieu even all clerkships for to the clerkship even of parliament though no such troublesome appendage as that of obligation has ever been felt cleaving to it and incumbering it yet not to speak of money—that not being here in question power enough and in a variety of shapes might be found thereunto appertaining if a gentleman happened to be in a humour to make use of it thus it is that in and by every line i am labouring and toiling to prove and if possible persuade gentlemen to be of opinion that the sun shines at noonday but why only because in and by the argument of the right honourable gentleman the contrary fact is assumed section viii plea  — need of money as a stimulus to official exertion a sixth plea if i understand it right consists in the alleged need of money for the purpose of serving in the case of official men in the character of a stimulus to be applied viz to men of hereditary wealth and independence to spur them on to the acquisition of talent or else to be applied somewhere else in order to enable us to do without them and their talents by having better men in their stead of this plea the account i am thus giving is i must confess besides its not being quite so clear as i could wish a little longwinded but it is the best i am able to give meantime the reader will see whether he can make anything better of it it has always been justly held says the right honourable gentleman in a free country and particularly in this to be one of its greatest privileges that the chief aristocracy as far as relates to the management of its public concerns should be an aristocracy of talent and of virtue as well as of rank and of property which principle would be destroyed if remuneration for public services should be withheld and the community would be deprived of all its advantages not only the great offices of state but some others of most efficiency secretaryships to the treasury perhaps for instance must then be meaning probably would in that case necessarily be confined to men of hereditary wealth and independence and with all the proper respect which should be entertained for such men it must be allowed that for the acquisition and improvement of talents necessary for the higher offices the passing occasionally through the inferior situations and that principle of activity which animates men in the attainment so much more than in the mere possession of power and station are much more favourable than the honours claimable by descent alone the exertions made by the right honourable gentleman in the endeavours he uses to prevail upon himself and enable himself to pay whatever respect it may be proper to     pay to men of a certain description present an edifying spectacle it is what he has been trying at and labouring at throughout the whole course of his paragraph which as the reader feels is not a very short one and after all without having any great success to boast of stationed and for so long a course of time close to the very door of the cabinet though not yet on the right side of it—seeing the duke of portland every day seeing the earl of liverpool seeing the lord viscount castlereagh son and heirapparent to the earl of londonderry seeing the earl of westmoreland seeing the earl of chatham seeing earl camden seeing the lord mulgrave—seeing in a word almost everybody that is worth seeing all of them not only men of hereditary wealth and independence but even nobles of the land—among all those great men there is not one no not one whom he has found it possible to hold in any higher estimation than great numbers of those who engage in trade and manufactures i mean antecedently to the exertions betrayed or displayed in this present paragraph and how small the progress is which in this same paragraph he has succeeded in making let this same paragraph itself declare his majesty for whom also the right honourable gentleman i will be bound for him has all along been labouring and with at least equal energy to entertain all the proper respect which should be entertained for him all these great men his majesty or those whose estate as the lawyers say he hath were at one time or other at the pains of decking out with titles and even some of them with ribbons yet after all and upon so good a judge of merit as the right honourable gentleman—one moreover who has had such good and such near opportunities of observation—so inconsiderable has been the effect that has been produced at all this expense—that in the estimation of the right honourable gentleman they are still so unfortunate every one of them as not to occupy any higher place than is occupied by—alas alas—great numbers of those who engage in trade and manufactures of the difficulties which he had to struggle with in his endeavours to find or make any higher place for them the magnitude is betrayed shall we say or manifested in every line as is likewise when all is over the delicacy with which to the very last he avoided giving any direct expression to that conclusion which having in an unlucky moment before the commencement of this paragraph burst out unawares had throughout the whole course of it been labouring once more to find vent and utterance of all these great men if we may take the word of so good a judge there is nothing to be made without money nor if it were proper to speak out any great matter even with the help of it especially in comparison of some other great men that he knows of who for the acquisition and improvement of talents necessary for the higher offices—including a consummate skill in the application of the four rules of arithmetic and without wasting time upon any such speculative and theoretical science as logic have had the benefit of passing occasionally pour passer le tems as the french say through the inferior situations when the antagonists whom the right honourable gentleman has to contend with are the offspring of his own genius they give him little trouble in his   d page we find him setting to rights a set of men but whether these were among his reasonable and candid men that he had just been meeting with i cannot take upon me to be certain—a set of men however of some sort or other according to whose conception the whole amount of what is levied on the people by taxes goes to pay sinecures and pensions—from which if true it would follow that on so simple a condition as that of suppressing these nuisances—taxes those still greater nuisances might be cleared away at any time but that any such conception is a misconception and consequently although there were no sinecures or pensions there would still be taxes he proves immediately beyond all dispute and his antagonists let them be ever so reasonable have not a word more to say for themselves this misconception being set to rights in that his   d page here again in his   th page we find him employed in instructing and undeceiving another set of men or perhaps the same set in another dress who are for withholding remuneration meaning nothing less than all remuneration howsoever ashamed they may be to say so for public services a strange set of men they are whoever they are—and what is to be done with them the course he takes with them and if he does not convince them he at least reduces them to silence is the setting them to think of a principle which he knows of and which if such remunerations were withheld would he says be destroyed and the principle once destroyed the community he concludes with an irresistible force of reasoning would be deprived of all its advantages now if so it be that he really knows of any such men it is pity but he had told us where some of them are to be seen for as a rareeshow they would be worth looking at i for my part jacobin as i suppose i am—i for my part am not one of them and this too i am happily enabled to prove having for a particular purpose proposed some good round sums to be disposed of in this way and that according to another plan in my opinion of which every day i live confirms me     of the only sort of thing which in his account—at least while this paragraph lasts—is of any value viz money my plan i speak now of that which relates to the present subject goes somewhat further than any other which it has happened to me to see in reducing the quantity to be administered at the public expense and yet not even in this shape do i propose to withhold it except in so far as the public service would be performed not only cheaper but better without it and be the right honourable gentlemans principle what it may i disclaim altogether any such destructive thought as that of destroying it all this while a difficulty which has been perplexing me is—that of comprehending what sort of an aristocracy this new sort is the discovery of which has been made by the right honourable gentleman and to which exercising the right which is acknowledged to belong to all discoverers he has given the name of an aristocracy of talent and of virtue not that by any such description if taken by itself any great difficulty would have been produced but that it is by the sort of relation which is represented as subsisting between this sort of aristocracy and the sort of thing called money that my perplexity is occasioned so far as money is concerned virtue according to what we have been used most of us to hear and read of at school and at college such of us as have been to college consists though not perhaps in doing altogether without money at any rate in taking care not to set too high a value on it but with all its virtue or rather in virtue of its very virtue the aristocracy which the right honourable gentleman has in view is a sort of aristocracy of which the characteristic is that they will not the members of it do a stitch without money and in their eyes remuneration in any other shape is no remuneration at all why because in their eyes to this purpose at least nothing whatever but money is of any value we have seen who they are that must have been sitting for the right honourable gentlemans kitcat club—his aristocracy of rank and of property where now shall we find the originals of his aristocracy of talent and of virtue consulting the works of dr beatson and mr luffman the only channels the periodical ones excepted through which in my humble situation a man can form any conception concerning any such great characters i can find no others but mr percival lord eldon mr canning sir david dundas and a gentleman right honourable i presume who in mr luffmans table of great characters occupies at present his   th column by the description of mr g rose meantime money—meaning public money—being in the right honourable gentlemans system of ætiology the causa sine quâ non not only of virtue but of that talent which is found in company with virtue and being on that score necessary to the constitution of that one of the two branches of his aristocracy if it has two or of the whole of it if it is all in one—what i would submit to him is—whether the task which in entering upon this work he appears to have set himself will have been perfectly gone through with till he has found means for securing to this talentandvirtue branch of his aristocracy a larger portion of his one thing needful than appears to have as yet fallen to its lot running over in this view such parcels of the matter of remuneration as exceed each of them the amount of £ 0000 ayear the only part of the sinecure list a man can find time for looking over and speaking to in this view i find them all or almost all of them in possession of the rankandproperty branch while the talentandvirtue branch starved and hidebound has found itself reduced to take up with the others leavings section ix plea  — need of money for the support of official dignity a seventh plea and the last i have been able to find consists in the alleged need of money for a purpose that seems to be the same with one which in other vocabularies is meant by the words support of dignity in the words of the right honourable gentleman for on pain of misrepresentation the very words must be taken where words are everything preservation of a certain appearance it is true continues he that magnanimity and genuine patriotic ambition will look for a nobler reward for their services than the emoluments of office but in the present state of society a certain appearance is essential to be preserved by persons in certain stations which cannot be maintained without a liberal provision from this paragraph one piece of good news which we learn or should learnat least if it could be depended upon is—that the time is now come when magnanimity and genuine patriotic ambition will look for a nobler reward for their services than the emoluments of office so late as the moment when the last hand was put to the right honourable authors last preceding paragraph this moment of magnanimity was not yet arrived down to that moment had remuneration meaning as     afterwards explained in the shape of emolument been withheld principle of some kind or other would have been destroyed—and so forth fortunate is this change for the country and in particular not a little so for the somewhat deficient plan here by an unofficial hand ventured to be proposed here then we have it—and from such high and competent authority—that besides emolument there is a something which in the character of reward for their services magnanimity and genuine patriotic ambition will look for and what is better still this unspecified something is capable of being received not only in the character of a reward but in the character of a reward of a nobler sort than emolument—that sine quâ non without which till this paragraph of the right honourable gentlemans was concluded or at least begun upon nothing was to be done having this i have all i want and as will be seen and as i hope has even been seen already even more than i mean or have any need to use unfortunately for me no sooner has the right honourable gentlemans wisdom and candour and discernment obtained from him and for my use this concession—than some others of his virtues i know not exactly which join hands and take it back again and though no otherwise than by implication yet—so necessary to his argument is this implication—that if he had taken it back in direct words he could not have done more than he has done if so much towards depriving me of the benefit of it but continues he—and now comes the retractation—a certain appearance is essential to be preserved by persons in certain stations which meaning probably which appearance cannot be maintained without a liberal provision in certain stations a certain appearance—nothing can be more delicate—nothing at the same time more commodiously uncertain—than this double certainty meantime if in the meaning of the whole paragraph there be anything certain it appears to me to be this—viz that on behalf of the magnanimity and genuine patriotic ambition which the right honourable gentleman has taken under his protection what he claims is—that in the account debtor and creditor as between service and reward this reward which not being emolument is nobler than emolument meaning by nobler if anything at all be meant by it that which in their estimate at least is worth more is to be set down as worth nothing and accordingly that the quantity of the matter of reward which each official person is to have in the less noble but more substantial and tangible shape is to be exactly the same as if there were no other reward either in their hand or within their view to my plan however with its weak means of support so necessary is the concession thus plainly though but for the moment made by the right honourable gentleman that with my good will he shall never have it back again power then has its value reputation has its value and this for the moment at least has been admitted by mr rose by mr roses evidence—by the weight of mr roses authority—i have proved it and now is my time for triumphing for though neither he nor any other right honourable gentleman ever took his seat in any moderately full house of commons nor ever attended a quartersessions without seeing before him gentlemen in numbers whose conduct afforded a still more conclusive evidence of the same fact than any verbal testimony they could have given even though it were in black and white—magistrates by the labour they bestow without emolument in the execution of their office—members by the expense which lawfully or unlawfully they have been at in obtaining their unemolumented seats—yet such is the weight of his authority and to my humble plan so strong the support it gives that having seized the fortunate moment and got possession of the evidence i can do no less than make the most of it now then say i whatever it be that these valuable things are worth so much in the account as between reward and service let them be set down for nor shall even the ingenuity of the right honourable gentleman enable him to object any want of fairness to my estimate leaving as my plan does to his protégé the proposed official person himself to make out his own estimate—to fix his own value upon the nonemolumentary part of his reward the more he chooses to have in the more noble shape the less may he be content to receive in the less noble shape how much he will have of each rests altogether with himself and so long as—with its bitters in one hand and its sweets in the other—the office cannot upon my plan be put into his hands without his own consent what ground for complaint anybody can make for him is more than i can see certain appearance for what purpose is it that this certain appearance whatever it be is so essential to be preserved is it for commanding respect in common arithmetic—in the sort of arithmetic that would be employed in a plain mans reasoning be the article what it may—respect or anything else—if there be divers sources or efficient causes of it—money for instance and power and reputation—to command     the necessary or desirable quantity whatever be that quantity the more you have from any one source the less you need to have from the others or from any other in the present state of society for it is to that that the right honourable gentleman calls for our attention unfortunately for us vulgar this arithmetic—this vulgar arithmetic—is not the arithmetic of high situation it is not the arithmetic of st jamess it is not the arithmetic of the house of lords it is not the arithmetic of the house of commons it is not the arithmetic of the treasury it is not the arithmetic of office—of any office by which a more convenient species of arithmetic can be employed instead of it in particular it is not so we learn not only from this paragraph but from the whole tenor of the work of which it makes a part the arithmetic of the navy treasurers office according to this higher species of arithmetic the more you have been able to draw from any one of these same sources the more you stand in need of drawing from every other power not indigence is the measure of demand have you so many hundred thousands of pounds in money having this money you have power having this money with this power it is essential you should have dignity having this dignity you have that which requires money—more money—for the support of it money power dignity money power dignity—such in this high species of arithmetic is the everlasting circulate are you in a certain station whatsoever you have power to spend and at the same time inclination to spend this is what the right honourable treasurer is ready to assure you it is indispensably necessary you should spend this is what if your patience will carry you to the next section of this humble comment or to the next page of the right honourable text you will see stated by the right honourable discharger of trusts and public duties—and in terms of which on any such score as that of want of distinctness or positiveness no just complaint can be made section x plea  — concerning the late mr pitts expenditure—the impropriety of economy how far proved by it immediately upon the back and as it should seem for the more effectual ascertainment of this so unfortunately uncertain though double certainty comes the grand example already above referred to that one example—in which we are to look for whatsoever explanation is to be found—for whatever is not inexplicable in the right honourable authors theory and this example proves to be the rate and quantum and mode of expenditure private expenditure observed and here stated by the right honourable gentleman in the instance of the late mr pitt that great statesman says he who was poor amidst a nations wealth whose ambition was patriotism whose expense and whose economy were only for the public died in honourable poverty that circumstance continues he certainly conveys no reproach upon his memory but when he had leisure to attend to his private concerns it distressed him seriously to reflect that he had debts without the means of paying them which he could not have avoided incurring except from a parsimony which would have been called meanness or by accepting a remuneration from the public which his enemies would have called rapacity for he had no expense of any sort that was not indispensably necessary except in improvements in his country residence where his house was hardly equal to the accommodation of the most private gentleman that the logic of our right honourable author is not altogether so consummate as his arithmetic is a suspicion that has been already hazarded and here perhaps may be seen a confirmation of it the proposition undertaken by him to be proved was a pretty comprehensive one its extent not being less than the entire field of office considered in respect of the several masses of official emolument comprised in it this it was that he took for his subject adding for his predicate that these incomes were and are not one of them sufficient—not one of them all things considered sufficient to all purposes† for proof of this his universal proposition in so far as it is in the nature of example to afford proof he gives us one example one example and but one the one office in the instance of which if insufficiency of emolument be proved such insufficiency is to be accepted as proof and that conclusive of equal or proportionable insufficiency in the case of all the rest is the office of prime minister an office the emolument of which is composed of the emolument attached to two offices     which when the parliamentary seat of the official person is in the house of commons have commonly been and in the instance of the said mr pitt were holden in one hand to complete the right honourable authors argument there remains for proof but one other proposition and that is—the insufficiency of this compound mass of emolument in the instance of the said mr pitt and the medium of proof is composed of this fact viz that being so in possession of this mass of annual emolument he the said mr pitt spent all this money of his own together with no inconsiderable mass—amount not mentioned—of other peoples money besides assuming what nobody will dispute that mr pitt died in poverty that which by his right honourable friend is observed and predicated of this poverty is that it was honourable to him which being admitted or not admitted the right honourable gentlemans further observation that it certainly conveys no reproach to his memory shall if it be of any use to him be admitted or not admitted likewise had this been all there would certainly at least have been no dishonour in the case a man who has no family nor any other person or persons having on the score of any special relation any claim upon his bounty whether it be his choice to expend the whole of his income or whether it be his choice to lay up this or that part of it nobody surely can present any just ground for complaint but in addition to that which was his own to spend or save mr pitt having spent money of other peoples in round numbers to the amount of £ 0000 more and this mode of expenditure having in so unhappy a way been rendered notorious rich and poor together having been forced to contribute to make up to this division of the rich the loss they had been content to run the risk of something was deemed advisable to be said of it in strictness of argument some readers there may be perhaps in whose view of the matter it might be sufficient here to observe—that admitting the fact unhappily but too notorious of mr pitts spending other peoples money—admitting this fact in the character of a proof and that a conclusive one that the mass of emolument attached to the two offices he filled was not sufficient for the one official person by whom those two offices were filled the proof would not extend beyond that one pair of offices and the number of offices being unhappily to be counted by thousands perhaps even by tens of thousands and this highest of offices in point of power differing more widely from the general run of offices than perhaps any other that could have been found the proposition has much the air of remaining in rather worse plight than if nothing in the character of proof had been subjoined to it on this footing might the matter perhaps be found to stand if viewed in a point of view purely and dryly logical but forasmuch as notwithstanding or rather by reason of its profuseness the expenditure of this one official person is by his right honourable friend held out as an example not merely as an example for illustration but as a pattern for imitation—for imitation by official persons in general—for imitation in respect of the quantum of emolument necessary to be allotted out of the taxes and attached to their respective offices—an observation or two shall here be hazarded respecting the conclusiveness of the right honourable authors argument with reference to this collateral and practical part of it the wry neck of the hero having in this way rendered itself too conspicuous to be concealed by any artifice what was left to the panegyrist was to make a beauty of it the expense of this repair has surely not been inconsiderable for here it is not editor illegible word only but morality and policy that have been made to share in it our assent being secured for so unexceptionable a proposition as that in the circumstance in question poverty is honourable the next contrivance is to slip in and get the benefit of our assent extended to one other proposition viz as if there were no difference that spending other peoples money was honourable and thus it is that our approbation is to be engaged for the practice and policy of giving encouragement to such honourable conduct by tokens of parliamentary approbation bestowed at the public expense necessary with its conjugate necessity and its near of kin essential are words of no small convenience to the right honourable gentleman of such convenience that that thing it should seem could not be very easy to be found which the same being convenient to official persons in official situations is not by and in virtue of such convenience under and by virtue of the right honourable authors system of ontology rendered necessary even to a man who had not quite so much as £ 000 ayear of his own to spend a mode of expenditure which in whatsoever degree convenient would one should have thought have presented the least satisfactory claim to   0 the appellation of necessary is that which consists in spending money of other peoples two rocks the reputation of the hero found his course threatened by two rocks meanness and rapacity one on each side and the expenditure of other peoples money—this was the harbour in which to avoid this scylla and this charybdis he took refuge had the expenditure of the hero been confined to the sum which by the competent authorities had been deemed sufficient such limitation would from the justice of the right honourable panegyrist himself notwithstanding his just partiality have received a gentle reprimand couched under the term parsimony and his imagination has found somebody else to call it meanness had he for those extraordinary services which we hear so much of accepted as a remuneration from the public any of those sinecures which in such unhappy abundance he saw lavished on men who could not produce so much as the pretence of even the most ordinary service the same industrious and fruitful imagination has found him friends in the character of enemies to call it rapacity—to avoid this charge of meanness it is that he places himself in a state of dependence under traders of various descriptions—the butcher the baker the fishmonger not to speak of the political intriguer—to avoid the charge of rapacity it is that what he obtains from those people he obtains from them on the pretence of meaning to pay them knowing that he has not wherewithal and nobly constantly and heroically determined never to accept it as to distress while the distress confined itself to those plebeian breasts this right honourable breast knew no such inmate but when some debts pressed so severely upon him as to render it necessary for some of his most private and intimate friends to step in and save him from immediate inconvenience when in plain english he had or was afraid of having executions in his house then it was that the distress became contagious—then it was that it distressed him seriously to reflect that he had debts when—of a necessity or of anything else the existence being asserted by a gentleman and as of his own knowledge and that so right honourable a gentleman—an obscure person—who having no such honour nor any chance of producing persuasion by any other means than such as his own weak reason may be able to supply—has after and notwithstanding all this form of assertion the misfortune to feel himself still unsatisfied it is natural to him to look around him for whatever support may anywhere be to be found—parliament—the opinion of parliament—should it be found on his side will that stand him in any stead such as we have seen is the opinion of mr rose but parliament—on this same point what is it that has been the opinion of parliament why the opinion of parliament is—that what mr pitt had was sufficient that more than he had was not necessary—was not of that indispensable necessity which has been brought on the carpet by the zeal assisted by the imagination of mr rose unfortunately for the right honourable panegyrist—unfortunately for his opinions—unfortunately for his assertions—this point this very point did—and on the very occasion he speaks of—come under the cognizance and consideration of parliament the emolument which is found annexed to these two offices both of which had been held at the same time by mr pitt—this emolument had it been deemed insufficient for the official man in question—viz for the species of official man—would thereupon of course have received an augmentation in the instance of this official person the subject would have received those marks of attention which have so frequently been asked for and so constantly been given for asking for in the case of the judges was it that by the case of this distinguished individual any demand was presented for any greater mass of emolument than there was likely to be an equally cogent demand for in the case of any successor of his in the same situation it seems not easy to conceive a case in which all things considered that demand can ever be so small true it is his private fortune was—his station in life considered—barely sufficient for independence but he had no wife—no child—he was in deed as well as in law completely single and in the right honourable gentlemans own arithmetic—which on this head differs not much it must be confessed from the vulgar arithmetic—the demand for money on the part of the father of a family is as the number of persons it is composed of over and above his £ 000 ayear augmented during half his political life by his sinecure to £  000 what is it that he could want money for—more money for that is here the question than would be wanted by or for any of his successors in power and office was it to buy respect and reputation with deserved and undeserved together no man in his place unless it was his father ever possessed a larger share of those valuable commodities than this second william pitt had he been in the case of the goodhumoured old driveller who gave so much trouble to pitt the first and whom his majestys grandfather was so loth to part with or suffer to be elbowed—in that case there would have been on his part a great deficiency in those essential articles and if like seats     they had been an object of purchase and public money the proper sort of money to be employed in the purchase no small quantity of such money would in that case have been necessary in the way of experiment—in the endeavour to make this purchase money though the mans own and not public money was in the dukes case actually employed and in memorable and stillremembered abundance but how completely the experiment failed is at least as well remembered to return to the deficiency of the sort in question supposed to have been on the more recent occasion displayed in the same place this deficiency then—such as it was and still is—parliament in the case of mr pitt did not so long as he lived think fit to supply at any rate left unsupplied what was done was—the giving a mass of public money—to the amount of £ 0000 or thereabouts—among a set of people names undisclosed but said to be the deceased ministers creditors friends remembered their friendships enemies now that the enemy was no longer in their way forgot their enmity friends and enemies vied in sentimentality—vied in generosity—always at the public expense and a justification yea and more than a justification was thus made for the cases of the still futurecontingent widow of lord grenville and the then paulopost future widow of mr fox should it here be asked why those trustees of the people chose to saddle their principals with the payment of debts for which they were not engaged and the necessity of which they themselves could not take upon themselves to pronounce—my answer is—that if anything in the shape of an efficient final or historical cause will satisfy them plenty may be seen already—but if by the word why anything like a justificative cause—a rational cause—a good and sufficient reason—be meant to be asked for i for my part know of none at the same time for the support of the proposition that stands on my side of the argument—it being the negative—viz that for no such purpose as that of encouraging and inducing ministers to apply to their own use the money of individuals can it ever be necessary that money raised by taxes should be employed—for the support of any proposition to this effect—so plain does the proposition seem to me that neither can i see any demand for a support to it in the shape of a reason nor in truth should i know very well how to go about to find one not thus clear of all demand for support is the side taken by the right honourable gentleman by his vote and influence whatsoever on that occasion was done having been supported and encouraged on him in point of consistency the obligation is incumbent he stands concluded as the lawyers say in both ways on the one hand not having ventured to propose any correspondent addition or any addition at all to be made to the mass of emolument openly and constantly attached to the office he is estopped from saying that any such extra expenditure was necessary—on the other hand having in the case of the individual by whom that expenditure was made concurred in the vote and act passed for filling up at the public charge the gaps made by that same expenditure in the property of other individuals he stands convicted by his own confession of concurring in charging the public with a burthen the necessity of which could not be so much as pretended on this occasion may we not venture to ask whether this may not be in the number of those cases in which gentlemen honourable gentlemen under the guidance of right honourable have in the words of our right honourable author been misled by mistaken ideas of virtue p    be this as it may by this one operation which is so much to the taste of the right honourable gentleman—not to speak of so many other right honourable honourable and even pious gentlemen—two distinguishable lessons may they not be seen given—two distinguishable lessons given to so many different classes of persons standing in so many different situations one of these lessons to wit to ministers the other to any such person or persons whose situation might enable them to form plans for fulfilling their duty to themselves by lending money to ministers to ministers an invitation was thus held out to expend upon themselves in addition to whatever money is really necessary as much more as it may happen to them to be disposed so to employ of that which is not necessary thus far as to the quantum—and as to the mode by borrowing money or taking up goods of individuals knowing themselves not to have any adequate means of repayment and determining not to put themselves into the possession of any such means to persons at large an invitation was at the sametime held out to become intriguers and by seizing or making opportunities of throwing themselves in the way of a minister to supply him with money more than he would be able to repay on demand and having thus got him in a state of dependence to obtain from his distress—always at the expense of the public—good gifts in every imaginable shape—peerages—baronetcies—ribbons—lucrative offices—contracts—assistance in parliamentary jobs—good things in a word of all sorts for which no money being paid or parted with neither the giver nor the receiver     would run any the slightest risk of being either punished or in any other way made responsible by a loan though for example it were but of £ 000 if properly timed—and that on both occasions—first as to the time of the administering the supply and then as to the time of pressing for repayment—that may it not every now and then be done which could not have been done by a gift of £ 0000 how often have not seats for example been in this way obtained—and this even without any such imputation as that of the sin the venial sin of parliamentary simony in virtue of the invitation thus given by the magnanimity and generosity of parliament—an invitation open at all times to the acceptance of persons to whom it may happen to find themselves in the corresponding situations—who is there that does not see how snugly the benefit of bribery may be reaped on both sides and to any amount without any of the risk a banker is made a lord why is a banker to be made a lord what is it that the banker ever did that he is to be made a lord a merchant is made a lord why is a merchant to be made a lord what is it that the merchant ever did that he is to be made a lord—these are among the questions which are in themselves as natural as the answers true or untrue might be unpleasant to some and dangerous to others we have heard many of us of the once celebrated nabob of arcot and his creditors and the mode in which their respective debts were to an as yet unfathomed extent contracted those debts which in so large a proportion and to so large an amount just and unjust together in name the expiring company and in effect the whole body of the people have paid or spite of the best possible discrimination will have to pay by the example set and lesson held out by the virtue of the right honourable gentleman and his right honourable and honourable coadjutors the policy of arcot was it not thus sanctioned and imported into great britain ministers plunge your hands as deep as you can into other peoples pockets intriguers supply profuse and needy ministers with whatever they want and make the most of them we will be your sureties our care it shall be that you shall not be losers against the opinions of so many great characters—such has been my temerity—over and over again have i laboured to prove i know not with what success that money is not the only coin in which it may happen to a public man to be willing to take payment of the public for his labour and that power and reputation—though they will not like shillings and halfpence go to market for butter and eggs—yet like exchequer bills within a certain circle they are not altogether unsusceptible of a certain degree of currency of the truth of this proposition the mr pitt in question affords at least one instance it proves indeed something more for in so far as purposely forbearing to receive what it is in a mans option to receive is tantamount to paying—it proves that in the instance in question the value of these commodities was equal to that of a very considerable sum of money in round numbers worth £ 0000—at any rate worth more than £  000 not that in the eyes of the hero money had no value for it had much too great a value it possessed a value greater than the estimated value of common honesty and independence he loved money and by much too well he loved it with the love of covetousness not that he hoarded it or put it out to usury but there are two sorts of covetous men those who covet it to keep it and those who covet it to spend it the class he belonged to was this covetingandspending class yes—that be did—pitt the second did love money and not his own money merely but other peoples likewise loving it he coveted it and coveting it he obtained it the debt which he contracted was so much money coveted obtained and expended for and in the purchase of such miscellaneous pleasures as happened to be suited to his taste the sinecure money which he might have had and would not have was so much money expended in the shape of insurance money on account of power in the purchase of that respect and reputation which his prudence represented as necessary to the preservation of so valuable an article against storms and tempests from above sinecure money to any given amount the hero could have got for himself with at least as much facility as for his right honourable panegyrist but the respect and the reputation were defences which in that situation could not be put to hazard of the battles he had to fight with the sort of dragons commonly called secret advisers this bare hint is all that can be given by one who knows nothing of anybody or anything his right honourable achates by whom he must alas how oft have been seen in a tottering and almost sinking attitude—more particulars could doubtless be given by a great many than by a gentleman of his discretion it would     unless it were in a posthumous diary for which posterity would be much obliged to him be useful on his sole authority     to enter into any detail of it was to enable virtue to rise triumphant out of all these trials that the amount of all this sinecure money was thus expended and without having been received     section xi concerning influence on the subject of influence page    what the right honourable gentleman admits is—that owing to the greatly increased revenue and all the other augmented and accumulated business of the state some increase has though unavoidably been occasioned in it viz by increase of patronage at the same time notwithstanding this increase yet in point of practice the state of things if we may trust to his conception is exactly as if there were no such thing at all as influence how so why for this plain reason viz that the influence created by such means is infinitely short of what viz by the measures of economy and regulation to which recourse has been had—has been given up thus far the right honourable author but in the humble conception of his obscure commentator the question between the two quantities one of which is in the hands of the right honourable accountant multiplied by one of those figures of rhetoric which in aid of the figures of arithmetic are so much at his command—multiplied in a word to infinity—this question is not on the present occasion the proper one in regard to influence the question which with leave of the public the obscure commentator would venture to propose—as and for a more proper one is—whether for any existing particle of this influence any preponderant use can in compensation for the acknowledged evil consequences of it be found and if not whether there be any and what quantity of it left remaining that could be got rid of understand on each occasion as being a condition universally and necessarily implied—without prejudice in other respects—and that preponderant prejudice—to the public service as to these points what appears to me with submission is—that without travelling out of this the right honourable gentlemans own work an instance might be found of a little sprig of influence which without any such preponderant prejudice to mr reeves tree might be pruned off this work of his i mean mr roses has for its title—observations respecting the public expenditure and the influence of the crown but unfortunately as in due place and time the candour of the right honourable gentleman himself in effect acknowledges these observations of his—and from so experienced an observer—are all on one side on the subject of expenditure out of    pages    have been expended in showing us what retrenchments have been made and how great they are are they indeed so great so much the better but even yet considering that if we may believe the right honourable gentleman himself p    the whole revenue of great britain is more than £ 0000000 ayear let the retrenchments have been ever so great the demand for further retrenchment wheresoever it can be made without preponderant prejudice to the public service seems by no means to be superseded subject to that necessary condition is there any such further retrenchment practicable this is exactly what the right honourable gentleman has not merely avoided but positively refused to tell us from first to last this work of his has according to the authors own account of it but one aim and that is by showing how great the retrenchments are that have been made already to stop our mouths and prevent our calling for any more is it then true that in this way all has been done that ought to be done even this not even in terms ever so general will he vouchsafe to tell us to what extent or in what manner it may be proper to press further retrenchment the author says he p    has not the remotest intention of offering an opinion his view has been clearly explained looking for the explanation the clearness of which is thus insisted on i find it if i do not mistake in his last preceding page but one viz in p  0 in which speaking of this his work by the name of the present publication—in endeavouring to set right the public opinion on this subject the performance of an act of justice to any administration is he says but a small part of its use a much more important consideration is its effect in producing that salutary and reasonable confidence which gives the power of exertion to the government and that concurrence which seconds its exertions among the people thus far the right honourable author for my own part if my conception concerning a governments title to confidence be not altogether an erroneous one this title depends in no inconsiderable degree on its disposition to press further retrenchments p    i mean of course in so far as in the judgment of that government they are not otherwise than proper ones yet this the right honourable gentleman—a member of this same government and that in the very next rank to the highest and receiving besides sinecure money no less than £ 000 ayear for being so peremptorily—and as we have seen of his own accord—refuses to do he will not do any such thing and why not on this point we might be apt to be at a stand at least if not at a loss were it not for the lights with which in another page p    the right honourable author himself has     favoured us his opinions on the subject he there acknowledges are strong ones but strong as they are or rather because they are so strong he will not let us know what they are because on his sole authority that is unless other opinions that in the scale of office stand yet higher than his concurred with his it would not be useful—there would be no use in it no use in it what not on a subject of such vital importance—when for the declared purpose of setting right the public opinion on this subject a right honourable author who knows all about it takes up the pen can it be that there would be no use in speaking what he thinks is right and as much of it as he has to speak no use in his speaking impartially—in speaking on both sides and on all sides what he thinks but not to go on any further in thus beating the bush may we not in plain english venture to ask—at the bottom of all his delicacy can any other interpretation be found than this viz that by those for whose defence and for whose purposes—and to come to the point at once—under whose influence this work of his was written his speaking as he thinks and what he thinks right—his speaking out on both sides would it in his own persuasion have been found not endurable if so here then we have a practical illustration and development of a number of preceding hints here we see the character—here we see one effect and use—of that aristocracy of talent and virtue with which in the account of remuneration nothing but money will pass current—nothing but money is of any value—and which constitutes so necessary an addition to the aristocracy of rank and property here we see what is and what we are the better for the fruit of that principle of activity p    which animates men in the attainment so much more than in the mere possession of power and station and of that amusement which for the acquisition and improvement of talents necessary for the higher offices gentlemen have given themselves in passing occasionally through the inferior situations of the unpopularity and ridicule that has so often been attempted to be fixed on the word confidence the right honourable gentleman has as he is pleased to inform us according to his own statement p    had some experience one little item to whatsoever may have been the stock laid up by him of that instructive article he may find occasion to make to that sort of confidence which is unthinking and blind this unpopularity and ridicule he appears to look upon as not altogether inapplicable nor consequently the sort of attempt he speaks of viz that of fixing it on the word confidence as altogether incapable of being attended with success but can anything be more unthinking and blind than that confidence which should bestow itself on an official man howsoever right honourable who in treating of a subject confessedly of high national importance and after furnishing in favour of one side whatsoever information his matchless experience his unquestioned ingenuity his indefatigable industry can rake together—and feeling on the other side of his mind opinions—and those strong ones nor doubtless unaccompanied with an adequate knowledge of facts—of those facts from which they receive their existence and their strength—should refuse—deliberately and peremptorily as well as spontaneously refuse—to furnish any the least tittle of information from that other side eloquent and zealous in support of profusion mute when the time should come for pleading in favour of retrenchment not without compunction let him behold at least one consequence destitute of all competent of all sufficiently qualified of all officially qualified advocates—deserted even by him who should have been its solicitorgeneral thus it is that the cause of economy is left to take its chance for finding here and there an advocate among low people who have never been regularly called to this high bar interlopers who destitute of all prospect of that remuneration which is the sole principle of activity that animates men in the attainment of power and station p    destitute of the advantage of passing occasionally through even the inferior situations p    are destitute of all talent destitute of all virtue—and whose productions if for the purpose of the argument they could for a moment be supposed capable of contributing on the ground here in question anything that could be conducive to the public service would one and all be so many effects with out a cause section xii concerning pecuniary competition—and the use made of the principle before the subject of influence is dismissed a word or two may perhaps have its use for the purpose of endeavouring to submit to the consideration of the right honourable panegyrist an article of revenue viz crown lands which neither on his part nor on the part of his hero seems to have received quite so much attention as could have been wished to the purpose of the present publication a circumstance that renders this article the more material is—that it may contribute to     render more and more familiar to the eye of the reader a principle on a due estimation of which the plan hereafter to be proposed depends for everything in it that either promises to be in its effect eventually useful or is in its application new economy and purity—reduction of expense and reduction of undue influence—in these may be seen the two distinguishable and distinguished though intimately connected objects to which speaking of the principle of competition our right honourable author speaks of it as having been meant to be made subservient and as having accordingly been made subservient in the hands of mr pitt—p    mr pitt he informs us p    looking anxiously to reforms effected many even considerable savings—and at the same time sacrificed an influence as minister much more dangerous than any possessed by the crown because more secret and unobserved the extent of it indeed could be known only to himself and to those in his immediate confidence we shall state continues he the measures in their order—beginning with loans and lotteries—proceeding with private contracts and closing this part of the account with the profit derived from the mode irrevocably established respecting the renewals of crown leases in each of which cases the influence diminished was not only extensive but was obviously in its nature more objectionable than any that could be acquired by the disposal of offices as the effect of the former was secret and unobserved whereas the latter is apparent and generally known coming to crown lands p    the last head of saving by management says he is under that of the estates of the crown the act of the  st of queen anne continued at the beginning of each succeeding reign for limiting grants of crown lands to    years put a stop to the actual alienation of the property of the crown but in its operation had the effect of greatly adding to the influence of it and certainly afforded no protection whatever to its revenues as will be seen in the note below† in reigns antecedent to that of queen anne when grants were perpetual the persons to whom they were made became immediately independent of the crown and not unfrequently gave very early proofs of that independence whereas by the measure adopted on the accession of the queen every grantee or the person representing him became dependent on the minister for a renewal of his lease for which applications were generally made at such times and on such occasions as were thought to afford the best hope of their being attended to on terms favourable to his interest under this system mr pitt on coming into office found the whole landed property of the crown and the income arising from if in every way very little exceeding £ 000 ayear he therefore after long inquiries and most attentive consideration applied a remedy in      when an act was passed‡ by which it is provided that no lease shall be renewed till within a short period of its expiration nor till an actual survey shall have been made by two professional men of experience and character who are required to certify the true value of the premises to the treasury attested on their oaths no abuse can therefore take place nor any undue favour be shown under the provisions of this law unless surveyors of eminence in their line shall deliberately perjure themselves or a treasury shall be found bold enough to grant leases or renew them at a less value than shall be certified to them which could not escape immediate detection as there is a clause in the act requiring an account to be laid before parliament annually of what leases or grants shall have been made in the year preceding for what terms or estates the annual value as returned on oath by the surveyors the annual value of the last preceding survey what rents shall have been reserved or what fines paid and upon what other considerations such leases shall have been respectively made more strict provisions to guard against any evasion of the law could hardly have been devised thus far our right honourable author a word or two now from his obscure commentator where having determined with himself to obtain for public property the best price that is to be had mr pitt pursues that principle my humble applause follows him but when without sufficient reason he turns aside from that or any other principle then my applause stops applause whatever in that case perseveres in following him will be of that sort which comes from copartners and panegyrists when government annuities were the commodity to be disposed of then it was that it was the choice of mr pitt to have the best price then it was that choosing to have the best price he adopted the mode and the only mode by which that effect can be produced when leasehold interests in crown lands were the commodity to be disposed of then it was that it was not the choice of mr pitt     to have the best price then it was accordingly that for fear of having the best price care was taken not to employ the mode the only mode by which any such effect can be produced to avoid giving birth to the undesirable effect in question the expedient employed was we see an actual survey made by two professional men of experience and character who are required to certify the true value of the premises to the treasury attested on their oaths under the provision of this law one thing the right honourable gentleman endeavours to persuade us of p   —is that no abuse can take place nor undue favour be shown why not because says he no such effect can take place unless surveyors of eminence in their line shall deliberately perjure themselves or—something else which he mentions shall take place and which admitting the improbability of it i shall not repeat here as to perjury the word is a strong word and to the purpose of causing the reader to suppose that the security provided by it is a strong security more conducive than any real lover of sincerity can be well pleased to find it but from the pen of a veteran in office and in offices and in such offices to whom it cannot be altogether unknown to how prodigious an extent the people of this country are made deliberately and habitually to perjure themselves—and how fond under the guidance of priests and lawyers the legislation and jurisprudence of this same country have been of causing men always without any the smallest use deliberately to perjure themselves—it is not without pain that a man who has any real dislike to perjury can behold this security held up to view in the character of a real one cases there are it is confessed with pleasure in which this alleged security is an efficient one as for instance where testimony to a matter of fact is to be given vivâ voce in an open judicatory and under the check of crossexamination not that even in that case it is to the ceremony that the efficiency would be found ascribable but to the crossexamination and the publicity with or without the eventual punishment but in the case here in question not one of all those elements of efficiency is to be found the sort of perjury which the right honourable gentleman endeavours to make us take for a punishable offence suppose it for arguments sake committed—was ever one instance known of a man being prosecuted for it as for perjury great would be my surprise to hear of any such case would so much as an indictment lie i have not scarched nor to the present purpose does it seem worth while gross indeed must be the case strong and clear stronger and clearer than it seems in the nature of the case to afford—the proof by which upon any such indictment convinction must be produced few it is evident are the sorts of articles—lands houses or any other such articles coming under the head of crown lands being unquestionably not of the number—few about the value of which it may not happen to surveyors of eminence experience and character to entertain real differences of opinion and moreover and without the smallest imputation on that character much more without the possibility of suffering as for perjury to agree in assigning such a value as to a very considerable amount—according to circumstances say    0        0  0 per cent in short one knows not where to stop greater or less than what in their opinions respectively is the true one the real value of the premises is the joint result of some half dozen suppose of circumstances on each side whereupon on one side suppose again this or that little circumstance somehow or other fails of being taken into the account unless the human understanding were that perfect kind of machine which everybody acknowledges it not to be who could think of speaking of it as importing so much as a speck upon a mans character that any such little oversight has taken place meantime the profit by the oversight may amount to thousands of pounds in any number unfortunately for economy still more unfortunately for uncorruption the sort of contract here in question is one of those in which with a preeminent degree of force interest and opportunity join in securing to the subject of valuation a false or undervalue what the one party viz the proposed lessee wants is money what the other party the discharger of duties and public trusts wants is influence if the valuation be deficient then in proportion to the deficiency both parties have what they want under a state of things so favourable to mutual accommodation let any one who feels bold enough undertake to set a limit to the loss liable to be produced to the public by the substitution of this mode of sale to the only one which is capable of finding out the real value in a fancy article such as a villa or a site for a villa cent per cent may be below the difference ten per cent—to put for arguments sake a certain amount for an uncertain one—will surely be regarded as a very small allowance in this ten per cent then may be seen the amount of the saving or the acquisition call it which you please which on the occasion is     question might have been made to the public and was not made thus much as to revenue then as to influence some judgment as mr rose observes p    may be formed by observing that of the persons holding crown leases when the act was passed upwards of eighty were members of one or the other house of parliament and it is hardly necessary to add continues he that in the cases of other lessees the parties who might have the means of doing so would naturally resort to solicitations of friends for obtaining the ministers favour now in the picture thus drawn of the state of the case as it stood at that time—drawn by so experienced and expert a hand—so far as concerns influence i for my own part till some distinct ground of difference is brought to view cannot but see a picture equally correct of the state of the case as it stands at this moment at this moment viz after and notwithstanding—not to say by reason of—the reform thus lauded so far indeed as concerns revenue i cannot doubt but that a very considerable change—and so far as it goes a change for the better has been made a change for the amount of which i take of course the account given of it by mr rose but so far as concerns influence what i should not expect to find is that any change worth taking into account had taken place eighty according to the right honourable gentleman is the number of members so circumstanced at that time eighty—or rather from that increasing division which landed property where it will serve for building or even for sites of villas naturally admits of more than eighty—is the number which i should expect to find at present not to speak of expectants for whom where the purpose of the argument requires it the right honourable arguer knows so well how to take credit for convincing an honourable or right honourable gentleman of the superiority of one ministry over another ten per cent upon any given sum will not it is true serve so effectually in the character of a persuasion as thirty per cent but wherever the ten per cent suffices the abolished twenty per cent would have been but surplusage since thirty per cent could do no more the case of the villa contiguous to chelsea hospital—a case which though it happened so long ago as the last session is not yet it is hoped altogether out of recollection—may serve and as well as half a hundred for clearing and fixing our ideas on this subject from that case may be formed some judgment whether the impossibility of abuse and undue favour is quite so near to complete as it would be for the convenience of the right honourable gentlemans acknowledged purposes that we should believe it to be all this while a circumstance which has contributed in no small degree to that composure and tranquil confidence of which my readers if i happen to have any may on this occasion have observed the symptoms is—a surmise in which i have all along been indulging myself—viz that between the opinions of the right honourable author and those of his obscure commentator there does not on this occasion exist at bottom any very considerable difference more strict provision to guard against any invasion of the law could hardly says the right honourable author have been devised but it will be for the reader to judge whether the law in question be quite so well guarded against evasion as by this saving word hardly the argument of the right honourable gentleman is guarded against any such impertinent charge as that of having said the thing that is not neither on this nor on any other occasion could it easily have escaped a sagacity such as his that a mode of sale the sure effect of which is to perpetuate a constantly inferior price is not quite so favourable either to increase of revenue or to diminution of influence as a mode of sale the sure effect of which is—to obtain on each occasion the very best price pecuniary competition—auction—having and in other instances to so great an extent—by this same hero and with the special applause of this same panegyrist been employed as and for the bestcontrived mode or instrument for obtaining for such articles as government has to dispose of the very best price—having been applied and with so much success in the case of government annuities—having been applied and with so much success in the case of contracts for stores—for when there is no fraud it is in form only and not in effect that in this case there is any difference between competition and auction in the common acceptation of the word—and moreover in the case of the very sort of article here in question—in the case of lands—sale of leasehold interests presenting themselves to view in every newspaper and even letting by auction in the first instance having nothing new in it it would be a most instructive explanation to us whose station is without doors if in his next edition the right honourable author would have the goodness to inform us how it happened that when in the course of her voyage economy had reached the latitude of the crown lands she all of a sudden stopped short and instead of the best instrument for fishing out the best price took up with so weak and illcontrived an one is it that in the case of lands auction is less well adapted than in the case of goods to an obtainment of the best price—less well adapted to the obtaining that best price for leasehold interest in lands to be paid for in money than     for money to be paid for in goods on the contrary in the case of goods to be supplied to government by contract as in the case in question with the benefit of competition the right honourable gentleman if not already informed might with little difficulty be informed of cases upon cases in which the rigour of the principle of competition receives a very convenient softening from expedients which have no application in the case of lands in default of such full and authentic lights as nothing short of the experience joined to the condescension of the right honourable gentleman would afford us it may be matter of amusement at any rate if of nothing better—to us whose station is on the outside of the curtain—to figure to ourselves in the way of guess and pastime what on the occasion in question may have been passing behind it before so desirable a head of reform as that in question could be brought even into the imperfect state dressed up as above by the ingenuity of our right honourable author long inquiries and most attentive consideration we are informed by him p    took place of these long inquiries no inconsiderable portion if one who knows nothing may be allowed to guess were naturally directed to so desirable an object as that of knowing what in case of a change of the sort proposed the eighty members of whom we have seen him speaking would be disposed to think of it and of the attentive consideration no inconsiderable portion it is equally natural to suppose was bestowed upon the objections which an innovation of this sort could not but have given birth to in so many honourable and right honourable minds with a set of hobgoblins known among schoolboys by the collective appellation of the secret advisers of the crown—and of whom certain sceptics such has been the growth of infidelity have of late it seems been found arians or socinians enough to question the existence—our authors hero there cannot be any doubt supposing them always to have had existence must have had to fight on this as on many other occasions many a hard battle of such warfare the result on the occasion here in question seems to have been a sort of compromise to restraint upon the dilapidation of the revenue fee faw fum could be and accordingly were brought to submit—and thus it was that sale grounded on collusive valuation was substituted to absolute gift to the diminution of influence fee faw fum could not and would not be brought to submit they would have gone off to hanover or to hampshire first—and thus it was that sale grounded on collusive valuation was preferred to sale for the best price paper vii observations on mr secretary peels house of commons speech   st march      introducing his police magistrates salary raising bill date of order for

completely avoided misrepresentation as far as possible the times and the morning chronicle—two of the most accredited sources of information—have upon this occasion been drawn upon and the matter

the genius of lord sidmouth who invented them by the magnanimity of mr peel who disdained not to adopt them they are—future exclusion of all nonbarristers ditto of all barristers of less than three years standing i speak here and of necessity of the two secretaries late and present for it is by mr peel and his successors in that office if by anybody that these remedies are to be applied parliament is to know nothing of them parliament is not to be trusted with the application of them viewing all this wisdom and virtue through the medium of the greatesthappiness principle a principle which has been accused of giving to financial objects rather a yellow tinge i have the misfortune of seeing the whole speech in a considerably different point of view—  the alleged evils—the inaptitude and the nonattendance—neither of them proved by it   supposing the disorder proved the supposed remedy parliamentary and ministerial as above inefficient to any good purpose efficient to a very bad purpose but both these evils though not proved by the right honourable secretary i admit and as it seems to me probabilize the existence   at the same time of both   so doing i venture to propose a remedy which for reasons assigned seems to me a promising one—and the only one which the nature of the case admits of without some change in the whole judiciary system such as in part has been and with large amendments will again be submitted to the public but which it would be altogether useless as well as impracticable to insert here alleged evil  —deficiency in appropriate aptitude

personal respectability per morning chronicle—their knowledge experience and respectability—all thirty of them—and their services had already proved the importance of the duties they had to fulfil per times again—they performed   0 their duties and that not only to the satisfaction of the right honourable secretary but to the great satisfaction of the country this being unquestionable what is become of the evil and what need can there be of a remedy what a scene is here the right honourable gentleman at daggersdrawn with himself how to account for it one way alone i can think of and it is this—the force of his eloquence overpowered his memory while with so much pathos he was lamenting on the part of a certain set of persons the deplorable want of aptitude—he forgot that before he sat down he had to deliver in behalf of the selfsame persons a certificate of accomplished aptitude when at last the time had come for the delivery of this certificate he had already forgot how large a portion of his speech had been employed in giving contradiction to it to answer the purpose for which they are made what must be the complexion of the assertions of inaptitude uttered with such entire confidence they must be at once true and false true for the purpose of proving the necessity of the additional bonus false for the purpose of entitling these thus meritorious and actually existing persons for this slides in sub silentio to receive before any of their future contingent colleagues have been in existence to receive it a full share of the benefit of it admit him to be in possession of the power of giving truth to a selfcontradictory proposition the right honourable secretary proves this his probandum and thus far justifies his measure refuse him this accommodation he stands selfconfuted and his argument is somewhat worse than none were ministerial responsibility anything better than a word the task the right honourable gentleman had charged himself with was it must be confessed rather a delicate one english punch according to the frenchman in the jest book is a liquor of contradiction a compound of a similar complexion was that which on occasions such as the present a situation such as the right honourable secretary occupies gives him in charge to mix up for the entertainment of honourable house except in the case of an underling whose character is too offensively rotten not to make it matter of necessity to suffer him to be thrown overboard for all official men in general—high and low—there is but one character a general character for excellence tinged here and there with a little difference of colour corresponding to the nature of the department the idea looks as if it were taken from the old chronicles where with decent intervals one portrait serves for halfadozen worthies one town for the same number of towns and so as to battles and executions time and labour are thus saved this universal character puts one in mind or an ingenious document i have seen sold under the title of the universal almanac a copy of it has been supposed to be bound up with every cabinet ministers copy of the red book like a formula for convictions it might be inserted into each particular or into one general act of parliament subscription to it and oath of belief in it in relation to all official persons whose salaries had risen or should hereafter rise to a certain amount might be added to the test and corporation acts and without need of troubling the legislature lord chiefjustice abbott or lord chiefjustice anybody would hold himself in readiness to fine and imprison every man who should dare to insinuate that any such person that lives or that ever has lived or that ever shall live is has been or ever can be deficient in any one point belonging to it without violation of this standing character rule he saw how impossible it was that any the slightest shade of inaptitude actual or possible in any one of its modes could be laid upon the character of any one of the existing incumbents with the character of all of them all who heard him see no    were acquainted remain according to parliamentary usage the only persons with whom any such liberty could be taken—their futurecontingent and thence as yet unknown successors here however comes something of a difficulty evil as above—disorder as above—inaptitude in some shape or other remedy as above of the preventive stamp the £ 00 ayear good supposing disorder or danger of it but where is the room for it where there is neither the one nor the other sole reason the word invidious invidious it would be and that being the case poor economy—so poor says no   that there could not be a worse—to refuse to those gentlemen whom everybody knows that which will be given to those of whom without disparagement it must be said that they are gentlemen whom as yet nobody knows so much as to aptitude and the alleged and by the same person at the same time denied deficiency in it remains as another and the only remaining subjectmatter of deficiency the article of time—time employed in official attendance this too is another delicate topic standing so near to aptitude and in particular to the moral branch of it nothing determinate in relation to it could be hazarded allusion insinuation yes but nothing that applied to anybody great increase of population—no   morning chronicle the duties of the office would require constant attendance—no   morning chronicle—almost constant attendance—no       times hereupon comes the same troublesome question as before this constancy of attendance is it not then paid by the present gentlemen answer as before yes and no and to secure it at the hands of their future colleagues and successors comes the necessity of the same sweet security—the £ 00 ayear this £ 00 ayear to be given and without condition not only to those unknown persons but moreover and in the first place on pain of hearing the word invidious and bearing the stigma of poverty given also to the existing gentlemen in whose instance there is so much and so little need of it so much for the right honourable secretarys two evils and his proof of their existence now for his two ministerial remedies in aid of the £ 00 ayear parliamentary one—  exclusion of all but barristers   exclusion of all barristers but threeyear old ones problem which his rhetoric or his logic or what is sometimes more powerful than both his silence has undertaken for the solution of—how to prove that by these two exclusions added to the £ 00 ayear—appropriate aptitude moral intellectual and active adequate to the situation together with adequate plenitude of attendance will be produced by this policy he secures to this class of his protegés the aptitude proved by the right to the name of barrister now then what are the qualifications the sole qualifications of the possession of which any proof whatever is given by the right to bear this name—answer—being of full age payment of a certain sum in fees and taxes and on a certain number of days sprinkled over a surface of five years eating and drinking in a certain place or therein making believe to eat and drink sum between one and two hundred pounds place the hall of an inn of court number of days twenty in every year total number of days a hundred as to the making believe this option must not be omitted nor yet the hour—four or halfpast four for neither the hour nor the fare accord well with the taste of the class of persons for whom it will be seen the £ 00 is destined as if this security were not strong enough now mounts another upon the shoulders of it after five years employed in the above exercises then comes a repose of three years more for not less indeed than these three years more must this class of the right honourable secretarys protegés have borne the name of barrister but as to the exercises of eating and drinking if it be agreeable to the gentleman to perform them he is no longer burthened with any limitation in regard to place the right honourable minister in the pathetic part of his speech no   asks a question may logic in the person of an obscure individual be permitted to do the like comparatively speaking for i mean nothing more—service for five years the usual time as clerk to an attorney would it not be a security though not so dignified somewhat more efficient the clerk could not be altogether ignorant of law without his masters suffering for it the master therefore has some interest in causing him to learn it the clerk in learning it but more of this further on the security is of lord sidmouths invention so his right honourable successor assures us and much inferior authority might have sufficed to command belief it is just the sort of security that the genius of his noble and learned oracle or of mr justice bailey or of mr justice park might have devised of all these luminaries the collective wisdom was perhaps expended upon it for all these luminaries the name of barrister with three years wear of it was security sufficient and if he is sincere lord sidmouths successor looks no deeper than to names so much better in their eyes is a nominal security than a real one that when a real one offers it is deliberately put aside—no   the design of the right honourable secretary found the class of country gentlemen standing in its way a class before which ministers not to say kings themselves bow was not to be lightly dealt with something in the way of compliment to them was indispensable the compliment however was unavoidably of a somewhat ambiguous character as not being eminent lawyers they could not serve the purpose inaptitude on their parts—relative inaptitude at least—it was necessary should somehow or other be insinuated as to this matter if absolute inaptitude would content the right honourable gentleman my feeble suffrage would see no very cogent reason against joining itself to his but as to comparative inaptitude in the case in question—comparative in relation to his three years old and theretofore perhaps eating and drinking barristers so far i cannot go with him for not only country gentlemen at large but country magistrates—nay and such country magistrates as have been in use to perform—and that for whatsoever length of time—the duties of this very office—such are those he puts from him this being decided for extinguishing all pretensions to appropriate aptitude on their part the purpose of his argument required a dyslogistic epithet routine is accordingly the epithet by which the whole of the business they have been accustomed to is characterized yet make the least of it it at any rate composes the greatest part of the business of the very office from which he is excluding them one more look and you will see that the business they have been accustomed to has in the instance of many     of them and may if he will vouchsafe to adopt them be in the instance of all these children of his adoption made to comprise the whole of it such being the candidates whom he puts aside as unfit for the business what are the objects of his embrace threeyears old barristers altogether unused to business of any kind unless eating and drinking or making believe to eat and drink is business to a person who has never dined or made believe to dine at an inn of court hall all this may seem exaggeration to say no worse i speak not only from observation but from experience such is my good fortune never as yet have i been convicted of perjury nobody has ever given me anything for saying this my evidence is therefore good evidence and it applies not less to the making believe to eat and drink than to the actual exhibition of those so perfectly conclusive and exclusively receivable tests of aptitude for the office of magistrate thus the matter stood sixty years ago and thus i am assured by equally competent witnesses it stands still let it not be said the place being a law place the conversation turns of course upon law there being no conversation upon anything there is no conversation upon law for unless you happen to be already acquainted with him you have no more conversation with your messmate than if he were at the antipodes to complete his demonstration of the superiority of his threeyears old barristers without any experience to a quondam country gentleman with thirty years of appropriate experience the right honourable secretary brings exemplification from the building act and tells honourable house of a case under it which says no   had occupied a couple of days during which surveyors had been examined on both sides now in a case of this sort what is there that should render even an experienced magistrate less competent than an equally experienced barrister what has it to do either with equity or with common law country magistrates who not a few of them are themselves builders—who all of them are accustomed to order buildings to be built—built with perhaps a little of their own money and sometimes with rather too much of other peoples—what should hinder them from being at least as well conversant with the subject as the most learned inhabitant of lincolns inn oldbuildings here for law is an act of parliament nothing more for fact evidence about something that should or should not have been done under that same act the days thus employed what would they have been to the purpose if instead of two there had been twenty of them at the winding up of his speech no  0 to place above all contradiction the indispensableness of the £ 00 ayear comes a trope—the word refuse—which seems to bid defiance to all endeavours to descry anything in it beyond the intensity of the desire to give birth to the indispensable effect barristers—all barristers in the lump—are by this figure of speech divided into two classes those who will serve for £ 00 ayear and those who will not serve for the £ 00 but will for the £ 00 as to the meaning it is indeed intelligible enough not so by any means the grounds of it that it were so is however rather to be wished for those—all those who would be content that the £ 00 ayear public money which the right honourable secretary is thus buying creatures with should be saved—all those barristers as they are are branded with the common name of refuse such is the contempt—the undisguised the thus loudly proclaimed contempt in which sincerity—i mean always comparative sincerity—is held by this one of our head guardians of public morals insincerity is among the qualities professed to be possessed by barristers the only one which is sure to be possessed by any of them now then true it is that no reason can be alleged for supposing that so far as disposition goes those who get least business are behindhand in this endowment with those who get most but disposition is one thing—practice is another and the less a man has manifested of it the more deepdrawn is the contempt which he receives on his head at the hands of the right honourable secretary from the bucket lettered with the word refuse meantime here stands a strange mystery refuse—were there ever such a plenty of it would the hand of mr peel pick it off the dunghill and place it on high—this refuse forbid it consistency at least for who is it that prophesies it of him is it not mr peel himself but shall he be suffered thus to deal by himself shall amyntas murder amyntas one possible solution remains and but one on the part of a barrister willingness to serve in the office of police magistrate for so little as the £ 00 ayear is not merely evidence of his inaptitude for that office but conclusive evidence this meaning however strange being intelligible enough—we have thus far something tangible to examine for supposing none but refuse willing to serve refuse he must take up with or have none and thus it being hobsons choice there is no inconsistency either in his making it or in his avowing the making it but suppose enough willing who are not refuse what matter is it how many there are who are refuse will he then having good and bad before him both in plenty take in hand the bad putting aside the good the stock of difficulties is not yet exhausted comes now a point for him to settle with certain     gentlemen of the thirty gentlemen at present serving in this situation four i see who by his own account no    are serving and for these three years or thereabouts have been serving at the low price none of them i hope were born in ireland or in the united states if yes there may be danger in the case sir they may say to him one after another do you mean to call me refuse one consolation is that refuse as according to him they are as per no   they are not the less included in his certificate no   of universal aptitude this with the assurance of the additional £ 00 may it is hoped soften them was it for this that the £ 00 was extended to those in whose instance experience if he is to be believed has demonstrated that for any other purpose it was not needed one lumping assumption there is upon which the whole strength of his argument rests faintness of prospect such as to induce a man in the profession to take up with £ 00 ayear certain charged with moderate labour is conclusive evidence of his not being fit either for the profession of barrister or for the office of police magistrate how brisk are the right honourable secretarys conclusions involved in the assumption is this—that all who have not actually a certain quantity of the business in question or at least a strong assurance of it are unfit for it now then how stands the matter in point of fact in a prodigious degree more than any other this profession is always overstocked in this same profession the quantity of business that shall be deemed sufficient to produce a refusal of the office with the £ 00 ayear—let the fixation of it be left even to him—for one who is in possession of it there may be two or more likely a much greater multiple of one that are not in possession of it here then according to his own reckoning for one who is not refuse there will be the two the three the halfdozen where shall we end who are refuse and yet as above of this refuse for aught he can know numbers there are in any proportion whose aptitude is at the highest pitch and who yet if they have either common prudence or disposition to follow so many examples as are before them will not disdain to pick up the supposed disgraceful pittance let me not be accused of taking an undue advantage of an unguarded word substitute the tamest word the language furnishes the arguments remain the same meantime who does not know that there are certain points of aptitude in respect of which a man may be very indifferently qualified for making his way at the bar and yet perhaps be but so much the better qualified for the exercise of the functions of the office in question being as they are—with mr justice baileys leave be it spoken—the functions of the judge rhetoric is the leading talent of the barrister logic of the judge and between the two the strife is not much less fierce than according to the poet between liberty and love be this as it may almost everybody knows—and a man must be a secretary of state or at least a cabinet minister not to know—that in this profession above all others success depends upon accident at least as much as upon aptitude—that it has for its proximate cause a certain opinion in the heads of attorneys and that if external circumstances altogether independent of inward endowments do not concur in the generation of this opinion a man may unite the rhetoric of a murray with the logic of a dunning and at the end of a long life die like sergeant kemble the reporter without ever having clasped to his panting breast the blessing of a brief nor yet are we out of our wood for still remains one topic to thicken the perplexity it is that of the length of standing—the yet remaining one of the three branches of the right honourable secretarys security for aptitude to render a barrister an object of his choice three years says no   must be his length of standing now then of the number three thus applied what was the design—to extend the number of admissible candidates or to narrow it the too young or the too old—for the exclusion of which of these unapt classes was it intended the too young says the wording abstractedly considered the too old says the word refuse and the sort of argument conveyed by it for these are they who by their willingness to accept of so low a price as the £ 00 have given the requisite proof of inaptitude—of their despair of barrister business—and consequently of their inaptitude for the office of police magistrate thus incompetent says the argument are the old barristers run to seed—turn now to the threeyearolds in the breasts of all this blooming youth no such selfcondemning and inaptitudeproving despair can have had time to form itself at this short standing—unless here and there a special pleader who has shown himself by practice under the bar be an exception—no practice no expectation—consequently no disappointment expectation how should there have been any after these three years how long shall we say continues the time for junior openings which require nothing but a few words got by heart and halfguinea motions of course which require not even that—sources not furnishing upon an average the tenth part of the supposed disdained £ 00 now then comes the comparison to these men in whose instance by the admission or rather by the assertion of the right honourable secretary the probability is—that they have had no appropriate experience worth     mentioning—to these men is to belong the exclusive chance of being chosen for the office while those who may have appropriate experience in any quantity not incompatible with the choice of £ 00 ayear for life charged with the already very moderate and naturally still decreasing labour which will be seen presently—are for that reason to be regarded as being proved in hopeless degree unapt and on that ground are to be excluded from all chance but you have forgot says somebody the wonderworking £ 00 ayear not i indeed but forasmuch as in the case of the threeyearolds it is to create aptitude out of nothing—i see not why it should find less difficulty in creating it in the instance of the twenty or twentythreeyearolds to whose stock of the requisite materials no limitation can be assigned short of that which is applied by an assurance of more than the £ 00 ayear by professional practice to prepare honourable house for the reception of the above logic and the above rhetoric right honourable secretary sets out i see with history original salaries £ 00 result per times no   incompetence per morning chronicle total incompetence cause and proof of the incompetence manifest out of twelve the original number barristers no more than three being barristers these three should naturally have produced a fiveandtwenty per cent discount from the totality of the incompetence but perhaps they were of the refuse sort and grant him but this the exception being thus only apparent gives strength rather than weakness to his sweeping rule here too sincerity compels me to be totally recalcitrant major minor conclusion—to nothing can i accede incompetence neither proved nor probabilized power of the first £ 00 ayear to increase competence supposing a deficiency of it denied by me supposing it admitted need of the proposed second £ 00 ayear for producing competence denied again the actual production of it having been so triumphantly proved by me as above proved by the most irrefragable of all testimony—his own evidence proof of the incompetence of the original nine—nonbarristership with so concise and at the sametime so satisfactory a proof especially to the barrister part of the audience—at this stage of his history in union with his logic the right honourable secretary might perhaps have done as well had he not only begun but ended not much strength it is believed will either of these his supports receive from the particulars the year of the establishment being     —the nine are all of them by this time gathered to their fathers indeed the right honourable gentlemans urbanity considered the sentence thus passed on them proves as much from such a quarter a more drastic condemnation unless it were by the word refuse can scarcely be imagined but they had not risen poor gentlemen to the rank of those the feelings of whose surviving relatives can make claim to the protection of lord chiefjustice abbott and if they had it is not against a secretary of state nor even against a member of honourable house—speaking in his place—that it could be afforded instead of the sweet satisfaction of seeing fine and imprisonment inflicted on the gainsayer—they must therefore under their affliction put up with such poor support as an obscure and unpaid exbarrister of the refuse class has it in his power to give with an exception of which presently of no one of the devoted nine do i remember anything the sort of character evidence which i have to adduce for them is therefore none of it of that sort which is called direct none of it more than circumstantial nor is it the worse for being so for as applied to character the value of direct evidence unless it be from some such person as a secretary of state may be judged from what is above although it is from a secretary of state to return to the history—in regard to appropriate aptitude—competence i cannot keep to since it includes not to say exclusively denotes acceptance at the hands of those to whom inaptitude is a recommendation—in regard to appropriate aptitude the question is between the nine defunct and reprobated original magistrates and the right honourable secretarys magistrates in petto or in embryo—his threeyearold barristers of these as yet unborn babes of grace—offspring of the imagination of the right honourable secretary—the title to the quality of aptitude has been already disposed of circumstantial evidence and proof presumptive of inaptitude—want of experience in business or more shortly—their not being men of business now then for my nine clients the right honourable secretarys list of them no   has been seen major one clergymen three—oh fie what after the major—starchdealers two glasgow trader one now with the exception of the three clergymen whom i shall leave to those so much more efficient advocates of whom no gentleman of their cloth can never be in want—magistrates for whom i cannot find any tolerably presumptive evidence of their having been men of business in any way—of all the others i am bold to affirm that they had been men of business i will go further and add—nor is there any one of those occupations experience in the business of which does not afford stronger presumption of aptitude—even in relation to the business of the office in question than     can be afforded by an utter want of all experience in any kind of business the major being a major must have passed through the several grades—ensign or the equivalent lieutenant captain and in all of them if commanding men by scores and hundreds is business—he must have been a man of business the starchdealers they too must have been men of business for buying and selling starch is doing business and in that business with whatever degree of success they could not but have been exerting themselves forasmuch as their subsistence depended upon it all this too in addition to their having been bonâ fide eating as well as drinking to wit from the hour they gave up the nipple down to the time of their appointment which is rather more than can be alleged in favour of the aptitude of the right honourable secretarys protegés unless it be the difference between the performing of those exercises at a mans own home and the performing them in the hall of an inn of court which difference i cannot bring myself to regard as constituting to the purpose in question a very material one i come lastly to the glasgow trader being a trader he too must have been a man of business as such i might leave him but it having fallen in my way to know in what ways and in how conspicuous a degree with reference to the business of this very office he proved himself a man of business i shall venture a few particulars this man was patrick colquhoun and unless destroyed by the comparative smallness of his remuneration his relative aptitude has stronger as well as more incontrovertible proofs than can i trust be produced not only by the right honourable secretarys unknown protegés in embryo whom even i look down upon as so many chits—but even by the whole of the actually existing barristermagistrates produced by the additional £ 00 ayear to whom i make my bow whoever they may be—treatise i mean on the police of the metropolis treatise on indigence treatise on the office of constable—and for aught i know others for i have not time to hunt for them bearing most directly upon the business of this very office as to the firstmentioned—of the number of its editions i am afraid to speak not having the last before me the fifth which i have in hand is as early as      and there must have been several others after it into the merits of them i cannot afford to enter this paper not being either a quarterly an edinburgh or a westminster review nor if i could could i venture to put my judgment in competition with the single word incompetence from the lips of the right honourable secretary i must leave them therefore to that evidence and if that evidence be not more probative than any which the right honourable secretary has adduced in favour of his future protegés or even in favour of their existing predecessors and intended colleagues i must give up my cause evidence of this sort in abundance must be omitted one lot is too pointed to be thus dealt with to this glasgow trader whatever may be the value of it was the public indebted for the first addition made to the number of those offices and the right honourable secretary for a proportionable part of the patronage to the value of which he is thus labouring to give increase it was the addition made by the thames police act    and  0 geo iii anno   00 ch    of this business it fell in my way not to be altogether ignorant a bill was necessary colquhoun had found the facts i ventured to supply the law i drew the bill leaving out as much of the customary surplusage as i durst in the procedure clauses for giving execution and effect to the law i ventured as far as i durst and further than any one had ventured before incompetent as the performance could not but be coming out of such hands change of hands rendered its competence unquestionable at my humble request a learned gentleman of the first distinction i know my distance better than to mention him received it into his and without the change of a word it became law the plan had been formed by colquhoun in conjunction with i forget what body of mercantile men who wanted a sort of board of which he was to be at the head the board they did not get but a present of £ 00 testified their sense of his competence with relation to police business such was the nameless glasgow trader his name would not have been quite so suitable to the right honourable secretarys purpose as it is to mine as to the three clergymen leaving the question as to their incompetence to be settled by the honourable secretary with the archbishops of canterbury defunct and living the lord chancellors and the several lord lieutenants i proceed to the remaining one of the two evils for which the second £ 00 ayear as provided by him is to operate as a remedy this is—the deficiency in the article of time the deficiency if any present or future in regard to the quantity of time employed or eventually about to be employed by the magistrates in question in the fulfilment of their duties on this evil the right honourable secretary touches it should seem with rather a tender hand allusion and insinuation rather than assertion are the forms of speech i see employed per no  —in the business great increase cause ditto partly in acts of parliament partly in population triumphant tenders of papers in proof of all these facts—to     which might have been added the existence of the sun at noonday of the existence of the thus delicatelyassumed evil—at the hands of the right honourable secretary i look in vain for other proof from that most authentic source somewhat less explicit is the evidence i see to the contrary it is that which has been already seen it is made of stretching leather it is wide enough to be applied to whatever can be desired by the thirty gentlemen—who it has been seen are at once so competent and for want of the £ 00 ayear so incompetent—these duties as per no    are performed to the great satisfaction of the country and this notwithstanding that as per no   to prove the necessity of the barrister part almost constant attendance he says is required required good but by whom was it or anything like it ever required—a question somewhat more easy to put than to answer by any such attendance or anything like an approach to it the place would be spoilt and no gentleman would accept it acceptance would of itself be proof of incompetence now then forasmuch as in this office according to the right honourable secretarys opinion an almost constant attendance is required and accordingly forms part and parcel of its duties—and forasmuch as without exception these same duties are according to this his evidence actually performed—performed not merely to his satisfaction but to the satisfaction of the country—forasmuch as i say evidence of the existence of this one of his two evils is notwithstanding the prodigious pile of papers with the mention of which he at once alarmed and satisfied the house still to seek—for this deficiency though it is not in my power to provide a supply it is not i flatter myself altogether out of my power humbly to point out a course by which he may obtain it true or false newspaper statement is unofficial statement unofficial statement is not admitted in evidence even when no man in honourable house doubts or will venture to express a doubt of the correctness of it honourable house knows better than to admit through such a channel anything however well attested in the character of evidence yet are such statements—unofficial and incompetent as they are—made use of every day in the character of indicative evidence for the elicitation of acknowledged evidence this premised i shall venture to copy from a newspaper a portion of a paragraph humbly observing that in every one of the offices in question there exist various persons from any of whom if it be agreeable to know it honourable house and in it right honourable secretary may learn at any time whether in this same newspaper statement there be any and what portion and degree of truth and how far the actual agrees with their required constancy of attendance we believe says the globe and traveller as quoted in the examiner of march        —we believe a magistrate attends at each of the offices from twelve to three and looks in again in the evening there are three magistrates in an office so that this duty is imposed upon each of them twice aweek we know that there is some business for which the presence of two magistrates is necessary but it is to be recollected that at almost all the offices volunteer magistrates are frequently in attendance we are convinced that a very large statement of the time each magistrate needs be in attendances is—every other day three hours in the morning and twice aweek two hours in the evening in regard to this evil if anything that comes from so incompetent a quarter could be heard i could i think do something towards tranquillizing the right honourable secretary aptitude is not quite so easily secured as asserted but attendance—the maximum of possible attendance—every masterman how humble soever in condition—every masterman that really desires it has it to the extent of his desires the right honourable secretary has it in his own individual office with the assistance of honourable and right honourable house to the same extent he may have it in the instance of every other public office without exception if then in any instance and in any degree he fails to have it it is because he does not desire not because he is not able to obtain it you may maximize attendance and you may minimize it the maximization problem has been solved and with illustrious success in the case of the children of the indigent when worked upon a steam scale as some are killed off others succeed and capital—the one and the only thing needful—accumulates examined in his place or elsewhere one honourable member of honourable house could give on this point if i have not been misinformed instructive information his name if i mistake not begins with a p those whose will it is to minimize attendance might if in the above newspaper report there be any approach to truth receive instruction if it be worth while by applying to another p no less a p than mr secretary peel but it is not worth while those who understand nothing else understand this everybody man and boy knows how to be idle—every man knows what it is to stand looking on and helping while others are idle every man knows what it is to pay as well as to be paid for doing work and all the while seeing and leaving it undone other arts travel at their different paces under     matchless constitution the art of sinecurism is at its acme in my small way i have a manufactory of my own in which with the same sort of instrument imagination with which the right honourable secretary has manufactured aptitude in the instance of his threeyearold barristermagistrates and for my own amusement as a halfretired chimneysweeper swept chimneys i make judges my judges are judges of all work and of all hours they do not it is true sit each of them every day in every year and on every day every hour of the fourandtwenty but in each judicatory they following one another do all this when sleeps injustice so may justice too said a voice to me in one of my dreams my muse is but a hobbling one—she has not been to school to the laureates the too is somewhat of a botch but i remember her so much the better in one thing i endeavour to copy the right honourable secretarys noble and learned friend—it is the quality so judiciously selected for his eulogium—consistency the ends to which my judicial establishment and my procedure code in conformity to the constitutional code to which they belong are from beginning to end directed are the ends of justice under matchless constitution the ends to which the judicial establishment is and the procedure code if there were any would be directed—are the ends of judicature what these are it is not for me to presume to inform the honourable secretary over and over again he must have heard them amidst peals of laughter or floods of tears from his learned and matchlesslyconsistent friend before or after the second bottle such being the bill—such the ostensible and declared objects of it—such the evils asserted or insinuated—such the remedies provided—such the arguments employed in proof of the evils and in recommendation of the remedies—what after all is the real object the topic must not be omitted though to few of the readers if any whose patience has brought them thus far can anything on this head be regarded as much more needed than were the honourable secretarys proofs of increase of population and acts of parliament loss by waste of public money is in every instance an evil in the present instance loss in the article of aptitude is in my view of the matter a still greater evil to the augmentation of aptitude perfectly inoperative will be the £ 00 ayear not so to the diminution of it £ 000 ayear is a salary for a nobly related puisne at one of the highest boards i am fearful of mistakes and have no time for researches when red books had the salaries to them £ 000 if recollection does not mislead me was the number attached to the office of puisne admiralty lord in the heaven of office there are many mansions of a police magistrate the station cannot be altogether upon a level with that of an admiralty lord but the £ 00 ayear will raise the lower office to a level next below that of the higher one to a reverend youth—even to one born honourable—a spiritual benefice yielding £ 00 ayear is not altogether an object of disdain—eased as above of labour though not so perfectly as in the other case why should even this temporal one without some improvement attendance is a burthen the lay incumbent can not be altogether eased of thought he may be eased of without difficulty when two magistrates are necessary there must be a nonhonourable to yield thought but the honourable will serve as well as the nonhonourable to yield auspices when one magistrate suffices the dignity of the honourable man will need no disturbance but the only case in which burthens so degrading to honourable men will require to be imposed is an extreme case naturally speaking there will in general be unpaid magistrates enough to whom for the time and trouble of attendance the power and the amusement will afford sufficient compensation one of these suppléans the nonhonourable takes care to provide each time for his honourable friend and colleague thus is the labour of the honourable minimized and sadly have his nonhonourable colleagues been deficient in what everybody owes to his rank if the quantity of time actually employed in official duties is anything more than an impalpable one here then in short comes the effect and use of this second £ 00 the first did not bring the place within the sphere of the highlyconnected class the hope is—that the second will it will at any rate form a basis for a third   what makes all doctrines plain and clear   about two hundred pounds ayear so stood the matter in sir hudibrass time but now the £ 00 must have an ever increasing number of others to mount upon seldom if ever do i endeavour to overthrow without endeavouring at the same time to build up for maximizing the chance in favour of everything needful i have a recipe of my own and that exemplified upon the largest scale the principle of it will be found in another part of this volume or in one that will soon follow it alas what hopes can there be for mine it is the very reverse of the right honourable secretarys it may serve him at any rate to laugh at his plan excludes experienced magistrates admitting nobody but nominal barristers now then comes the laugh—the most efficient and approved of house of commons arguments mine admits nobody but experienced magistrates     excluding barristers nominal and real all together my plan serves at once for aptitude and attendance as to aptitude—for that i require as a qualification previous admission into the magistracy and thereafter unpaid but constant and adequately proved attendance at some one of the existing offices attendance for a certain length of time say five years to wit when from the commencement of the plan that length of time has elapsed and till then for as great a length of time as can be had now for a contrast between my experienced magistrates and the right honourable secretarys unfledged barristers—adding if so it please him any number of greyheaded ones   as to moral aptitude my magistrates will have been engaged in the exclusive support of right—or at least of what the legislature has pronounced right—and the exclusive repression of wrong—or at least of what the legislature has pronounced wrong his barristers will have been occupied either in nothing at all or in what is so much worse than nothing promiscuous defence of right and wrong with the universal predilection for wrong as being the best customer   as to intellectual aptitude composed as it is of appropriate knowledge and judgment my magistrates will for the whole of their unremunerated length of time have been employed on the very spot in study and occasionally in practice in the very field for which it is proposed to engage their remunerated services in the whole of that field and in no other than that field to their consideration will have been subjected in all their varieties all sorts of cases which can have grown up in that same field the right honourable secretarys barristers with their £ 00 instead of £ 00 ayear—how will they have been occupied my answer has been seen already the right honourable secretarys answer the country will be grateful for if he can find any but they may have been not only barristers but barristers in full practice and all the while not knowing anything more of the business of a police magistrate than if they had been all the while fighting as army officers of practising barristers there are about as many equity as common lawyers now in a police magistrates practice what is there that has anything in common with equity practice let him bestow a glance on the table to maddocks equity and then on the table to the last edition of burns justice or whatever work has now supplanted it and see whether this is not strictly true to those abstracts i venture in kindness to refer him long as the road through may seem to be as being shorter than through the mazes of his walking dictionary those he might get by heart sooner than an intelligible answer from his oracle a negative the oracle would not venture to give and an affirmative he would not choose to give   lastly as to appropriate active aptitude on the part of my magistrates it would be a maximum by every motive they would be impelled to render it so at the hands of the barrister what his right honourable patron does not require is activity in any shape all he does require is existence as to attendance and the means of securing it to a great degree it is already comprised in the active aptitude just spoken of but in whatever possible degree he chooses to have it he may have it if he pleases nobody who does choose to have it ever fails of having it i will not attempt to trouble him with particular proofs as they are already in one of my waking dreams in manuscript they are already in another or two and will ere long be in print if i live† this plan would suit both classes the expectant stipendiaries would not be disinclined to attend since it would increase their chance of the preferment the existing stipendiaries would not be disinclined to be attended for since it would increase their ease how much soever superior the £ 00 ayear ones may be to their exploded predecessors the £ 00 ayear ones—were they to leave the burthen of the day altogether to the still superior expectants if such they should prove the public would not any more than these same parties have in this quiet arrangement any reason to repine ahab had served baal a little jehu hath served him much what prospect have i not opened—what an epicurean heaven thirty £ 00 ayear places and all sinecures so many temporal prebends and canonries with such a potpourri of sweet arguments what is there that could not be proved laughable and delectable all this—true but would it be the less beneficial not it indeed—see horaces reports ridentem dicere c suppose not that it is upon this £ 000 ayear alone that all this examination has been expended the expense is but as a drop in the bucket the reasoning on which it is supported is no such trifle if good for £ 000 not less would it be for £ 0000 for £ 00000 or £ 000000 more than even this might if duly looked into be seen perhaps to stand upon no better grounds be this as it may by any one in whom curiosity is strong enough it may be seen how admirable a match it     makes with that on the ground of which burke for the whigs followed by rose for the tories proved as another part of this volume will show the necessity of draining out of the pockets of the productive classes the last drop of the matter of wealth that could be squeezed out of them consistently with the continuation of their existence practice it is true cannot be always rendered altogether coextensive with theory but whether the theory actually pursued as a law by government under the really existing form of government and under the fictitious entity called the constitution is not the thing actually avowed by both parties may be seen without other trouble than the turning over a few leaves mr martin if eyes or morning chronicle april        do not deceive me—mr martin of galway treading in the right honourable secretarys steps and with a copy of the above speech i presume in his memory—stands engaged on the   th of may to extend his protection to judges and i know not what besides while his protection was confined to the helpless and persecuted part of the creation i followed the honourable gentleman at an humble distance but if nothing will serve him but the extending it to those bipeds with gowns and wigs instead of feathers whom i had almost called v—n which would have been as bad as refuse—to those whose everyday occupation is depredation and everydayemployed instrument a lie—here i feel it impossible to go on with him were it my good fortune to be honoured with his confidence i would beg him to stop where he is and not suffer a hand admired and vainly endeavoured to be made ridiculous for its beneficence to be converted into a catspaw let those i would say to him let those who are to eat the chesnut put paws upon pates and beg for it let me not be mistaken when i had like to have said v—n what i had in view were feefed judges the only sort alas which matchless constitution has yet bred men to whom and so much more than to the man of finance we are indebted for the so little less than universal denial of justice if instead of adding he would substitute salaries to fees i would consent to shut my eyes against the amount howsoever extravagant it might prove the fees to be compounded for would have been—not only the fees avowedly extorted but the unhappily so much more abundant stock surreptitiously received received by these so erroneously supposed uncorrupt hands they would be—not only the fees exacted by superintendents in their own name but all those exacted under their authority by respective subordinate holders of offices of which they have the patronage for who is there that does not know that an office in a mans gift has a no less decided marketable value than an office of the same emolument in his possession true it is that compared with the value of the possession the value of the patronage may be to any amount less not less true is it that it may also be and that it not unfrequently is fully equal let lord eldon say how much less worth to him the many thousands ayear he has put into his sons pocket are than if it had been his own let mr peel if he feels bold enough look into the documents and tell us in his place how many those thousands are to the number of the offices the emolument of which a man can pocket with his own hand there are limits to the number of the offices the emoluments of which he can thus pocket through other hands there are no limits and in any number of instances the protégés life may be worth more than the patrons who is there that does not know that the value of an office to the incumbent is directly as the emolument and inversely as the labour who is there that does not know that to the patron the value of it is directly as the inaptitude of the protégé he has it in his power to put in and keep in it since the more consummate this inaptitude the less his choice is narrowed who is there for example that does not know that it is to the union of these two characters that spiritual offices in particular are indebted for their transcendent value who is there that can deny that while this mode of payment lasts interest is in all judges at daggersdrawn with duty—that it is from this cause that suits take up as many years as they need do hours and as many pounds as they need do pence who is there that can deny that it is from this cause that our system of judicial procedure is what it is—and that through the whole texture of it—judges having been the manufacturers—delay expense and vexation having been maximized for the sake of the profit extractible out of the expense yes by such hands made to no other end could it have been directed the chiefjustice of the kings bench has he not the nomination to the keepership of the prison named after his judicatory if so then to the profits of the bench are added the profits of the tap and the money which justice would have returned to the hands of the creditor is extracted through this channel also into the pockets of the judge same question as to other chiefships—whether as between one and another consistency in this respect or inconsistency is the rule also of that which is about to be squeezed by jailor out of debtors and creditors how much is in advance squeezed out of him by judge questions these none of them   0 surely unfit to be put by mr peel before he gives his support to the advocate of innoxious beasts and preeminently noxious judges originally though pregnant with depredation and oppression as it could not but be payment by fees was matter of necessity for judicature was necessary before kings had money to pay salaries for these threeandthirty years past it has been without excuse the corruption continued has been continued with open eyes when the trade of trading justices was put an end to—this was the name then given to middlesex magistrates—it was undoubtedly for this same cause it was because in their small way they made and protracted suits for the purpose of multiplying fees when this small branch of the trade was put an endto it was by the selfsame remedy i am now venturing with how little hope soever to propose so far as concerned corruption success could not be more complete salaries were substitutes to fees and in that form the plague ended when fees had thus given place to salaries what disorder there was took an opposite turn while the fees flowed into the judicial pocket there was too much activity now that if any come in they take a different direction if report is to be believed see above p     there is not enough of it lethargic not excitative is now the character of the disease beyond comparison more mischievous than the lethargic is the excitative though when the specific is applied so much easier to cure if in the case of the trading judges called magistrates the remedy was needful how much more bitterly needful is it not in the case of the trading judges called judges—look to mischief profit temptation check look to the two fields of mischief take measure of their extent under the trading justices the delay manufactured may be reckoned by days under the trading judges by years under the trading justices expense imposed on suitors may be reckoned by shillings under the trading judges by hundreds and by thousands of pounds of the jurisdiction of the trading justices local field middlesex with or without the now added three other home counties of the trading judges england local field in both cases far too irregular for measurement chaos bids defiance to the theodolite what is sufficient is—that in the case of the trading justices the sum of the scraps is a trifle compared with what it is in the case of the trading judges under the trading justices the profits of the trade may be reckoned by hundreds ayear under the trading judges by more than as many thousands honourable gentlemen—will they always be so weak as to believe or so transparently insincere as to pretend to believe that while the temptation afforded by the hundreds was irresistible the temptation afforded by the thousands was is or can ever be without effect mr peel—does he believe this his noble learned and consistent friend who if you will believe him is purity itself—does he believe this honourable gentlemen—will they always believe or affect to believe that it is in the power of a masquerade dress to change mans nature and that a contagion which a coat could not resist has been and is resisted by a gown with a strip of fur sewed to it mr peel—does he believe this the noble learned and consistent friend who is faith as well as purity personified—does he believe this so much for mischief—profit—temptation now as to check in one sense of the word responsibility the trading justices had judges over them judges by whom—if haply in an extreme case money could be raised sufficient to buy a hearing for a cry for punishment—they might be punished—judges who though not fond of punishing any man with a kings commission in his pocket—might thereupon by fear of shame be peradventure driven so to do if the case were flagrant the trading justices had judges over them to any practical purposes the trading judges have none head of them all is the lord chancellor head over himself is lord eldon over lord eldon in chancery lord eldon in the house of lords charge him with creation or preservation of abuse—of delay expense vexation uncertainty—motive either none at all or the profit upon the expense—he names the inquisitors by whom the inquisition is to be made the rehearsal of this farce has been performed when the curtain comes to be drawn up—if there be hardihood enough to draw it up—will the plaudits of a plundered people welcome it remains still untouched the effective responsibility impunity wanted much of being complete in the case of the trading justices it wanted nothing in the case of the trading judges here the word responsibility is mockery action none—indictment none—pretence of impeachment a cloak—consistently with legislation impeachment is physically impossible time would suffice for rendering it so even if accusers were to be found and where is the inducement for accomplices to be become—some of them informers others of them judges thus much for impeachment address of both houses is impeachment under another name trading justices never made law the trading judges have always made it continue to make it and so long as the pretended     lawmakers suffer them—which they find no small convenience in doing—will never cease making it yes made it they always have and above all things for the sake of the trade accuse them—you do so in the teeth of a law made by themselves to punish you for it the counterfeit and judgemade law is even more effectual than a real one would be for on each occasion it is moulded at pleasure moulded by those who having made it for the purpose execute it were i to see a judge taking a bribe—should i tell of it not i if i had common prudence the person punished would be—not the judge for taking the bribe but i for telling of it thus and hence it is—that on the part—not only of all judges but of all whom they delight to favour—including all whom the king delighteth to honour—virtue is consummate character immaculate but why talk of imaginary things such as bribes when by the real things called fees—fees made lawful by those who pocket them—the work of corruption—of sure and selfcorruption—is carried on carried on in open day—carried on without fear or shame—in the face of the so long plundered and though so often warned yet still deluded people no never surely was grosser delusion than that by which english judges are exhibited as models of uncorruption in whatsoever shapes they could practise corruption without danger they have always practised it and of this practice their system of procedure composed of depredation and denial of justice has been the fruit never it is said and truly never was english judge known to take a bribe no verily for how should he bribery requires two a receiver and a giver receiver a man cannot be without putting himself into the power of the giver since bacon no english judge has been weak enough to do so and so there can be no receiver this is seen by everybody and so there can be no giver what in england should induce a judge thus to expose himself when without exposing himself he gets more in abundance than in any other country judge ever did by anything he could do to expose himself what should induce him to take of this or that man with fear and trembling money in the shape of a bribe—when by money exacted by taxes levied on all men without distinction by force of a law made by his predecessors or perhaps by himself—he is permitted under the name of fees to pocket more money than judge ever received elsewhere in the shape of bribes give a man whatsoever he would steal from you you may prevent his stealing it whatsoever a man desires to exact give him power to exact it by law you may prevent his exacting it against law of this sort is the antiseptic the infallibility of which has received such ample proof in the case of english judges as to bribery so called what is the real preservative against it publicity—that most efficient and sole safeguard which these incorruptibles ever have been and even now with the eye of the public full upon them never cease labouring to destroy a judicatory on which life and death depend is not if you will believe judge bailey—is not a court of justice why because if you will admit this a certain quantity of nonsense with the word prejudging in it may suffice for keeping the doors of it closed admit this and you may see the doors of the westminster hall judicatories equally closed—give them this you may do anything with them with as little ceremony they will be ready to give up their own title to the appellation of courts of justice were they so to do no contradiction would the position receive from me all i should object to is the practical conclusion drawn from it with lord eldon you will have little difficulty he has long been working at the change so frequently open are the doors of his closet—to shut the door of his hitherto mostly open court will be one of these days a motion of course they may however be thrown open now and then for occasions of parade whereupon bar will be seen arguing while court writes dockets reads letters or takes a nap a kindred and eminently convenient policy is—the giving to chambers of judicature such a size and form that no laygents can find entrance true it is that by this device ingenious as it is the guardian influence of the publicopinion tribunal cannot be entirely destroyed for lawyers cannot be altogether prevented from becoming writers and betraying the secrets of the court it may however by this means be in no inconsiderable degree weakened how much more effectual instruments of this policy brick and mortar are than rules of court can be is no secret all that rules could do is the rendering admission difficult properly placed brick and mortar render it impossible english judges incorrupt indeed those who talk in this strain what is it they can mean by it did they ever see or hear of a judge who was not completely at the command of the corruptorgeneral places for sons daughters husbands nephews nieces husbands friends and friends friends—and to crown all coronet for self none of these things are bribes true but are they the less irresistible—are they the less corruptive but why speak of command far short of the real strength of the corruption—of the     corruptive longings and consequent courtings and consequent compliances with presumed desires—comes the view which that word gives of it from any such superior to any such subordinate authority no such explicit expressions of will ought to be none accordingly ever are issued issued to what end need they be in a situation of that sort is there a judge is there a man that needs to be told what will displease and what will please to stand assured with sufficient certainty not a step need any man stir from his own home take for example the case of john hunt among the titles of majesty in this country is that of most excellent john hunt in his examiner says things which go to impugn that title lord chiefjustice abbott punishes him for this with loss of £ 00 under the name of fine and £ 0 under the name of costs costs of which the honourable house could know at any time if it chose to know whether anything and if anything how much directly or indirectly goes into the pocket of the chiefjustice now then of the thus punished words wherein consisted the mischief oh says his lordship or somebody for him the feelings of the king were hurt by them hurt by them how so this same hurt—how came his lordship to be so sure of it this same majesty that now is—did he ever tell him of it—did he bespeak any such punishment no the questions answer themselves to be thus assured his lordship had no further to look than into his own learned breast and there he saw them for in that repository of fine feeling what he could not fail to see clearly enough is that had it happened to himself to hear a man speak in any such strain of his lordships father he would have been indignant and not sorry to see the blasphemer punished by the king that now is or by anybody for him does lord chiefjustice abbott or lord chiefjustice anybody need to be told that obsequiousness to crowns is the road to coronets so much for power and glory now as to money if ever there was a judge on whose incorruptibility the sound of the trumpet was loud it was the late lord camden his lordship was lord high chancellor his son on pretence of telling out public money got out of it an income which when he gave it up a bow upon paper is due to him for it was worth £  000 ayear to him so much for corruptive intercourse in a case in which it is not bribery now for a case in which it would be bribery sevenandtwenty guineas in hand suppose george the third saying to the lord chancellor—in this suit naming it which i have against such an one naming him give judgment so and so and i will give you these sevenandtwenty guineas—would his lordship have taken it oh fie fie what a thought—this would have been no better than bribery multiply the twentyseven by a thousand—multiply the product by so many years as the income lasted—and though assuredly nobody said what nobody had any need to hear all is consummate purity so much for motives and the influence of them on conduct to know which for the purpose of legislation which is the purpose here in question never do i look to anything but situation of individuals i know just nothing which is just what i want to know now as to mischievousness of the law thus made the effect is and if it had any the object was to establish punishment for everything that can tend to palce in an unfavourable light the character of any king that ever lived while the whole treasury of reward is applied to the purpose of placing those jewels in the most favourable light possible probative force of the evidence being in both cases the same suppression of evidence in favour of one side is in effect exactly the same thing as forgery of it in favour of the opposite side mischievousness of the practice the same in both cases wickedness of it the same though the people as yet have not sufficiently learnt to see it keep in force this law and with a steady hand give execution and effect to it—the will of holy alliance is done and history from being the food is converted into the poison of the mind yes all history first as to the supposed injured dead the protection granted to the manes of the third george shall it be refused to those of the second or those of the first if yes at what point if at any in the line of ancestry shall it end then as to the supposed injured living if thus wounded by the aspersions cast upon his royal father can the king that now is be indifferent to any such or any other aspersion cast upon his princely grandfather his royal greatgrandfather or his first ducal then royal greatgreatgrandfather c c if not then up go we to egbert and to fergus and so on through woden to japhet and to adam at which of all these points does royal tranquillity commence—that degree of tranquillity which will suffice to render truth and history unpunishable in this case bythebye may be seen as well as in so many hundred other instances how much more useful judgemade law is to parliament itself—constituted as it is and looking to the ends which so constituted it cannot but look to—than even its own parliamentlaw could be made parliament itself would it thus dare to destroy the truth of history and cut up political science by the roots but innumerable are the things of this sort     which it does every day by the hands of judges and which fear or shame would keep it from doing by its own these things unless the lastmentioned one be an exception being so manifest and so almost universally acknowledged to be true that on account of their notoriety the very mention of them is tedious—what less can follow than that to all purposes to which corruptness is to the greatest extent mischievous a state of constant corruptedness is the state in which every judge has been that ever sat upon the english bench in cases between king and subject in which the mischief of it consists in giving countenance and increase to depredation and oppression for the benefit of his monarch his associates and dependents—the disease is incurable its root is in the form of government but in suits between subject and subject in which the mischief consists in giving countenance and increase to depredation and oppression by judges the present judges at all times excepted whatever they have been are or will be for the benefit of judges their associates and dependents the disorder is not incurable a few words more as to the remedy but for which the disease would not have here been mentioned the principle has been seen the public are indebted for it to lord colchester his was the original middlesex police magistrate act   d geo iii c    anno      time enough for amendment the bill found its way somehow or other into my hands time for scrutiny i could not afford my approval was pure and simple sheridan opposed it in honourable house objection increase of patronage—a whig complaint never grudged when nonredress is sure a few words might have dissipated it but they were words that could not be heard there subject of the objection—either the source of the delegated power or the quantum of it applied to the source the objection an unanswerable one went to the form of government it applied to every part present and future of the official establishment applied to the quantum it supposed a certain quantity of corruption needful and as such requiring to be protected from censure by the word influence all above needless and that it might be game for the whig hunt licensed to be hallooed at by its proper name applied to every future addition to the establishment the objection sought the exclusion of every good to the introduction of which—and the perpetual continuance and increase of every evil to the diminution of which—any such addition should be necessary no such desire as that of applying a bar to the increase—to the addition of corruption to influence—was really entertained in honourable house the disposition to keep influence within its bounds whatever they were had place or it had not if no objection to increase was useless if yes cancelling an equal quantity of sinecure would afford the same general security without depriving the public of the benefit of the particular measure to return to the true remedy it was a specific in the finance committee of      and     —the groundwork of such an economy as the form of government admits of—lord colchester applied it and with success to some of the administration offices it stopped there judicial corruption was in an ark too sacred to be touched in both houses whatsoever was learned would have been in a state of insurrection learned lords were above shame ministers were not above fear so there the reform rested since then the public mind has made some advance whether sufficient for the substituting of justice to depredation and corruption time will show to return to mr martin and his new protégés by his humanity he got nothing but ridicule from his liberality he may hope better fortune no honourable gentleman who for self son brother cousin or friend has ever refreshed his eyes with a glimpse of the remuneration fund can consistently harbour a doubt of the insufficiency of it whigs form no exception for though possession is not theirs at any time expectancy is at all times in the maximization of expense it unites them in interest with judges with what aspect they behold the county courts bill may be seen without looking at their eyes saving to suitors would be robbery to these their protectors while in the patronage they have no share everything they say against it—everything they can seek to clog it with—is a certificate in favour of it a measure with this object cannot have a stronger one by this his liberating scheme who knows how many supporters he may not have brought over for his humanity scheme how profound soever their contempt for their betters for when educated as they sometimes are and always may be quadrupeds have the virtues without the vices of featherless bipeds how profound soever their contempt—how complete soever their indifference—mens hatred for these animals can it to any considerable extent be greater than their love for themselves as to his instrument of purchase—his announced vermingorging bill—he could not have chosen a more promising one this measure is of the number of those which even an opposition member may be admitted to carry and in which success can scarce be dubious reasons are ready stationed in each honourable breast they stand upon a rock and calculation is the name of it what will my share of the annual charge amount to a few halfpence ayear—what i toss now and then to a beggar to get rid of him when he is     troublesome thus much on the debtor side now per contra creditor so many more thousands ayear for my son my nephew my cousin or though it were but my cousins cousin when his time comes which it can scarce fail to do for taking his seat in a certain place for calculation being settled in the head then from hand or lungs comes the substance of the universallyreceived economicomathematical truism—official aptitude is in the direct ratio of ditto remuneration—a proposition which to render it really true requires nothing but the substituting to the word direct the word inverse thereupon comes a flower or two such as the right honourable secretarys rhetoric has just been seen scattering over the subject—virtue displayed and appealed to generosity dignified virtue displayed in the penetration manifested by seeing through the cloud which the word economy pronounced with a shake of the head—poor economy had in the head of vulgar ignorance thrown over the question natural and customary result—hear him hear him from all quarters is anything ever said on the other side if yes it is for forms sake with a sort of faint and as if selfcondemning tone nor even this but under the most satisfactory assurance that the measure will not be hurt by it while upon this ground i cannot pass over altogether an error—for such i am persuaded it is—on the part of mr peel as to a matter of fact and which remained unnoticed before because foreign to the purpose in england according to him no   judges are worse paid than in almost any other country in the world not that even if admitted the fact would serve his purpose it would run counter to his purpose for if not the only incorruptible english judges so almost everybody has hitherto been in the habit of saying are of all in the world the most incorruptible well then—this incorruptibility—forasmuch as by what you are paying for it you have got it already—why pay anything more for it this question would be unanswerable were it not for the argument ad verecundiam men who perform so charmingly can you be so ungenerous as to let them serve at an under price when it would be so easy for you to give them a fair price the argument is worthy of the nursery and perhaps has been inherited from it the child is gorged with meat but spies out cake and cries for it dear sweet poppet says grandmother to mother can you be so hardhearted as to let it cry on only to save a little bit of cake so much for argument now for fact talking with a frenchman tother day on this subject £ 0 ayear he assured me—£ 0 and no more is the salary of that class of judges by which by far the greatest part of the business is done well but dont they take bribes—no such thing on the contrary the country is universally satisfied with them just what we have seen the right honourable secretary assuring us of in the case of the £ 00 ayear magistrates the right honourable secretary having it in charge to find his £ 00 ayear insufficient its sufficiency notwithstanding had somewhat of a bias upon his own mind according to the right honourable secretary with these his £ 00 ayear magistrates the country is universally satisfied but then as has been seen though satisfied he is at the same time dissatisfied with them and besides their aptitude being to be proved as well as disproved he had something of a bias though a shifting one upon his mind the frenchman had no such bias he is himself neither judge magistrate nor lawyer nor patron with reference to any who are he is a man of estate birth and connexion and though all that a man of information and discernment it did not occur to me to crossexamine him as to fees but as what we were talking about turned upon what was the whole of the emoluments i cannot but think that if there are fees they are fees of which neither the magnitude can be increased nor yet the number extended otherwise than by the satisfaction afforded by good judicature and that if any at all the £ 0 does not receive from them any such increase as would affect the argument i for my part would not give for them another £ 0 this though if it were anything to the purpose it might surely serve for inquiry—is not official what follows is printed register of officers and agents c prepared at the department of state date of congress resolution   th april      printed anno      at

masterships besides the ever corruptive fees before the words every other country stands indeed in one of the reports of the right honourable secretarys speech no   the limitative word almost let any one judge whether it was not a prudential one a thing more to be wished than hoped for is—that in the right honourable secretarys situation and those associated with it right honourable gentlemen and noble lords were a little more careful than they sometimes are when speaking to facts especially distant and complex ones such as those in questions like this more especially by lord liverpool not many years ago if recollection does not greatly deceive me—by lord liverpool it     was declared and insisted upon that in this country population for population he could not but mean the expense of the official establishment was less than in the united states proceeding in this strain had he entered upon particulars the king he would have had to say costs this country less than the president does the united states so much for first treasury lord right honourable secretary—would he after speaking upon the particular branch of the expenditure now in hand as he has done—would he after parliamentary inquiry into the facts consent to pay the judicial establishment upon the same scale as it is paid in that country in which to use his own phrase it is so much less parsimoniously paid than in this not he indeed what is it he would then turn upon us and ask what is it to the purpose what people do in other countries—in countries in which the state of things is so different from what it is in our own is it for us to receive laws from other countries in a committee of his own nomination will he be pleased to elicit the evidence by which the correctness of this assertion of his will be proved he knows better things what use he would ask is getting up evidence from which nothing is to follow lord liverpool—will he consent to assign to the whole official establishment the same rate of remuneration as that which has place in the united states—general government and particular states always included to no such insidious proposal would his lordship give acceptance his love for the people and for economy is too sincere to suffer him to pledge himself to an innovation from which the dear people would have nothing to gain and so much to lose on pain of ignominy a helpless radical must maintain whether he will or no some caution in regard to his facts were he to make a slip he would never hear the last of it high situation places a man at his ease in regard to facts as often as occasion requires he may let fly insinuations or assertions such as the above and thenceforward hear no more of them than he pleases should any unpleasant use of them be endeavoured to be made up comes the rule no allusion to anything said in a former debate good if responsibility be good for nothing not so clearly so if responsibility be good for anything so far as regards facts it is a counterpart to that mendacity licence which in scotch reform and elsewhere has been held up to view as one of the pillars and main instruments of english judicature throughout this examination i have never been altogether free from feelings of compunction at the thoughts of the sort of liberty all along taken with the author of the special jury bill on the present occasion i found him doing as in his place everybody else has done on that other occasion i see him taking a course peculiar to himself time does not at this moment permit me so much as to read the bill i cannot therefore on the ground of any opinion of my own venture to say a syllable of it but if it does but completely substitute as i am assured it does lot to packing and is in other respects what it has been certified to be by those whose discernment and love of justice i stand assured of it will by this one measure ensure to him a stock of popularity and public confidence such as i tremble but to think of should this measure be carried through he must however content himself as well as he can with the reputation of probity for as for that of consistency it will quit him and seek refuge in its chosen seat the bosom of his noble and learned friend consistency being where it is—how anything of this sort should have found its way into the secretary of states office is the mystery of mysteries one word more as to patronage on the present occasion it is to the lessening the value of it to the honourable secretary that my endeavours such as they are have been applying themselves yet so far am i from grudging him any good thing obtainable without preponderant evil to the community—in the case of the county courts bill no desire a man in his place can have for feeling the patronage of it is in his own hands can be more sincere than mine for seeing it there supposing the situation equally acceptable to the only class of expectants worth providing for here is a stock of patronage worth at least three times as much as that other county court judges thirty salary of each £ 00 this gives £  000 ayear—thrice as much as the £ 000 no hands can i find anywhere which in point of aptitude matchless constitution standing as it stands would bear a thought in comparison of his lord lieutenants—they are so many invisible objects in the high court of public opinion nobody will see them—nobody will know who they are the judge chosen by each will be chosen of the family most connected in the county which is as much as to say the most unapt that could be chosen armed as he is like any achilles still the place of a secretary of state is at the bar of public opinion and he stands an object to all eyes here are mine for example weak as they are yet better perhaps than none thus watching him could they keep running after thirty or i dont know how many more lord lieutenants chancellors—aye—theres the rub sooner than see the patronage in the hands of the model of consistency or even of any other english feefed judge—sooner much sooner would i see it added to the portefeuille of the chancellor of france     speech of mr secretary peel on introducing the police magistrates salary increase bill   st march      extract reported in the times and the morning chronicle of the   d— times   he held in his hand papers from which if he chose to enter into any detail he could prove to the satisfaction of the committee that since the institution of police magistrates the business which devolved on those individuals had owing to various acts of parliament which had been passed independently of the increase of population greatly augmented although that circumstance would of itself be a sufficient reason for increasing the salary of the magistrates he rested his proposition upon grounds which he hoped the committee would consider even more satisfactory   when the police magistrates were first appointed it was the practice to select individuals to fill the office who he must say were incompetent to discharge the duties which devolved upon them he found from the papers which had been laid upon the table that out of twelve police magistrates appointed at a former period there were only three barristers the rest were composed of a major in the army a starchmaker three clergymen a glasgow trader and other persons who from their occupations could not but be considered as utterly unqualified to perform the duties of magistrates   the law had fixed no limitation with respect to the previous education of persons appointed to the office of magistrate but he thought the committee would be pleased to hear that a limitation on that point had been prescribed by the secretary of state neither his predecessor in office lord sidmouth nor himself had ever appointed a person to fill the office of magistrate who had not been a barrister of three years standing that was a rule to which in his opinion it was most desirable to adhere   but in order to enable the secretary of state to abide by that rule and to carry it into practice it was necessary to augment the present salary of police magistrates he implored the house to consider whether £ 00 ayear the present salary was sufficient to induce a barrister to give up the emoluments of private practice and the hope of preferment in his profession to undertake the duties of a magistrate   which required their almost constant attendance it could not he thought be considered an unreasonable proposition that in future the secretary of state should be empowered to give to each police magistrate the sum of £ 00 per annum   he hoped that he should not be told that individuals might be found who would be willing to undertake the magisterial duties for a less sum it was very true that such was the case he was constantly receiving applications from persons who were anxious to be appointed police magistrates those applications proceeded principally from country magistrates who had discharged the duties of their officeably and satisfactorily but whom nevertheless he did not think right to appoint to be police magistrates in the metropolis he held the unpaid magistracy in as high respect as any man but he could easily conceive that a gentleman might in consequence of the influence which he derived from local circumstances—the relations of landlord and tenant for instance—be able to discharge the duties of a country magistrate in a satisfactory manner who would be incompetent to undertake the important ones of a police magistrate   police magistrates was the name generally given to those magistrates to whom he alluded but those persons were mistaken who supposed that the duties which they had to perform were merely executive they were called upon to administer the law in a great number of complicated cases which were submitted to them out of some recent acts of parliament some very important questions arose which the police magistrates were called upon to decide several nice cases had occurred under the building act he knew one case of that description which had occupied the attention of the magistrates for a couple of days during which surveyors had been examined on both sides he thought that a salary of £ 00 ayear was not more than a fair remuneration for the practice which a barrister must abandon when he undertook the duties of a magistrate   it appeared to him that the individuals appointed to administer justice in this country were more parsimoniously dealt with than in almost any other country in the world he thought this was poor economy to give inadequate remuneration to individuals selected to administer justice whether in the highest office of judge or in the less important but still very important office of police magistrate   he might he did not doubt get persons—  0 those persons who could not succeed in their profession—the refuse of the bar—to fill the office of police magistrate at a lower salary than he proposed to give—he could save £ 00 or £ 00 ayear by such a proceeding but the public would have cause to lament it    the present police magistrates were of the highest personal respectability and performed their duties to the great satisfaction of the country they were thirty in number only four of whom were not barristers the right honourable gentleman concluded with moving—that it is the opinion of the committee that each justice appointed or to be appointed under the act for the more effectual administration of the office of justice of the peace shall receive a salary not exceeding £ 00 morning chronicle   he held papers in his hand showing in the clearest manner the great increase that had taken place in the business of the police offices since their first institution arising from the great increase of the population of the metropolis amongst other causes it appeared from those papers that since their first establishment considerable additions had been made to the business of the offices by various acts of parliament passed at different times but he would lay his proposition upon stronger grounds   in the first instance the salaries of the magistrates amounted only to £ 00 per annum it was afterwards raised to £ 00 but it was well known that under the former regulation the persons appointed were totally incompetent to the duties he found that of the twelve magistrates first appointed three were barristers one was a major three clergymen two starchdealers and one a glasgow trader   he thought the committee would be pleased to hear that though there was no limitation fixed by law to determine the eligibility of the persons to fill such offices lord sidmouth and himself had confined themselves strictly to the appointment of barristers alone and had not nominated any to the office of magistrate who were of less than three years standing he would ask the committee under those circumstances   whether £ 00 ayear could be sufficient to tempt a professional man of adequate abilities to relinquish his hopes of rising at the bar   the duties at the office would require his constant attendance and the committee he     thought would not consider it unreasonable to empower the secretary of state to grant them each a salary not exceeding £ 00 ayear   it was true he might be told that there were many individuals now ready to accept those offices but though that was certainly the case they were most of them country gentlemen who had discharged the duty of magistrates in their respective counties but that was no reason why they should be selected to fill the situation of police magistrates in the metropolis he respected as much as any man could the unpaid magistracy of the country but it did not follow that because they were enabled by the weight of their character and influence to perform the ordinary routine duties of county magistrates they were competent to discharge the more arduous business of the police in this city   many acts of parliament had increased the duties of those offices important questions in civil causes often came before them and under the building acts they were often obliged to hear the evidence of surveyors on each side and to determine many points which required a considerable degree of legal knowledge he would rather rest his proposition on that single statement than enter into the details contained in the papers which he held in his hands   it appeared to him that this country was more parsimonious in its provisions upon the administration of justice than any other and he was sure that there could not be a worse economy than such saving either with regard to the highest or to inferior officers   the great object should be to procure persons qualified to discharge the duties hear hear      0 to tell them that they might take the refuse of the bar would be to recommend a course which the public would soon have reason to lament upon those grounds he trusted that the committee would not consider the addition of £ 00 ayear to their present salaries too much to remunerate them for the services of the police magistrates    they were acquainted with the character of the individuals who filled those offices at present their knowledge experience and respectability were unquestionable they were thirty in number and their services had already proved the importance of the duties they had to fulfil the honourable gentleman concluded with moving a resolution—that each of the justices appointed or to be appointed to the police offices of the metropolis shall be allowed a salary not exceeding £ 00 ayear to be paid by one of his majestys principal secretaries of state paper viii indications respecting lord eldon including history of the pending judgessalaryraising measure originally published in      section i facts suspected subjects of inquiry for the house of commons respecting lord eldon certain suspicions have arisen the object of these pages is—to cause inquiry to be made if possible by the competent authority whether there be any ground—and if yes what—for these suspicions in general terms they may be thus expressed—   that finding the practice of the court of chancery replete with fraud and extortion lord eldon on or soon after his coming into office as chancellor formed and began to execute a plan for the screwing it up for his own benefit to the highest possible pitch to wit by assuming and exercising a power of taxation and for that purpose setting his own authority above that of parliament which plan he has all along steadily pursued and if not the present judges salaryraising measure    anno      a late act to wit the  d geo iv cap   is the consummation of it   that it being necessary that for this purpose the other westminster hall chiefs should be let into a participation of such sinister profit—to wit as well for the better     assurance of their support as because the power of appointing to those offices being virtually in his hands whatever is profit to them is so to him—the means employed by him tended to that effect also and have been followed by it in relation to the whole scheme conception may perhaps receive help from a glance in this place at the titles of the ensuing sections here they are— §   under lord eldon equity an instrument of fraud and extortion—samples of it §   anno   0 —order by chancellor and master of the rolls augmenting the fees of offices in the gift of one of them §   profit to subordinates was profit to principals so in course to successors §   contrary to law was this order §   by it increase and sanction were given to extortion §   so to corruption §   how lord eldon pronounced the exaction contrary to law all the while continuing it §   how the chancellor had laid the ground for the more effectual corruption of himself and the other chiefs anno   0  §  0 how the project was stopped by a solicitor till set agoing again as per §   §    how the other chiefs were corrupted accordingly §    how the illegality got wind and how felix trembled §    how the chancellor went to parliament and got the corruption established §    how the head of the law seeing swindling at work stept in and took his

chancellor exercised a dispensing power §    character evidence section ii under lord eldon equity an instrument of fraud and extortion samples— a single sample will serve to show in what state lord eldon found this branch of practice and that it stood not in much need of improvement at his hands by a few more which follow a faint yet for this purpose a sufficient idea will be given of the improvement it has actually received under his care by the command of a father i entered into the profession and in the year      or thereabouts was called to the bar not long after having drawn a bill in equity i had to defend it against exceptions before a master in chancery we shall have to attend on such a day said the solicitor to me naming a day a week or more distant warrants for our attendance will be taken out for two intervening days but it is not customary to attend before the third what i learnt afterwards was—that though no attendance more than one was ever bestowed three were on every occasion regularly charged for for each of the two falsely pretended attendances the client being by the solicitor charged with a fee for himself as also with a fee of  s  d paid by him to the master the consequence was—that for every actual attendance the master instead of  s  d received £  and that even if inclined no solicitor durst omit taking out the three warrants instead of one for fear of the nottobehazarded displeasure of that subordinate judge and his superiors true it is the solicitor is not under any obligation thus to charge his client for work not done he is however sure of indemnity in doing so it is accordingly done of course thus exquisitely cemented is the union of sinister interests so far as regards attendances of the functionaries here mentioned thus is the expense tripled so for the sake of the profit on the expense the delay likewise and i have been assured by professional men now in practice that on no occasion for no purpose is any masters attendance ever obtained without taking out three warrants at the least so much for the state of the practice before lord eldons first chancellorship now for the state of it under his lordships auspices within the course of this current year disclosures have been made in various pamphlets one of the most instructive is the one entitled a letter to samuel compton cox esq one of the masters of the court of chancery respecting the practice of that court with suggestions for its alteration by a barrister london      extracted from it are the following alleged samples samples of the improvements made in the arts and sciences of fraud and extortion by masters in chancery and others under the noble and   0 learned lords so assiduously fostering and protecting care i in regard to attendances on and by masters money exacted by them as above when no such services are performed p    the issuing of warrants is another subject which requires consideration these are issued frequently upon states of facts abstracts of titles charges and discharges c not according to the time consumed in going through the business before the master or his clerk but according to the length of the statement the clerk takes it for granted that the investigation of a state of facts of a given length may be expected to occupy a given number of hours the solicitor therefore in drawing such his bill of costs after the statement has been gone through leaves a blank for the number of warrants to proceed on the state of facts the masters clerk fills up the blank by inserting such a number as might if there had been much contention between the different parties have by possibility been issued thus where two or three are all that in fact have been taken out ten or fifteen are charged and allowed the solicitor produces those he has actually received in the course of the business and the clerk delivers to him so many more as are necessary to make up the requisite number† p    a similar process takes place with respect to the report if the charge for the warrants alone were all that was to be complained of the mischief would not be so great but you are aware sir‡ that an attendance on each of these warrants is charged for and allowed and that frequently by several different solicitors∥ so that the expense to the suitors is grievously increased ii of the sinister profit made by the solicitor the greater part has for its cause the rapacity of the master supported by the chancellor p   copies of proceedings of all sorts of states of facts of affidavits of reports of every paper in short which is brought into the office are multiplied without the least necessity and in many instances are charged for though never made for instance in an amicable suit where the only object is to obtain the opinion of the court on some doubtful point and the masters report is previously necessary to ascertain the facts of the case clearly each solicitor concerned is required in most instances to take or at least to pay for a copy of the state of facts carried in of the affidavits in support of it and of the draft of the report and in the event of his not taking these copies he is not allowed to charge for any of his attendances in the masters office p  0 the draft of the report is kept with the other papers relating to the suit in the masters office and to such a length is the system of charging for copies carried that in amicable suits it not unfrequently happens i believe that no copy whatever of the draftreport is made but the solicitor merely looks over the original draft in the masters office yet even in this case two or more copies will be charged for as made for the plaintiff and defendants pp  0    iii how by breach of duty as to attendance on the part of masters and their clerks delay and expense are manufactured by them and profit out of it over and above what is exacted by them on mendacious grounds as above p    the masters seldom i believe make their appearance in southamptonbuildings before eleven and are mostly to be seen on their way home by three oclock at the latest p    another evil is that of issuing warrants to different parties to attend at the same hour with some exceptions says another pamphlet with a high and responsible name to it p    i find a general understanding prevails that the earliest appointment for a master must be eleven and the latest at two oclock consequence—warrant sent for frequent answer—master full for a week page   —court sits from ten to four so far the authority court sitting as yet in public cannot convert itself into a sinecurist this accommodation it cannot afford to any but its feudatories who so long as they act the shorter the proportion of time in a day they sit on each cause have the greater number of attendances to be paid for the attendance styled the masters is after     all in many instances only the clerks so that it may be matter of calculation at the end of what period under the cherishing care of lord eldon all masterships may have ripened into sinecures and thus completed the course completed already by the sixclerkships per pamphlet entitled rewards c page    of which presently average emolument of one of the masters clerks in           and      £  00 ayear iv strict community of sinister interest between the judicial and professional lawyers the judicial principals the professional forced accomplices p    their bills will be less rigidly examined under these circumstances it is not the interest of a solicitor to quarrel with the masters clerk both are alike gainers by the existing system—p    in cases where the costs come out of a fund in court much less strictness is likely to prevail if the plaintiffs solicitor be allowed for attendances on more warrants than are actually taken out during the progress of the business a similar allowance must be made to the defendants solicitor but even if it were both the interest and the inclination of the solicitor to amend this practice it is not in his power so to do he might indeed amend it so far as his own charges go but no farther over those of the masters clerks he has no controul and he is moreover at the mercy of the clerk if he quarrels with the clerk he must expect to be thwarted and delayed in every suit which comes into that office and to have his bills rigorously taxed the masters clerk with the assistance of a clerk in court taxes the solicitors bill but there is nobody to tax the masters bill v corruption and extortion by bribes given to and received by masters clerks in addition to the sinister profit carried as above to the account of the master p    the gratuities at present allowed to the masters clerks ought to be done away with altogether     solicitors who are in the habit of giving large gratuities to the clerks will at any rate be looked upon favourably their business will be readily attended to and oftentimes to the delay of others who in strictness are entitled to priority vi anno      lord eldons eyes forced to open themselves to fraud and extortion in one portentously scandalous instance kept shut in all other instances before and since p    with regard to copies of particulars of sale where an estate is sold in the masters office a material alteration has of late years been made to such a height had these charges amounted that in one instance casamajor v strode £ 00 were claimed for compensationmoney in lieu of written copies of particulars of sale in consequence of that charge the general order of   th march      was made by which the master is allowed sixpence a side for so many printed copies of the particulars as there are actual bidders and no more there seems no good reason for making even this allowance it would be fair enough if the masters are to continue to be paid by fees to allow the expense of copying the particular for the printer and even a fee if thought necessary for settling it but beyond that as there is no actual trouble there should be no charge on the suitor p    of the particulars above given a general confirmation may be deduced from the contents of the i now see named but not promiscuously published pamphlet above alluded to—mr vizards what is above is a small sample of that which is said to have place of what follows in sections     and   the design is—to show how that which has place came and comes to have place section iii anno   0 —order by chancellor and master of the rolls augmenting the fees of offices in the gift of one of them it consists of a printed pamphlet of    pages bearing in the titlepage the words following— list of costs in chancery regarding solicitors and also clerks in court as increased by orders of court dated   th february last issued under the joint signatures of the right honourable the lord chancellor and master of the rolls being exact copies of those orders the same having been collated with the original lists of the court london printed for heraud and co law stationers carey street corner of bell yard by j  w smith king street seven dials   0  in the preamble to that part which regards the clerks in court fees the order speaks of itself as establishing a schedule of—increased fees thereupon follows the schedule and the number of the fees is fortythree anno      in pursuance of certain orders of the house of commons returns were made amongst other chancery offices from that of     the sixclerks and another from that of the sworn and waiting clerks these are comprised in pages         of a paper entitled fees in courts of justice dates of order for printing   th may and   th july      nos     and   0 in the return relative to the sworn clerks are reprinted the contents of the pamphlet above mentioned section iv profit to subordinates was profit to superiors so in course to successors here begins the proof of the fact—that a twopenny loaf costs twopence in honourable and right honourable house the proof will be insufficient in any other unless it were a right honourable one it would be superfluous for information yes but for reminiscence it may have its use i wherever an office has any money value so has the patronage of it by the patronage understand the power of determining the individuals by whom together or one after another it shall be possessed—the whole power or any share in it take any office singly compared with the value of the possession that of the patronage may be less or greater it is most commonly less but it may be many times greater patron say a father near the grave son in early youth value of the office if occupied by the father not one years purchase if by the son a dozen years or more present income of a sixclerkship about £ 000 ayear so stated to me by gentlemen belonging to the office it is regarded as a sinecure—patron the master of the rolls one of these judges was sir thomas sewell children numerous no further provision for this one without injustice to others suppose it sold what would it have been worth to him not a fifth of what it was by being given £ 000 the price usually got by patron so at least said by gentlemen belonging to the office this for the information of mr robinson—the mr robinson who as far as i understand hitherto to secure purity interdicts sale leaving gift as he found it say patron and grandpatron as you say son and grandson grand patronage is not so valuable as patronage true nor yet valueless in the kings bench is an office called the clerkship of the rules annual value as per finance reports       £     nominal joint patrons in those days earl of stormont and mr way grandpatron earl of mansfield lord chiefjustice trustee for the lord chiefjustice said earl of stormont and mr way price paid £ 000—circumstances led me to the knowledge of it but for grandpatrons cowardice that cowardice which is matter of history more might have been got for it that or thereabouts was got for it a second time would you know the money value of an office exclusive of the emolument in possession to the aggregate value of the patronage belonging to it add that of the grandpatronage nor is that of greatgrandpatronage nothing wherever you can see a grandpatron other than the king seeing the king you see a greatgrandpatron a mastership was a fortune to a daughter of lord erskine had he held the seals long enough a sixclerkship might have been a provision for a son supposing the matter settled with sir william grant who had no issue if either patronage grandpatronage or greatgrandpatronage of the office are valueless so is the possession of it in case of abuse profit to individuals is one thing mischief to the public another profit from feegathering offices may be made either by sale or by gift when by sale small is the mischief in comparison of what it is when by gift but this belongs to another head neither by the chancellor nor by the master of the rolls it may be said are nominated any of the officers to whose fees the order gives increase true nor by this is the additional value given by it to the patronage lessened along with the values of the swornclerkship and the waitingclerkship rises that of the sixclerkship tenpence per folio is paid to sworn and waiting clerks tenpence per ninety words called a folio for copies taken by them out of each such tenpence the six clerks for doing nothing receive fourpence this is all they receive an all which to some eyes may not appear much too little the measure was one of experiment direct object that project of plunderage which will be seen continued and extended by the hands of lord eldon in   0  and sanctioned by parliament in      collateral or subsidiary object on his part giving additional strength to the dominion of judgemade over parliamentmade law full butt did this order run against a special statute made for remedy against this very abuse not to speak of the general principle laid down and thus vainly endeavoured to be established by the petition of rights but as to this see next section of the price the public was made to pay for this sinister profit not more than half has as yet been brought to view the other half went to stop mouths waste all of it as well as productive of correspondent delay is what is exacted for all three sorts of clerks thus felt and even yet say the solicitors the plunderable fund is composed of the aggregate property of all those who can afford to buy a chance for the article sold under the name of equity the greater the quantity     taken by the one set the less is left for the other—see an experience of this shown in §    preceded accordingly by the bonuses given to these more immediate cointeressees of the chancellor and his feudatory was a like bonus given to the fraternity of solicitors section v contrary to law was the order not to speak of clauses of common that is to say imaginary law called principles borrowed or made by each disputant for the purpose of the dispute—full butt does the order run against indisputable acts of parliament—acts of general application applying to taxation in any mode without consent of parliament—acts of particular application applying to taxation in this particular mode—   first comes the generallyapplying act    ed i c   anno     —we have granted for us and our heirs as well to archbishops     as to earls     and to all the commonalty of the land that for no business from henceforth we shall take such manner of aids tasks nor aprises but by the common assent of the realm   next comes    ed i stat   c   anno   0 —no tallage or aid shall be taken or levied by us or our heirs in our realm without the goodwill and assent of archbishops bishops lords barons knights burgesses and other freemen of the land   now comes the speciallyapplying act  0 ed iii c   anno     —first we have commanded says the statute all our justices to be sworn that they shall from henceforth do equal law and execution of right to all our subjects rich and poor and we have ordained and caused our said justices to be sworn that they shall not from henceforth as long as they shall be in the office of justice take fee nor robe of any man but of ourself and that they shall take no gift nor reward by themselves nor by others privily or apertly of any man that hath to do before them by any way except meat and drink and that of small value   lastly comes the allcomprehensivelyapplying clause in the act commonly called the petition of rights   ch i c   §  0—that no man hereafter be compelled to make or yield any gift loan benevolence tax or such like charge without common consent by act of parliament turn back now to the judgemade law and the enactors of it could they have had any doubt as to the illegality of what they were doing not unless these sages of the law had forgot the a b c of it but a pretence is made—and what is it whereas the same speaking of the fees of the offices in question have been at different times regulated by the orders of this court as occasion required the different times—what are they they are the one time at which by a like joint order anno         geo ii lord chancellor hardwicke his master of the rolls fortescue did order and direct that the swornclerks and waitingclerks do not demand or take any greater fees or reward for the business done or to be done by them in the sixclerks office than the fees and rewards following whereupon comes a list of them† in any of the many reigns in which parliament never sat but to give money and in which could kings have kept within bounds there would have been an end of parliaments—as the value of money sunk augmentation of subordinates fees by superiors might have had something of an excuse but lord hardwicke—while he was scheming this order he     was receiving in the house of lords moneybills in profusion brought up by the house of commons this tax of his—would the commons have given or would they have refused their sanction to it under either supposition this tax of his imposition was without excuse well and suppose that chancellor and his master of the rolls had done what lord chancellor erskine and his mentor did—order and direct that the said schedule of fees be adopted p    but they did no such thing they were too wary the time was not ripe for it george the second had a pretender to keep him in check george the third had none true it is that by their adroitlyworded prohibition all the effect of allowance was produced but had anything been said about the order there were the terms of it—all that these models of incorruption had in view by it was repression allowance was what it was converted into by underlings acting out of sight of superiors thus on a ground of rapacity was laid an appropriate varnish—a coating of severe and selfdenying justice the caricatureshops used to exhibit divers progresses progress of a scotchman progress of a parson and some others in these pages may be seen that of a feegathering judge seen already has been the first stage of it if lord erskine or rather the unfledged equitymans mentor had any doubts of the illegality of what they were doing no such doubts had lord eldon for now comes another motion in the gymnastics of lawyercraft—the last stage or thereabouts which for the moment we must anticipate the last stage in the progress is that which is exhibited in and by that which will be seen to be his act—the act of     —  geo iv c    as per §    of these pages the assumption per force recognised to be illegal because as will also be seen the court of kings bench had just been forced to declare as much whereupon came the necessity of going after all to parliament illegality recognised but a different word the word effectuallyemployed that from all who were not in the secret the evil consciousness might be kept hid whereas says the preamble it is expedient that some provision should be made for the permanent regulations and establishment of the fees of the officers clerks and ministers of justice of the several courts of chancery kings bench common pleas exchequer and exchequer chamber at westminster and of the clerks and other officers of the judges of the same courts but the same cannot be effectually done but by the authority of parliament     thereupon comes the first enactment enabling judges to deny and sell justice for their own profit and giving legality and permanence and by the blessing of god mr justice bailey and mr justice park eternity to the things of which we have been seeing samples as to the effectuality of the thing what had been done in this way without parliament and against parliament had been but too effectually done and but for the so lately disclosed illegality might and would have continued to be done as long as matchless constitution held together at the same time what is insinuated is—that although what had thus been done without parliament had hitherto and all along been done legally yet for want of some machinery which could not be supplied but by parliament it could not in future be so effectually done as it would be with the help of such machinery which accordingly the act was made to supply not an atom of any such subsidiary matter is there in the act all that this act of lord eldons does is to authorize and require himself and the other judges in question—the westminsterhall chiefs—to do as it had found them doing taxing the injured—taxing them on pain of outlawry—taxing the people and putting the money into their own pockets in §    the reader will see whether what is here said of the absence of all machinery is not strictly true nothing whatever besides what is here mentioned does the act so much as aim at section vi by it increase and sanction were given to extortion the illegality of the order supposed taking money by colour of it is extortion—either that is or nothing is ask mr serjeant hawkins else as good common law as mr anybody else or even my lord anybody else makes is that made by mr serjeant hawkins so says everybody look to dittos pleas of the crown vol ii b i ch    §   in the margin especially if you take leachs edition or any subsequent one you will see a rich embroidery of references if the ground does not suit you go to the embroidery and hard indeed is your fortune if you do not find something or other that will suit you better it is said says he that extortion in a large sense signifies any oppression under colour of right but that in a strict sense it signifies the taking of money by any officer by colour of his office either where none at all is due or not so much is due or where it is not yet due so much for the learned manufacturer for the present purpose the strict sense you will see is quite sufficient as for the large sense this is the sense you must take the word in if what you want is nonsense if you do go on with the book     and there you will find enough of it and that too without need of hunting on through the references for if with the lawmaking serjeant you want to enlarge extortion into oppression you must strike out of extortion the first syllable and with it half the sense of the word which done you will have tortion—which will give you if not the exact synonyme of oppression something very little wide of it and here by the bye you have a sample of the sort of stuff on which hang life and death under common law section vii so to corruption corruption no no such head has the learned aforesaid manufacturer and wholesale dealer in crownlaw no matter he has bribery rambling over that field he picks up corruption which he takes for the same thing had he lived in present times well would he have known the difference bribery is what no judge practises would you know what prevents him see observations on the magistrates salaryraising bill corruption—selfcorruption—is what as you may see there and here every westminsterhall chief judge has been in use to practise and is now by act of parliament anno        geo iv c    allowed to practise for bribery too hawkins has his strict sense and his large sense it is in its large sense that he fancies it the same thing with corruption neither to bribery however nor to corruption does this law of his apply itself in any other case than that in which he who commits it has something or other to do with the administration of justice but as before this is all that is wanted here bribery says he in a strict sense is taken for a great misprision of one in a judicial place taking any valuable thing whatsoever except meat and drink of small value† of any one who has to do before him any way for doing his office or by colour of his office but of the king only §   but bribery in a large sense continues he is sometimes taken for the receiving or offering of any undue reward by or to any person whatsoever whose ordinary profession or business relates to the administration of public justice in order to incline him to do a thing against the known rules of honesty and integrity for the law abhors inuendo the common law that is to say it makes the judges abhor any the least tendency to corruption in those who are any way concerned in its administration here the learned serjeant waxes stronger and stronger in sentimentality as he ascends into the heaven of hypocrisy where he remains during the whole of that and the next long section abhor corruption oh yes even as a dog does carrion be this as it may note with how hot a burning iron he stamps bribery and corruption on the foreheads of such a host of sages—of lord erskine oh fie isnt he dead—sir william grant oh fie was he not an able judge—and lord eldon the lord of lords with his cæteras the inferior chiefs section viii how lord eldon pronounced the exaction contrary to law—all the while continuing it the following is the tenor of a note obtained from an eminent barrister present who had particular means and motives for being correct as to the facts and who does not to this moment know the use intended to be made of it in the court of exchequer february      0— donnison v currie a question was made upon a petition whether certain allowances made to a solicitor on the taxation of his bill of costs were regular which they would have been if the court of exchequer adopted in its practice the additional allowances made by lord erskines order otherwise not it was objected that those additional allowances were not adopted by the exchequer inasmuch as lord erskines order was not legal and that lord eldon had intimated an opinion that he did not consider it as legal the chief baron richards admitted that he understood lord eldon had said that he did not consider lord erskines order as being legal but that it had been now so long acted upon that the court must be considered as having sanctioned it and that he richards should follow what had been said by lord eldon thus far the report as to its being for his own benefit see §   thirteen years and no more having sufficed thus to set bench above parliament anno    0 quære what is the smallest length of time that will have become sufficient before the reign of john the second is at an end objector—idle fears how inconsiderable in all this time the utmost of what the people     can have suffered from the exercise of this power answer—true the plunderage has its limit thank for it however—not learned moderation but a very different circumstance which will be explained in §    when the act by which the last hand was put to the plan comes to be considered moreover what makes fees so stickled for in preference to salary is—that as plunderable matter increases so will plunderage as to its being for his own profit that lord eldon thus continued the exaction see §   bravo lord chancellor eldon—bravo lord chief baron richards so long that is to say just thirteen years assuming what of course is true—that of the course of illegality begun under lord erskine and pursued under lord eldon the continuation commenced with his reaccession years thirteen here then is one length of time which suffices to entitle the westminster chiefs all or any one of them to set aside any act or acts of parliament they please and in particular any act of parliament the declared object of which is to prevent them from plundering without stint all people who can and will buy of them what they call justice and from denying it to all who cannot but bar     what said bar to this oh exchequer is a snug court small the quantity of bar that is ever there but were there ever so much bench cannot raise itself above parliament but it raises bar along with it between bench and bar even without partnership in money or power sympathy would of itself suffice to make community of sinister interest the same fungus which when green is made into bar is it not when dry made into bench no want of bar was there anno   0  when lord eldon as per next section laid the ground for the decision thus pronounced anno    0 as little when the next year      as per §    ground and all were laid low by the shock of an earthquake matchless constitution it will be seen may be turned topsyturvy and laygents know nothing of the matter bar looking on and laughing in its sleeve note here the felicity of lord eldon the profit reaped by him from his hegira of a few months we shall soon see how from one of the most unexpectable of all incidents the grand design of the grand master of delay experienced a delay of six years a delay which like so many of his own making might never have found an end but for the shortlived apparent triumph and unquiet reign of the pretenders to the throne when upon their expulsion the legitimates resumed their due omnipotence it seemed to all who were in the secrets of providence—and neither mr justice bailey nor mr justice park nor any other chaplain of lord eldons could entertain a doubt of it—that it was only to give safety and success to this grand design of his that the momentary ascendency of the intruders had been permitted the chancellor by whom the first visible step in the track of execution was taken being a whig—not only was a precedent set and ground thus made for the accommodation of lord eldon but a precedent which the whigs as such stood effectually estopped from controverting poor lord erskine—all that he had had time to do was to prepare the treat to prepare it for his more fortunate predecessor and successor scarce was the banquet on the table when up rose from his nap the giant refreshed and swept into his wallet this in addition to all the other sweets of office as to poor lord erskine over and above his paltry £ 000 a year nothing was left him but to sing with virgil—sic vos non nobis mellificatis apis section ix how the chancellor had laid the ground for the more effectual corruption of himself and the other chiefs for this ground we must from      go as far back as the year   0  in the explanation here given of the charges it seemed necessary to make this departure from the order of time for till some conception of the design and of a certain progress made in the execution of it had been conveyed the nature of the ground so early and so long ago laid for it could not so clearly have been understood in nonsense it will be seen was this ground laid plain sense might have been too hazardous the document in which the design may be seen revealed is another reported case and what is better one already in print exparte leicester vesey juniors equity reports vi     buried in huge grimgribber folios secrets may be talked in print and for any length of time kept the language nonsense the design may be not the less ascertainable and undeniable nonsense more egregious was seldom talked than on certain occasions by oliver cromwell whatever it was to the audience then to us the design is no secret now here it follows—that is to say lord eldons vesey junior vi     to     date of the report   0  aug   date of the volume   0  p    —lord chancellor p    —a practice having prevailed for a series of years contrary to the terms of an order of the court and sometimes contrary to an act of parliament it is more consistent to suppose some ground appeared to former judges     upon which it might be rendered consistent with the practice and therefore that it would be better to correct it in future not in that particular instance upon the question whether that order is to be altered or to be acted upon according to its terms which are at variance with the practice i am not now prepared to deliver a decisive opinion for this practice having been ever since permitted to grow up as expository of the order if my opinion was different from what it is as to the policy of the order according to its terms i must collect that there is in that practice testimony given that according to the terms it would be an inconvenient order no abstract this—no paraphrase—verba ipsissima eldon this all over none but himself can be his parallel nothing which it could be of any use to insert is here omitted those who think they could find an interpretation more useful to lord eldon by wading through the five or six folio pages of his speech let them take it in hand and see what they can make of it all they will be able to do is to make darkness still more visible section x how the design was stopt short by a solicitor till set agoing again as above the deepestlaid designs are sometimes frustrated by the most unexpected accidents from the hardihood of a man whose place was at his feet we come now to see a design so magnificent as this of the chancellors experiencing the abovementioned stoppage of six years before me

mr lowe in various forms stated to his lordship in public as well as in private that in his lordships court the corruption of office had become so great that it was impossible for a solicitor to transact his business with propriety this in general terms adding at the same time what in his view were particular instances and praying redress note that to say in his lordships court was as much as to say under his lordships eye—after such information at any rate if not before  —page  0 argument thereupon by counsel mansfield afterwards chiefjustice of the common pleas romilly afterwards solicitorgeneral on the part of both assurance of strong conviction that the charge was well founded proportionable fears and not dissembled of the detriment that might ensue to the personal interest of their client from the resentment of the noble and learned judge  —page  0    proof exhibited of the reasonableness of these fears—judge angrypetitioner bent beneath a torrent of power and personal abuse  —page    five years after to wit anno   0 —lord erskine then chancellor—similar address to his lordship a brief again given to romilly at this time solicitorgeneral but with no better fortune further encouragement this rebuff—further encouragement to wit to lord eldon when restored  —page   —in a note reference to the abovementioned case exparte leicester in vesey junior with quotation of that portion of his lordships speech which may be seen above in §   hence a conjecture that in that same case mr lowe himself in some way or other had a special interest from the reference so made to that case and his lordships speech on the occasion of it it should seem that the design of it as above was not a secret to mr lowe and that his lordship knew it was not here ends the history of the stoppage  —preface pp     upwards of eighteen months antecedently to the abovementioned   th november      say accordingly on or about   th may      page   on the occasion of two causes—limbrey

occasion of the cases of limbrey and gurr c as per no   containing as it does pages between   and   this same preface is too long for insertion here carefully have the above allegations been culled from it of the passage contained in the body of the work the matter is too interesting and instructive to be omitted it will be found below here then is one source from which had it ears for corruption honourable house might learn at any time whether from the above alleged corruption lord eldon has not during the whole of his two chancellorships been reaping profit and whether it was possible so to have been doing without knowing it by lord eldons present set of nominees evidence from mr lowe has i hear been elicited little if any fruit i hear has been obtained from it no great wonder any such barrenness anything unacceptable to their creator they could not be very desirous to receive nor perhaps mr lowe since the experience had of his lordships courtesy to give astonished all this while at the stoppage—astonished no less than disappointed—must have been the goodly fellowship—the solicitors and clerks in court importunate for six long years but not less vain than importunate had been their endeavours to obtain from lord eldon and his sir william grant—yea even from lord eldon—that boon which with the same sir william grant for mediator and advocate—at the end of six short months we have seen them obtaining from lord erskine—the said sir william grant being as per §   in quality of patron in partnership with the said clerks in court p    an attempt in   0  to reform practice whilst lord thurlow held the great seal tables of fees taken by officers in the court of chancery remained set up or affixed in their respective offices and the most trifling gratuity was received with a watchful dubious eye and cautious hand but soon after the great seal was resigned by his lordship those tables began to disappear and in      have never since been renewed—gratuities then augmented until they had no limits and so early as the year   0  when increased fees and costs had attained little of the strength and consistency at which they have since arrived the author of these observations stated to the court that the corruption of office had become so great that it was impossible for a solicitor to transact his business with prepriety† to justify such statement he by petition set forth certain payments made which he insisted ought not to have been demanded or received and prayed for redress and he wrote a letter to one of the lord chancellors secretaries in which he stated an opinion     which until the great charter and the beforementioned statutes of king edward iii and king richard ii are repealed he is disposed to maintain and which though otherwise advised by his counsel he then refused to retract the petition came on for hearing and was supported by mr mansfield and mr romilly with a spirit and in a manner peculiar to those advocates and satisfactory to the feelings of the petitioner and resisted by mr attorneygeneral sir spencer perceval and mr richards in vain did mr mansfield urge that gratuity was the mother of extortion and mr romilly state the intrepidity of his client on that occasion the author of these observations who never heard an angry judge give a just judgment bent beneath a torrent of power and personal abuse on the coming in of a new administration in the year   0  the author of these observations addressed a letter to lord erskine and prepared to further hear his petition but he was given to understand by those who had once applauded his efforts† that a a change of men did not change measures and since that time the irregular increase of fees and costs has introduced much confusion into the law section xi how the other chiefs were corrupted accordingly as to what regards the chief of the exchequer judicatory an indication has been seen in §   as to what regards kings bench and

botanist and exnurseryman named salisbury to distinguish him from a namesake of the gentlemanclass salisbury minor is the name he goes by among the fancy at the end of a series of vicissitudes he had sunk into one of those sinks of misfortune in which to help to pamper overfed judges debtors are squeezed by jailors out of the substance that should go to creditors as from smithfield an overdriven ox into a chinashop—breaking loose one day from his tormentors salisbury minor found means somehow or other to break into one of the great westminsterhall shops in which as often as a demand comes for the article so miscalled justice bad goods are so dearly sold to all who can come up to the price and denied of course to those who cannot the chinashop scene ensued surprised and confounded the shopmen exhibited that sort of derangement which the french express by loss of head—ils ont perdu la tête under the notion of defence confessions came out which come now to be recorded anno      nov   —the date is material barnewall and aldersons kings bench reports vol v p     in the matter of salisbury in person salisbury in person had obtained a rule nisi for one of the tipstaffs of the court to answer the matters of his affidavit the affidavit stated that the tipstaff had taken a fee of halfa guinea for conveying him from the judges chambers to which he had been brought by habeas corpus to the kings bench prison such fee being more than he had a right to demand according to the table of fees affixed in the kings bench in pursuance of a rule of this court gurney and platt showed cause upon affidavits stating that the fee had been taken for a very long period of time by all tipstaffs in both courts and that it was allowed by the master in costs the court however adverting to the statutes   geo ii c    §   and    geo ii c    §   and the rule of court of michaelmas term   geo ii and the table of fees settled in the following year said that it was clear that the tipstaff had no right to take any other fee for taking a prisoner from the   0 judges chambers to the kings bench prison than six shillings which was the fee allowed him in that table they therefore ordered the fee so taken to be returned to the complainant figure to himself who can the explosion bancum regis shaken as by an earthquake—bancum regis in an uproar—the edifice it had cost lord eldon twenty years to rear laid in ruins we are above parliament had said as above lord eldon alas no at the first meeting cried lord abbott i could not for the life of me keep where you set us i had not nerve for it that fellow     such impudence who could have thought it as to the fees it is from parliament you see we must have them now if at all it may take you some little trouble but you see how necessary it is and you will not grudge it this is not in the report but it is in the nature of the case and that is worth a thousand law reports drawn up by toads under harrows think now of the scene exhibited in and by kings bench—culprit and judge under one hood—guilty or not guilty not guilty o yes if the master whose everyday business it is to tax costs knows not what they are if the chiefjustice whose everyday business it is to hear discussions about costs knows not what they are or what they ought to be see now how the accounts stands—the money account of the  0s  d legalized say  s remains confessed to

pounds and thousands of pounds are made of pence and shillings mark now another sort of account case a criminal one codefendants had the list been complete tipstaff master and chiefjustice had it been as agreeable to punishers to punish themselves as others what a rich variety of choice was here motion for imprisonment by attachment as above for this is what is meant by answering affidavits indictment for extortion indictment for corruption indictment for conspiracy information for all or any of the above crimes mark now the denouement the case as above a criminal one the crime not punished but without the consent of the sufferer compounded for of the fruit of the crime the exact nominal amount ordered to be restored—not a farthing even given to the hapless masterman by whose sad days labour thus employed so much more than the value had been consumed in thus sueing for it with cost of affidavits several times as much after seeing in this precedent the utmost he could hope for—what man by whom like extortion had been suffered from like hands would ever tax himself to seek redress for it redress—administered in semblance denied in substance with not an exception unless by accident such or to an indefinite degree worse is matchless constitutions justice but the punishment—where was the punishment this is answered already had the order for redress comprised a sixpence beyond the  s  d the inferior malefactor might have turned upon his principal and the fable of the young thief who at the gallows bit his mothers ear off have been realized—isnt it you that have led me to this these fourandsixpences that i have been pocketing—is there any of them you did not know of had it not been for this mishap would not my place have been made worth so much the more to you by every one of them is there any one of them that did not add to the value of the place you will have to dispose of when i am out of it why do you come upon me then cant you afford it better than i can pay it yourself but—the two learned counsel who thus fought for the  s  d—by whom were they employed—by tipstaff master or chiefjustice not by tipstaff surely seeing that his cause was so much the chiefjustices he would not thus have flung away his money he would not have given six eight or ten guineas to save a  s  d these if any are among the secrets worth knowing and which house of commons will insist on knowing insist—but when when house of commons has ceased to be house of commons well then this fourandsixpenny tripartite business—is it not extortion is it not corruption if not still for arguments sake suppose on the part of all three learned persons—all or any of them—suppose a real desire to commit either of these crimes can imagination present a more effectual mode of doing it till this be found spare yourself whoever you are spare yourself all such trouble as that of crying out shame shame contempt of court calumny blasphemy contempt of court forsooth if contempt is ever brought upon such courts and for the good of mankind too much of it cannot be brought upon them it is not in the telling of such things but in the doing of them that the culpable cause will be to be found here then we see were statutes—here according to lord eldons instructions laid down as per §   at the outset—here were rules of court disposed of in the same way and at one stroke anno   0  in the first year of his reign—disposed of at one stroke and in the same way a liberty which might so easily be taken with acts of parliament—hard indeed it would have been if a judge     might not take it with the rules of his own court conformable we see here exactly was this operation to the instructions laid down by him as per §   just twenty years before anno   0  in the first year of his reign as to the rules of court it was not in the nature of the case that they should present any additional difficulty rules which if it were worth the trouble and would not make too much sensation he might have repealed in form at any time be this as it may here was the exact case so long ago provided for by eldonic providence the case which being the principle laid down with virtual directions given for the guidance of his next in command had been made broad enough to fit you need not be told say these directions how much more obedienceworthy common is than statute law—law of our own making than any of the law we are forced to receive from laygents but though you should find one of our own laws in your way—nay though with one of theirs you should find in your way one of ours to give validity and strength to it—never you mind that your business is to make sure of the fees at the same time for decencys sake while our underlings who get more of them than we do are screwing them up and you may trust them for that you of course will know nothing of the matter should any unpleasant accident happen—such as the having the table with the lawful fee in company with the proof of the additional money habitually exacted bolted out upon you in the face of the public you will of course be all amazement though the thing can never have taken place but under your own eye—while the prisoner was beginning to be conducted from your own chambers where you had just been examining him—never had you so much as suspected the existence of any such difference as to lord abbott whatever want of disposition on his part there may have been to pay regard to acts of parliament no such want could there have been as to any such instructions as these of lord eldons but whether it was that he had not got them by heart or that when the time came to repeat them and apply them to practice his heart failed him—so it was—they were not followed and so out came the confession that has been seen the confession in all its nakedness this is not all not more than three years before this very fee had been taken into consideration by speciallyappointed authority and the  s  d disallowed under the head of tipstaff the table of    0 say certain commissioners of whom presently directs the fee of  s to be paid to the tipstaff that carries any prisoner committed at a judges chambers to the kings bench prison     the fee of  0s  d we conceive to have been taken in respect of these commitments     for twentyfive years and probably longer but we recommend that the fee of  s only be received in future mark now the regard manifested by these commissioners—by these commissioners of lord eldons—for the authority of parliament recommendation soft as lambskin of the extortion and contempt of parliament impudent as it was not any the slightest intimation unless the rotten apology thus foisted in instead of censure be regarded as such of this recommendation the fruit has been already seen the fee taken and for aught that appears uninterruptedly taken notwithstanding what in all the three intervening years the chiefjustice had he never heard of any such recommendation—never heard a report of which his own court with the fees belonging to it were the subject—never seen any thing of it and the commissioners for what cause disallow the  s  d only because the act of parliament and the contempt so impudently put upon it and the extortion and corruption for the purpose of which the contempt was put had been staring them in the face men who from such hands accept and in this way execute such commissions—is not some punishment their due yes surely therefore here it is public—behold their names—  john campbell esq master in chancery—  william alexander esq then master now by the grace of lord eldon lord chief baron of the exchequer—  william adams doctor of civil law—  william osgood esq—  william walton esq accompanied are these recommendations by certain nonrecommendations from those as to tipstaffs reference is made to ditto as to marshal and there it is that after stating p     that his profit arises chiefly out of two sources of which be it not forgotten the tap is one—with this source before them it is that after ringing the praises of it another of their recommendations is—that this matter be left in the hands of the court to which the prison more immediately belongs in plain english of the chiefjustice whose interest it is maximize the profit in all manner of ways and of whose emoluments they saw a vast portion rising in proportion to the productiveness of this source throughout the whole of the report except for a purpose such as this not the least symptom of thinking exhibited fees taken so much we recommend so much such

imputations having come on votes come to be given on them repress then if possible your tears and wrapping yourself up in your agony hurry out of the house section xiii how the chancellor went to parliament and got the corruption established the explosion has been seen blown by it into open air was the scheme of taxing without parliament and in the teeth of parliament at the same time a handle for denunciation was left prominent and it has been seen how broad an one a handle too which some williams or other might at any time lay hold of and give trouble the trouble which the driver of pigs has with his pigs—the trouble of collecting honourable gentlemen together and whistling them in when the question is called for delay therefore was not now in season november         was the day on which the breach as above was made a session did not pass without providing for the repair of it the  0th of june      is the day on which the first stone was laid and how thorough and complete the repair is remains now to be shown the hand of parliament being the only applicable instrument stooping at last to employ it could not but be more or less mortifying to a workman to whom for so many years it had been a football but to lord eldon the part of the reed is not less familiar than that of the oak and what was lost in universally applicable power will be seen gained in ease and tranquillity reference had to this special and most valuable use of it act   d july        geo iv c   —title an act to enable the judges of the several courts of record at westminster to make regulations respecting the fees of the officers clerks and ministers of the said courts the preamble has been seen business of it skinning over the past illegality section   business of the first empowering these same judges to screw up to a maximum and without stint the accustomed fees of the second to add any number of new ones of the third making it to this effect the special duty of all underlings to do whatever their masters please of the fourth anxiously easing them of the trouble of regulating solicitors fees forasmuch as nothing was to be got by it of the fifth providing as has been and will be seen for the concealment of the fees as before should more be to be got at any time by their being concealed than by their being known of the sixth which is the last providing compensation for any the smallest fee which by accident should happen to slip out should any such misfortune ever happen the losers are not only authorised but required to tell his majesty of it for every possible additional duty an additional fee or batch of fees good in §    or elsewhere it will be seen how it is that by multiplying such duties under the rose equity pace and equity cost have been rendered what they are everything at discretion §   everything as they shall see fit §   the people of england all who have redress to seek for injury from without doors—all who have to defend themselves against any of those injuries of which these same judges are the instruments—all who have to defend themselves against injuries the seat of which is in the pretended seat of redress—all who have to defend themselves against the attacks of any of those villains with whom lord eldon has thus placed these judges together with himself in partnership—all all are thus delivered up bound to be plundered in secret without stint or controul by the hands of these same judges never could more solicitude have been demonstrated never more appropriate talent as well as care expended in satisfying it so exquisite the work the most exquisitely magnifying microscope might be challenged to bring to view a flaw in it in     the style of english legislation it may be given as a model as a study—for a young draughtsman who for sections a yard long looks to be paid at so much a word the same hand which had no better interest than the publics been to be provided for would have left loopholes through which the entire substance of the measure might be extracted has in this its darling work as if by an hermetic seal closed all such crannies could this pamphlet have been made to hold it i should have copied it and pointed out the beauties of it for comprehensiveness it has but one rival and that is in the law called civil law quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem for principi put judici you have the act of english law—the act of george the fourth the enacting part could not be too clear of equivocation and not a particle is to be found in it the preamble presented an irresistible demand for equivocation and here it is seen already in §   has been this same preamble with its essential word effectually note here the use of it it is this the more effectually to turn mens minds aside from the idea of the illegality—causing them to suppose that though nothing had been done but what was legal strictly legal yet to give to what had been done its full effect legal machinery in some shape or other was needed in addition to such as learned workmen stood already provided with and that to give existence to such additional machinery was accordingly the object of the act now the fact is that no such additional machinery does the act provide or attempt to provide not an atom of it what it does is—easing the hands of the criminals of whatsoever check they felt applied by the consciousness of their so lately divulged criminality—thus giving to them the undisturbed power of taxing the people for their own profit without stint and for this purpose rendering that power which had so long been arbitrary in fact at length arbitrary by law remains the clause about keeping the table of fees exposed to view they are to be kept hung up—these table of fees—hung up in a conspicuous part of the room good and while there hung up what will be the effect of them the same as of those hung up in virtue of those former statutes of george ii with the kings bench rule that followed them the place they are hung up in is to be a conspicuous one good but the characters of these nothing is said so that here is a loophole ready made and provided in the abovementioned case which produced the demand for this act a document referred to as a ground of the decision is—a rule of court of michaelmas term   geo ii† and the table of fees settled in the following year in article  th of the document intituled rules and orders c mentioned in that same rule of court which without any title is in latin in speaking of the table of fees it is said that it shall be fairly written in a plain and legible hand with this clause lying before him—and he could not but have had it lying before him—with this clause lying before him it is that the penner of this same act of lord eldons contents himself with speaking about the place and says nothing about the hand what the omission had for its cause—whether design or accident—judge whosoever is free to judge from the whole complexion of the business not that even in this same rule of court with its fair and legible hand there was anything better than the semblance of honesty tables of benefactors to churches and parishes—tables of turnpike tolls—were they even in those days written in a fair and legible hand no they were painted in print hand as they are still in black and gold but if instead of fair and legible the characters should come to be microscopic and as illegible a scrawl as can be found—suppose in the grimgribber hand called court hand—a precedent of this sort will not be among the authorities to be set at nought this will not be among the cases in which according to lord eldons consistency as per page     it would be more consistent to suppose some ground appeared to former judges upon which it the act of parliament or the rule of court or both might be rendered consistent with the practice—meaning with the practice carried on in violation of them lord eldons act or the eldon act should be the style and title of this act precedent lord ellenboroughs act—so styled in a late vote paper of honourable house‡ lord ellenboroughs act sole but sufficient and characteristic monument of the legislative care wisdom and humanity of that peer of parliament as well as lord chief justice∥     as to the chancellors being the primum mobile of the act—only for forms sake and to anticipate cavil can proof in words be necessary the bill being a money bill it could not make its first appearance in the house in which lord eldon rules these matters by his own hand the members by whom it was brought into the only competent house were the two lawofficers and that by these two official persons any such bill could consistently either with usage or propriety have been brought in otherwise than under the direction of the head of the law will not be affirmed by any one the act then was lord eldons act section xiv how the head of the law seeing swindling at work continued it and took his profit out of it swindling is an intelligible word it is used here for shortness and because familiar to everybody look closely and see whether on this occasion it is in any the slightest degree misapplied by statute  0 geo ii c    §  —all persons who knowingly or designedly by false pretence or pretences shall obtain from any person or persons money     with intent to cheat or defraud any person or persons of the same     shall be fined or imprisoned or     be put in the pillory or publicly whipped or transported     for     seven years   all persons says the act if then a master in chancery so comporting himself as above is not a person he is not a swindler if he is a person he is   and so in the case of a commissioner of bankrupts if any one there be who has so comported himself   so likewise in the case of any other functionary holding an office under lord eldon   so likewise in the case of every barrister practising in any of the courts in or over which lord eldon is judge in the case of every such barrister if so comporting himself   add every solicitor if however it is true as indicated in the samples given in §   that in the case of the solicitor in respect of what he does in this way he is by the subordinate judge the aforesaid master not only to a great extent allowed but at the same time to a certain extent compelled—here in his case is no inconsiderable alleviation in the guilt of the official that of the nonofficial malefactors is eclipsed and in a manner swallowed up and drowned so far as regards masters in chancery to judge whether among those same subordinate judges under lord eldon there be any such person as a swindler and if so what number of such persons see the sample given in §   same question as to commissioners of bankrupts concerning whom except as follows it has not as yet been my fortune to meet with any indications lists of these commissioners    in each list   all creatures all removable creatures—accordingly all so many virtual pensioners during pleasure—of lord eldon further subject of inquiry whether these groups likewise be or be not so many gangs of his learned swindlers indication from the morning chronicle friday april         at a common council thursday april    information given by mr favel appointment made by list  d of these commissioners for proof of debts in a certain case hour appointed that from    to   commissioners named in the instrument of appointment messrs glynn whitmore and mr m p horace twiss attendance by mr glynn none by mr whitmore as little consequence nothing done by mr horace twiss an hour and a half after the commencement of the appointed time half an hour after the termination of it a call made at the place had he even been in attendance from the commencement of the time instead of stepping in half an hour after the termination of it still commissioners more than one not being present no business could it seems have been done to what purpose then came he when he did unless it was to make a title to the attendancefee moreover for this nonattendance of theirs messrs glynn and whitmore have they received their attendancefees if so let them prove if they can that they are not swindlers mr horace twiss who does not attend any part of the time but steps in half an hour after when his coming cannot answer the purpose has he received for that day any attendancefee if so then comes the same task for him to perform mr favels candour supposes some excuse may be made for mr twiss if so a very lame one it will be an option he should have had to make is to do his duty as a commissioner of bankrupts and not be a member     of parliament or do his duty as a member of parliament oh ridiculous and not be a commissioner of bankrupts—a commissioner of bankrupts and as such one of lord eldons pensioners convinced by his commissionership of the immaculateness of his patron commissioner makes a speech for patron much no doubt to the satisfaction of both should a committee be appointed to inquire into chancery practice—there mr peel there—in mr twiss you have a chairman for it meantime suppose for arguments sake mr twiss comporting himself in any such manner as to give just cause of complaint against him—be the case ever so serious—to what person who had any command over his temper would it appear worth while to make any such complaint to judge whether it would let him put the question to mr lowe as per §  0 these men—or some and which of them—being so many swindlers—he who knowing them to be so protects them in such their practices and shares with them—with all of them—in their profits what is he is not he too either a swindler or if distinguishable something still worse if with strict grammatical or legal propriety he cannot be denominated a receiver of stolen goods—still the relation borne by him to these swindlers is it not exactly that which the receiver of stolen goods bears to the thief masters in chancery  0 commissioners of bankrupts  0 together  00 and upon the booty made by every one of them if any who is a swindler does this receiver of a portion of their respective gains make his profit these same swindlers every one of them made by him what they are—stop between the two sorts of receivers—the thiefbreeding and the swindlerbreeding receivers—one difference it is true there is the thiefbreeder though in so far as in his power he gives concealment to his confederates he does not because he cannot give them impunity—whereas the swindlerbreeding receiver seeing that he can gives both masters in chancery—creatures of this same creator almost all if not all of them—is there so much as one of them who is not a swindler—an habitual swindler say no if you can lord eldon say no if you can mr secretary peel deny if you can that your mentor is in partnership with all these swindlers deny it if you can that out of those who have accepted from him the appointment of reporting him blameless two are of the number of these same swindlers oh but by one of his hundred mouthpieces cries lord eldon nothing has he ever known of all this nothing except in those instances in which his just displeasure at it has well been manifested whatever here be that is amiss never has been wanting the desire to rectify it—the anxious desire     but the task think what a task think too of the leisure the quantity of leisure necessary necessary and to a man who knows not what it is to have leisure then the wisdom the consummate wisdom the recondite the boundless learning alas what more easy than for the malevolent and the foolish to besputter with their slaver the virtuous and the wise not know of it indeed oh hypocrisy hypocrisy the keeper of a house of illfame     to support an indictment against him is it necessary that everything done in his house should have been done in his actual presence ask any barrister or rather ask any solicitor whom retirement has saved from the chancellors prospectdestroying power—ask him whether it be in the nature of the case that of all the modes in which depredation has been practising in any of his courts there should have been so much as one that can ever have been a secret to him no time for it indeed of the particular time and words employed by him in talking backwards and forwards in addition to the already so claboratelyorganized general mass as if to make delay and pretences for it a thousandth—a ten thousandth part—would have served an honest man anywhere for a reform a reform which how far soever from complete would suffice for striking off twothirds of the existing mass and who can say how much more have you any doubt of this mr peel—accept then a few samples—   reform the first

it give the attendance which so many thousand other official persons would rejoice to give for a twentieth part of it   a third reform in the year there are    months serve in every one of them months excepted for vacation those in which no wrong that requires redress is practised anywhere   a fourth reform you are one person and clerk of yours another the business of any clerk of yours is to serve with you not for you serving by another is not serving but swindling small as is the number of words in the above proposed orders anybody may see how many more of them there are than are strictly needful to the purpose of directing what it is desired shall be done     numerous are the reforms that might be added all of them thus simple many of them still more concisely expressible oh but the learning necessary the recondite lore fruit of mother blackstones twice twenty years lucubrations learning indeed of all the reforms that have been seen is there a single one that would require more learning than is possessed by his lordships housekeeper if he has one or any one of his housemaids wisdom necessary for anything of all this oh hypocrites nothing but the most common of all common honesty of those whom because unsuccessful poor and powerless men are in the habit of calling swindlers the seat—that of many of them at least—is in the hulks of those hereby supposed swindlers whom because rich and powerful no man till now has ever called swindlers—the seat—the seat of ten of them at least—is in the house of lords as between the one class and the other would you know in which when the principle of legitimacy has given way to the greatesthappiness principle public indignation will press with severest weight set them against one another in the balance   quantity of mischief produced—is that among the articles to be put into the scale nothing in comparison the mischief of the second order nothing the alarm produced by the offence of him whose seat is in the hulks against all such offences each man bears what in his own estimation is little less than an adequate security—his own prudence a circumstance by which the swindler is distinguished to his advantage from the thief no man can for a moment so much as fancy himself secure against the hand of the swindler if any such there be whose seat is in the house of lords united in that irresistible hand are the powers of fraud and force force is the power applied to the victim fraud the power applied to the mind of the public applied as with but too much success it has been hitherto to the purpose of engaging it to look on unmoved while depredation in one of its most shameless shapes is exercised under the name of justice   unpremeditatedness—is it not in possession of being regarded as operating in extenuation of moral guilt deliberateness as an aggravation deliberateness does it not in case of homicide make to the offender the difference between death and life under the laws of blood so dear to honourable gentlemen noble lords and learned judges of those swindlers whose seat is in the hulks how many may there not be whose delinquency may have been the result of a hasty thought begotten by the craving of the moment answer and then say—of the swindler if any such there be whose seat is in the house of lords the offence is it not the deliberate the regularly repeated the daily repeated the authentically recorded practice   quantity of profit made—is that among the circumstances that influence the magnitude of the crime for every penny made by the swindler whose seat is in the hulks the

crime much longer have there been swindlers out of the masters office than there can have been in it the earliest on record are those who spoiled the egyptians but with them it was all pure fraud no force was added to it learning—appropriate learning—of demand for this endowment assuredly there is no want and not only for this which every lawyer speaks of but for original and originating genius—an endowment which no lawyer ever speaks of adding to the mass in the augean stable every ox had wisdom enough for—every ox that ever was put into it to employ a river in the cleansing of it required not the muscle but the genius of a hercules wisdom yes indeed but of what sort not that which is identical with but that which is opposite to lord eldons years spent in the pursuit of those which we have seen to be the actual ends of judicature fourandtwenty true but by every year thus spent a man will have been rendered not the more but so much the less apt for pursuing the ends of justice lord eldon serve the ends of justice he knows not even what they are ask him what they are—at the end of half an hour employed in talking backwards and forwards he will conclude with his speech in exparte leicester and the passage that has been seen in it ask what are     the ends of justice thirty paces are more than i need go to see boys in number any one of whom when the question had found him mute or worse than mute could answer and take his place yes in that man in whom the will has been vitiated as his has been the understanding—sure as death—has been vitiated along with it should a pericramum such as his ever meet the hand or eye of a gall or a spurzheim they will find the organ of justice obliterated and the organ of chicane—a process from their organ of theft grown up in the place of it if i misrecollect not this section has been referred to for something to be said as to the profit capable of being derived from the source here spoken of if so the readers indulgence must be trusted to for a respite till the entire of the judgessalaryraising measure has been found ripe for a view to be taken of it section xv how king georges judges improved upon the precedent set by king charless in the case of shipmoney see above §   the improvement was an altogether simple one the pocket which received the produce of the tax imposed by king charless judges was the kings the pocket which received and receives the produce of the tax imposed by king georges judges was and is their own now for consistency—now for the use of this same principle as a precedent a precedent set and with this improvement in the seats and sources of what is called justice and thence offered to the adoption of the other departments but what applies to this purpose will be better understood when the consummation given to the system by the pending measure comes to be brought to view what they did they contented themselves with doing as it were by the side of parliament giving indeed their sanction to the operations of an authority acting without parliament—but not of their own authority taking upon themselves to obstruct and frustrate the operations of parliament never did they levy war against the authority of parliament never did they make known by express terms that whatever parliament had ordained should as they pleased go for anything or for nothing never did they adjourn obedience sine die never did they say—a practice having prevailed    contrary to an act of parliament    it would be better to correct it in future not in that particular instance† section xvi how to be consistent and complete the application of the selfserving principle now as to consistency—you lord eldon you who practise consistency—you mr peel you who admire it—go on as you have begun assisted by your official instruments you have planted in the statutebook after having established it in practice the selfserving the selfcorrupting the selfgorging principle you have rooted it in one department plant offsets from it in the others you have covered     with it the field of justice go on with it and cover with it the field of force repair in the first place the ravage so lately made by the fabled dryrot that dryrot which not content with timber rotted the china and the glasses give to the duke of york the power of settling the pay of his subordinates and levying by his own order the amount of it    what do you hesitate not to speak of loyalty all pretence then to consistency is at an end with you dignity is in your creed the one thing needful your judges are brimful of it at least if it be in the power of gold to make them so so far everything is as it should be but the commanderinchief—not to speak of the heir to the crown—has he not in his situation demand enough for plenitude of dignity and forasmuch as in your mathematics mr robinson—applied to administration of justice aptitude is as dignity—say if you can how the same proposition should fail when applied to the still more dignified function of wielding military force apply it next to the navy for the benefit of lord melville and his croker give legality to shipmoney as for the benefit of lord eldon and his abbott you have given it to extortion and denial of justice legalizing that mode of supply now in the   th century you will add to it the improvements you have found for it in your own genius and your own age you will not as did the creatures of charles i make the faux pas of putting the produce into the kings pocket no you will remember what that experiment cost his majestys predecessor you will if you can get leave of envy—you will put it into the pockets of lord melville mr croker and their friends and thus in the navy department likewise will everything be as it should be rhetoric and fallacy all this says somebody fallacy not it indeed nothing but the plainest common sense suffer not yourself to be blinded by one of those fallacies which timidity and selfdistrust are so ready to oppose to indisputable truth say not to yourself all this is strong therefore none of it is true what i do not say is that in the two supposed cases the mischief of the application is as great as in the real one what i do say is that the principle would not be different the principle different no nor the course taken more palpably indefensible section xvii how lord eldon planned and established by act of parliament a jointstock company composed of the westminsterhall chiefs and dishonest men of all classes in general jointstock companies are no favourites with lord eldon but general rules have their exceptions that between dishonest men of all classes and judges taking payment to themselves out of a fund common to both the strictest community of interest has place has been proved if anything was ever proved over and over a tax into what pocket soever the money goes cannot be imposed on judicial pursuit but to all who cannot advance the money justice is denied and all those who fail to do what has thus been rendered impossible to them are delivered over to injury in all shapes at the hands of all persons who are dishonest enough to take advantage of the licence so held out a tax into what pocket soever the money goes cannot be imposed on the necessary means of judicial defence but it offers to all who can advance the money and are dishonest enough to accept the offer an instrument wherewith by the power of the judges yet without their appearing to know anything of the use thus made of it injury in almost every imaginable shape may be inflicted—inflicted with certainty and impunity and the correspondent sinister profit reaped at the charge of all those who are not able to purchase the use of that same instrument for their defence thus in so far as the produce of the exaction goes into the judges pocket the interest of the dishonest man cannot in either of those his situations as above be served but the interest of the judge is served along with it of a partnership contract whatever else be among its objects one object as well as effect is the establishing a community of interest between the several members and if the persons acting so described are not dishonest and if between them and the judge in question a community of interest is not formed let any one say who thinks he can in what more indisputable way it is in the power of man to be dishonest and whether between such a set of men and a set of dishonest judges it would be possible for community of sinister interest to be formed not less difficult will it be found to say how any man judge or not judge can fail to be dishonest who receiving money in proportion consents and with his eyes open to     the habitual promotion and production of injury in all imaginable shapes in both or either of the situations described as above true it is that in general jointstock companies any at least that can be named on the same day with this for magnitude have not been formed without a charter and that on the occasion here in question no charter has been employed not less true is it that in the establishment of other jointstock companies the power of parliament has been employed and that in the establishment of the jointstock company in question that hand so superior to all morality has in the manner shown in §    most diligently and effectually been employed in the concession of a charter the hand of the chancellor is regularly employed and in the passing of the acts of parliament in question it has been shown how that same learned hand has not been less primarily and effectually employed such being the partnership now as to the terms of it a species of partnership as well known as any other is—a finds money b skill and labour of the partnership here in question such are the terms head of the firm beyond all dispute lord eldon found by him in by far the greatest abundance skill labour power and example looked for by him and received accordingly profit in correspondent abundance behold then the firm of eldon and co by what other name can the firm with any tolerable degree of propriety be denominated apprised of the existence of this partnership judge and co is the denomination by which for i forget what length of time—some thirty or forty years probably—in print as well as in conversation i have been in the habit of designating it not a pen not a voice having ever raised itself to controvert this undeniable truth but though established by intrinsic power—by that power which is so much in the habit of setting at nought that of parliament—never till lord eldon stood up and with so much ease carried the matter through as above was this coryphæus of jointstock companies established by an express act of parliament one allembracing and undeniable truth when the public mind is sufficiently familiarized with it will remove doubts and difficulties in abundance it will serve as a key to everything that in this country has ever been done in the field of judicial procedure from the norman conquest down to the present time diametrically opposite to the ends of justice have been the actual ends of judicature judicial establishment and judicial procedure included but more especially judicial procedure paid as judges have been by fee—paid by taxes the produce of which has all along been liable to be augmented and been augmented accordingly by themselves at no time could the system have been in any better state suppose that in those their situations and that in the most barbarous times judges would have for the end of action the happiness of suitors as well might you suppose that it is for the happiness of negroes that planters have all along been flogging negroes for the good of hindoos that the leadenhallstreet proprietors have all along been squeezing and excoriating the sixty or a hundred millions of hindoos section xviii how the kings chancellor exercised dispensing power to those who have read §§   and  0 or §   alone this can be no news but of the nature and magnitude of the dispensing power thus assumed and exercised by lord eldon conception may be helped by a few words more james the second and his advisers operated openly and rashly prerogative in hand they ran a tilt against parliament law lord eldon was lord eldon in a cause of no expectation out of sight of all laygents—out of sight of all men but his copartners in the firm of which he is the head—he laid down the fundamental principle when under a so unexpected opposition his good humour habitual and preeminent as it is forgot itself for a while—not so his prudence taking instruction from the adversary he made a full stop nor till the impediment ceased could he be made to move a step by all the importunity we have seen employed in the endeavour to urge him on towards the consummation of his own schemes still out of the sight of laygents when on the cessation of the interregnum he remounted the throne and like louis xviii reaped the benefit of whatever had been done for the consolidation of it by the usurper—the obstructor persevering as we have seen him being for the time dispirited by the rebuff received from lord erskine under the tuition of the learned jackofbothsides—still he imposed not any fresh tax contenting himself with increasing—in the manner and to the extent samples of which have been seen in §  —the produce of those he found established nor was this the whole of his labour or of his success for we have seen how still out of sight of the laygents at times and in ways altogether invisible to unlearned eyes at what tables and over what bottles must be left to imagination he had succeeded in completely impregnating his westminsterhall creatures and in their several judicatories giving complete establishment to his plan as well in principle as in practice   0 then again when another unexpectable mishap befel him and the webs which the united strength of so many learned spiders had for such a length of time been employed in weaving were broken through and demolished altogether by the irruption of one poor hunted fly—even this shock severe as it could not but be did not make him relinquish his high purpose bold where boldness was requisite pliant where pliancy all the sacrifice it brought him to was—the accepting from parliament and that too with improvement the consummation of the ambitious and rapacious plan at the commencement of which the nature of the case had obliged him to act though with all prudent and practicable secresy against parliament thus much as to the mode—now as to effect and the extent given to it james the second with his dispensing power placed a catholic priest in the privy council and a catholic or no less obsequious protestant fellow in an oxford college john the second gave the dispensing power not only to himself but to all his underlings covering thus with a so much more profitable power the whole field of judicature section xix character evidence against specific indications such as these honourable house and the old bailey receive a sort of evidence which is neither quite so easily obtained nor quite so efficient when obtained in the old bailey as in honourable house it may be called and for aught i know is called character evidence quantity in pretty exact proportion to that of the hope and fear of which he who is the subject of it is the object quality determined by the same causes colours two—white and black but for my old friend mr butler no such evidence as this would have been offered—no such section as this have been written nor yet if in the laud heaped up by him upon lord eldon he had contented himself with using his own hand but the hand to which he has assigned this task is the hand of romilly that confidencecommanding and uncontradictable hand which for this purpose resurrectionman like he has ravished from the tomb having in the course of between thirty and forty years intimacy been in the habit of hearing sentiments of so widely different a tendency on every occasion delivered in relation to this same person—silence on an occasion such as the present would have been so little distinguishable from assent that i could not sit easy without defending myself against what might otherwise have appeared a contradiction given to me by my departed and everlamented friend in relation to lord eldon i have no doubt of romillys having used language which at a distance of time and for want of sufficient discrimination might naturally and sincerely enough by a not unwilling hand have been improved into a sort of panegyric thus put into his mouth but by the simple omission of one part of it the strictest truth may have the effect of falsehood with a transcript of the panegyric in question or of any part of it i will not swell these already too full pages suffice it to mention my sincere wish that it may be compared with what here follows by my living friend—my departed friend i have reason to think was never seen but in a mixed company assured i well am and by the declaration of my departed friend that between them there was no intimacy between my departed friend and myself confidence was mutual and entire romilly was among the earliest and for a time the only efficient one of my disciples to romilly with that secresy which prudence dictated my works such as they are were from first to last a textbook the sort of light in which i was viewed by him was in honourable house in his own presence on an evermemorable occasion attested by our common friend mr brougham† not a reformatiuncle of his as hartley would have called it did romilly ever bring forward that he had not first brought to me and conned over with me one of them—that in which paleys love of arbitrary power was laid open—was borrowed from my spiders under whose covering they may still be found the project so successfully opposed by lord eldons sir william grant—the endeavour to prevail upon honourable gentlemen to divest themselves of the power of swindling in their individual capacities—was to both of us a favourite one nothing of this sort could ever come upon the carpet but the character of lord eldon came of necessity along with it a few lines will give the substance of volumes the determinate opposer of everything good the zealous able and indefatigable supporter of everything evil from which to the ruling one or the ruling few reputed good in any the smallest quantity at the expense of the many appeared derivable well and what chance do you see of the     evil geniuss suffering it to pass this on one part was the constant question why     just now things are so and so stating or alluding to some hold which at the moment he thought he might have upon lord eldon a favourable circumstance was—that though regarding the m p with the eye with which he could not but regard one of the most troublesome of his political opponents—the chancellor—such in his estimation was the legal knowledge and judgment of romilly—was in the habit of paying to the arguments of this advocate not less but even more deference than in the eyes of the profession was always consistent with justice so at least i have heard over and over again from various professional men in romillys acquirements and character he beheld a leaningstock the value of which he knew how to appreciate now for the like through channels less exposed to suspicion— the state of the court of chancery is such that it is the disgrace of a civilized society these are the words furnished me in writing by a friend as among the very words used by romilly but a few months before his death in a mixed company it was at a place which for several days of his last autumn a place i occupied in devonshire afforded to the relator various free conversations besides those at which i was present—general result—lord eldon himself the cause of many of the abuses of the greater part of the others the remedy always in his own hands if there is a hell the court of chancery is hell words these given as the very words uttered by lord erskine but a few weeks before his death in conversation with another person from whom i have them under his own hand both relators most extensively known and not more known than trusted on any adequate occasion both papers should be visible judex à non judicando ut lucus à non luendo the sort of service of all others for which lord eldon is not only most eminently but most notoriously unfit is the very service for the performance of which his unexampled power may have been originally     placed but if pretended so falsely pretended to be still kept in his hand this being premised and admission made of the facility with which for purposes such as have been brought to view he can wrap his miserybreeding meaning up in clouds such as while transparent to accomplices and natural allies shall be opaque to all destined victims—i must for shortness refer my readers to mr butlers panygeric sending them to a work which has already had ten times as many readers as any of mine can look to have i secure myself against the consciousness of injustice and i hope from the reproach of it i will advance further in my approach to meet him on any of those nice points on which expectation being equally strong and sincere on both sides the difference between right and wrong being scarce discernible decisions were it not for appearances might with as little prejudice to the sense of security be committed to lot as to reflection holding the scales of justice—on any of these sources of doubt and display which in any tolerable system of legislaturemade law a line or two or a word or two would have dried up—lord eldon at the expense of years where another man would have taken days has given to the amateurs of difficulty a degree of satisfaction beyond what any other man could have given to them to them satisfaction to himself reputation—instrument of power applicable to all purposes this by the having stocked his memory with a larger mass than perhaps any other man romilly possibly excepted of the cases known to have sprung up within the field of equity—and the having also enabled himself with correspondent facility to make application of them to the purpose of each moment whatsoever be that purpose whether it be to lead aright to mislead or to puzzle and put to a stand himself or others so much for intellectuals now for morals beyond all controversy—recognised not less readily by adversaries than by dependents one politicojudicial virtue his lordship has which in his noble and learned bosom has swelled to so vast a magnitude that like aarons serpentrod it shows as if it had swallowed up all the rest in the public recognition of it trembling complaint seeks an emollient for vengeance decorous and just satire a mask after stabbing the master of the abuses through and through with facts mr vizard takes in hand the name of this virtue—and innuendo this is the only one that can be found lays it like a piece of goldbeaters skin on the wounds that which beauty according to anacreon is to woman—courtesy according to everybody is to lord eldon to armour of all sorts—offensive as well as defensive—a matchless and most advantageous substitute with the exception of those whom while doubting he is ruining and without knowing anything of the matter plundering—this it is that keeps everybody in good humour everybody—from my lord duke down to the barristers servantclerk useful here useful there useful everywhere—of all places it is in the cabinet that it does knights service it is the court stickingplaster which even when it fails to heal keeps covered all solutions of continuity it is the grand imperial cement which keeps political corruption from dissolving in its own filth never said somebody once never do i think of lord eldon or lord sidmouth but i think of the aphorism of helvetius—celui qui na ni honneur ni humeur est un courtezan parfait when this virtue of the noble and learned lords has received its homage the rest may be most effectually and instructively made known by their fruits these fruits will be his res gestæ exploits—performed throughout or in the course of his fourandtwenty years dominion over the fields of judicature and legislation enterprises consummated—enterprises in progress—measures not originating with him but taken up by him and improved—exploits performed by his own hands exploits performed by the hands of his creatures or other instruments—under one or more of these heads were any such exactness worth the space and trouble would some of these exploits be to be entered—under another or others others but forasmuch as all judicial censure is altogether out of the     question and the space and research necessary for such distinctions altogether unaffordable they must unavoidably be omitted under each head it will be for the reader from what he has seen or heard or may choose to see or hear to consider whether and if yes how far the imputation attaches to improve upon these hastily collected hints and complete the investigation would if performed by a competent hand assuredly be a most interesting as well as useful work   nipping in the bud the spread of improvement over the habitable globe ruining fortunes by wholesale and involving in alarm and insecurity a vast proportion of the vast capital of the country by wantonlyscattered doubts leaving the settlement of them to a future contingent time that may never come   rendering all literary property dependent upon his own inscrutable and uncontroulable will and pleasure   establishing a censorship over the press under himself with his absolute and inscrutable will as censor inviting after publication with its expense has been completed applications to himself for prohibition with profit to himself in these as in all other

and pleasure establishing and continually extending the practice of covering his own proceeding with the cloak of secresy   rivetting on the neck of the people the continually pinching yoke of an aristocratical magistracy by rendering all relief at the hands of the chancellor as hopeless as by artificial law expenses and participation in sinister interest and prejudice it has been rendered at the hands of the judge   on pretence of heterodoxy by ex post facto law made by a single judge for the purpose—divesting parents of the guardianship of their own children   injecting into mens minds the poison of insincerity and hypocrisy by attaching to pretended misdeeds sufferings from which by an unpunishable and unprovable though solemn act of insincerity the supposed misdoer may in every case with certainty exempt himself†       in all manner of shapes planting or fixing humiliation and anxiety in the breasts of all who on points confessedly too obscure for knowledge oppose him or refuse to join with him in the profession of opinions in relation to which there is no better evidence of their being really his than the money and power he has obtained by the profession of them   pretending to establish useful truth by the only means by which success to pernicious falsehood can ever be secured proclaiming in the most impressive manner the falsehood and mischievousness of everything that is called religion—by punishing or threatening to punish whatsoever is said in the way of controverting the truth or usefulness of it  0 bearding parliament by openly declaring its incapacity to render unpunishable anything to which the judges with the words common law in their mouths shall have been pleased to attach punishment or take upon them to punish—thus by the assumed authority of himself and those his creatures keeping men under the rod of punishment for habits of action which in consideration of their innoxiousness had by parliament been recently exempted from it as if parliament had not exempted men from declared and limited but for the purpose of subjecting them to unconjecturable and unlimited punishment witness the unitarians and all others who will not at his command thus signified defile themselves with insincerity to purchase the common rights of subjects    doing that which even parliament would not dare to do and because parliament would not dare to do it doing it with no other warrant than this or that one of a multitude of words and phrases to which one import as well as another may be assigned at pleasure witness libel blasphemy malice contra bonos mores conspiracy christianity is part and parcel of the law of the land converting thus at pleasure into crimes any the most perfectly innoxious acts and even meritorious ones substituting thus to legislative definition and prohibition an act of ex post facto punishment which the most consummate legal knowledge would not have enabled a man to avoid and as to which in many an instance perhaps it was not intended that it should be avoided all this—which under a reallyexisting constitution grounded on the greatesthappiness principle would furnish matter for impeachment upon impeachment—furnishes under the imaginary matchless one matter of triumph claim to reward and reward accordingly    poisoning the fountain of history by punishing what is said of a departed public character on the disapproving side—while for evidence and argument on the approving side an inexhaustible fund of reward is left open to every eye thus by suppression doubling the effect of subornation of evidence this by the hand of one of his creatures his own hand without the aid of that other not reaching quite far enough the title master of the abuses which occurs in p     may perhaps have been thought     to require explanation it was suggested by that of master of the revels coupled with the idea of the enjoyments in which he and his have for so many years been seen revelling by the exercise given to the functions of it the mastership of the revels being abolished or in disuse—the mastership of the abuses appears to have been silently substituted and lord eldon presents himself as having been performing the functions of the office as yet without a salary with his masters in chancery serving under him in the corresponding capacity and on the same generous footing on the principle of the unpaid magistracy a subject for calculation might be—at what anno domini the business of all the denominated offices possessed by those masters and their grand master respectively will have been brought into the state into which under his lordships management that of the sixclerks has already been brought together with that of the six offices with which the future services of his honourable son have been so nobly and generously remunerated—at what halcyon period these offices will with the rest have been sublimated into sinecures and the incumbents apotheosed into so many dii majorum or dii minorum gentium of the epicurean heaven to help conception a short parallel between the noble and learned lord and his noble and learned predecessor jefferies may be not altogether without its use general jefferies had his one campaign general eldon as many as his command lasted years—the deaths of jefferiess killedoff were speedy of eldons lingering as his own resolves the deaths of lord jefferiess victims were public—the sufferers supported and comforted in their affliction by the sympathy of surrounding thousands lord eldons expired unseen in the gloom of that solitude which wealth on its departure leaves behind it jefferies whatsoever he may have gained in the shape of royal favour—source of future contingent wealth—does not present himself to us clothed in the spoils of any of his slain no man no woman no child did eldon ever kill whose death had not in the course of it in some way or other put money into his pocket in the language visage and deportment of jefferies the suffering of his victims produced a savage exultation in eldons never any interruption did they produce to the most amiable goodhumour throwing its grace over the most accomplished indifference jefferies was a tiger eldon in the midst of all his tears like niobe a stone prophet at once and painter another predecessor of lord eldon—lord bacon—has drawn his emblem behold the man says he who to roast an egg for himself is ready to set anothers house on fire so far so good but to complete the likeness he should have added—after having first gutted it one other emblem—one other prophecy—is it not written in the arabian nights entertainments—sinbad the sailor britannia old man of the sea the learned slaughterer of pheasants whose prompt deaths are objects of envy to his suitors after fretting and pummelling with no better effect than sharpening the gripe—the arabian slave by one desperate effort shook off his tormenting master the entire prophecy will

concealment will be sufficiently manifest read this work of theirs whoever you are—you who thinking for the public have any regard for justice so rich the mass of abuse it not merely denounces in general terms but spreads out in detail bringing it at the same time within the conception of nonlawyers the matter ranged under some nine or ten heads following one another in the chronological order of the proceedings in a suit proper subject of every honest mans indignation according to them p    not only the system which allows but the judges who encourage such conduct and with a little attention every solicitor who has had twentyfive years practice and a few over in the equity courts as well as many a man who has had none will be able to draw the line and to say to himself whether by any former judge anything like so much encouragement has been given to the sort of conduct therein held up to view ask with so many learned gentlemen whether it be to lord eldon or to the system that the phenomena are due ask first whether it is to the father or to the mother that the birth of a child is due from this most instructive publication take a few hastilypickedup samples pages

lord eldon with or without predecessors for stalkinghorses to carry that same disposition into effect i by dishonesty on the defendants side to which side in a common lawsuit dishonesty is of course most apt to have place—  years   before the time for what is called appearance the defendant not being permitted to appear but forced to employ in appearing for him a solicitor whom likewise without a train of barristers to speak for him the chancellor will not see  ½     by not appearing before the cause is ultimately called on for judges hearing       after hearing wasted by reference to a master

of him who at common law had been on the defendants side one half of the business of equity consisting in stopping or frustrating the application of the remedy held out by common law and at any stage down to the very last this stoppage may be effected n b this combination of two sorts of judicatories proceeding on mutually contradictory principles is by lord eldon and by so many others professed to be regarded as necessary to justice  years   by amending bills from   to     between the suits being set down for hearing by the judge and its being by that same judge called on for hearing

often stated and never denied delay on the plaintiffs side as here has been in use to be employed as a regular and sure source of profit by dishonest men with other mens money in their pockets where

and firmness addresses two one to the people the other to noble lords for better intelligibility behold these same addresses in the first place in plain english after that for security against misrepresentation in lord eldonish   lord eldon to the people in plain english—have done have done let me alone nay but dont teaze me so you had best not you wont get anything by it this is not the way to get me out i can tell you that come now if you will but let me alone ill go out of my own accord i should have been out long ago had it not been for you its only your teazing me so that keeps me in if you keep on teaze teaze ill never go out no that i wont note that this was on the   th of june      ten days after the day on which without authority or expectation on the part of the author the editor of the morning chronicle with whose stripes the noble and learned back is so well acquainted had given an article on these indications the original in lord eldonish—perhaps it is thought that this mode of calumnious misrepresentation is the way to get me out of office they are mistaken who think so i will not yield to such aspersions nor shrink from asserting what i owe to myself had i been treated with common justice i should not perhaps have been lord chancellor this day but i repeat it i will not be driven out of office by calumnious attack let me only be treated with common justice and my place shall be at any mans disposal calumnious indeed look back cautious and justiceloving reader—look back at the indications see what any of them want of being proofs see whether anything but a formulary or two is wanting to render them proofs and conclusive ones suppose for arguments sake the defendant guilty and see whether on that supposition anything more convincing than what is there brought to view could have been adduced say whether in case of misstatement anywhere there can be any ground for regarding it as wilful any ground for attaching to it any such epithet as calumnious   lord eldon to lordships in plain enlish—help help help going going cant stand it any longer what nobody lend me a hand—nobody speak a word for me do not you see how it is with me what and will you turn against me better not i can tell you that youll be all the worse for it when i am put down it will be your turn next what will become of your privileges—think of that ill tell you what so sure as they take away my seals so sure will they take away your privileges squeaking staggering blustering crying out for help—all in a breath what an exhibition original in lord eldonish—the feelings and fate of an individual are in themselves of small importance to the public and i may be sacrificed to the insults i daily receive but i beg noble lords to reflect that i may not be the only sacrifice if the object is as it appears to be to pull down the reputations and throw discredit on the motives and conduct of men in high official situations—if every man who occupies a high situation in the church turning of course to the bishops bench in the church or state is to become the object of slander and calumny then your lordships may lay your account with similar treatment and be convinced that your privileges or power cannot long be respected when such characters have been sacrificed n b at what words the tears began to flow is not reported when a crocodile comes on the stage—tears tears should be added to the hear hears no my weeping and fainting and firmnessacting lord how purblind soever the eyes you are accustomed to see around you blindness is not yet so near to entire as to make lordships see no difference between your seals and their privileges their privileges who is it that is to take away these same privileges the king or the people or the pope     of rome your seals yes the king can take away these pretty playthings of yours and not improbably will so soon as in his estimation there will be more uneasiness from keeping them where they are than from placing them elsewhere but lords privileges they are a sort of a thing not quite so easily disposed of to bring his hand in his majesty will first take away from himself his own prerogatives the people yes supposing guards and garrisons were all annihilated in a day the people that is to say a mob might not find much more difficulty in dealing with these accoutrements of yours than the king would after burning your bags they might throw your seals into the thames where your predecessor littleton threw his yes all this a mob for this is what you always have in view when you speak or think of the people might indeed do but could they either burn or throw into the thames their lordships privileges as to the pope i say nothing of him here what regards him belongs to catholic emancipation seriously it was found impossible by anything but extravagance to comment upon such extravagance what must have been the state of that mind which could rely upon it as argument in this place without aid either from witchcraft or from treachery i had actually gone on and given the substance of the argument with which in cabinets and over bottles the noble and learned lord has for these fiveandtwenty years and more been occupying himself in the endeavour—no very difficult one it must be confessed—to keep up and if possible to increase the aversion to improvement in so many shapes and to reform in every shape but relevancy seeming questionable and mischief from overweight unquestionable the papers have been put aside the indications are before the reader some original others copied in both cases how determinate they are he can scarcely have failed to remark as well as the proofs he shall now have before him the answers from a clear conscience accompanied by a clear and wellexercised conception they would have been correspondently determinate in generals at any rate and in particulars according as time and occasion admitted and importance required every charge would have been noticed and lest omission should be taken for confession no one left altogether without notice so much as to what the answers might have been and in the momentarily supposed case would have been behold now what in the actual case they are first as to the general heads of defence they will be found composed of uncharacteristicallyvituperative matter applied at every turn to the accusations and expressed in these terms—     misrepresentation and calumnies     calumnious misrepresentation     such aspersions     calumnious attacks     misstatements and misrepresentations of every kind     much misrepresentation     calumny and misstatement     slander and calumny what the noble and learned defendants perturbation did not permit him to perceive is how strongly this sort of language smells of the old bailey of the place he was looking to be sent to by their lordships as per globe june         there to be put to death and that when a man can find nothing to say that shall tend to his exculpation this sort of unmeaning outcry is what he vents his anguish in rather than be seen to make confession in the shape of silence so much for generals follow now all the several specific attempts at defence with an observation or two upon each lord eldon—i from the accounts which have been furnished to me of my emoluments as lord chancellor from those who best know the amount lordship himself being nobly careless of all such things apart from my income as speaker of the house of lords i am happy to say that the lord chiefjustice of the kings bench has received a larger sum from his office i speak from the average accounts of the last three years observations—  what is this to the purpose not of the quantum do we complain but of the sources of which sources he dares not say a syliable   whatever it be that you receive is it the less because you receive it from a number of places instead of one   of the patronage nothing said whereas from a small portion of it you receive in the person of your son according to the undisputed calculation of mr miller £  00 ayear and unless in case of untimely death will receive in the whole £ 000   what is it to the purpose what the chiefjustice has if the emolument of the man in question is excessive does the greater excess of another mans make it less so   since he knows then what his emoluments are why will he sit to be thus badgered rather than produce them why unless it be because they would be seen not to agree with the account thus given of them and because he fears that if honourable gentlemen     knew the whole amount they would grudge giving him full value for it lord eldon—ii and i will further say that in no one year since i have been made chancellor have i received the same amount of profit as i enjoyed while at the bar observations—  the same no most probably not for so long as there is a farthingsworth of difference this is strictly true but how is anybody to know whether it is   if everybody knows it what would it be to the purpose   while the chancellor declares himself happy that the chiefjustices profits out of other mens misery are so great may a suitor be permitted to confess himself not quite so happy that barristers profits drawn by insincerity out of the same impure source are if so it really be so enormous lord eldon—iii had i remained at the bar and kept the situation i held there i solemnly declare i should not have been a shilling the poorer man than i am this moment notwithstanding my office observations—  believe who can evidence none disprobative counterevidence as to the official side of the account obstinacy of concealment evidence circumstantial indeed but not the less conclusive but possibly here as before of his cluster of offices with their emoluments he shuts his eyes against all but one and thus by a virtual falsehood thinks to keep clear of a literal one   again—what is all this to the purpose oh had he but kept to the bar—or instead of the bench been sent to that bar to which as above he so lately looked to be sent by their lordships on his way to another place—what a waste of human misery would have been saved of human misery for which who ever saw or heard him exhibiting any the slightest mark of regard men women and children—widows and orphans—being treated by him as if composed of insentient matter like the stones from which the gold exacted from them was extracted lord eldon—iv no charge of delay can fairly be brought against me observations—  now well done lord eldon to a host of witnesses continue to oppose a front of brass   not to speak of the mountains of manufactured delay opened to view by the samples as if by a particular providence—in opposition to this plea of not guilty behold prepared by anticipation six months antecedently to the pleading of it a special piece of criminative evidence a statement the manifestly trustworthy result of a course of observation the commencement and continuance of which was a phenomenon not much less extraordinary than the course observed upon it is here copied word for word from a morning paper whence it came from is unknown neither to the whole nor to any part of it whatsoever has any contradiction been ever heard of   under the eyes of so vast a posse of retainers retained by every tie of interest in the defence of this giver of good gifts—is it in the nature of the case that anything to which the name of misrepresentation could have been applied with any chance of being regarded as properly applied should in all this time have passed unnoticed court of chancery—from a suitor—term ended on monday the lord chancellor when he was rising apprized the gentlemen of the bar and the suitors of the court that he would not come down till thursday his lordship is no doubt entitled to two days recreation after his learned labours of a month in order that the public may duly appreciate those labours let us briefly review them—the calculation may appear curious—the time which his lordship sat—the number of cases heard—not decided—and the quantum of relief afforded his lordship commenced his sittings on the  st november and from that to the   th both inclusive he sat in court    days in no day but one did he sit before ten oclock on one day only did he remain till three indeed he could not during term for as he has often said the students should have their dinner his lordship out of the    days spent in court   ½ hours for   days he sat  ½ hours each equal to    for   ditto       for   ditto  ¼     for   ditto  ¼    for   ditto  ¼   ½    days   hours   ½ this statement is correct if the court clerk can be depended on on two of those short sitting days his lordship had to attend in council to hear the recorders report of the old bailey convicts on another of them he rose before twelve oclock in indignation that there was no business—no business in chancery on some of the other short days he was called on business elsewhere but let us now see how this time was occupied the case of the rev a fletcher is entitled to the first place in this enumeration indeed the flight of paris with helen was not destined to give more employment for the grecian heroes than the flight of mr fletcher   0 from his caledonian lassie is to cut out for the gentlemen of the long robe thus may we fairly exclaim—cedant arma toga in the kings bench we had only a skirmish from which the parties retired æquo marte the great fight was reserved for the arena of chancery for four days the contending parties fought and four times did night or preparations for the students dinner put an end to the contest on the fifth day—after hearing from eight counsel nine speeches the reply included—his lordship decided that he would not become an officer of police for a scotch synod to pull the reverend preacher from the pulpit this case consumed    hours out of   ½ but is it decided no—the contrary for his lordship more than once intimated that if it were worth while by a longer term of suspension to bring the question before the court in a more regular form his opinion might incline the other way his intimations will not be lost on the synod therefore mr fletcher that you may not be pulled down by the skirts you had better like mawworm wear a spencer fourteen hours more were consumed from day to day in two cases which were new to the court these were—petitions from latham and abbots bankrupts praying that his lordship by virtue of the enlarged jurisdiction conferred on him by the new bankrupt law would grant them their certificate which the required number of their creditors refused his lordship after many observations referred one to be reexamined by the commissioners and to determine the fate of the other he demanded more papers the cases of these parties are therefore in statu quo and we are again fated to listen to halfadozen longwinded orations next after these in point of duration is to be placed the motion to commit the glamorganshire canal proprietors for violating his lordships injunction after hearing eight counsel for ten hours on different days his lordship decided that four of the defendants were not to be committed but the liberty of fifth is adhuc sub judice to balance the mildness of the judgment with a sort of trimming policy vengeance was denounced against the refractory watchmen therefore they had better look sharp discite justitiam moniti et non temnere we have now accounted for    hours out of the   ½ of the rest the old cases of grey v grey and of garrick v lord camden in which no progress was made took up   hours   more were devoted to hale v hale to determine the sale of mothers estates to be commenced de novo and  0 from day to day were given to the attorneygeneral v heales sims v ridge the matter of bayles and the matter of blackburns to honey v honey wilcox v rhodes—appeals from the vicechancellor in the latter of which his honours decree was pronounced to be nonsense incapable of being executed not one of them is a jot advanced lunatics and the elopement of a ward took up  ½ hours the new alliance company took up   and then   more were wasted in disputes between counsel and court about priority of motions the opening of the eternal opera house cases of which there are now three took up   hours and the remaining   were consumed from time to time on bankrupts petitions and miscellaneous orders to recapitulate the whole the business and time are balanced thus— the attorneygeneral v the rev a fletcher    ex parte latham in re latham

miscellaneous      ½ lord eldon—v it is a mistake to suppose that because the drudgery of some offices is performed by deputies they are therefore to be called sinecures observations—  nebulousgas—confusiongas—evasiongas from the eldon laboratory eldon juniors six sinecures—four in possession two more in reversion—of course here in view never where common honesty is an object of regard—unpunishable swindling of indignation—never will they be anywhere out of view   mark here the division business of official situation drudgery and nondrudgery drudgery doing the business of the office nondrudgery receiving and spending the emoluments of it paying for the doing of the business unless it be of a particular connexion no more than a pittance the smallest that any one can be found to take note that with few if any exceptions when from any one of these offices you have separated the drudgery you have separated all     the business from it for laying out of the case those which are judicial such as the masterships and the commissionerships and the examinerships—the business of them amounts to little or nothing more than ordinary clerkbusiness such as copying or making entries under heads business not requiring a tenth part so much appropriate knowledge and judgment and active talent as that of an exciseman does   note that what his lordship here does consists in putting a possible case that those who are eager to lay hold of every supposition favourable to him and his system may without proof set it down in their minds an actual case an actual case to a considerable extent exemplified and in particular in the instance of the rich cluster of sinecures out of the profits of which without troubling himself with the drudgery either of writing or thinking his honourable son is acting the part of a fine gentleman and if rumour does not overflatter him testifying filial gratitude by good dinners   the possible case is this—a situation in which one man and no more is placed though the business of it is more than one man can adequately perform the business being at the same time of such a nature as to be capable of being divided into two branches one requiring extraordinary appropriate acquirements the other requiring none beyond ordinary ones for example shopkeepers clerks acquirements in this state of things the extraordinarytalentrequiring part of the business is reserved by the principal official person for himself his appropriate aptitude considering the dignity of him of whose choice he is the object being unquestionable the nomorethanordinarytalentrequiring part that to wit which is meant by the drudgery being turned over or rather turned down by him to the deputy of the thus wisely and carefully made division and distribution sole object of course—the good of the service   now then—supposing an inquiry into this matter included in the inquiries of a house of commons committee is there so much as a single instance in which any such overweight of business together with any such division made would be found exemplified whoever is a layer of wagers might without much danger venture a considerable one to the contrary   in the case of eldon junior what i would venture to lay for is—that of his four places in possession there is not one the business of which requires so much appropriate knowledge judgment and active talent as that of an exciseman does and that there is not one for which he himself does any business other than signing his name with or without the trouble of looking over the accounts of the deputies if in name or effect there be any to wit for the purpose of ascertaining whether the principal receives the whole of what is his due and so in regard to the reversions the existence of which bythebye is a separate one and that an abominable and altogether indefensible abuse   true my lord an office in which for the public service a something an anything is done—is not in strictness of speech a sinecure though that something were no more than any charityschool boy is equal to and although it took up but a minute in doing once out of each of the seven months in ayear during which your masters your lordships soninlaw included serve   this being conceded to you what are you the better for it would you have the amount of the depredation exercised by the maintenance of an office allowed to be executed by deputy i will give you a rule by which in every case you may obtain it from the sum received by the principal subtract that received by the deputy or deputies—the difference is all of it depredation of thus much you may be sure whether of this which the deputy or deputies receive there be any and what part that belongs to that same account is more than you can be sure of otherwise than by applying to this case that matchless criterion of due proportion as between reward and service fair competition—competition as in the case of goods sold and—under the name of work done—service in all shapes sold to individuals and if good in those cases what should render it otherwise in this   casting back an eye on the matter thus employed in effecting the explosion of the eldon gas i cannot but regret the quantity if by any instruction contained in it the labour of looking into it be paid for it will be by the applications capable of being made of this concluding rule lord eldon—vi i will pledge myself to be as active as any noble lord in correcting abuses but i will perform my duty with a due regard to the rights of others observations—  pledge himself yes but giving a pledge is one thing—redeeming it another in the whole fiveandtwenty years during which this has been swagging like an incubus on the breast of justice in what instance has he ever meddled with abuse in any shape unless it be by the endeavour to give perpetuity and increase to it not that as thus worded this desire amounts to any great matter beyond what he might have credit given him for and this without any very wide departure from the exact line of truth noble lords—if in a situation such as theirs it were possible for men to feel any such desire—would not have far to look for the gratification of it     your majesty said somebody once to a king of spain who was complaining of ceremonies is but a ceremony your lordships the same person might have said to their lordships are but an abuse as an argumentum ad hominem nothing against this challenge can be said but the organs for which it was designed were the ears of noble lords not the eyes of the public to which however i hereby take the liberty of recommending it abuses are neither hares nor foxes noble lords are too well born and under noble and learned lords too well bred to take any great delight in hunting them lord eldon—vii the reason why in the present bill there appeared no clause regulating offices in the court of chancery is—that a commission is now sitting on the state of the court observations—  now sitting o yes and for ever will be if his lordships recommendation to the people is taken by the people and the operation of teazing ceases or relaxes—sedet æternùmque sedebit   a commission yes and what commission a commission which never could have sat at all—which never could have been thought of at all—had it been supposed that in either house there exists any such sense as a sense of shame   an enormous dilatory plea set like a gun in a selfjudication system a transparent veil for corruption a snug succedaneum to the still apprehended and eventually troublesome inquisition of a not quite sufficiently corrupt honourable house—such is this commission—a subterfuge which more than perhaps all others has damaged the reputation of the principal not to speak of the accomplices in matchless constitution that allprevading and allruling principle the selfjudication principle has now to that local habitation which it has so long had added a name a name which so long as the mass of corruption in which it has been hatched continues undissolved will never cease to be remembered—remembered in time and place by every lover of justice and mankind as occasion serves lord eldon—viii i am uncorrupt in office and i can form no better wish for my country than that my successor shall be penetrated with an equal desire to execute his duties with fidelity observations—  i am uncorrupt and so a plea of not guilty was regarded by this defendant as sufficient in his case to destroy the effect of so matchless a mass of criminative evidence and supersede the need of all justification and exculpative evidence incorrupt oh yes in every way in which it has not been possible for you to be corrupt that you are so far this negative quality is yours make the most of it and see what it will avail you remains neither possessed nor so much as pretended to the whole remainder of appropriate moral aptitude appropriate intellectual aptitude and that appropriate active aptitude without which a man possessed in the highest degree of appropriate aptitude in both those other shapes may in your situation be has in your situation been—a nuisance desire and so in an office such as that of chiefjudge and that but one out of a cluster of rich offices fed upon by the same insatiable jaws desire is sufficient accomplishment or anything like an approach to it supervacaneous yes that he does form no better wish for his country—this may be conceded to him without much difficulty for whatever be the situation when a man has been disgraced in it by inaptitude the least apt is to him but too naturally the least unacceptable successor but as to the can this is really too much to be admitted for even a lord eldon—after rubbing his eyes for the length of time necessary to rub out of them for a moment the motes which keep so perpetually floating in them in the shape of doubts—even a lord eldon might be able to see that desire and accomplishment are not exactly the same thing and that where the object is worth having desire without accomplishment is not quite so good a thing as desire with accomplishment at the end of it put into this chancellors place his housekeeper supposing her to have any regard for the money it brings would have this same desire—which except the uncorruption is all he can muster up courage to lay claim to and which is so much more than can be conceded to him—the desire in respect of fidelity and everything else so far to execute the duties of it as to save herself from losing it next to this comes what has been seen already in his lordships concluding address to their lordships of the visible condition of the defendant no intimation is given in the report to judge from what is given a man who could with such a peroration close such a defence must have been at the verge of a fainting fit in which condition he shall for the present be left     paper ix— on the militia this paper consisting of a portion of the constitutional code viz ch x defensive force §   radicals who will be found in its proper place paper x on public account keeping complaints have of late been made of the method at present pursued for making recordation and appropriate publication of the transactions of the several classes of functionaries of whom the official establishment of the british government is composed and of the pecumary and quasipecuniary transactions more particularly by high authority it has been pronounced inadequate and ill adapted to its professed purpose to this by that same authority a substitution has been proposed and that in the character of a welladapted and adequate one it consists in simply substituting to the method and phraseology at present employed the method and phraseology which is called sometimes the italian sometimes the doubleentry mode or system and the use of which is confined to the case in which pecuniary profit and loss are conjunctly presented to view against this change so far as regards the use of this peculiar and technical phraseology i protest on two grounds—  that instead of being conducive to it is incompatible with the design which on this occasion whether it actually be or no ought to be entertained namely that of rendering the state of the accounts in question more effectually and extensively understood   that if introduced it would of itself produce deterioration to an unfathomable degree in a form of government which assuredly stands not in need of any such change these evils will when examined be seen coalescing into use first as to the design what ought it to be answer as above to render the transactions in question as effectually understood as may be and to that end as intelligible as may be to those whose interests are at stake upon them that is to say in the first place to the representatives of the people in the next place to the people themselves constituents of those same representatives now then in respect of intelligibility what would be the effect of the introduction of this same italian mode so far from augmentation it would be little less than destruction and this relation had as well to constituents as to representatives method is one thing phraseology is anther   first as to method that by means of it any addition would be made to the number of those by whom the transactions in question would be understood remains to be proved no determinate reason for thinking so have i anywhere been able to find whatsoever if anything this same addition would be might it not to equal effect and with equal conveniency in every respect be made by the phraseology in use with everybody as well as by that which is peculiar to merchants with little or no hesitation i answer in the affirmative at any rate that which may be asserted without even the smallest hesitation is that whatsoever may be the advantage derivable from the method never can it compensate for the evil inseparably attached to the unintelligibility of the phraseology   next and lastly as to the phraseology to the whole community with the exception of the single class designated by the appellation of merchants this phraseology is utterly unintelligible to all those for whose use it is or ought to be designed by those by whom the substitution of it to that which is universally intelligible is proposed members of     honourable house and people without doors included of the number of those to whom it is unintelligible compared with the number of those to whom it is intelligible what is the amount to any person whatsoever the answer may be intrusted be it what it may—say who can that it will not suffice to ground the putting a decided exclusion upon the proposed change now then for the other objection—deterioration of the form of government to a universally intelligible mode of giving expression to the transactions of the functionaries of government and in particular to the part which consists in the collection of the produce of the taxes and the disposal made of it substitute an almost universally unintelligible mode what is the consequence answer—exit public opinion enter darkness such as that which forms the characteristic of absolute government to matchless constitution may be substituted the government of spain portugal or turkey and this without responsibility or danger in any shape on the part of the authors of the change obvious as these effects can scarcely fail to appear when once mentioned to none of those persons by whom the subject has been taken into consideration do they appear to have presented themselves neither to those by whom the change has been proposed nor yet even to those by whom it has been opposed first as to those by whom it has been opposed these are—messrs brooksbank and beltz two of the three commissioners for inquiry into the state of the public accounts a wide difference exists say they between the business and circumstances of a trader and those of a government department in the observation thus vague and unapplied consists the only objection made by them to the introduction of the italian mode of the distinction between method and phraseology no intimation whatever is conveyed by it next and lastly as to those by whom the change has been proposed not without sincere regret is it that on this occasion and for such a purpose i hold up to view a production on so many other accounts so highly estimable as the work entitled financial reform by sir henry parnell baronet m p late chairman of the committee on finance pure once p     purest twice pp     and    —in these two words are contained all the arguments i can find in that work in favour of this same phraseology mr abbots proposal is he says p     to establish the italian system in its purest form and to those persons who are practically acquainted with the italian system of accounts the reasons on which mr abbot founds his opinion of its being applicable to all official accounts cannot but be he says p     completely satisfactory applicable unquestionably but what is that to the purpose just nothing applicable means capable of being applied but of the truth of this proposition what need of opinion from that gentleman or anybody else to make us fully satisfied applicable or not applicable with advantage—that is the question and to that question answer has not been given by mr abbot answer has been given here that of the desire of these so highly intelligent and wellinformed statesmen abovementioned unintelligibility on the part of the subjectmatter in question and ignorance next to entire on the part of the persons in question were not amongst the objects—i who write this am altogether satisfied but of the desire of those by whom the recommendations made by the committee over which he sir henry parnell presided were set at nought and the existence of that same committee cut short were or were not these among the objects relieved should i be from an anxiety eminently painful were it in this paper consistent with sincerity to answer in the negative to bring forward a motion for the emolument of the persons in question was according to mr chancellor of the exchequer if the account of the debate is to be believed† treating them it should perhaps have been placing them in an invidious point of view—and in effect he accordingly on that same occasion did what depended on him towards preventing their being placed in that same point of view but these same persons—who were they answer—members says he of the privy council—a body composed of the council of the sovereign and afterwards the first judge in the land was included in it—prodigious and so in the opinion of this member of the cabinet council be the man who he may the servants of the crown have but to obtain the placing of him in a situation which affords them the means of putting into his pocket an indefinitely large portion of the produce of the taxes—this done nobody but themselves is to be informed of the amount of it what the amount is of the booty thus determined to be screened from detection the right honourable guardian of the public purse has not informed us but if the imputation couched under the word invidious be all that he objects to a sure and easy receipt     for the wiping it off is at his command it consists—in the giving publicity to the information in question in the instance of every public functionary without distinction in and by the original committee on finance of which the late charles abbott afterwards speaker and not long ago ennobled by the title of lord colchester was chairman extensive were the disclosures of this sort made and as far as appeared in endeavours to narrow them this was in the years          thirteen or fourteen years after came the committee on finance of which the chairman was the still living mr henry banks the lord eldon of honourable house from the report made by that committee no possibility was there of learning the aggregate of the emoluments received in the instance of any one of the functionaries occupying the situations mentioned in it so exquisite was the ingenuity by which the deed of darkness was accomplished in the eyes of the right honourable persons in question is the imputation of harbouring this same design of darkness regarded as matter of importance—is the clearing themselves of it considered by them as an object worth their regard the means at their command are most effectual for and during many years in the latter part of the last century for the use of the directors of the lifeinsurance company called the amicable society was annually published in conjunction with an almanac a list of the situations of which the official establishment was composed with the emolument attached to each in the shape of salary at present in the annual publication intituled the royal calendar of these situations or at any rate the greatest part of them a list is published but of emolument in the shape of salary or in any other shape in no such publication or in any other publication is any mention to be found now then by order of some one of the constituted authorities let a complete list be published of all those several situations with the amount of the aggregate of the emolument respectively attached to them and to the columns in which these aggregates are inserted let there be added another exhibiting the total of the emoluments received by the functionary in question from all public sources taken together with numeral figures expressive of the pages in which the several situations with their respective masses of emolument are presented to view against the proposition for throwing the light of day upon this part of the den of cacus the only argument adduced by the right honourable gentleman is composed of the word invidious in the import of this same word the idea of distinction is included do away the distinction—set fire to the gas—illuminate uno flatu the whole den as above proposed—extinguished is this argument some dictionary dead or living he will have to turn over for another such on the present occasion—after what has been said on the subject of unintelligibility is it worth while to say anything more of that same branch of art and science for science i see it called to which the attribute of purity has so unhappily been ascribed of fiction and nothing else is it composed of a tissue of misrepresentations—of departures from truth—and these not merely useless but much worse than useless to things relations all along ascribed of which things are not susceptible to persons relative situations in which on the occasion in question these same persons are not placed wine is said to be debtor to cloth to what use this absurd falsehood what explanation of anything does it give to what human being who has not been drenching himself with this and the kindred falsehoods for weeks or months can it present any idea unless it be an illusive one unless it be translated into the vulgar tongue true it is that had this locution been originally applied to the presenting to view the ideas annexed to it by the professors of this artandscience—it might have served as well for the purpose as does the correspondent part and parcel of the vulgar tongue but having once been fixed in the habit of being applied to so different a purpose thence comes the confusion and the useless difficulty which stands opposed to all endeavours to understand it so much for confusionspreading proposition now to speak in logical language use for a delusive term enter wastebook cum totâ sequelâ suâ—wastebook a book composed of paper the value of which is that of wastepaper to an unadept mind what other idea than this is it in the nature of this appellation to suggest yet is this one book the cornerstone on which the truth and usefulness of all the others rest—a book error in which infects with correspondent error all the rest—the original of which though in different forms all those others are but copies call this book the original book those others the derivative books the delusion vanishes call this book the chronological—those others the logical books the matter being traced in different orders according to the different purposes—a further instruction is afforded it is one of the branches of that artandscience which teaches how to make plain things difficult a curious and not altogether uninstructive parallel is that which might be made between this regular and technical mode of account keeping for by both these epithets do i see it honoured and the technical and regular system of judicial procedure it would     show to what a degree by the leadingstring held by blind custom without any additional one tacked on by sinister interest aberration from the rule of right is capable of being effected of this phraseology if any use it have the use consists in giving brevity to the mode of expression analogous is the use in this case to that of shorthand as a substitute to ordinary hand—to that of arithmetical notation as a substitute to ordinary orthography—and to that of algebraic as a substitute to arithmetical notation but small in comparison is the utmost service which in this character can be rendered by it and on this ground not on an imaginary one by those who teach it should the usefulness of it be placed in my constitutional code—to wit in the already published volume of it—may be seen a section in which in the compass of sixtyeight pages what is designed for an allcomprehensive set of books for the exhibition of the accounts pecuniary and quasipecuniary of any government whatsoever is presented to view but for the bulk of it it would have been included in this present miscellany official establishments which it embraces in its view are—not only those of this country but those of any other country whatsoever to any attention bestowed upon it by the only persons from whose attention to it any good to the community would ensue—two objections there are to the potency of which the author is duly sensible no title had he having the effect of a warrant from authority for the undertaking of it instead of the £  00 ayear or some such matter from all the members of the community taken together—  s from each of such of them as may vouchsafe to purchase it is the remuneration he will receive from it by which remuneration in the case of this work as in the case of almost all others by which he has endeavoured to render his labours useful to his own country and mankind—his profits will to a large amount be left on the minus side two objections there are to its being regarded as worth the   s by those with whose title to receive money out of the taxes mr chancellor of the exchequer is so effectually satisfied by the consideration of the quantity thereof so received by them two objections and each of them an unconquerable one no such remuneration will be offered and were it offered no such remuneration—nor any remuneration other than that which would be afforded by the acknowledgment of the usefulness of the work—would be received but let but a title such as that of privy councillor or were it even no other than that of commissioner with £  00 ayear or some such matter be added to it—oh what a treasure it would be multiply the £  00 by ten—multiplied by the same number would be the value of the work multiply it by a hundred—the value would be multiplied an hundredfold multiply it by  0000 its value would outstrip that of holy writ—and prostrate before it would lie the whole population of the cabinet accompanied and sanctified by his grace of canterbury and all those other paragons of piety whose regard for that same holy writ is manifested by the fineness of their sleeves and the tyrian dye of their servants liveries included are all these propositions in that mathematical axiom which is the keystone of matchless constitution—aptitude is as opulenceasterisks paper xi constitutional code—table of contents as shown by titles of chapter and sections this will be found in its proper place     commentary on mr humphreys real property code by jeremy bentham from the westminster review no xii for october      being a review of observations on the actual state of the english law of real property with the outline of a code by james humphreys esq of lincolns inn barrister  vo murray london     asterisksthe following note was prefixed to the article by the editor of the westminster review— we conclude this number of the review with a supplement in a form unusual in similar periodical publications in the conduct of this work we may lay more than an ordinary claim to the use of the personal plural for it is rare that our opinions are not shared by the whole of our corps and still rarer for any of our articles to reach the public without having previously passed the ordeal of more than one judgment the following composition is published as it came from the hands of the writer its merits are as peculiar as its style and it would be an attempt equally vain as useless to give to such an article a general uniform and to attempt to conceal the individuality of the manner if not of the matter holding as we do the intellectual qualities of mr bentham in the very highest esteem and having during our course invariably maintained the legislative views of this distinguished jurisconsult whom we regard as the great founder of a new and better system it may readily be supposed that we were anxious to ascertain his opinion of a work respecting which from its nature and subject he may be justly considered as the highest authority this opinion has been communicated to us in the following form and we publish it unchanged in the most trifling particular if the weight which mr benthams name must carry when thus united with that of mr humphreys accelerate in the least the progress of that legal reform which is now beginning to be so loudly demanded we shall be pardoned for having deviated in this especial instance from the approved form of conveying the arguments of a reviewer—ed     commentary on humphreys real property code of a work such as this the publication forms an epoch in law certainly i had almost said in history in possession in expectancy in prospect in project—have you any property in the shape thus denominated deep in proportion to the value of it is the interest you have in this work signal and unprecedented your obligation to the author of it lay even property in this shape out of the question still if by those on whose will everything depends his exertions be but duly seconded strong will be the ground you will have for felicitating yourself on the appearance of this star in the horizon of jurisprudence for of all that is valuable to man nothing is there to which directly or indirectly its beneficial influence will not be found to extend it has indeed for its direct object and main subjectmatter that species alone of property to which english lawyers and they alone have so absurdly and uncharacteristically instead of immoveable given the name of real but for everything else to which it is in the nature of law to afford security—security in a proportion as yet unexampled—will if his plan be carried into execution be the effect not less signal is the moral than the intellectual merit manifested by it a young briefless lawyer who on a survey taken of the road to advancement had been fortunate enough to descry this as yet untrodden track and bold enough to enter upon it—this was the sort of character in which in my imagination the author had been pourtrayed to one who in the shape of business had nothing to lose—distinction even if that were all—distinction how barren soever—would of course have its value imagine any one my astonishment when the information reached me that instead of a young adventurer the work had for its author a man advanced in years a conveyancer at the very head of his profession a reformist who by every page written and every hour thus spent in an occupation not less laborious than meritorious had thus been making a sacrifice of pecuniary interest on the altar of public good proportioned to the service he has rendered to all who are not lawyers is the illwill which with few exceptions indeed if man be man he cannot but have called forth in the breasts of all who proportioned to the advancement given to the artandscience see as they cannot but see the defalcation made from the profit of the trade sincere if ever admiration was is that which is here expressed whether it be a blind one what follows will soon show hale with all his merits hale like all lawyers who had gone before him and almost all who have come after him was no reformer nothing better than an expounder everything stated by him was stated as he found it or conceived it to be no inquiries as to what it ought to be in the eyes of lawyers—not to speak of their dupes—that is to say as yet the generality of nonlawyers—the is and the ought to be or as in greek it would be so much better—the το ον and the το δεον from which last ethics has received the more expressive name of deontology were one and indivisible by david hume in his treatise on human nature the universality of this practice of confounding the two so different objects was first held up to view as to blackstone flagrant as were the abominations which at every page he had to wade through must have met his eye—not to extirpate them not to expose them was his endeavour but to cover and preserve them and which of the two quantities has been the greater—the service he has done to the people in the one shape or the disservice in the other—both being to his narrow mind probably alike objects of indifference—is a question easier to propose than solve before this work came out code and codification were rank theory theory and as such objects of sincere horror with as much of pretended contempt as would mix up with it now at length they are become practice contempt has been repulsed by its own image and horror has given way to praise but now to particulars law of landed property being the field—follow eight distinguishable heads under which it is believed may be ranked mr humphreys proposed improvements some more some less explicitly declared   substitution of apt to the present unapt forms of the instruments by which landed   0 property is disposed of—say for shortness of conveyancing instruments or formulæ   melioration and extension of the registration system as applied to conveyances   in the case of freeholds substitution of the generally prevalent to the anomalous courses of descent namely gavelkind and borough english   reduction of copyholds to the state of freeholds   allcomprehensive partition of common lands   substitution of a really existing code to the present compound of a really existing with an imaginary civil or say nonpenal code of law so far as relates to landed property codification this in contradistinction to consolidation   appropriate addition to the judiciary establishment in so far as may be necessary to the giving execution and effect to the substantive part of such proposed code   substitution of an apt to the present unapt system of judicial procedure or say adjective law in so far as necessary to that same end of the separation thus made paramount with a view to practice is in my view of the matter at least the importance probability of adoption and dispatch in execution join in the requisition that of so vast a whole the number of separate parts be maximized   probability of adoption because let the whole plan contain say two parts both of them beneficial to the universal interest but opposed respectively by two distinct particular and thence sinister interests—one of these interests—not by itself but with the addition of the other being strong enough to throw the plan out—one of them may notwithstanding the opposition be carried into effect whereas if the separation had not been made both sinister interests would have stood opposed to it and there would have been an end to it thus stands the matter in the case of two and no more than two mutually unconnected sinister interests but the greater the number of them the smaller will by the supposition be the number of the individuals united in opposition by each and the greater accordingly the number of universally beneficial arrangements possessing a chance of being carried into effect for want of such separation—many are the salutary arrangements which if separately proposed would have found no opponent but which by being conjointly proposed have been lost then as to dispatch if appositely made the further the separation is carried the greater the number of appropriately apt hands or sets of hands among which it may be distributed then again as to appropriate aptitude the further the separation is carried the greater the chance of finding a hand or set of hands in a superior degree apt each of them for one part though they would not respectively have been equally so for any other now for the application i improvement the first substitution of apt to unapt formulæ to this i allot the first rank why because least unlikely to be adopted and most speedily capable of being effected take any one of them for example in so far as for its being employed and carried into effect it requires not any alteration in the existing tenor of the statute law or in the course of judicial practice—it is capable of being carried into practice by the philanthropist himself by whose ingenuity it has been devised and the greater the number of the improvements thus happily circumstanced the more extensive will be the number of them effected by this most simple of all means unhappily by this alone without assistance from statute law not very extensive it is feared can be the effect produced at any rate for each distinguishable improvement the less the assistance needed from that so difficultymoved machinery the better the chance of the load of evil in all shapes with which the instruments in question are oppressed—lengthiness to wit thence unintelligibility expensiveness and dilatoriness—of all this evil the main efficient causes are shown to be composed of the work given to needless and useless trustees in whom no confidence is reposed and the addition of the blind agency of judiciary functionaries to the mental labour of professional draughtsmen in the fabrication of the mendacious and pickpocket instruments rendered necessary under the name of fines and recoveries true it is—this mass of abuse could not be cleared away by any other hand than that of parliament but by that of any professional draughtsman not inconsiderable are the improvements that may be introduced the endless sentences at present in use may be broken down and reduced to the scantling of those employed on the like occasions in every other country and on all other occasions in all countries—for the purpose of enabling the most unpractised eye to see its way clearly over the present labyrinth and take repose wherever it found need—the several topics distinguishable in those huge masses of matter which in the present practice are compressed together into the compass of one sentence may be presented to view by their already universally known denominations the matter belonging to each such topic may be formed into a separate sentence and to each such sentence to save the need of repeating it in terminis or by a little less lengthy general description a numerical appellative may be allotted of the general indication thus given exemplification and thence     it is hoped elucidation will be seen in the course of the ensuing pages as to the clearing the system of the other more highly morbid symptoms—i am but too sensible how far even with these additions his plan of operation would fall short of meeting the disorder with anything like an allsufficient remedy still however i see in it the least unpromising of all his generous enterprises in respect of the force of the sinister interests it would have to encounter it stands less unfavourably circumstanced than any other by rendering conveyances and the contracts embodied in them somewhat less unintelligible to parties and other interessees—it would lessen the mass of suffering in the shape of disputes and disappointments and in so far lessen the abundance of the lawyers harvest it would reduce in some degree the profit of the conveyancers company—and of the firm of eldon and co in chancery and the house of lords but it would not as any system of procedure capable of fulfilling its professed end would go to the blowing up the manufactory of factitious litigation at one explosion—and at the first proposal of it call up in defence of matchless constitution that judiciary system by which to ninetynine hundredths of the people access is denied to so much as a chance for justice ii improvement the second giving efficacy and extension to registration for this purpose i shall have to treat our artist with a sight of an instrument a fruit of female ingenuity suited to this one of his beneficent purposes in a degree beyond what he can have had any conception of iii improvement the third abolition of the anomalous courses of descent absolutely speaking yes but comparatively speaking no great good seems here to be expected on the other hand no great resistance to be apprehended true it is that this improvement the subjectmatter of it being an insulated one is in its nature capable of being carried into effect by itself but setting aside the supposition of an allcomprehensive code—or at any rate an allcomprehensive property code—the benefit produced by it would be comparatively inconsiderable its principle if not only one being that which it would have in the character of an instrument of simplification iv improvement the fourth reduction of copyholds to the state of freeholds highly beneficial this but at the same time unavoidably operose and tedious the sooner indeed it were begun the better but in no other shape need or should the commencement of the course of improvement wait either for the consummation or the commencement of it pride would set in array against it the aristocracy of the country in their character of lords of manors pecuniary interest the lawyerclass in the character of stewards not but that in the longrun pecuniary compensation ab intrà with or without a little of ditto ab extrà—at the expense of the whole community to whom the whole rule of action would thereby be rendered so much the more accessible—might peradventure gain the votes of the one and quiet the alarms and clamours of the other v improvement the fifth partition of common lands to a certain extent this improvement is comprised in that which consists in the conversion of copyholds into freeholds to a certain other extent that is to say in so far as the land is already in a state of freehold—or being copyhold can be divided into separate parcels leaving the manorial rights in other respects untouched—it will require the arrangements for the effectuation of which the general inclosure act was intended and the several particular inclosure acts have been and continue to be intended as to this matter true it is that the greater the degree in which the provisions of the particular acts can be generalized and those of the general act improved upon of course so much the better and propositions for this purpose may of course be expected from the ingenuity experience and public spirit of mr humphreys but in addition to those efficient causes others of a peculiar nature and not quite so prompt in growth are required that is to say capital in proportionate quantity—capital in the appropriate hands—and a state of things such as will admit of the giving to it the direction in question to advantage now as to capital it cannot be made to accumulate in or find its way into these same hands with quite so much celerity as may be given to the operation of drawing up an act of parliament and a state of things which affords probability to the opening of the trade in corn to foreign cultivators is but little favourable to increase in the homeproduction of it not that by these circumstances any objection is opposed to that part of our learned reformists plan which consists in the procurement of the appropriate mass of information subservient to these same purposes but of that in its place vi vii viii improvement sixth seventh and eighth—codification substitution of really existing law to fictitious substitution of an apt to an unapt judiciary establishment and system of procedure as to these three parts in conjunction there will be more or less to say before this article is at a close now for a trespass on his patience the time is come when the scalpel must be set to work state of it much rougher than the anatomist could have wished but neither time nor space admit of that smoothness which would otherwise have been endeavoured to be given to it more than fifty     years ago i took it up for the first time with blackstone lying on the table the subject being so different it is with affections correspondently different and proportionable reluctance that i take it in hand now in blackstone every abuse has its varnish or its apology in humphreys none should the liberties now taken have any such effect as that of calling forth like for like my gratitude will not be less sincere than my admiration is now observations applying to all three formulæ viewed together are the following— i emendandum the first subjectmatter length of each one of the three pattern instruments and symmetry as between the three description of the subjectmatter of disposition insufficient and thence at the same time by the whole amount redundant and useless of the subjectmatter of a sale the number of diversifications being practically speaking infinite—no one can with propriety and safety be taken for and thence copied as the representative of any other much less of all others in each instance what should be given is—in the body of the instrument a generic designation as short as possible so as to answer the purpose in the schedule a sort of appendage referred to but not exhibited in the authors draught a description the particulars of which must in the nature of the case be all of them individual of a building for example the generic description will of course be of one sort of a piece of land of an altogether different sort as to the individual description—for the purpose here in question in addition to other purposes all habitations should be numbered for the process of enumeration an allcomprehensive plan may be seen in my parliamentary reform bill of a piece of land on which there is no building the description of the site will be given by giving the name of the nearest road with the several names of the several fields of which it is composed in respect of the piece of land there can be no difficulty since in fact and of necessity in whichever way held whether in commonalty or in severalty every field has its name of the compound subjectmatters composed of buildings with land annexed the mode of description is rendered familiar to everybody by those printed papers of particulars which are employed on the occasion of sales whether made by auction or by hand behold here then already drawn though by an intrusive hand the proper contents of the schedule say rather the only proper for what other description of the subjectmatter can be so proper for a deed of sale as the very one to which by the agreement to purchase the purchaser had given his assent but the knot of lawyers must be paid—paid for doing in not improbably a bad manner what has been already done in the best if for appropriate accuracy the scientific eye affords a promise of being of use and i do not say but that in some instances so it may be the proper time for its operation is antecedent not subsequent to the adjustment of the subjectmatter of the conveyance—the paper of particulars if this be so useless then is every syllable occupied in individualizing the subjectmatter in the body of the deed behold now the quantity of surplusage thus employed employed in giving to conception difficulty and to expense increase in the deed of sale lines    whereof surplusage in this form   in the mortgagedeed lines    whereof surplusage in this form    in the marriagesettlement deed lines    surplusage in this form    lines in all three together     whereof surplusage in this besides other forms    now as to length of sentences separately considered the more lengthy the sentence the greater the fatigue of him whose misfortune it is to be subjected on one account or other to the obligation of reading it and lodging the contents in his mind when the fatigue rises to a certain pitch—such is the readers anxiety to reach the end of his labour—that for want of a resting place he slides over the topics without dwelling upon any of them the length of time necessary to the impregnating his mind with an adequate conception of it on the other hand let it be broken down into its several distinguishable topics—so many topics so many sentences so many sentences so many restingplaces and whatsoever topic requires particular consideration will be considered at full leisure on time wasted in disentangling it from the rest what is more no danger of the draughtsmans own mind losing itself in the mizmaze this apprehension—is it a fanciful one in proof of its wellgroundedness i call two witnesses one of them our learned reformist himself the vast reduction made by him in the extent of the labyrinth notwithstanding the other no less a personage than a learned lord the lord advocate of scotland   enter first our learned author—evidence of bewilderedness an offence against the laws of priscian locus delicti family settlement deed—corpus delicti as the romanists say the words convey charge and settle the loves of the parts of speech are no secret to any boy who in any one of the royal schools has been initiated in the gymnastic exercise of which a poetical grammar is the instrument here so it is that to enable them to beget a meaning the three amorous verbs require each of them in the shape of a preposition a different mate convey to charge with settle on now then     as to the fate of these same lovers after a long and adventureful period of unsatisfied desire burning in one instance through a course of not fewer than    out of the    lines convey is at last made happy in the embraces of his dear to charge in the arms of with not so with the luckless settle in vain has the wood been hunted over for a mate for him no such comfort for him is to be found and he dies childless not that miss campbell for whom the benefit attached to the burthen conveyed by the verb charge is intended—is at the end of the story disappointed of it for in a recess of the wood candour requires the confession the preposition to steps in at last steps in a second time to her assistance and her two hundred ayear pinmoney and five hundred ayear jointure form the result   enter now lord advocate—if a warrant—from practice power and dignity in high situations—can afford consolation under the imputation of a grammatical peccadillo the learned delinquent needs not be inconsolable opening the house of commons folio entituled return parochial education scotland order for printing   th february and   st may      you will find it written in page   letter from the lord advocate of scotland to henry hobhouse esq follows here what is relevant to the present purpose what is not relevant being eliminated i had the honour to receive your letter stating that the king having been pleased to comply with an humble address for the letterpress is thus italicized an account showing then follows the matter of a folio page and desiring mark here the king instead of commanding—oh treason desiring—deprived of all command and reduced to desire desiring that i would take the necessary steps for procuring c and transmit c that it might c previous to being laid before the house of commons  well—the king having been pleased what then nothing for at the word commons ends the paragraph closed by a fullstop then comes the next beginning with i beg leave to state that in obedience to the above order it had occurred to me and so forth now as to the effect produced on the faculties of the preeminently learned composer by the folio page—the unbegun and unended sentence which lest the like effect should be produced on the mind of the reader is here omitted—such is its narcotic quality that while dragging on with it he falls asleep and in the course of his sleep dreams of a certain order to which he is rendering obedience rubbing his eyes—the above order cries he—order what order look the whole page through no such thing as an order will you find ii emendandum the second in the three patterns taken together another feature of redundance and the redundance pregnant with error on the part of learners of the particulars in question the tenor different in each species of deed yet whatever is capable of being taken for the subjectmatter of a marriage settlement is alike capable of being taken for the subjectmatter of a sale or a mortgage evil effects three   error liable to be produced in the minds of learners in supposing the general necessity of the difference exhibited in the individual case   and   perplexity and waste of labour in examining the three to ascertain whether such necessity has place sharers in these dangers nonlawyers all lawstudents as many and tyrolawyers not a few note that on the authors own plan—between the two species of dispositions there are but two points of difference one is—that to which expression is given by the substitution of the word charge in the deed of mortgage to the word sell in the deed of sale the other regards the mode and result of the repayment to be made of the money lent had the exhibition been thus confined to the points of difference would not the aid given to conception have been rather more effectual of needless diversity another bad effect is—the distracting the attention from the needful eadem natura eadem nomenclatura same the ideas same the words should be in contemplation of the above inconvenveniences this rule has been ventured to be delivered elsewhere if it be worth remembering the jingle in the latin the metre in the english may have their use in composition for ordinary purposes the opposite propensity is in these days prevalent when the import meant to be conveyed is the same to find for each occasion a different expression is the task the writer sets himself harmless when clear and muddy right and wrong are matters of indifference not altogether so in legal instruments on which every thing that is dear to man depends iii emendandum the third sentences more lengthy than necessary lengthiness of the whole of a discourse is one thing lengthiness of these its component parts another of the lengthiness of the whole consequences such as have just been seen are the result lengthiness of the parts separately considered is the imperfection now more particularly meant to be brought to view by the manner of printing it looks as if the reduction of the apparent superadded to that of the real length of the whole had been among the objects of our learned reformists ambition as to paragraphs in no one of the three instruments does the letterpress exhibit the appearance of more than one true as to sentences in the deed of sale you might if     hard pushed make any number from one to five according as you pointed the paragraph though by the punctuation one only is there exhibited but in the mortgage deed which in the length of the whole is much the same as that of the other you cannot make more than one as to the marriagesettlement deed not a single resting place was i able to find till i came to the word allen in the second page line    quantity of matter travelled through these    lines added to the    lines in page the first—total quantity fifty lines—more than half of the whole with its three full pages and its    lines here at length it is—that in breach as it should seem of his original plan as indicated by the letterpress our learned draughtsman—so completely had he run himself out of breath—has in compassion for self and readers though it should seem not without reluctance put down a full stop in page   line    having a proviso to put in he of necessity begins a fresh sentence but as if to make us believe that no addition is thereby made to the number of the sentences he has done by us pardon the expression rather unfairly putting instead of a period no more than a comma at the close of it so again when he comes to line    of this same third page he plays us a similar trick and as if the better to disguise it—at the commencement of this last proviso he omits the distinctive type employed for the assistance of the eye at the commencement of the first thus it is that after so much as has been done by our learned reformist in the way of selfpurification—purification of his style from the malady of lengthiness the leprosy of lawyercraft still that which has been seen has as yet cleaved to it to complete the purification a little sprinkling such as is here offered of the cleansing water remains wanting to it iv emendandum the fourth indication of topics none horrific of course to learned eyes will be so flagrant an innovation as the one the absence of which is thus audaciously made a matter of charge laygents however—and for them alone am i of counsel—laygents will i flatter myself see a convenience in it besides the clearness and promptitude it gives to conception it performs the function of a macadamizing hammer in breaking down the aggregate mass so many topics so many denominations so many denominations so many sentences so much as to lengthiness on the part of the discourse now as to the consequences of it on the part of the readers for my own part exlearned as i am and therefore if ever no longer learned—in the law in general and in conveyancing law in particular never learned at all till i got this smattering at the feet of my gamaliel—for my own part i confess my perplexity to have been extreme as i fear will by blunders in i know not what number be but too amply testified nor can i for i am a little out of humour and revenge is sweet nor can i i say altogether suppress my surprise that in this perplexity i have had a sharer in my learned master himself—witness inter alia the same exception thrice imbedded twice repeated at the expense of four lines out of the   † in this one principal paragraph apropos of these same exception clauses i may perhaps take the liberty of submitting to his consideration the course which anybody may take for evolving and which i always take for avoiding such involvements but this if anywhere must be in another place at any rate examples in abundance may be seen in official aptitude maximized c just issuing from the press at the present writing i must not neglect my clients least of all my fair one the heroine of the piece for whose interest—how illsoever our learned reformist may think of me for the preference—i cannot help feeling rather more solicitude than for his—she having so much more at stake and in this her approaching condition having so many ladies fair to share with her in the exigencies belonging to it no i will not think so meanly of her understanding as not to suppose that—how happy soever in her mrs allen state—it might not on some occasion or other occur to her in her anxiety for the dear little ones to cast an eye over this her magna charta and in its pages as in a horoscope seek to read their fate this being supposed—it cannot i think but be more or less matter of accommodation to her to find in those same pages a possibility of understanding it this accommodation in so far as time and space would allow it has in the way that has been seen—and will in another way be more particularly seen—been my humble endeavour to supply her with to render perceptible to sense the degree of improvement introduced by him in respect of lengthiness the ingenuity of my learned master has with happy effect exhibited in parallel pages his proposed instruments framed upon his reduced scale—placing them by the side of those which he found in use by the long succession of vacancies the attention of the reader is in every two pages drawn anew to the difference vacancies in the deed of sale  0 in the mortgage deed  0 in the marriage settlement    in the mind of his adventurous pupil ambition not altogether unmixed with a dash of envy and jealousy has inspired a similar course the dwarf upon the giants shoulders is an emblem which the temerity will be apt to present to     recollection in the minds of readers how small the utmost ulterior reduction i have been able to effect will be obvious to every eye by the particular type employed in the reprint here given of authors draught indication is given of most of the words regarded as capable of being eliminated without prejudice either to intelligibility or to certainty supposing the form exhibited in the reviewers draught substituted in the reviewers draught a further liberty is taken by the insertion of a few additional topics which for the reasons given in the notes afforded a prospect of being of use by a correspondent sign these also are

daughters to her son if but one if sons more than one to the eldest   vii   money provision for children not taking part in the estate say the moneytakers apportioner the father in this provision no child having part in the estate has any part having the whole includes the having a part       sum total at his disposal five thousand pounds charged on the estate as per no  0      share of each whatsoever he appoints the whole any part or no part      by deed he may bind himself to any such child or children or to any person on behalf of any such child or children to charge the estate with any sum not exceeding the total charge as per no         so likewise by last will in so far as is consistent with what he has done by deed      no money advanced in his lifetime to or for the benefit of any such child whether in the way of income or in the way of capital—will unless by deed expressly so declared to be be understood to be designed to be deducted out of the apportionment made as per nos             0 no charge endeavoured to be made by him on the estate will have effect till after this settlement charge as per no    has been carried into effect      to the receipt of any share of the portionmoney he may annex all such conditions not prohibited by law as he thinks fit      maintenance for this purpose upon the principal of any such childs portion he may pay or direct to be paid—to such child or to any person on account of such child—interest at any rate mentioned by him for any length of time up to full age or marriage at which time the principal or what remains of it will be to be paid  0       for any payment as per nos    or    he may assign any time he pleases      of the portionmoney obtained under this settlement—whatsoever part if any remains undisposed of by the father is to be divided among the children and the descendants if any of the children in equal portions after the several manners mentioned in nos               viii   subject to fathers

commissioners appointed under letters patent of date the  th june      to inquire into the law of england respecting real property and first printed in the appendix to their third report ordered by the house of commons to be printed   th may      gentlemen—  by your circular dated the  th and  th of august      and addressed to various persons of whom   then was and now continue to be one you were pleased to call for suggestions on the subject of registration as applied to mens titles to the subjectmatters of the sort of property termed in english law real property the present paper is written and presented to you in obedience to that call   by your letter of the   th of august      addressed to myself alone in answer to mine to you of the   th of that same month you were pleased to honour me with an assurance in these words they meaning you the said commissioners have no hesitation in saying that they should think it their duty to include whatever may proceed from him meaning myself in any appendix to the report which they may hereafter make to his majesty on this assurance the present communication places its reliance   the observations here submitted have for their immediate appropriate and by you expressly authorized subjectmatter the plan proposed for the institution in question by yourselves but by this as by any other proposal which is transmitted to any person for examination reference if not expressed at any rate implied is made or authorized to be made to some determinate set of notions considered as constituting a standard of propriety—in a word to some principle or set of principles i shall therefore in so far as my own conception of my competence extends take the preliminary liberty of submitting to you the leading features of the sort of plan which to myself presents itself as most eligible prefaced by a short exposition of the principles from which they emanated and to which they look for their support   superior utility and novelty in these i behold two qualities the union of which is indispensably necessary to constitute a sufficient warrant for any such communication as that in question yes novelty for in the idea of absence of novelty is included absence of usefulness presence of uselessness so far is novelty when taken by itself and not alleged to have inaptitude for its accompaniment—so far i say is it from constituting any reasonable ground of objection to a plan for this or any other purpose   if this be true what shall we say—what shall we think—of those by whom without controverting the utility of a proposed plan be it what it may the alleged novelty is held up to view in the character of a ground for the rejection of it—of those in a word by whom the word innovation is employed as a token of disapprobation and an instrument of censure   as to my own competence i consider it and accordingly speak of it as having certain defined and precise limits and on the outside of those limits lies all information as to all such matters of fact the knowledge of which is not capable of being possessed by an individual not actually engaged in the practice of the profession which has for the subjectmatter of its exercise the subjectmatter of the commission in virtue of which you have been pleased to make this call upon me whatsoever therefore i shall venture to propose you will understand as calling upon you for amendment as far as requisite amendment in every one of its three shapes—subtraction addition and substitution       on this occasion the part which i take in the business will be seen to confine itself to the giving a comparatively small number of suggestions by the adoption of which if and in so far as my view of the matter is correct it would be put into a new and that the most appropriate conceivable form   in and by various parts of my publications i stand pledged to the public never to propose or advocate—never to oppose and combat—any law or institution actually established or proposed to be established without attaching to it an accompaniment composed of reasons meaning by reasons considerations having for their object the showing in what manner immediately or through the medium of a chain of any length of causes and effects the arrangement proposed presents itself as likely to give a net increase to the happiness of the person or persons in question that is to say to the balance on the side of pleasure after deduction made of the quantity of pain experienced during the period in question as on all other occasions so on this by this engagement i regard myself as bound   in one of those same publications in particular the subjectmatter of consideration comprehends the entire aggregate of all the several sorts of functionaries of which the official establishment of any country is or in the nature of things can be composed those here in question are consequently comprised and throughout that work may be seen a specimen of the abovementioned accompaniment namely in the instance of every article which has for a heading the word ratiocinative the work i am alluding to is that which has for its title constitutional code for the use of all nations and all governments professing liberal opinions  0 so much as to my plan now gentlemen as to yours considered in like manner with reference to reasons your plan is before the public with all due deference what i have to propose is a somewhat different one your reports on the subject lie before me i look in them for reasons i find in them no such thing a bill moved for in pursuance of those same reports has been before the public i look in it for reasons neither in that same proposed law do i find any such thing as in the one instrument so in the other stat pro ratione voluntas as for me—my will not having any chance for the being clothed and armed with legal power—the power of reason if i can find any on my side is my sole resource stat pro voluntate ratio    is it even unprecedented this same accompaniment look to westminster hall in westminster hall when in a judicatory a judge and in particular a chiefjustice bears his part in the making of the sort of decision called a judgment and for a ground of that same judgment delivers his opinion in this case if the importance of the matter presents itself to him as calling for any further support he fails not to deliver his reasons    again when from the judgment of one judicatory a party makes his appeal to another judicatory in this case also a man submits to the superior authority in question his reasons    now then gentlemen—in your quality of learned gentlemen let me ask you—if in the business of judicature a support of this kind is needful how much stronger is not the need of it that has place in the business of legislation—that business to the importance of which the extent of the consequences considered the importance of the business of judicature is but as number one to infinity    not altogether insensible to this demand has the legislature of this country been even in its hitherto corrupted state at the commencement of a statute something in the guise of reason has been customarily and regularly served out served out yes but of what sort of a sort such as a bridoison in the drama of figaro or the old woman in the history of little redridinghood or a legislator in the land of gotham might have been proud of    whereas it is expedient—with these four words commences the train of surplusage of which under matchless constitution the greatest part of an act of parliament is so regularly composed of these words is composed the whole of that portion of matter in which the draughtsman places his trust in the character of a justification for the exercise made by him of that authority of which he is the organ when laying about him and scattering broadcast the seeds of good and evil with so little expense in the shape of thought    now then as to the particular bill above alluded to in that same bill on looking into it for reasons though i cannot find any such thing yet what i do find is the justnamed something which seems intended to serve instead of reasons it is composed of those same four words—whereas it is expedient it is that same vox et præterea nihil i speak thus freely because if in that same dictum there be anything of fatuity or if you please of silliness and in my view of the matter that there is in abundance you gentlemen are not any of you chargeable with it how little soever in accordance with reason this phrase it cannot be denied is most perfectly in accordance with precedent without it this or that high functionary whose name official and personal sooner or later shall and will be made publicly known—inasmuch as his remuneration has been made to rise in proportion as the rule of action has by its immensity and obscurity and richness in surplusage been made to increase in inaptitude     for its professed purpose—this selfauthorized and selfpaid comptroller of the authority of the king in parliament this secret imposer of taxes for his own benefit might find the bill incomplete and as such find himself obliged to throw it overboard    houses honourable and right honourable have each of them its standing orders they have in common this one standing reason it is as good for one thing as another for one proposed enactment as for another in this its aptitude however there is nothing of peculiarity nothing but what might be shared with it by any other four words drawn in the way of lottery out of a dictionary    such is the sort of embellishment belonging to a bill—meaning a future contingent statute of a piece with it—in exact keeping with it—are in a speech the two locutions—contrary to every principle of justice and contrary to the first principles of justice bearing upon the face of them the marks of the abovementioned country of gotham as the country from which these commodities were all of them imported    but of this lastmentioned embellishment the ground to which it is suited and on which it is commonly embroidered being not a bill but a speech i find not any exemplification in the authoritative article of piecegoods i have been speaking of only therefore for elucidation—or if you please for illustration—not for justification is the mention made which i have ventured thus to make of it  0 happily a new order of things is at length born nonsense will not for ever sit on the throne of common sense    reasons principles ends means rules maxims axioms positions propositions on the present occasion had i to do that which on some future occasion i may not impossibly have to do—namely in my address to you to take for the subjectmatter of it the whole of the field of real property—in that case in the character of principles i might have to submit to your consideration no fewer than sevenandtwenty words or sets of words which in the form of a tree composed of a trunk with branches and subbranches called by logicians in former days the arbor porphyrum lie at this moment before my view and with them would come the whole cortége as the french say of the genera generalissima abovementioned for wheresoever i tread my wish and endeavour is to find and if i do not find to make my foundation sure happily for us all on the present occasion not more than two of these principles will it be necessary for me to trouble you with with the addition of a small quantity of matter under the head of reasons and that of ends and means and a few preparatory propositions which present themselves to my view as being relevant conclusive and incontestable    these principles are—  the greatest happiness principle or say the happinessmaximizing principle and   the disappointmentminimizing or say disappointmentpreventing or say nondisappointmentprinciple yes verily the disappointmentminimizing principle nay good gentlemen do not be horrified by it for here not only on sure ground do i tread but as you will see on authoritative ground on ground which you will find yourselves estopped from denying to be authoritative    as to my reasons what i cannot but apprehend is that by the mention thus and here made of them may be called to the minds of some of you the image of the old steward in addisons drama of the haunted house who after speaking of reasons and of many reasons goes on to say at present i shall mention only seven but for this i must take my chance    now for my authority truly gratifying it is to me on this occasion to find in accordance with this notion of mine about disappointment the opinion as proved by the practice of a distinguished member of your own body it preserves in the completest manner from the reproach cast by the word theoretical this same disappointmentminimizing principle    in the so admirably instructive and useful work of mr tyrrell intituled suggestions sent to the commissioners appointed to inquire into the laws of real property i have the satisfaction of seeing this same principle three several times referred to as the ground of the arrangements which he recommends i in page    —the expense uncertainty and disappointment which usually attend suits for longforgotten claims render them says he a source of more injury than benefit to the church    ii in page    —tithes under a descent says he can never be considered secure until the right of the devisee has been barred and a few cases of hardship to disappointed devisees are not continues he of so much importance as the advantage—the safe alienation of property thus far mr tyrrell    and if such is the inferiority of the importance of these few cases of hardship to disappointed devisees whence comes this same inferiority—whence comes it i ask but from this namely that in the cases in which by the result the alienation has been shown to be unsafe disappointment has been produced by that same result and that these cases having been more numerous than those others the sum of the pain that has thereby been produced in these lastmentioned cases   0 is greater than that which has been produced in the firstmentioned cases    iii lastly in page    —speaking of of the wording of a certain devise the particulars of which are not material to this purpose he gives as the reason of the construction or as a nonlawyer might say the interpretation he recommends this—namely that if no gift had been made to the owner of the property the person to whom it was devised must he says have been disappointed meaning evidently that on the supposition that if in the sort of case in question the disposition made of the property in question by the judge is that which he mr tyrrell recommends—on that supposition in the breast of the party in whose disfavour that same disposition operated either no such pain at all would be produced or if any pecuniary circumstances being supposed to be on both sides equal the pain would not be so great as in the contrary case    i come now to speak of ends and means ends the attainment of which ought to be kept in view and aimed at on the occasion of whatever arrangements come to be taken for the establishment of the proposed institution and are accordingly aimed at in the suggestions which here follow these ends are distinguishable into two—namely the primary and the secondary  0 first as to the primary end the evil against which a remedy is hereby endeavoured to be applied consists in the unexpected loss of money or moneys worth the primary end aimed at is—the prevention of this loss    then as to the secondary end on the occasion and for the purpose of the application of this remedy a certain series of operations or as among lawyers the phrase is a certain course of procedure is necessary on which occasion evil to a greater or less amount in the several shapes of delay expense and vexation cannot but have place in the remedy we behold a benefit in this lastmentioned evil we behold a burthen attached to that same benefit and what remains after subtraction of the amount of the burthen will be the amount or say clear value of the benefit and the institution having for its primary end the conferring on the individuals interested that same benefit the minimization of this same burthen is that which it has for its secondary end    just so is it in the case where instead of a registeroffice the scene lies in a court of justice the benefit sought is a remedy against wrong and this is what that institution has for its primary end the attached burthen consists here also of evil in these same several shapes of delay expense and vexation and the minimization of the evil in these its several shapes has been considered and spoken of as that which the institution of a court of justice with its course of procedure has for its secondary end    on examination made into the manner in which these two ends—the primary and the secondary—may most effectually be attained namely by the maximization of aptitude on the part of the matériel as well as the personnel to borrow a phrase from the war department—that is to say the building or buildings and its or their official inhabitants—together with the minimization of the expense—my eyes have fixed upon seven distinguishable objects in the character of means each of them for the attainment of one or both of these two ends and within the field of each of these seven objects means of a more particular nature which with reference to them may be styled means of effectuation and which i shall accordingly designate by such their proper name    objects and means of effectuation taken together thinking that to this or that one of you gentlemen it may perhaps be matter of convenience to have them upon occasion visible all of them at one and the same glance i have given expression to the tout ensemble of them on the same side of a leaf of paper in and by a table which will almost immediately present itself to your view    of the evil the prevention of which constitutes the primary end five different modifications may be distinguished each liable to fall on a correspondent description or class of persons the diversity in the description of these same modifications of the evil will be seen to have for its cause a correspondent diversity in the relative situations of the classes of persons who stand opposed to it    in all five cases the loss with the suffering consequent upon it has for its efficient cause the badness of the title to the subjectmatter of property in question in some one of these same cases the suffering has for its immediate cause the actual loss of an immovable subjectmatter of property or some interest therein in others loss in the shape of money in others again that which the suffering has for its immediate cause is that which may with more propriety be considered as nonacquisition of profit or say benefit than positive loss or say burthen    here then in the aggregate are so many cases of suffering which when regarded separately may be thus described i case the first—sufferer a person who is in possession or in fixt expectancy of a subjectmatter of real property or of an interest therein the title to which for want of some piece of evidence some saving knowledge which a registration office would have taken charge of and rendered accessible to all persons interested turns out to be bad    ii case the second—sufferer a person who having paid money for the purchase     of a subjectmatter of real property or of an interest therein fails of receiving it he who in return for the money has undertaken to cause him to receive it finding himself rendered by the badness of his title to it unable so to do say in six words a purchaser on a bad title    iii case the third—sufferer a person who having paid money on the security of a subjectmatter of real property or interest therein in such sort that if the money with the interest due upon it fails of being put into his hands on or before a certain point of time the thing itself or money to be raised by the sale of it as above will be put into those same hands is by that same cause prevented from so receiving it say in six words a lender on a bad title  0 iv case the fourth—sufferer a wouldbe seller with a bad title prevented from becoming actual seller of it by the badness of his title to it    v case the fifth—sufferer a wouldbe purchaser if prevented from becoming actual purchaser by the badness of the wouldbe sellers title in these two last cases as well as in the three first suffering has place and that suffering has disappointment for its cause but in these same cases the nature and the immediate cause of the evil are too diversified miscellaneous and uncertain to admit of any more particular description here    now for the abovementioned string of preparatory propositions i the institution for the existence and organization of which you are occupied in making preparation consists of a building or set of buildings to be employed in the character of a registeroffice or set of registeroffices together with an official establishment for the carrying on the business by the performance of which the benefit contemplated is designed to be conferred on the several persons interested    ii this benefit consists in the preserving from deperition and keeping in a state of accessibility to all persons lawfully interested a certain class of written instruments or say documents which have been framed for the purpose of affording upon occasion sufficient evidence of mens right and title to property of a certain description distinguished by the name of real property    iii of this benefit the principal if not the only intrinsically valuable but at any rate abundantly sufficient use consists in the preserving the several proprietors and other persons respectively interested from the pain of disappointment namely that pain or say that uneasiness which a man experiences when without his consent any thing valuable which he has been in the habit of looking to as his own ceases so to be looked upon by him which said uneasiness has not place in the mind of any person who has not been in that same habit or state of mind in relation to that same thing blessed is he that expecteth not for he shall not be disappointed says an addition proposed to be made to the beatitudes if i misrecollect not by dean swift    iv of these two parts of the institution neither can be brought into or kept in existence and applied to use without a quantity more or less considerable of expense in the shape of money    v this money is not obtainable but by means of taxes    vi in so far as taxes are imposed money is taken from persons without their consent and thereby in their minds a quantity more or less considerable of pain produced    vii as to aptitude the more complete the relative aptitude of the several persons so employed relation had to their respective official operations the better so likewise of the dead stock    viii to come back to the expense that that and aptitude may be considered in conjunction the less the expense employed in the purchase of their respective services so long as that aptitude is not thereby diminished as well as in the provision made of the dead stock the better  0 ix for giving in the most concise and easilyremembered form in the compass of seven words expression to both these so intimatelyconnected positions existence has been given to this one rule—let official aptitude be maximized expense minimized now comes the promised table of objects and means of effectuation i object the first—expense minimized—proposed means of effectuation these—   building for reception of the stock one and no more than one   assistant registrars or say registrar deputes superfluous none   of assistant registrars or say registrars depute the salaries minimized by competition and see object iii   of registrar deputes during the probationary year the service gratuitous   for an object of reference map of the whole territory and see object v   for exemplars of the documents the manifold mode of writing employed and see object vi ii object the second—delay minimized—delay of the service rendered to the suitors—means of effectuation these—   attendance uninterrupted—adequate to all demands   profit to functionaries from delay none in any shape iii object the third—aptitude of the     several functionaries maximized—means of effectuation these—   sinister interest excluded by the complete substitution of salary to fees branch of appropriate aptitude thereby secured the moral   probationership antecedently to definitive location branches of aptitude thereby secured the intellectual and active   securities for appropriate aptitude in all its branches numerous and effectual as will be seen beyond all example iv object the fourth—aptitude of the machinery maximized—means of effectuation these—   the arrangements regarded by anticipation as being best adapted having been appointed by parliament head registrar he being divested of all sinister interest empowered to make eventually effective amendments by the light of experience subject to disallowance by king or either house v object the fifth—security for the efficiency of this same process of registration maximized—means of effectuation these—   object of reference in the description given of the parcels an allcomprehensive map of the whole territory as per object i exclusive of maps of districts vi object the sixth—extent of the application made of this same remedy maximized—means of effectuation these—   subjectmatters of property moveable excepted all admitted copyholds leaseholds and incorporeal thence in correspondent number the proprietors   fees exacted or permitted none thence the relatively unopulent not excluded from the benefit of the remedy   the manifold mode of writing employed as per object i thence expense in remuneration of skilled labour saved to suitors and the number of exemplars furnished rendered correspondent to the demand vii object the seventh—minimization of the burthen with which the benefit is clogged—means of effectuation these—   fees as above none see objects i and vi   means of communication for documents and other writings the letterpost thence expense of separate communication through skilled labour saved in relation to these several means of effectuation now follow the promised explanatory and justificative matters in detail now then for these several objects and means of effectuation in detail i first object to be accomplished—the expense minimized—means of effectuation these—   means the first—building for the lodgment of the whole stock—materiel and personnel as the phrase is in french together—one and no more than one already if i do not misunderstand the matter your leaning gentlemen is strongly in favour of this maximum of simplicity lest however after all the determination should not otherwise be on that side i will take the liberty of submitting to your consideration an experiment which in days of yore it fell into my way to make in the year      or thereabouts the year is not material pitt the second formed a plan and brought in a bill accordingly for making provision for the whole pauper population of england by means of a workhouse under particular management in every parish or small union of parishes i took this plan in hand and demonstrated that it would not do for that besides other objections the difference in respect of the quantity of capital necessary between that plan and one that i pointed out would not be less than fifteen unillions with all his faults—such was the candour and magnanimity of that god of so many idolatries—he gave up his own plan took to mine and a day was appointed for settling the details of it when it was crushed by a veto from on high the details of which belong not to the present purpose the demonstration in question may be seen in four successive articles of arthur youngs annals of agriculture put together the sheets some copies of which he presented to me constituted a moderatesized  vo volume which i propose ere long to reprint under the title of pauper management prefaced by a history of the abovealludedto catastrophe it will form part and parcel of the history of the war carried on for not less than threeandtwenty years between george the third of blessed memory and one of his rebellious subjects i mention thus much gentlemen lest when you read of the capital of fifteen millions left out of his calculation by the heavenborn minister you should suspect that while speaking of it i was in a dream i present to view this incident the rather because in the calculation of the expenses projectors however talented are but too apt to overlook this or that item which when brought to light appears to such a degree obvious that the omission of it becomes a source of no small surprise thus again when the late mr james humphreys came out with his plan for an inquiry into the subject of real property the expense of that part of it which had for its object the obtaining no more than one portion of the information requisite would have amounted to between four and five hundred thousand pounds in a paper of mine in the westminster review is shown how the like information might be because it had been obtained for next to no expense so again when mr windsor projector of the gas light system came out with his proposal an expense the mention of which was not to be     found in them was that of the pipes by which this so useful species of air is conducted to its several destinations   means of minimization of expense the second—minimization of the number of the paid functionaries employed minimization of the number of the functionaries employed methinks i hear the draughtsman and the supporters of the existing bill exclaiming—minimization of this part of the expense is that then the utmost that your plan does or so much as professes to do ours exonerates the public of it altogether it lays the burthen on the shoulders of individuals and these the only ones on whom it ought to press that is to say those by whom the accompanying benefit is enjoyed answer   applied to the institution in question this measure of economy has for its ground the assumption that the institution is of no use for in no inconsiderable proportion those persons in whose instance the demand for the benefit has place are those who have not wherewithal to pay for it and if for the good of the whole community taken in the aggregate it be desirable that for the sake of this species of saving the benefit should be denied to this part of the whole population so likewise is it desirable that that same denial should have place in the case of all the rest   then as to those in whose instance no such complete inability has place the less a mans ability to bear the burthen is the more severely is the pressure of it felt by him be the price that will be thus set upon the benefit what it may some there will be by whom it will no more be felt than by the man by whom a halfpenny is given to a beggar is the loss of the halfpenny while others there will be on whom it will press with all degrees of pressure up to that which would be produced by his being deprived of the whole of what he has to live upon   in a word this assumes the shape given to the remuneration of the functionary to be that of payment by fees and from that mode of payment results an increase given to the expense in another way which will be brought to view hereinafter under another head namely by giving increase to the number of the occasions on which the money will have to be paid assessed upon the public fund the burthen presses upon each mans shoulders in exact proportion to his ability to bear it that is to say in so far as the system of taxation is what it ought to be in another work of mine for the accomplishment of the desideratum here in question—that is to say the minimization of the number of paid functionaries and thereby of the aggregate expense of that pay—may be seen means applicable to functionaries in general and accordingly to those here in question—namely power and obligation to the principal functionary to locate unpaid deputies in sufficient numbers what may there be seen is—how the matter may be so managed as that there shall always be functionary power enough and never more than enough such being made at all times the interest of the principal by whom these auxiliaries are located as to this matter see below   third instrument of minimization applicable to the expense of the institution competition applied to the remuneration of the functionaries if the security for appropriate aptitude on the part of the competitors were in any degree deficient from this same deficiency an objection might be opposed to the use of this instrument of frugality but the security which will here be proposed will be seen to be entire and completely satisfactory and this being the case the objection vanishes as to any other objection to the application of the competitionapplying principle on those who object to the application of it in this case—on those if any such persons there be who approve of it in any other instance—is it incumbent to declare why it is that they disapprove of the application of it in the present instance he who disapproves of monopoly in any one other instance let him say on what ground it is that he approves of monopoly in this instance to be consistent he must approve of monopoly on the part of dealers applied to everything in relation to which he here accords it to purchasers the food he keeps himself from death with the clothes he covers himself with the labour by which he makes provision for his several other wants whatever it may happen to them to be whence then came the banishment of this instrument of frugality from this part of the labour market whence but from the sinister interest to the action of which those on whose will the settlement of the matter has depended stood exposed to them belonging the power of location applied to the official situation to which on each occasion the remuneration was to be attached the higher the remuneration the greater the benefit to themselves their attachment is to that part of the benefit which was reaped exclusively by themselves not to speak of the benefit produced by the emolument in its quality of part and parcel of the aggregate stock of the matter of corruption—a benefit in which they were but sharers but says a common place argument which on every such occasion may be heard from the lips and even from the pens of corruptionists screw down a mans remuneration in this way he will raise it up again by whatever     instruments lie within his reach answer that has been given over and over again—true thats what he will do if it be reduced thus low but so will he be it ever so high and the higher it is the more effective the power—the greater the facility—it gives him for screwing it still higher and higher till he screw it up to the height of that of a king and to crown all to that of an emperor look to france—look to louis philippe with his civil list of £  0000 for five months—£   000 for twelve months look to the united states compare the £   000 with president jacksons £ 000 or £ 000 ayear so if what is proposed is that the situation with the remuneration attached to it be made a subjectmatter of purchase he that purchases say they will make the most of what he purchases just as high as the profit can be screwed up by him just so high will it be such then is the policy of these same enemies of the community and lovers of themselves what they refuse to make application of consists of all the several instruments by the application of which the evil is capable of being reduced what they do make application of is the sort of instrument by the application of which the evil is maximized thus it is in the case of the most profusely remunerated of all functionaries and such in his situation is the nature of man naturally most unapt in point of intellectual and active appropriate aptitude of all functionaries by the half million which is openly and avowedly given to him—by this it is that he is enabled to obtain in the shape of patronage—patronage of needless and to us useless offices so many millions which are not openly and avowedly but at a vast ulterior expense covertly given to him to the application made of this rule principle and source of economy one exception and one alone there must be on the occasion of application made of the securities in question the existence of antecedent experience of the conduct of the functionaries in question in that same situation is supposed and is necessary but at the outset of the institution by the supposition no such experience can have had place this exception then is a necessary one such at any rate will it be pronounced by those to whom it belongs to determine and advantageous indeed will be the compromise if with no other than this exception they can prevail upon themselves or be prevailed upon to give their concurrence to this rule to the functionaries first located in the several situations in question let them then assign such remuneration as on the score of as being in accordance with the masses of the matter of remuneration attached to the general run of the existing stock of official situations they would attach were no such measure of economy as this brought to view much good may it do them molerate is the boon that can be claimed for them on the score of assured competence selfdenial and disinterestedness   fourth instrument of minimization applicable—gratuitousness of the service of deputes during the probationary time—say a twelvemonth refuse to see who can escape from seeing who can deny who can venture the efficiency of this test of aptitude of those by whom in any tolerable degree appropriate aptitude is possessed who is there that will decline submitting to it what danger can there be that by his submission to this test any diminution of the requisite or desirable share of appropriate aptitude will in the instance of the functionaries located on these terms be produced nor less favourable to the interests and feelings of the individuals in question will these arrangements be than to the interest of the public in respect of the aptitude of its functionaries by no individual who in his own eyes is not able to abide this test—by no individual who is not desirous of its being so—will application of this test be made made then to the satisfaction of all persons concerned this same application of this same test will be and on the part of each and every one of those who do not abide it how small in comparison will consequent suffering be the plan does not suit me says the man—or i do not choose to serve in it on such terms and of either of these assertions in what way and by whom can the verity be contested but under matchless constitution of those on whom it depends it is the interest that throughout this as well as every other part of the official establishment the quantity of appropriate aptitude rendered necessary on the part of the several functionaries should be not the greatest possible but the least possible consistently with the keeping the government and with it their sinister profit in all shapes from falling to pieces for the greater the degree of aptitude exacted and rendered necessary the greater will be the odds against their several relatives and other protégés—the greater the chance that by their being found not to be possessed of it in so high a degree as their several competitors they will stand excluded ii second object to be accomplished minimization of delay in the service rendered to each several suitor   means of effectuation the first—assistant registrars or say registrars depute superfluous none the number of the functionaries employed     being given the degree in which the object now in question is accomplished will be proportioned to the quantity of attendance exacted of each such functionary that is to say as the number of the days on which attendance is paid by him in each year and the number of the hours during which such attendance is paid by him on each such day as to the number of each mans days of attendance in the year deductions from the whole number of days in the year are called for not only by the need of attendance on his private business but by what is due to health and comfort as well as by what is understood to be due to religion on the score of religion allowed to each functionary days of nonattendance—say the fiftytwo sabbath days with the addition of christmas day and good friday hours of attendance exacted all those on which suitors in general are inclined to repair to the spot for the purpose of receiving the appropriate service a precise standard of reference is presented to view by the greatest number of hours habitually exacted at the hands of any functionary in any of the existing public offices for the number of vacation days to be allotted for the purpose this same standard of reference may serve say as many consecutive days as there are in four weeks subject to the being in the instance of each individual dispersed and placed in different parts of the year by agreement amongst the several individuals concerned in addition to these ascertainable times of absentation the accidental occurrence of sickness suffices to demonstrate to any rational mind the unreasonableness of any reliance on altogether uninterrupted attendance to matchless constitution alone does it belong to expose the most important part of the business as in the case of honourable house to be put to a stand by sickness on the part of one of its members note here that in this case as in all others if for any part of the service rendered by the functionary instead of or in addition to salary remuneration were appointed or left to take the shape of fees the purpose here in question will be but too largely frustrated for multiplication of the fees maximization will be made of the number of the times and thence of the aggregate of the times of attendance with intervals between the several times—and thence of the quantity of delay which each business will experience this will already it is hoped be found sufficiently evident if not it may be seen enlarged upon in the work intituled petitions for justice c note also that if to the number of the functionaries adequacy be secured as above a correspondent relaxation in the severity of the obligation of attendance may be effected without any material addition to the expense and then it is that through the medium of the deputation system the quality of elasticity so to speak may throughout the whole field of operation be given to the provision made for the service of public functionaries always close fitting always enough never too much iii third object to be accomplished—on the part of the several functionaries aptitude maximized means of effectuation this one in my constitutional code in relation to each of the several official situations belonging to the several departments—legislative executive administrational included and judiciary—under the head of securities for appropriate aptitude provision is made for the possession of that same so highly desirable quality by the several functionaries therein respectively located of these same securities some there are which being applicable to no other species of constitution than that of a representative democracy are foreign to the present purpose on looking over the list of those same securities and more particularly the list of those applicable to the judiciary department selection has been made of these and after the necessary modifications made of them to fit them for being applied to the sort of office here in question the list of them is as follows   after the first and original appointment or say location exclusion put upon all candidates for the situation but such as in that of registrar depute have given proof of appropriate aptitude in all shapes by the exercise of the same functions under the superintendence of a registrar principal   the obligation contracted by the utterance of an inaugural declaration to be pronounced antecedently to entrance into office and the sense of responsibility increased in proportion to the publicity of it as to this see constitutional code ch xii judiciary §    judges inaugural declaration when published and as a model in the alreadypublished volume vol i ch vii legislators inaugural declaration   the interdiction put upon all emolument other than that which in the eyes of all men stands attached to the office by law see above object i expense minimized—means of effectuation   remuneration superfluous none object vi means of effectuation   fees

instruments deposited and searched for and searches made at the expense of suitors   singleseatedness of the office thence     integrality and undividedness of whatever responsibility legal or moral stands attached to the conduct of the functionary in the exercise of the duties of this his office as to this see constitutional code vol i ch ix ministers collectively §   number in an office   in the eyes of all persons present in the registrationoffice in quality of actors as they may be called on the registration theatre exposure of the tenor of the inaugural engagement as above   of his attendance at the seat of duty the constancy secured by the connexion established if found or deemed necessary between attendance and the receipt of official pay as to this see constitutional code vol i ch vi legislature §  0 attendance and remuneration how connected   dislocability of the registrar principal by the king or either house of parliament by the king to wit by an order countersigned by the lord privy seal with special reasons assigned by either house of parliament without any such reasons question   why countersigned by a single high functionary instead of being made an order in council—answer for responsibility for when instead of an individual the socalled burthen of responsibility is laid on a multitude the pretended burthen is an airballoon and the ceremony a farce question   why give this power to the lord privy seal—answer on the presumption that the functionary to whom the duty of countersigning the instrument of location is allotted is the home secretary the essential point is that the effective power of location and that of dislocation should not be in the same hand why because the inducement whatever it were by which the location had been effected would generally speaking be sufficient to prevent the dislocation howsoever merited from taking place for by every consideration by which human conduct is commonly on such occasions most powerfully influenced and determined the patron would stand engaged to continue his protection to his protégé question   why not give to the lord chancellor either the locative power or the dislocative answer because judging from his relative situation and from past experience he would abuse it it is of the situation of course that i speak not of this or that individual to the exclusion of others not one of you gentlemen without fear of the imputation of wishing to give offence not one is there of you i can venture to assert to whose conviction it has not been manifest what injury has been done by equity judges under the pretence of justice by counteracting the intentions of the legislature as manifested on former occasions by the institution of registeroffices involving titles in clouds of factitious uncertainty for the sake of the litigation and the profit wrung by them and their subordinates out of the expense on this as on so many other occasions need i add gentlemen that it is in the feegathering system the syphilis of the law that all this corruption has its root a set of securities such as the above—this if anything is what is meant by the word qualifications application of which having been customarily made when a new office has been established has of course been made in the present instance during the period in which by reason of the novelty of the institution there has not been time sufficient for bringing to view the result of the test of appropriate aptitude afforded by service performed in the very occupation in question an idea which since the publication of that same code has occurred to me is this namely that to keep off unapt aspirants—to keep off all those men who in such numbers regarding themselves as being secure against the being obliged to quit are so ready for the sake of the emolument to take upon themselves the duties of the office whatever it be—the first years service should be performed gratuitously on this plan a man who felt himself unfit for the office would be absolutely without motive for seeking it or so much as accepting it even it offered whereas in the present order of things destitution for other cause than judgment of guilty according to legal forms on conviction of a criminal offence being morally impossible the consequence is that in no other shape is any degree of inaptitude sufficient to keep a man out of office and preserve the public service from the evils to which his incapacity subjects or exposes it so much for that which ought to be now for that which is in the character of securities for appropriate aptitude on the part of the class of functionaries in question the supposed securities customarily provided under the name of qualifications may without fear of refutation be pronounced worse than useless and the supposed securities provided in the present instance are of the sort of those which are thus customarily provided of these same securities there are two namely   aggregation of the candidate in question to a certain class of persons who are occupied in exercising or endeavouring to exercise a certain profitseeking profession   bearing a part in a certain ceremony called the taking an oath neither the one nor the other of these supposed securities are means in any the smallest degree conducive to that same declared end       the class of men to which the candidate for the office in question is regarded to have been aggregated is that of barrister at law but with the exception of age to the power of aggregating a mans self to that same class no other condition is necessary than the having eat or appeared to eat a certain number of dinners in the same large hall in which other men are at that same time engaged in that same occupation among the writings which have for their object the contributing to the instruction of these same men is one that has for its title jocular customs of divers manors one of these same customs consists in the emission of gas from the intestines on certain solemn occasions for the entertainment of the company assembled the egesta in this latter case would not in the character of a security for appropriate aptitude constitute a less appropriate or less efficient one than is furnished by the ingesta in the former case   now as to the oath as in the nature of the case so in practice there are two kinds of oath—the assertory and the promissory the one here in question belongs to the promissory sort in the case of the assertory oath in my petitions for justice the worse than uselessness of it has been held up to view and proofs uncontested and incontestible may be there seen of its being so and with no less truth may these same proofs be seen applying to promissory oath in the present as well as in all other cases a supposed security which is inefficient is not negatively and simply useless it is positively much worse than useless it is a source of delusion producing confidence where confidence has no ground to stand upon so far as it is a security for any thing it is a security for relative inaptitude on a similar occasion to sir robert peel when home secretary were observations to this same effect presented presented but without effect it pains me to think and to have to say—that on the present occasion these same observations have been equally unavailing against truths so incontestible and so important the eyes of public opinion will not always remain shut and no sooner do they open than any draughtsman in whose draught either of these same sham securities has place will be covered with a wrapper of ridicule in which it would pain me to see enveloped any of the gentlemen to whom i have the honour thus to address myself iv fourth object to be accomplished—on the part of the machinery of the system aptitude to be maximized means of effectuation these— in the text of the act do whatsoever antecedently to experience presents itself as capable of being done towards the accomplishment of this desired purpose but in relation to the system thus formed give to the chief registrar the power from time to time to make whatsoever amendments shall in his eyes have afforded a promise of being conducive to that end subject to disallowance either by the king alone or by either of the two houses for the giving of this initiative and defeasible power of legislation the reason is at once simple and conclusive for their guidance no experience whatsoever will the framers of the act have had whoever they are full experience will have had this same functionary to whom the trust is thus proposed to be confided true it is that if of any other of the arrangements made by the act the effect were to give to him an interest in the deterioration of the system together with the power of promoting at the expense of the universal interest that same particular and sinister interest a wellgrounded objection would thus be opposed to this same proposed arrangement but   in the first place by what has been proposed under the last preceding head he will be seen to stand effectually purged of all such sinister interest   in the next place an additional and as yet unexampled security against evil in that shape is provided by the power thus given to each one of the three component sharers in the power of the supreme legislature in several unconnected parts of the bill as it stands at present power of making regulations respecting the details of the business is conferred on this same functionary but as to the matters in relation to which this power is given nothing else is done in and by the bill nor is any power of disallowance given to any authority other than that of the whole legislature between the cases in which without inconvenience power of regulation by the hands of an authority other than the legislature may and those in which it cannot be given without preponderantly evil consequences it would not it is imagined be easy to draw the line by the expedient here proposed all need and all use of any such line are done away eminently unpalatable to the taste because so eminently and equally detrimental to the particular interest of some of the opposers of the principle of allcomprehensive codification would the hereproposed arrangement be dried up by it in no inconsiderable degree would be the source of the indefinitely lengthy train of amendments upon amendments with the profit of the branch of amendmentmaking which this branch of matchless constitution has contrived to put into their hands a profit which cannot but have had no inconsiderable share in the producing of the opposition which continues to be made to the only arrangement by which anything like complete effect can     be given to any the most salutary and indispensable arrangements or individuals be preserved from punishment for the not doing of those things which it has thus been rendered and continues to be rendered impossible for them to do for how great is the evil which in their eyes would be too great for the whole community to be afflicted with for the sake of putting any the smallest sum into one of the noble or right honourable pockets how extensive the conflagration that would be too extensive to be made for the purpose of roasting for him a single egg but by a reformed parliament let us hope howsoever according to custom the malefactors may be left comfortably wrapt up in impunity the maleficent practice may be put a stop to of the appropriate and best adapted mode of making amendments in existing regulations by whatsoever authority made a description may be seen in the part already published of the proposed constitutional code namely in ch vi legislature §    members motions and of the mode in which without detriment to the supreme power of the legislature alterations may be made by authorities subordinate to it an exemplification is given in the asyetunpublished part namely vol the third ch xii judiciary collectively §    judges contested interpretationreporting function §  0 judges eventually emendative function to which reference is made in ch vi legislative §    securities for appropriate aptitude art    having so far as depends upon me introduced and applied to this same business the hands which by situation will be in the highest degree well qualified for the performance of it i shall there leave it and save to myself the time and labour of framing any proposed arrangements of detail for the purpose in question and to the gentlemen i am addressing the time and trouble necessary to the taking of any such arrangements into consideration v fifth object to be accomplished—security for the efficiency of the process in question—namely the process of registration—maximized means of effectuation an appropriate allcomprehensive map altogether indispensable seems to me to be this muniment without this for an object or standard of reference—without such an anchor as this to be fastened to—surely to a vast proportion of the landed property in the kingdom will the title remain floating in the ocean of uncertainty in one part of this vast aggregate the assurances have maps of correspondent extent for their accompaniments in another part in the vast remainder no such means or say instruments of identification have place if necessary or useful in any one instance where is the instance in which it can be otherwise an allcomprehensive original being thus formed then of the several parts of it should be taken a copy of each of the several parishes contained in the whole territory with correspondent provision for extraparochial places but here a twofold difficulty presents itself—   cause of the difficulty in the first place the irregularities in the surface of the earth exhibited by this surface are all imaginable diversifications of curvature whereas in this graphical representation of it on the only surface which it presents to view no one of all these diversifications is exhibited the surface is the whole of it in one and the same plane   in the next place comes the entire figure of the earth considered in its character of a solid body—an oblate spheroid—the mode of curvature the form of its divergence and aberration from a right line not uniform throughout as in the case of a sphere but varying general consequence in a degree more or less considerable incorrectness in a representation given of the portion of land in question in every map that ever has been or ever can be made of this same surface consequences in particular these where there are maps in the case of each division of the surface say in the case of each mile the quantity of the land given by the portion of the allcomprehensive map—the general map—would not agree with that given by a particular map of the same spot taken without reference made and regard paid to the allcomprehensive map  —the number of the products of the next subdivision say the acres stated in the titledeeds as belonging to each proprietor or set of proprietors would not agree with the number of acres represented as belonging to him or them in and by the corresponding portion of the allcomprehensive map  —all round each mile exhibited by the portion of an allcomprehensive map would be a sort of fringe or border which by that map would be represented as belonging to one proprietor or set of proprietors while by the particular and separate maps together with the number of the acres as stated in the assurance they would be spoken of as belonging to a different one in every instance in which the same mile is parcelled out between proprietors or sets of proprietors more than one each would in and by the number of acres stated in the assurances as belonging to him together with the maps if any with which those same assurances were accompanied be represented as having a larger part in it than he really has or could have each would therefore be in     the assurances stated and in the accompanying map or maps represented as possessing a quantity more or less considerable which he could not possess but at the expense of the part possessed by the other or others and thus in every part of the mile there would be a portion more or less considerable which would be represented as belonging to two different proprietors at the same time    in relation to this it will naturally be observed that by this discrepancy no actual collision litiscontestation or inconvenience in any shape is known to be produced for that by the natural boundaries which have place upon the land itself—that is to say the hedges ditches fences palings and the walls—what portion it is that belongs to each such proprietor or set of proprietors is indicated and demonstrated beyond dispute true in so far as boundaries of any sort have place this cause of doubt and dispute is obviated and excluded but in every acre in which boundaries are wanting this remedy to the deficiency has no place what then would be the remedy—answer it would be thus expressed take an account of the number of feet and inches in the actual occupation of each proprietor or set of proprietors or their respective lessees divide then in the map the whole mile into such or such a number of parts or portions divide the correspondent mile in the allcomprehensive map into that same number of parts or portions situated with relation to one another in the same manner in so doing mark their several proprietors as exhibited by each one of the correspondent portions in the allcomprehensive map the same as those in those which are given by the number of acres and so on in case of any ulterior or minuter division of the land among different occupiers as in the case of towns from the adjustment thus made would result the demarcation proper to be made in the correspondent portions of the allcomprehensive map and where on the land itself between one property and another there is not any actually existing boundaries the lines on which the boundaries ought to be placed in the country or say in french in the plat pays differences of no greater an amount than that of a few feet would not generally speaking be very material not so in towns or in the precise spots anywhere where fixed fences of any kind more especially those composed of brickwork or cemented stone have place a man whose fence in any direction had been too advanced would have to pull it down and to be charged with the correspondent quantity of expense and so in the case of watercourses other cases might be brought to view but for the particular example in proof of the importance of the general observation these may suffice think of the expense which by this course would have to be produced in the case of a church or any other similarly expensive public building on the continent of europe in countries more than one the thus proposed sort of muniment has actually been brought into existence and continues to be beneficially employed in this country among the pamphlets which of late have been published on the subject of assurances several there are in which this so essential an auxiliary to the efficiency of the main institution is recommended in those foreign instances the allcomprehensive map forms an appendage to a correspondently allcomprehensive cadastre as it is called containing a body of information of which that which is exhibited in and by the sort of muniment called in english a terrier forms a part the allcomprehensive muniment called doomesday book framed so early as the eleventh century a short time after the norman conquest is a sort of inchoate exemplification though imperfect and inadequate in the degree that might be expected at so early a stage in the progress of society trifling in comparison of the usefulness of it would be the expense of providing this same instrument of general security for the single purpose of defence of the country by means of fortifications against invasion by a foreign enemy a document of this sort instituted at public expense by order and under the direction of the board of ordnance is in considerable advance of the total number of counties in england and scotland       or    are already on sale among them the two largest—namely yorkshire and devonshire† for giving facility to the recurrence made to a representation of this sort a species of indication applicable to any map whatsoever has already been employed and is actually in use a map with this improvement in it lies before me it is a map of paris the whole surface is divided into parallelograms by lines composing a sort of latticework in one direction these parallelograms as they follow one another are distinguished and designated by the letters of the alphabet a b c c in the cross direction by numerical figures       c in the margins are inserted one under another in alphabetic order the names of the streets and other divisions preceded   0 respectively by the letter and the figure by the conjunction of which the place or places which the reader is looking for may almost instantaneously be found over and above the information of which the several parishes and extraparochial places in the territory in question are the subjectmatter this same document might be made to serve for supplying the like information respecting the division styled manors between parishes on the one part and manors on the other part various are the relations that have place—   in some instances they coincide   in other instances manors more than one are contained every one of them in an entire state in one and the same parish   in others again parishes more than one are contained every one of them in an entire estate in one and the same manor   in others again in which manors one or more than one are contained in an entire state in one and the same parish to these integers stand attached fragments more than one which extend over parishes more than one   and vice versâ in other instances in which parishes one or more than one are contained in an entire state in manors more than one to these integers stand attached fragments one or more than one which extend over manors more than one various are the signs and devices by any one of which this relation between the sites of parishes on the one part and manors on the other part might be exhibited to the eye and held up to view as to the particular nature the need of and benefit derivable from the ascertainment of the several manors in existence and the mode in which the obtainment of this information may most effectually and commodiously be accomplished it belongs not to the subject of registration but some suggestions of mine in relation to it may perhaps find their place on another occasion under the appropriate head give me said archimedes give me but another place to stand upon and i will give motion to the earth give me say i give me but a map to point to and i will give rest and quiet to all that inherit this our portion of the earths surface vi sixth object to be accomplished—extent of the application made of this same security maximized if the institution is productive of benefit who are they who in respect of justice ought to be left destitute of it—a question this which assuredly it is incumbent on him to answer if any such person there be by whom opposition is made in any shape to the utmost possible extension that can be given to this same benefit exceptions—always excepted are all cases if any such there be in which by the burthen imposed in all shapes taken together pecuniary expense included the benefit will be outweighed but this same burthen—on him by whom the existence of it is alleged lies the obligation of making proof of its existence and this obligation he will fulfil on pain of seeing his silence in relation to it regarded as a virtual confession of the groundlessness of the opposition made by him to the proposed measure means of effectuation these—   subjectmatters of property moveable excepted all admitted copyhold leasehold incorporeal thence in correspondent numbers the proprietors is it that the expense is such as would outweigh the benefit on the contrary the expense would be next to nothing such it was for example   in the case in which the body of information obtained for the use of parliament had for its subjectmatter the population of england wales included   in the case in which it had for its subjectmatter the provision made throughout for the education of the people in scotland second means of effectuation—   fees as above none avoiding to give to any part of the remuneration the shape of fees question—why not answer short and conclusive reasons the following—   to all who are unable to pay the price thus set the service is denied and in every instance in which the evidence which by that service should have been preserved and rendered accessible is for want of such service rendered unobtainable justice itself is thereby denied   to all those to whom whether in quality of incumbents or in that of patrons in the whole or in any part a profit is suffered to be reaped from this source an interest is given and that a but too efficient one in maximizing the amount of it the modes in which this increase is given to it are these—  increasing the number of the occasions on which each fee is exigible   on each occasion increasing the quantity of the fees thus exigible   in the case where the service consists in copying a written instrument or performing any operation in relation to it and the amount of the fee or fees increases with the length of the instrument increasing the length accordingly   if to the rendering of the service a journey is necessary giving increase to the number of such journeys and to the length and expensiveness of each thus upon every occasion is addition to an unlimited amount made to the expense       so as to delay where and in so far as the means employed for making addition to the profit consist in making addition to the number of the occasions on which the fee or fees are exigible a means contributory to the effect is the minimizing the quantity of the service on each occasion performed that the number of successive days on which it comes to be performed may be maximized here then there are so many intervals of delay produced moreover in instances to an indefinite number so it is that by addition made to the length of the interval between occasion and occasion addition may be made and accordingly is made to the number of the occacasions on which a fee or fees are exigible and accordingly exacted   when and in so far as this is the shape in which the remuneration has place the amount of it is in a perpetual state of uncertainty and whatsoever be the most proper amount from this same proper amount it is continually divaricating being almost always and to an indefinite extent either too great or not great enough at one time the public is suffering by the excess at another time the functionary is suffering by the delinquency   when this is the mode of payment the amount of the emolument and the sources from whence it flows are kept concealed from the public eye and the application of the check which by that all searching instrument would be opposed to abuse is thus averted true it is that by the institution of the feefund already mentioned the efficiency of the inducement to make addition to the expense is more or less diminished and may even be extinguished altogether but of its being extinguished altogether there can be no adequate ground of assurance for so long as by and from the hands of individual suitors benefit in any shape is expressly allowed or may be received without danger so it will be and however strong and in appearance sufficient the door may be which is shut against it crevices will be found or made in this same door and at these crevices emolument will flow or ooze in true it is again that saving the above exceptions a limit being thus put to the amount expense in excess—in one word depredation—is so far successfully obviated but the eye of the public being thus excluded from the scene abuse in other shapes is thus left without controul for example that oppression which without benefit rendered by it in any other shape to the oppressor may be practised for the gratification of pride or enmity in a word in no shape whatsoever will benefit be shown to flow from the giving this shape to the mass of official remuneration or any part of it for the producing of a semblance of benefit—for the producing in the mind of the public a notion of the existence of benefit in some shape or other—the word alacrity or some equivalent locution has been employed but by no person has any attempt been made to show—by no person will any successful attempt be made to show—that benefit in any determinate shape has ever been experienced by any person from this source nor how it is ever likely to be experienced in the case of the feefund completely is the door shut against this supposed benefit emolument none alacrity none the sole assignable cause ceasing so does the effect put aside the feefund thereupon comes into consideration the nature of the service in the several shapes in which remuneration in this shape is desired to be attached to it let any one by whom the benefit is supposed to have place look into the service in each case and say how it is that from the attaching to it remuneration in this shape benefit in the alleged shape or any other can be seen to follow let him look out for the several interesses for the parties whose interest is any way affected these he will find to be on the one part the several suitors who in person or at a distance have need to hold intercourse with the several functionaries on the other part those same functionaries and as to the suitors they will be seen to be either—  persons applying to have their documents or information thereof received into the archives of the offices or   persons having need or being desirous of making inspection into or inquiry concerning the contents of those same archives true it is that under the feefund system while the functionary is secured against loss he has in some cases a chance and hope of profit and in that hope a source of alacrity but what an atom of good is this to set against the weight of the evil which has been shown to have place in the other scale note that for the tutelary inspection performed by the eye of public opinion a continual demand will be created by the danger lest by a conspiracy between the functionaries on the one part and solicitors or other agents of suitors on the other part additions be made to expense and for that purpose to delay as above shocking in the extreme to the delicacy of gentlemen in both these situations will of course be any such suspicion but what has happened once may happen again much more what has had place universally as well as constantly how it is that by a conspiracy between the species of judges styled masters in chancery on the one part and the solicitors of parties on the other part may to an enormous amount have been habitually—under and by virtue of the matchless corruption     engendered and fostered by matchless constitution—a pitiless extortion obtained from suitors on pretences knowingly false and justice thereby to all but the very few denied and to the few sold has now not only been completely authenticated but rendered universally notorious and whether the fountain of this corruption be yet dried up let any one who is so minded speak on this subject matter may be seen in various works of mine but more particularly that which is entitled justice and codification petitions c for on most points close is the analogy between the sort of official service by which what is called justice is administered or professed to be administered by the judges and their subordinates and that by which preappointed written evidence is registered the case is that the sort of service rendered by the functionaries belonging to a registeroffice of the kind in question is as elsewhere observed subsidiary to the sort of service rendered by the functionaries who are considered as belonging to the judiciary establishment and is liable accordingly to abuse in the same shapes produced by the same causes   the manifold mode of writing employed thence besides the production of other beneficial effects to a vast amount by reduction made in the expense contribution made to the maximization of the number of the persons to whom the benefit of registration is imparted in an essay of mine on the subject of the late mr humphreys work on real property is contained a description of this invention with a detailed explanation of the uses to which in the field of registration it is capable of being applied this essay made its appearance in the form of an article in the westminster review no xii for october      and having reserved some numbers for gratuitous distribution i took the liberty of presenting a copy to each of the gentlemen to whom in their quality of commissioners of inquiry into the law of real property this paper is addressed of all these copies the receipt has been acknowledged of a contribution so highly important as this invention seemed to me to be to that service to the cause of justice the conferring of which was the purpose of the commission given to them to find no notice taken was to me a disappointment of no ordinary severity but at present i have in hand a security for the cognizance which they will take of it i mean the engagement which i set out with begging their attention to—an engagement fruit of that public spirit by which they stand so eminently distinguished—i mean the engagement to give publication in their reports to whatsoever suggestion i shall have submitted to them for that purpose here follows then of that same article such part as regards the manifold mode of writing here follows the passage from now as to registration near the end of p  0  to marriage settlement near the beginning of p  0  antea gentlemen you have read what is above i now call upon you—i hereby call upon you—either in your report or proposed law to give to that instrument of justice and security against fraud on one part and ruin to countless individuals on the other part the attention and employment so incontestibly due to it or if not to say why not for on the score of conciseness this locution i am content to borrow even from the judicatories which by so sad a misnomer call themselves courts of equity yes fixed upon you already is the public eye and under the sharpened eye of a reformed parliament fastened upon you it will be with unprecedentedly searching energy pretences indeed i have heard—reasons i will not call them—the name of reason i will not profane with them—pretences then i will call them but such pretences—i am ashamed to think of them i am ashamed to think from what lips it is that i have heard them name those lips i will not they were such from which i should have hoped for better things of any such number of copies said the voice—of any greater number of copies than are at present in use there is no need the remuneration for skill in a laborious profession ought not to be cut down too low then there is the paper—the paper not white enough—the ink not black enough in a word the thing was i found an innovation—the offspring of theoretical fancies—instead of conformity forming a perfect contrast to the precious fruit of ancestorwisdom—the existing practice as to practice true it is it had already been in use for years in use—but with whom is it for official dignity to put itself to school—to school—to the school of a newspaper so much for the arguments against the use of this instrument of security against forgery and of reduction of expense now for some matters of fact some states of things in favour of it   first as to the notion about uselessness i turn to the masterly and admirablyinstructive work the gratuitouslydistributed volume of one of your number mr tyrrell intituled suggestions to the commissioners appointed to inquire into the law of real property in it i read the following passages— page     if it be thought improper to take the custody of wills which may include any personal estate from the ecclesiastical courts office copies of them might be registered upon being authenticated by an affidavit made by the officers who have examined them     and heavy penalties should be imposed upon them in case of negligence in overlooking a mistake the errors in the official copies made at doctors commons are so frequent that few counsel will venture to advise upon an obscure will without requiring to see the original or requesting the solicitor to ascertain the accuracy of the copy i have met with several instances of important mistakes in one office copy which was examined with the original by my desire in the last year four verbal errors were found in about as many lines every one of which altered the interest of the devisees page     speaking of judgments they are not binding under the present act upon lands in a register county until they have been registered in that county and in like manner they should be required to be registered separately with respect to every different county in which there may be estates intended to be charged with them and not to be effectual as against other securities or assurances of lands in such county which may have been previously registered that which it seems clear to me was on this occasion contemplated by mr tyrrell is—an indefinitely repeated process of registration and if this be really what was meant by him to be proposed the consequence is that in relation to the demand it presents for the manifold mode of writing it makes no difference where the scene of the operation lies whether in one and the same edifice or in so many different edifices i say in so many different edifices or at least in some considerable number of different local edifices for as between the one plan and the other the option is in p     stated by him as hanging nearly in equilibrio page     an official copy of any deed will or other document might be given to any person entitled to an interest in the estate and might be signed by the two clerks by whom it may have been examined with the original and who should be liable to a penalty for every mistake in it so says mr tyrrell now then for a few questions to him—   to the number of the persons to each of whom it may happen to have an interest in this same estate what is the limit that can be set   accordingly what is the limit that can be set to the number of the copies which on this plan might be needful with a fee for each—a fee increasing with the length of each such copy   or to the number of the fees payable in respect of these proposed double attestations   or eventually to the number of the mistakes to which it may happen to have been made with fees for the several persons employed in the correction of those same mistakes not to speak of the quantity of time consumed in the discovery of the error and the applying the corrective to it   on the supposition that in lieu of the ordinary mode of taking copies exemplars—all of them equally entitled to the appellation of originals—were taken in the manifold way what possibility would there be of any one such mistake true it is that supposing the number of such exemplars to exceed    there would not be a possibility of furnishing an exemplar to each of the persons in question without the necessity of a transcript from the original set of exemplars in which extraordinary case a possibility of mistake would have place and perhaps it might even happen that the number in which in this case the marks were sufficiently clear might not be quite so great as that of the copies taken but in this case nothing could be easier nor more efficacious than the remedy namely a few words written on one of the leaves of the ulterior batch or batches stating them not to belong respectively to the first page     the duplicates of registers of births marriages and deaths should be kept in the public office for the county in which they may be made to this passage applies with equal propriety the observations made on the passages in p     and     in which observation is stated the ground on which i concluded that what he assumed the existence of was on each occasion a not improbable demand for indefinitely large numbers of copies page     an official copy of any deed will or other document might be given to any person entitled to an interest in the estate and might be signed by the two clerks by whom it may have been examined with the original and who should be liable to a penalty for every mistake in it thus far mr tyrrell now then say i—where is the man that will undertake to set any and what bounds to the number of the copies which for this purpose it may happen to a will for example to present the need of with the skilled labour necessary to the examination applied to each of them that skilled labour to the inadequacy of which to the purpose of preventing evil consequences to an indefinite extent you have just been seeing him bear such ample testimony on the other hand see how the case stands on the supposition of the writings being performed in the manifold mode    0    or even if necessary as many as    written by one and the same hand at one and the same time i say    this is capable of being done for this has been done if of the whole number any one is correct so are all the rest if in any     one there be any error that same error has place in all the rest and for the detection of it in them all no skilled labour is necessary or of use then as to the correction of these errors with pen and ink in the common way correction made in the manner in which corrections are made in a proof sheet in printing having been made in any one of them the number of words the aggregate of these corrections consisted of would be all that would be to be copied in the others and of these errors—one or all of them—how great soever may be the importance not frequently can it happen that the number should be very considerable when the worst comes to the worst all that would be to be done is the copying over again such of the leaves and such of them only in which the errors make their appearance and this is one advantage resulting from the moderateness and uniformity which may be given to the size of the leaves whereas for anything that appears in the bill the documents sent into the office for registration may be of the great and greatly diversified extent of which papers and skins of parchment are susceptible page     it would be convenient to require that every deed will or document brought for registry should be accompanied with a short synopsis or statement of the contents in order that when found to be correct it might be copied into the register book as a marginal index to the copy of the instrument and also with such other description of the nature of the document as ought to be inserted in any of the indexes or books of reference supposing the sort of abridgment in question to be of use and for facility of conception it should seem it would be—for so it is in the case of a bill and an act of parliament it might be ordained to be made in the original in which case it would have place of course in each of the several exemplars of it but a standing and universallyapplying rule should be enacted declaring that no words employed in the abridgment shall be understood as influencing the construction to be put upon the text at large will it be said that by the employing exemplars of the whole of each document instead of the proposed abridgment the bulk of the aggregate number of the deposits would be swelled to such a degree that the expense of the buildings necessary for the reception of them would be so great as to constitute a decisive objection against the use thus proposed to be made of the manifold mode at any rate this objection would not lie in the mouth of any man to whom as in p     the choice of having a building for each one of the fortytwo counties and the having but one for all the counties together is stated as being nearly a matter of indifference on the plan proposed in the above extract here would be for learned gentlemen the profit and for unlearned parties the expense of skilled labour to be employed in the drawing of these same synopses with the danger of errors therein occurring and the certain expense of corrections to be applied to those same errors in the case of the manifold exemplar of the document at large no demand for any such synopsis nor any possibility of any such errors page     the office he goes on to say might be divided into two departments one for ascertaining the authenticity of documents proposed to be registered and the other for preserving and affording facility of reference to them and they might be so regulated that the one should afford a check against negligence or error in the other the latter department might be divided into as many different offices as there are counties or ridings including the cities and towns which are counties of themselves in the districts in which they are locally situated and there might be an additional office for such documents as relate to more than one county thus far mr tyrrell for my part i do not clearly perceive the utility of this reduplication of the expense still less the preponderance of the benefit in this case over the burthen all that in relation to this matter i do clearly perceive is—that by the use of the manifold the expense whatever it is would be nearly and the danger of error altogether done away so much as to the notion about needlessness in fine to the employment proposed to be given to the manifold mode of writing is there now any really operative objection other than that which is opposed by the fees which by it would be kept out of the pockets of learned gentlemen and kept from taking their departure out of the pockets of unlearned suitors while writing this i am also employed on my plan for extinguishing the factitious delay factitious and missealed expense with the thenceresulting sale and denial of justice the manifold mode of writing applied to the minutation of evidence is a means and instrument altogether indispensable the employment of it a condition sine quâ non to the giving to that unspeakablyimportant benefit the degree of perfection it is susceptible of and of its usefulness with reference to that ulterior purpose mention may be seen hereinabove made by adopting and exemplifying these my suggestions in relation to it it depends upon you gentlemen to bring under the eyes of all whom it may concern a demonstration of its     practicability and usefulness for that the most important of all purposes the subjectmatter committed to our consideration says somebody is not how justice may be administered at least expense but how the respective owners of what is called real property may be best secured against the loss of it true but if the instrument in question be it what it may is good for the purpose in question its being also good for another purpose or for other purposes in any number is most assuredly to any intelligent mind no reason why use should not be made of that same instrument to that same purpose yes should it which i ardently wish that it may not and venture to hope that it will not be my misfortune gentlemen to see you wilfully suffering this grand instrument of justice and security to remain unemployed for want of any endeavours on your part to give adoption and support to it and the community to remain destitute of the benefit of which it affords so bright a prospect—parliament and through parliament or without parliament other nations as well as this shall hear of it and to the latest posterity the shame of such a wilful neglect shall lie on the heads to which it belongs no never so long as i have a voice or a pen capable of giving utterance to these my wishes—never shall cease my endeavours for the adoption of it—my incontestably just reproaches for the neglect of it vii object the seventh—minimization of the burthen in the shape of expense with which the benefit produced by registration is clogged means of effectuation these—   burthen transferred from individuals to public the burthen thus transferred from the shoulders least able to the shoulders most able to bear it in the shape of fees unless proportioned in each instance to the pecuniary ability of the individuals at whose hands respectively they were called for which is what they could not be the burthen would in so far as paid press on each individual with a weight of affliction more and more heavy in proportion as he was less and less able to bear it and in individual instances to an indefinite number the individual not having wherewithal to pay the fee or fees would exclude him altogether from all participation in the benefit of the institution for to the smallness of the value of the subjectmatter in question no limit can be set in regard to feelings what the smallness of the value in question is too apt to do—indeed to a greater or less degree it may be affirmed has accordingly done—in the breast of every public man by whom the matter has ever been taken into consideration is to diminish the idea of the pressure and that in such sort as to exclude from his affections all regard for it unhappily no such effect has it upon the feelings of the individual who is thus dealt with   fees as above none remuneration of the functionaries the whole of it in another shape namely that of salary of the importance of this object considered in another point of view namely the minimization of the expense whatsoever be the shoulders on which it is laid—a view has been already given that is to say under the head of the first object—expense minimized   means of communication for documents and other writings the letterpost thence expense of separate communication through skilled labour saved in the bill i have the satisfaction of seeing this mode of communication ordained to be employed how well adapted it is to this purpose and how prodigious the saving made by it in comparison with that mode of communication by special messengers which is employed where law proceedings are the subject has been abundantly shown and is much too abundantly felt in a work of mine intituled petitions for justice and codification—namely in p     of the petition for justice art   of the part which has for its subjectmatter the judiciary establishment—a proposition to this effect is contained that for trustworthiness and economy says the passage in question the business of messagecarrying be as far as may be performed by the machinery of the letterpost gentlemen i have now said my say for your part you have a choice to make you will either break your engagement and consign these pages to oblivion or keep to your engagement and to this address presumptuous as it is give publication in your next report dixi jeremy bentham queens square place westminster  th july              justice and codification petitions being forms proposed for signature by all persons whose desire it is to see justice no longer sold delayed or denied and to obtain a possibility of that knowledge of the law in proportion to the want of which they are subjected to unjust punishments and deprived of the benefit of their rights drafts for the above proposed petitions by jeremy bentham     justice and codification petitions advertisement contained in the present publication are three papers— paper the first proposed petition for justice at full length paper the second proposed petition for justice in an abridged form paper the third proposed petition for codification i petition for justice at full length parts of it these— part i case made—grounds of the hereby proposed application to the house of commons inaptitude to wit of the existing system of judicial procedure with reference to its alleged and supposed ends as also of the judicial establishment occupied in the application of it proofs the several heads and instances of abuse and imperfection which are accordingly brought and held up to view part ii prayer consequent—remedy proposed for the disorder composed of those same abuses and imperfections prayer its parts— part   outline of the proposed judicial establishment part   outline of the proposed system of procedure model the domestic system that to wit which is pursued of course by every intelligent father of a family without any such idea as that of its constituting the matter of an art or science sole difference the necessary enlargement and diversification correspondent to the difference in magnitude between the two theatres ii petition for justice in an abridged form parts of it these— part i abridgment of the case part of the fulllength petition part ii prayer part matter of it the same word for word as that of the fulllength petition reference accordingly sufficient repetition needless reasons for the two different forms these   in the fulllength petition number of the pages as will be seen  0  cumbrous would an instrument of this length be if presented in the only form in which it would be received—cumbrous and that to such a degree that its bulk might of itself be found an insurmountable obstacle to its being carried about for signature this form is—that of a roll of parchment composed of skins tacked on one to another length whatever is necessary for receiving the signatures in addition to the matter of the petition   compared with that of the abridged instrument the expense of the operation of engrossing would of itself be a serious obstacle   readers in greater numbers—readers and thence signers may of course be expected for the shorter than for the longer instrument to each reader the two will here present themselves for choice for reading the instrument presented to a person looked to as disposed to promote the design will be of course a printed copy of this work in this way it is perusable by any number of persons at the same time while     if there was no other copy than the abovementioned roll years might elapse before this instrument could pass through the number of hands in succession to each of whom a single day might suffice for the persual of a copy of it iii petition for codification intimately connected is the subjectmatter of this petition with that of the petition for justice no otherwise than by codification can the reform here prayed for—or any effectual reform in any shape—be carried into effect a petition in the terms here seen having been honoured by the approbation of mr oconnell has by that gentleman as a letter of his informs the author of these papers been put into the hands of the catholic association for the purpose of its being circulated for signatures of this publication—the ultimate object being the engaging parliament to take into consideration the subject matter of it the immediate and instrumental object is the engaging individuals to concur by their signatures in the endeavour to induce parliament to take the desired course persons looked to for signatures who answer every person in whose breast any such desire has place as that of seeing made in relation to any subjectmatter touched upon by it any change not looked for by him from any other source any change whatsoever be the complexion of it ever so different from or ever so opposite to that of the change here proposed what says somebody—cooperation expected from persons entertaining desires directly opposite yes even from them how so because supposing parliament taking the matter into consideration—to each person for the seeing such his own desires gratified would thus be afforded a chance such as he would not possess otherwise but if at the hands even of persons entertaining opposite views and wishes such cooperation may not unreasonably be expected with how much stronger assurance may it be expected at the hands of persons whose views and wishes are more or less in accordance with what is here endeavoured at now as to the ground of expectation in regard to parliament this is the distinctive character of the present work presenting as it does in addition to the statement and that an allcomprehensive one of the alleged disorder a proposed remedy so far as regards the mere disorder the work is an operation an easier than which could not easily be found at no time can any hand be incompetent to it while in any such task as that of the exhibition of a remedy so much as approaching to coextensiveness with the disorder no ground appears for supposing any other hand at present engaged—or without invitation likely in any way to engage this or none such alone is the option presented to every person on whose part any disposition has place to employ his signature in applying to the disorder its sole possible remedy to wait till a draught to this extent presented itself to no part of which he saw anything to object would be to wait till the end of time in regard to codification included in the object of this publication is it will be seen not only the presenting to view the fruit of the authors own labours but the engaging other candidates in the greatest number obtainable in the same so supremely and allcomprehensively important service nor to this purpose is the same sanction of authority altogether wanting by implication at any rate codification has in its favour the declared opinion and recommendation of the real property commissioners witness the questions circulated by them sufficiently manifest at any rate is the recommendation while in pursuance of their labours something should be done but by parliament whatever it be either by codification or not at all will it have been done and whatever be the length to which this indispensable operation has been carried—why it should stop there or anywhere short of completion is a question to which it rests with any declared opponent of codification to find if it be in his power anything like a rational answer by his refusal to answer it or his silence in relation to it judgment of inconsistency against him will be signed these things considered requisite assurances are not wanting that as soon as the press of more urgent business admits the matter of both petitions will by appropriate motions be brought to the view of the honourable house instructions as to the mode of proceeding for obtaining signatures provide a skin of parchment tack to it one after another others in sufficient number to contain the matter of the petition with the addition of signatures in such number as you expect to obtain for it a thing desirable is that all persons who join in the petition may be distinguished each one from any other for this purpose let each subscriber add to his name at length an indication of the place of his abode if it be where there is not a town the name of the county and the parish will be the proper mode of designation if in a town the name of the town with that of the street or other mode of address employed in sending a letter by the post to save bulk and expense—divide the roll into parallel columns each of them wide enough to receive a signature of an average length in which case when it exceeds that length two lines will always be necessary though commonly sufficient to each signature prefix a number expressive of the order in which it stands   0 as to the instrument thus employed—in general if not exclusively—it will be the abridged petition the fulllength petition being much too large and the transcription of it too expensive for general use to any person disposed to use his endeavours to obtain signatures for the longer petition should it present itself as being too long an easy operation it will be to strike out of it such parts as it seems to him can best be spared where any abridged petition is the one employed—in this case a copy of the petition at length as printed should be left with the person applied to that he may peruse it if so inclined before the roll is put into his hands for signature of the opposition which every such coadjutor has reason to expect it is material that he should be sufficiently aware from all persons to whom any change in the existing system would be an object of regret such is the reception which should of course be looked for and provided against and in this number are included of course all those by whom to any amount in any shape in any way direct or indirect profit is derived or thought by them to be derived from any abuse or imperfection to which by the proposed draught a remedy is endeavoured to be applied more particularly all attornies or solicitors as of late years they have been called and persons especially connected with them by any tie of interest or relationship not to speak of judges other persons belonging to the judicial establishment and barristers nor as to the whole class and its several ramifications let it ever be out of mind that on their own principles by their own showing being incontestably interested they are one and all in relation to this matter not to speak of so many other matters to use their own language so many incompetent incredible and altogether inadmissible witnesses of this publication one natural effect is the producing addresses in one way or other to the author from correspondents to the number of whom no certain limits can be predicted and which if precautions were not taken might be such as to be oppressive for so it is that whatever probability there may be of the presentation of petitions or though it were no more than a single petition in the course of the present session the like probability may continue during an indefinite length of ulterior time but for the arrangement thus requested this publication might therefore have for one of its effects the imposing upon the author a charge to an indefinite amount and not terminating but with his life on this account it is requested that no communication be addressed to the author but through the medium of the bookseller nor to the bookseller but either post paid or accompanied with an order for a copy of the work lastly as to the usefulness of this production and the endurance of which it is susceptible to those whom the design may be fortunate enough to number amongst its wellwishers and the production among its approvers a consideration that cannot fail to be more or less agreeable is—that whatsoever may be its capacity for attracting signatures the same may remain to it during an indefinite length of time and that so long as the remembrance of this publication lasts no one to whom the existing selfstyled instrument of security is a source and instrument—of depredation of oppression in a word of injury in any shape can be in want of a ready vehicle for the communication of his complaints preliminary explanations necessary to be first read   in the introductory advertisement will have been seen the consideration which gave birth to the proposed abridged petition for justice in addition to the fulllength petition   when that advertisement went to the press the drawing up of the abridged petition had proceeded about half way and from the progress at that time made had been deduced an assurance delusive as it has proved of completing it within the desired compass the compass both as to time and space   from that time the further this part of the work went on the less apposite was perceived to be the appellative abridged by which it had been originally designated till at length instead of the one operation abridgment four distinguishable ones—subtraction addition repetition substitution—were the operations found to have been performed   of this variety of operations—imperfection in respect of clearness conciseness and methodical order on the part of the draft considered as a literary composition has been the indispensable consequence but should it be seen as the author trusts it will be that without detriment to the practical purpose no different course could have been pursued—no material dissatisfaction on the part of the reader will it is hoped have place   practical end or purpose—change for the better means employed—maximizing the number of the persons known to entertain the desire of seeing such change take place mode of making this desire known—attachment     of each ones signature to some copy of a petition praying for such change   now then for maximizing the number of signatures one means is—the maximizing the number of copies offered for the reception of those same signatures but by the bulkiness of the aggregate mass of the matter by which the reasons for the change stand expressed will the end and purpose be obstructed no it will be promoted how so answer because the instrument may be cut into smaller instruments in any number to each of which signatures may be found obtainable from persons from whom this expression of concurrence would not have been obtainable for any one other of these same component parts much less for the whole   now then as to the particular use and purpose of the two here proposed instruments—fulllength and abridged petitions—taken together this was—the maximizing the number of the arrangements in the existing system seen by the several readers to be adverse to the ends of justice to which end a means manifestly conducive was—the tying up as it were of those same arrangements into bundles characterized and distinguished from each other by appropriate names this accordingly is what has been done by the list of devices   considerations showing the course actually pursued to have been the most conducive that could have been pursued the following—   in proportion as the operation went on—matters of detail deemed all of them contributory to the common ends but which had not all of them presented themselves at the time of drawing up the firstdrawn petition—came into view by exclusion put upon any of these additional grounds and inducements would the chance for the attainment of the common end have been increased no surely  0 true it is—that in the ordinary case of an abridgment—between clearness and conciseness a mutual repugnancy has place as conciseness is increased clearness is diminished but in the present case happily no such repugnancy has place no mutual counteraction but what is capable of being effectually got rid of decomposition as above is the operation by which this reconciliation is capable of being effected and is accordingly here proposed to be effected    now as to the course which may be seen actually taken as above in pursuance of the design of abbreviation first came condensation as in the ordinary case of an abridgment then simple elimination or say subtraction applied to certain paragraphs belonging to the device in question lastly elimination applied to the whole of the matters contained under the head of a device in this last way may be seen dealt with three devices namely device xi decision on grounds avowedly foreign to the merits device xii juries subdued and subjugated and device xiv result of the fissure in device xiii mentioned groundless arrestation for debt as the pressure produced by the influx of additional matter increased these more and more efficient modes of reduction may be seen successively employed    the two drafts taken together being in this state comes now the question—of the compound mass—any and what portion is there that can with truth be pronounced useless answer yes namely the aggregate of the paragraphs reprinted without variation after this deduction every other assignable portion of the matter may be stated as having its use    the case in which if at all the correctness of this proposition will be most questionable is that in which of two paragraphs the one is as above but a condensation of the other but even in this case so it may be that the one of them may be the most apt in the eyes of one set of proposed subscribers the other in the eyes of another such set    in the disposition made of the matter of the original draft—and thereafter of that of the abridged draft—a method as serviceable as it was in the authors power to give has been given to it but now—take the worst case that can have place suppose nothing to have place that can have any claim to the appellation of method—the whole matter—is it useless and the labour thrown away by no means    for the purpose being to prevail upon the constituted anthorities to take the whole of the mass of existing law in question for the subject matter of consideration—and this for the purpose of reform and amendment—of no blemish in any shape can any indication in any language or form be given that will not be more or less contributory and conducive to the purpose    upon the whole—proposed for the choice of all persons disposed to be contributory to the proposed design by framing drafts for circulation for the purpose of obtaining signatures will be—the options examples of which are the following— i to employ the fulllength draft without alteration as it stands ii to employ the abridged draft without alteration as it stands iii to employ either draft with amendments such as may appear meet amendments whether additive subtractive or substitutive iv to form drafts of their own composed of matter—none of it contained under any of the heads employed in the above drafts v to form drafts composed of matter of     their own with or without use made of those same heads and with or without insertion declaredly given to more or less of the matter contained under them vi to frame drafts composed of matters exclusively their own without reference made to or use in any way made of any part of the matter contained in either of these same drafts    of these several options to which others might have been added the one last mentioned it will of course be supposed is not of the number of those which the author expects to see embraced but even supposing it were—whatsoever be the number of the drafts thus framed and with attached signatures presented to the constituted authorities—correspondent will be the service rendered to the cause of reform and improvement by these pages    a lottery suppose set up and paragraphs of the abridged petition some or all of them drawn out of it and written down on the roll in the order assigned to them by fortune—even in this case a petition so framed and thereupon signed would not be altogether without its use    so long as that most allcomprehensive most grinding and most crying of all grievances—the tyranny of judgemade law—continues unredressed—the correspondent public service unperformed—so long as the torrent of human misery flowing from it keeps running on—be the number of ages during which it will have continued ever so great never will the use whatever it be which the matter of these proposed petitions is capable of being put to be at an end  0 to the care of posterity should the time not be yet ripe the author will recommend this matchless service with his dying breath    hapless individual whoever you may be whose lot it is to behold your means of subsistence torn from you and plunged into the gulph called by a cruel mockery a court of equity there to be devoured by the appointed sharks—in these pages you may at all times see samples—samples ready made—of the only sort of instrument which it is in your power to make application of in the character of a remedy—with this in hand you may go about and look about for assistants and coadjutors in those companions in misery whom in such deplorable abundance you will behold presenting themselves all around    nor while for companions in misery you look sideways forget to look upwards for the authors—cruel hypocrites in pretence alleviators—in reality preservers—of all parts of it anxious and industrious preservers when neither creators nor exacerbators    but says somebody is there not one still better course left which you might have taken and which is still left open to you to take from the matter of the original fulllength petition and the abridged petition taken together might not you have drawn up—might not you even now draw up—a new draft consigning to the flames both the existing ones answer by time and expense taken together intimation is given of two objections the first of which might of itself be conclusive considering that during the time thus occupied in an operation little better than mechanical all other works of greater usefulness in this same time would be at a stand    but another answer still more conclusive and it is hoped satisfactory is this by no means by any such ulterior and amended abridgment would the purpose of it be answered for while for the purpose of it a survey were taken of the field fresh weeds would be seen springing up and pressing themselves upon the extirpating hand in this way after enlarged as well as abridged editions in any number—each superseding all former ones—still the demand for another and another would be presenting itself nor for the consumption of labour time and money would the demand cease till the work of which an outline and nothing more is here professed to be presented had been brought to a state regarded as a state of completeness    suppose it now in that state the following is the form in which it would present itself to view of the hereproposed system the part called the prayer in the very words or as lawyers say tenor of it occupying the foremost places but by the side of it all along a delineation of the several correspondent features of alleged inaptitude ascribed to the existing systems to the principal text would thus be subjoined a sort of perpetual commentary thus composed    in conclusion a word or two as to the numerical figures which in the abridged petition stand prefixed to the paragraphs in the abridged petition only in the original one not the demand for that help to reference not having as yet presented itself to view    for all but the two first of the above proposed six options indisputable assuredly is the facility that will be found afforded by this little additament witness sad experience of the result of the nonemployment of them by means of these instruments than which nothing can be more familiar or indispensably useful—or even by the constituted authorities themselves more universally applied to portions of the matter of law—except where the production of uncertainty and mistake is among the objects aimed at reference is in the concisest manner possible made to any assemblage of words whatsoever     without danger of mistake—without them mistake and uncertainty may to any amount be produced    accordingly wherever in relation to a law or a body of laws to maximize the execution and effect given to it is really an object of desire—numerical figures prefixed to the several portions of discourse are the instruments employed witness the practice in every civilized part of the globe england—lawyerridden england—alone excepted    on the other hand wherever the design entertained is—the giving increase to such uncertainty with its attendant miseries—objects in view the benefit of the lawyer class and those connected with it by any community of sinister interest—the use of this together with so many other instruments of certainty is pertinaciously and inexorably abstained from imitated thus the fabled barbarity of mezentius kept bound up in the closest contact with carcases in an ambiguous state between life and death is the whole stock of those statutes which are still designed as well as destined to be employed as living ones witness the latest of the string of bills framed exactly as if they had for their object on pretence of diminution the augmentation and perpetuation of depredation and oppression repealed—such an act thereupon designated by its long and wordy title and such an act designated in the same conceptionconfounding manner and so much of such an act—in like manner designated—so much how much learned sir right honourable sir whichever be your right name—render it possible for us to know how much instead of consigning to complete ruin by alleged mistake as to the how much on the part of a wretch who has been half ruined by some petty tyrant clothed in the authority of a justice of the peace at whose charge on the faith of parliament that compensation has been sought which would not have been promised but for the foreknowledge that it would never be granted—so much—once more how much—till of late followed upon the words so much the words as relates to the subject of      whereupon came some sort of designation given of it now even this clue is refused and the passage evaporates in nonsense  0 to these figures—when the question was as to the mode of preparing drafts for receiving signatures—an objection was made on the ground of unusualness to the quarter from whence the objection came nothing short of the most respectful attention could be paid but the use to which on that occasion it was destined was no other than that of being applied to an instrument which was then actually in a state for receiving signatures and to which accordingly references for any such purpose as the one then in question were not intended to be made of these instruments of clarification the use and purpose here in question is—the subjecting to decomposition the supposed too bulky bodies—that out of them other bodies in any required number polype like might be framed but in the case here alluded to no such decomposition was contemplated comes now another use of these small but effective instruments of precision call it for example the argumentative or argumentassisting use calling for distinctions sake the one first mentioned the simply indicative of these same little instruments is constituted a support—and that a matchless one—for close reasoning    pitiable in good truth will be seen to be the condition of the disingenuous opponent who casting an eye on a body of argument which he stands engaged to encounter and attack beholds it armed with them thus distributed into so many articulate parts—for the clear correct and complete designation of each of which a single word is effectually sufficient—the discourse be it what it may presents to him in each part of it a determinate and nevermisapprehensible object and standard of reference here sir is proposition the first what say you to it has it your assent has it your dissent if your dissent for what reason or reasons unapprised of the existence of these defences—he comes suppose with his quiver full of devices borrowed from the book of fallacies see then the condition in which he finds himself instead of doing as he had flattered himself with doing—instead of shooting fallacies into the middle of the discourse at random—or enveloping the whole expanse of it as it were in a net—he feels himself pinned down under the pressure of a most distressing alternative taking in hand the chain of discourse—either he must grapple with the links which it is thus composed of one after another—or remain motionless—remain motionless and thus by a token more unequivocal and demonstrative than it is in the power of words to be acknowledge the object of his hostility to be unassailable nothing can he say—for such is the supposition and this is a supposition which may continually be seen verified—nothing can he say but what is to be found in this or that chapter section and article of the book of fallacies some article in and by which before he ever took this device of his in hand it may be seen ready confuted looking at the mark—nothing can he find to hit it with but some witticism—some wellworn piece of nothingness—some vague generality—which—like a cloud—dark or more or less brilliant—hanging in the air—is seen to have no substance—nothing that can be brought to bear upon the object of his warfare        well sir—says now to him the master of fair and close reasoning—here sir is the proposition what say you to it—what nothing a man—for ingenuity and promptitude so highly distinguished kept mute by prudence because unable to find anything which a man could utter without shame—what still silent well then the demonstration is complete the proposition uncontrovertible yes altogether uncontrovertible since you sir even you can find nothing to object to it    think now once more of the condition of the disingenuous and selfcondemned wouldbe assailant—when by every fresh proposition he beholds a fresh triumph over him thus secured ☞ after writing what is above came the conception and the hope that an additional optional petition might have its use and that—by the same observations by which explanation and justification have been given to the two first—the like service might in a sufficient degree be rendered to this third by the title of the more abridged petition it is accordingly subjoined petition for justice to the honourable the house of commons in parliament assembled justice justice accessible justice justice not for the few alone but for all no longer nominal but at length real justice in these few words stands expressed the sum and substance of the humble petition which we the undersigned in behalf of ourselves and all other his majestys longsuffering subjects now at length have become emboldened to address to the honourable house at present to all men justice or what goes by that name is either denied or sold denied to the immense many—sold to the favoured few nor to these but at an extensively ruinous price such is the grievance as to the cause it is undeniable power to judges to pay themselves—to pay themselves what they please so it be at the expense of suitors the denial and the sale follow of necessity be the pay in each instance but a farthing to all that cannot pay the farthing justice is denied to all those who can and do pay the farthing sold and the persons on whom alone this burthen is imposed who are they who but the very persons who alone were the exemption possible should be exempted—altogether exempted from it distinguished from all other persons are suitors by the vexation which as such they endure the security whatever it be which by this vexation these so dearly pay for all others enjoy without it and on each man the greater the vexation in other shapes the higher it will be seen is the tax for the longer and thence the more vexatious the suit the more numerous are the occasions on which payment of this species of tax comes to be exacted what if this faculty of setting in the same way their own price upon their own service were given—and why might it not as well be given—to functionaries in other departments—say for example the military the business of military functionaries is to give security against external of judiciary functionaries against internal adversaries what if to the army power were given to exact whatever contributions it pleased so it were from those alone who had been sufferers from hostile inroads by those military functionaries this power has not ever been received by judiciary functionaries it not only has been received but to this day continues to be exercised the tax called shipmoney found a hampden to oppose it to oppose it at the expense first of his money then of his life neither in its principle was that same shipmoney so absurd nor in its worst natural consequences would it have been by a vast amount so mischievous as this justicemoney for so with not less propriety might it be called shipmoney produced its hampden the hampden for justicemoney is yet to seek taxes imposed on suitors at the instance of ministers were bad enough but they are not by a great deal so bad as those imposed by judges ministers cannot without the sanction of parliament give increase to taxes imposed at their instance judges can and do give increase at pleasure to taxes imposed for their own emolument by themselves out of our torments they extract their own comfort and in the way in which they proceed for each particle of comfort extracted for themselves they of necessity heap an unmeasurable load of torment upon us by every fee imposed men in countless multitudes are for want of money to commence to carry on a suit deprived of rights to any amount and left to suffer without redress wrongs to any amount others made to suffer at the hands of judges for want of the money necessary to enable them to defend themselves against unjust suits in all other cases the presumption is that if left to himself man will upon each occasion sacrifice to his own every other interest and upon this supposition are all laws grounded what is there in irresistible power     wrapt in impunity that should make it—what is there in an english judge that should make him—an exception to this rule such being the grievance and such the cause of it now as to the remedy the cause we said for shortness the causes we should have said for there is a chain of them nor till the whole chain has been brought to view can any tolerably adequate conception be entertained of the sole effectual remedy—the natural substituted to the existing technical system of procedure cause of the oppositeness of the system to the ends of justice the sinister interest on the part of the judges with whom it originated cause of this sinister interest the mode of their remuneration instead of salary paid by government fees exacted from suitors cause of this mode of remuneration want of settled revenue in a pecuniary shape for military and other purposes personal service rendered to government being paid for not in money but in land cause of this mode of payment rude state of society in these early times but for the norman conquest no such sinister interest in conjunction with the power of giving effect to it would have had place at the time of that disastrous revolution the local field of judicature was found divided into small districts each with its appropriate judicatory still remaining with small parcels or faint shades of the power are the denominations of those judicatories county courts for example hundred courts courts leet courts baron in each such district in the powers of judicature sharers in form and extent not exactly known the whole body of the freeholders form of procedure the natural the domestic natural—that is to say clear of all those forms by which the existing system—product of sinister art and thence so appositely termed the technical—stands distinguished from it forms all of them subservient of course to the ends of judicature all of them opposite as will be seen to the ends of justice let not any such charge as that of unwarrantable presumption attach on the views which we your petitioners venture thus respectfully to submit to the honourable house be the occasion what it may—when by numerous and promiscuous multitudes expression is given to the same opinions as well as to the same wishes unavoidably different are the sources from which those opinions and those wishes are derived in some reflection made by themselves in others confidence reposed in associates among those in whom on the present occasion the necessary confidence is reposed are those the whole adult part of whose lives the study of the subject has found devoted to it history and description will now proceed handinhand as it was in the beginning so is it now how things are will be seen by its being seen how they came to be so to the arrangements by which the existing system has been rendered thus adverse to the ends of justice will be given the denomination of devices devices having for their purposes the abovementioned actual ends of judicature and under the head of each device in such order as circumstances may in each instance appear to require the attention of the honourable house is solicited for the considerations following—   mischievousness of the device to the public in respect of the adverseness of the arrangement to the ends of justice   subserviency of the device to the purposes of the authors—that is to say the judges and others partakers with them in the sinister interests   impossibility that this adverseness and this subserviency should not have been seen by the authors   impossibility after this exposure that that same adverseness should not now be seen by those to whom the device is a source of profit   incidentally originallyestablished apt arrangements superseded and excluded by the device the ends of justice we must unavoidably remind we will not say inform the honourable house—the ends of justice are—  the giving execution and effect to the rule of action this the main end   the doing so with the least expense delay and vexation possible the collateral end in the main end require to be distinguished two branches   exclusion of misdecision   exclusion of nondecision nondecision is either from nondemand or after demand the first case is that of simple denial of justice the other case is that of denial of justice aggravated by treachery and depredation to the amount of the expense of the collateral end the three branches delay expense and vexation have been already mentioned to these same ends of justice correspondent and opposite will be seen to be the ends—the originally and still pursued actual ends—of judicature from past misdecision comes succeeding uncertainty from the uncertainty litigation from the litigation under the existing feegathering system judges profit from the expense in the more immediate way that same sinister profit from the delay increase to expense and thence to that same profit from the expense and the delay vexation this not indeed the purposed but the unheeded and thence recklessly increased result of the nondecision and the delay ease at the expense of duty will moreover in vast proportion be seen to be the intended and but too successfully cultivated fruit manner in which this mode of payment     took place this originally king officiated not only as commanderinchief but as judge from this reality came the still existing fiction which places him on his own bench in westminster hall present at every cause at the early period in question in the instruments still extant under the name of writs king addresses himself to judge and says—these people are troublesome to me with their noise see what is the matter with them and quiet them—ne amplius clamorum audiamus thus far explicitly and in words implication added a postscript this will be some trouble to you but the labourer is worthy of his hire nothing better could judge have wished for all mankind to whom and all by whom injury had been done or supposed to be done were thus placed at his mercy upon the use of his power he had but to put what price he pleased to every one who regarded himself as injured his assistance was indispensable and proportioned to plaintiffs assurance of getting back from defendant the price of such assistance would be his the plaintiffs readiness to part with it to the defendant permission to defend himself was not less indispensable as to pay all the judge had to choose was between high fees and low fees high fees left at any rate most ease but the higher they were the less numerous the lower the more numerous the hands by which they could be paid thus it was that by kings what was called justice was administered at next to no expense to themselves the only person by whom the burthen was borne being the already afflicted bad enough this but in france it was still worse independently of the taxes imposed under that name directly on the proceedings profit by sale of the power of exacting the judges fees was made a source of revenue and hence instead of four benches with one judge or at most four or five judges on a bench arose all over the country large assembly rooms full of judges under the name of parliaments of the devices to which we shall now intreat the attention of the honourable house the following are the results— i parties excluded from judges presence ii language rendered unintelligible iii written instruments where worse than useless necessitated iv mendacity licensed rewarded necessitated and by judge himself practised v oaths for the establishment of the mendacity necessitated vi delay in groundless and boundless lengths established vii precipitation necessitated viii blind fixation of times for judicial operations ix mechanical substituted to mental judicature x mischievous transference and bandying of suits xi decision on grounds avowedly foreign to the merits xii juries subdued and subjugated xiii jurisdiction where it should be entire split and spliced xiv result of the fissure—groundless arrests for debt explanations we are sensible are requisite explanations follow i device the first—parties excluded from judges presence—demandant not admitted to state his demand nor defendant his defence admitted then only when and because they cannot be shut out admitted just as strangers are admitted without the power of acting for themselves in this device may be seen the hinge on which all the others turn in every other an instrument for giving either existence or effect or continuance to this indispensable one only by indirect means could an arrangement so glaringly adverse to the ends of justice have been established these means it will be seen were the unintelligible language and the written pleadings at the very outset of the business the door shut against the best evidence evidence in the best form from the best sources no light let in but through a combination of mediums by which some rays would be absorbed others refracted and distorted no information let in but through the hands of middle men whose interest it is that redress should be as expensive and for the sake of their share in the expense as tardy as possible for what purpose but the production of deception by exclusion put upon truth and admission given to falsehood could any such arrangement have been so much as imagined for terminating a dispute in a family was ever father mad enough to betake himself to any such course better ground for a commission of lunacy would not be desired no not by any one of the judges by whom the profit from this device is so largely reaped upon each occasion the fathers wish is to come at the truth to come at it whatever be the purpose giving right giving reward administering compensation or administering punishment the fathers wish is to come at the truth and the judges wish—what else ought it to be for coming at the truth the means the father employs are the promptest as well as surest in his power what less effectual means should be those employed by the judge     forget not here to observe how necessary the thus inhibited interview is to the ends of justice—how necessary accordingly the prevention of it to the actual ends of judicature where the parties are at once allowed and obliged each at the earliest point of time to appear in the presence of the judge and eventually of each other where this is the case and in smalldebt courts it is the case the demandant of course brings to view every fact and every evidence that in his view makes for his interest and the defendant on his first appearance does the like if the demand has been admitted demandant applies himself to the extraction of admission from defendant defendant from demandant original demands—cross demands—demands on the one side—demands on the other side—relevant facts on one side—relevant facts on the other side—evidence on the one side—evidence on the other side—all these grounds for decision are thus at the earliest point of time brought to the view of the judge and by anticipation a picture of whatsoever if anything remains of the suit pourtrayed in its genuine most unadulterated and most instructive colours of the goodness or badness of each suitors cause of the correctness or incorrectness of his statements all such evidence is presented to the judges view as it is in the nature of oral discourse gesture and deportment to afford as to mendacity say in the language of reproach lying licence for it could no more be granted to a party in this supposed state of things than to a witness it is in the existing state of things continue the supposition for the truth of whatever is said every man by whom it is said is responsible from the very first being in the presence he is in the power of the judge moreover for continuing such his responsibility as long as the suit renders it needful a mode of communication with him may be settled in such sort that for the purpose of subsequent operations every missive addressed to him in that mode may unless the contrary be proved be acted upon as if duly received in the judicatory of a justice of peace acting singly and in a smalldebt court conducted in this way many and many a suit is ended almost as soon as begun many a suit which in a commonlaw court would have absorbed pounds by hundreds and time by years and after that or without that in an equity court pounds by thousands and time by tens of years as often as upon the demandants own showing the demand is groundless to him who under the present system would be defendant all the expense all the vexation attached to that calamitous situation would be saved to go back to the primeval period which gave rise to this device where in a countless swarm feefed assistants and they alone had to do the business with their partner in trade the feefed judge the reverse of this took place and continues to have place of course everything was and is kept back as long as possible operation was and is made to follow operation—instrument instrument—that each operation and each instrument may have its fees on the one hand notices rendered as expensive as possible are sent for the purpose of their not being received on the other hand of notices that have been received the receipt is left unacknowledged or even denied and in either case assumed not to have place true it is states of things there are in which either at the outset or at this or that time thereafter neither in the instance of both parties nor even of either party can the appearance in question have place for a time longer or shorter by distance or by infirmity bodily or mental a party may stand debarred altogether from making his appearance before the judge or though appearing the aid of an apt assistant may be necessary to him when the party interested is a body corporate or other numerous class composed of individuals assignable or unassignable of agents and other trustees of all sorts the attendance may at the outset or at some later period be necessary with or without that of their respective parties but whatever be the best course the impracticability of it in one instance is it a reason for not pursuing it as far as practicable in any other under the system in its present state certain sorts of suits there are to which the exclusion does not apply itself what are they they are suits in which if thus far justice were not admitted the exclusionists might themselves be sufferers suits for murder theft robbery housebreaking and so forth judges whether they have bowels or no have bodies judges have houses and goods a year or two at commonlaw ten or twenty years in equity would be too long to wait before the criminal could be apprehended but that purpose accomplished off flies justice six months or twelve months as it may happen the accused lies in jail if guilty just so long does he if innocent but of this under the head of delays but says somebody why say excluded when in any one of these courts a suitor makes his appearance is the door of the court shut against him did no instance ever happen of a suitor standing up in court and addressing himself to the judge oh yes once in a term or so scarce oftener and why not oftener even because as every man sees nothing better than vexation is to be got by it and if at any at what period can this     be not at the outset not till the suit has run out an indefinite part of its destined length the judge being in by far the greatest number of individual suits from first to last invisible nor yet an invisible agent but an invisible nonagent mechanical as will be explained mechanical from the outset being the mode to a truly admirable length substituted to mental judicature but suppose the unhappy outcast in court proceedings by the devices that will now immediately be explained—proceedings and even language have been rendered he finds unintelligible to him even if he has counsel of whom besides one for use he must have at least one and may be made to have halfadozen for show if though it be but one of them has opened his mouth the mouth of the unhappy client is not indirectly as above but directly and with the most shameless effrontery inexorably closed the one in whom all his confidence is reposed may by treachery or negligence or craving for greater gain elsewhere have forfeited it three hundred guineas have been given with a brief the fee left unearned and restitution refused if in such circumstances a counsel though it be one who not expecting to be needed is unprepared has but opened his lips no says the judge counsel has spoken for you you shall not speak for yourself a plaintiff had he ever such full licence to speak could he compel the appearance of a defendant not he indeed if both were in court together by accident could either compel answer to a question put to the other as little ii device the second—language rendered unintelligible—it was by this device that in the first instance the exclusion was effected to saxon judicature succeeded that of norman conquerors to saxon liberalism norman absolutism in saxon times reigned in adequate number local judicatories not only countyshires but so to speak still lesser judgeshires hundred courts courts leet courts baron and others then and there people or lawyers made no difference language was the same from the presence of the judge in any one of these small and adequately numerous tribunals directly or indirectly was suitor ever excluded no more than in a private family contending children from the presence of their fathers under the norman kings grew up norman french speaking lawyers whether in the metropolis or elsewhere along with his horses and their grooms one train of these domestics was always in attendance about the person of the king to this train was given the cognizance of all such suits as from such varied distances so various and some of them so long could be made to come to it quartering himself upon vassal after vassal the king was perpetually on the move in his train moved a judge or judges to this train whatever part of the country he had to come from every man who had anything to complain of had to add himself to the place wherever it was that the train happened to be at the defendant had to be dragged when there these same suitors there found a judge or judges who speaking a different language could not or would not understand what they said the language of the normandybred lawyers was a sort of french the language of the country from whence they came these lawyers spoke the language of the country into which they were come they disdained to speak the rules such as they were by which the procedure of these foreign despots—in so far as memory served and selfregarding interest permitted—could be guided would of course be such as their own language gave expression to rules which as well as the rest of the language were to the vast majority of the suitors unintelligible meaning by suitors on this occasion not only those who were actually so but those who but for this obstacle would have been but could not be so justiciables they are called in french in british india this state of things may with a particular degree of facility be conceivable here then by a plaintiff if he would have his demand attended to by a defendant if he could be admitted to contest it—here were two sorts and sets of helpmates to be hired interpreters to convey what passed between parties and their advocates and between witnesses and judge and advocates to plead the cause on both sides between advocates and judges the connexion was most intimate like robbers acting together in gangs and without licence—these licensed irresistible and unpunishable depredators linked together by one common interest acted as brothers and styled one another by that name thus circumstanced they had but to take measure of the disposable property of the suitors and divide it among one another as they could agree in and by this confederacy in a language intelligible seldom to both parties most commonly to neither or what was worse to one alone was the matter talked over and settled as to the truth of what was said how much was true how much was false was not worth thinking about means of ascertaining it there were none parties while exhausting themselves in fees either looked on and stared or seeing that by attendance nothing was to be got but vexation staid away at an early period minutes of these conversations came to be taken by authority and continued so to be till the end of the reign of henry the viii     anno      from which time under the auspices of chance they have been continued down to the present under the name of the yearbooks from the commencement of the reign of edward i anno      they are in greater or less proportion extant in print having been printed anno      by this one allpowerful judicatory metropolitan it might have been styled had the place of it been fixed by this one great frenchspeaking judicatory the little local englishspeaking judicatories were swallowed up remains to be shown how this was managed a suit from which if given for him a man saw he should reap no benefit would not be commenced by him when in a local judicatory in which the plaintiffs demand being so clearly just the defendant would have been sure to lose a suit was depending the judges on each occasion at the instance of the defendant sent to the howsoever distant judicatory an order to proceed no further and to the defendant an order to come and along with the plaintiff add himself to the train as above this having been made the practice and been extensively felt and universally seen to be so thus all over the kingdom was an end put to the business of all these englishspeaking and justiceadministering judicatories if a man who was rich enough beheld within the jurisdiction of one of those judicatories another whom by enmity or any other cause he was disposed to ruin all he had to do was to commence a suit either in the great travelling judicatory or in the first instance in the little first judicatory and thence call it up into this alldevouring one appeal on such occasions does good service this practice evocation in french it is called was anybody may see to how great a degree an improvement upon it if from all these judgeshires howsoever denominated and empowered—county courts hundred courts courts leet and courts baron—appeals had been receivable this would have done much but this would not have done everything some indeed would have passed through the strainer and yielded fees but by far the greater part would have stuck by the way and have thus been useless—upon the vulgar modes of appeal evocation was no small improvement on an appeal misdecision on the part of the inferior authority required to be proved presumption is shorter than proof by an evocation this presumption was regularly made and being made acted upon iii device the third—written instruments where worse than useless necessitated so far from being worse than useless indispensable to perfect judicature is the art of writing in so far as properly applied properly applied it is to three things instrument of demand under the appropriate heads instrument of defence under appropriate heads and on both sides evidence to no one of these three heads belong the so much worse than useless written instruments styled pleadings behold in the first place the use and demand there was for instruments of this sort meaning always with reference to the sinister interests of judge and co then afterwards their particular nature by the unintelligibility given to the language absolutely considered not inconsiderable was the profit gained comparatively speaking relation had to what could be done and was done accordingly very little of the french language the usefulness to judge and co was wearing out not to speak of amicable and commercial intercourse war was ever and anon sending englishmen into france lower and higher orders together by tens of thousands at a time under edward iii a hundred thousand at one time made that fruitless visit to the walls of paris while the use of the french language was thus spreading itself so was the art of writing and with it the use of the latin language among the priesthood it was common and amongst the earliest lawyers were priests now was come the time for pressing preeminently useful art and not altogether useless erudition into the service of discourse written pleadings were added to oral ones added not substituted prefixt being interposed between the delivery of the original scraps of parchment and the debate in court french the spoken matter preceded by latin and that written thus was darkness doubled and difficulty trebled of this darkness the latin part continued unimpaired by any the faintest ray of light till towards the middle of the last century by statute of the  th of george ii anno      the darkness invisible transfigured into the existing darkness visible contemplating it the all but failure blackstone cannot hold his exultation notice to dishonest men in general was then given by the feefed judges is there any man whose property or any part of it you would like to have—any man you would like to ruin if you can drop pence with them into my till till they are tired do what you like and if they call upon me to help them stand fast they shall have their labour for their pains or if you cannot come at them i will do the thing for you this was neither cried nor sung nor said but when acts speak words are needless such was the language then—such is the language now as to the uses—the advantage obtained through mendacity will be brought to view under the next head even supposing the line   0 of truth ever so rigidly adhered to still the advantage could not fail to be considerable to no inconsiderable extent incapacity especially in that rude state of society would do the work of sinister art only by the capacity of paying on the one part for it would any bounds be set to the extent to which without aiming at excess a rambling story might be spun out on either part even from the first to the purpose of giving the proposed defendant to understand he was expected to make his appearance on a certain day at a certain place on pain that should follow was applied it would seem a scrap of parchment paper as yet unknown with a scrap of writing written upon it of the writing latin was the language by anything so vulgar as the conquered language conquerors disdained to sully hands lips or ears it was between this writ so it came afterwards to be called—between this writ and the viva voce discussion that the pleadings were interposed on the occasion of each suit four things there are to distinguish which clearly from each other was and still continues to be found a task of no inconsiderable difficulty these are—  the service demanded of the judge at the charge of the proposed defendants say in one word the demand   the portion of law on which the demand was grounded   the individual matter of fact which it is alleged has brought the individual case within the sort of case for which the provision has been made by the law   the evidence or say the proof by which the existence of these same facts was required and expected to be made manifest not to speak of the law where there not being any really existing portion of law bearing on the sort of case the existence of a portion of law adapted to the plaintiffs purpose must of necessity be assumed assumed—that is to say created by imagination in a form adjusted in some way or other to the demand correspondent was the course necessary to be taken on the defendants side as to the demand next to nothing was the information given in relation to it by the writ remained therefore to be given by the pleadings the particular nature of the service as above demanded together with a statement of the facts on which the demand was grounded with which was chemically combined a dram of the portion of common alias judgemade law which this same demand took for its ground signal was the service rendered to the inventors by this decree—  spoken words could not be sold at so much a dozen the written words could be and were so much for the profit account   of the word of mouth alterations not a syllable could be uttered which the judge did not sit condemned to hear all labour without profit different the case when this preliminary written alteration came to be added once commenced then on it went of itself like a pump set a going by a steamengine the judge receiving his share of the profit on it neither his ears nor his eyes being any part of the time troubled with it so much for the ease account but of this further under the head of mechanical vice mental judicature yet another use the additional and so unhappily permanent served thus as the subjectmatter and groundwork for the subsequent and evanescent mass of profit yielding surplusage by the plaintiff his story had to be told to a sort of agent called in process of time an attorney a word which meant a substitute from this statement the attorney had to draw up a case from this case an advocate styled a sergeant contour afterwards simply sergeant originally styled apprentices—barristers were not hatched had to draw up the pleadings commencing with that styled as above the declaration attached to each of these learned persons was his clerk masters and clerks by each one of them was received his fees father of a family when you have a dispute to settle between two of your children do you ever begin by driving them from your presence—do you send them to attorney special pleader sergeant or barrister think you that by any such assistance any better chance would be afforded you for coming at the truth than by hearing what the parties had to say for themselves page upon page and process upon process each process with fees upon fees—all these for the production of no other effect than what is every day produced all over the country by a line or two in the shape of a summons or a warrant from a justice of the peace a hundredhorse steamengine for driving a cork out of a bottle tell thomas to come here or bring thomas here this is what a father when his wish is to see his son thomas says to his son john father of a family if your power of endurance is equal to the task wade through this mass of predatory trash and imagine if you can the state your family would be in if by no one of your children you could ever get anything done without the utterance of it well then exactly as necessary—exactly as contributive is it to the giving execution and effect to an ordinance of the king in parliament as it would be to the giving execution and effect to an order addressed by you on the most ordinary occasion to any child of yours the judge was in a word a shopkeeper a spurious article stampt with the name of justice the commodity he dealt in by hearing the applicant—the wouldbe plaintiff in     person nothing was to be got by serving the scrap of parchment a fee was to be got one fee and that one like the queen bee mother of a swarm of others to conclude this same subject of written pleadings and the use of it to lawyercraft well might blackstone thus triumph as above well might he felicitate himself and his partners in the firm to his analysis is subjoined an appendix in x numbers the vii last of which are precedents of contract or procedure chiefly procedure still in use numbers vii divided into sections    and in each of several of the sections distinct instruments more than one an exhibition more eminently and inexcusably disgraceful to the head or heart of man scarcely would it be in the power of reward to bring into existence not one of these instances is there in which in an honest intelligible and straightforward way the purpose might not with facility be accomplished in not one of them in any such way is the purpose actually aimed at in every one of them the matter of it is a jargon of the vilest kind composed of a mixture of lies and absurdity in the grossest forms in maleficence much worse than simple nonsense by nonsense no conception of anything being presented by it to anybody no deception would have been produced by this matter to every eye but that of a lawyer a false conception is presented and in his mind if he be not sufficiently upon his guard against it will be produced such was the use derived from this invention in its original and most simple state remain to be brought to view the increments it received earlier or later from the other sources above mentioned from the suborned mendacity—from the established delays from the groundless nullifications on grounds avowedly foreign to the merits and as in process of time jurisdiction as will be seen came to be split then came the ulterior improvements introduced by equity and spirituality equity and spirituality—those two favourite handmaids of the dæmon of chicane iv device the fourth—mendacity licensed rewarded necessitated and by judge himself practised of this contrivance the root will be seen in a distinction taken between pleadings and evidence to mendacity in evidence no allowance is given to mendacity in pleadings full allowance why not to mendacity in evidence because if to this last stage in the suit the allowance had been extended not so much as a shadow of justice would have been kept on foot society could not have been kept together now for this same distinction what ground is there in the nature of the case not any thomas nokes took my horse on such a day naming it—says i john stiles the plaintiff to the judge make him give me back the horse or give me its value in this may be seen the instrument stated first link in the chain of written pleadings—i saw the defendant take the horse says matthew martyr afterwards at the trial this is called proof on evidence matthew martyr if what he thus says is false is punishable but if john stiles though conscious that the defendant never took the horse declare that he did take it and this for the purpose of obtaining the value at his charge why should he be unpunishable rational cause for the distinction none on the other hand for the purpose of depredation under the mask of justice—the reason—the use—the ingenuity of it is admirable by taking off the punishment from this stage of the suit the door was thrown open to every dishonest man who being rich enough felt disposed to hire the judge to enable him then as now by means of the costs of suit to accomplish his dishonest purpose by suffering the punishment to be capable of attaching at the last stage of the suit no advantage was lost before the suit had run this length the defendants ruin may have been accomplished moreover if by this or that man in the character of a witness wilful falsehood comes to have been committed so much the better for here if the purse of the party injured by falsehood not being yet drained passion has got the better of prudence here comes another suit the suit by which the infliction of the punishment is demanded the nature of the destruction thus established behold now the several application made of it—the licence or say permission the remuneration or allowance and the compulsion all together by a preestablished harmony evidenced by usage the judge stands determined that if the defendant having received or been supposed to have received this same first link in the chain of pleadings does not on his part add to it a second he the judge will cause seizure and sale to be made of the defendants goods and the proceeds to the amount in question delivered to the plaintiff what the dishonest plaintiff knew from the first was—that for no lie by which he gave as above commencement to the suit would he be punishable here then was the allowance or say licence what he also knew was—that if the first tissue of lies failed of being in appointed time answered by the defendant in correspondently mendacious prescribed form—he the dishonest plaintiff thus rendered so by the judge by the invitation virtually given to him and everybody by this his hired instrument and accomplice—would receive the contemplated     reward for his dishonesty here then comes the remuneration and the compulsion the remuneration thus given by the judge to the dishonest plaintiff the compulsion thus applied by the judge to the defendant and so on through any number of links in the chain of pleadings had justice been the end aimed at would this have been the course no but a very different one no sale of dearbought strips of parchment befouled by judges lies from the very first no suit commenced but by an interview between the suitor and the judge no ear would the judge have lent to any person in the character of plaintiff but on condition that in case of mendacity he should be subjected to punishment including in case of damage to an individual burthen of compensation thus then vanishes the distinction between pleadings and evidence and of the dishonest suits that then were and now are born and triumph a vast proportion would have been killed in embryo of whatever on this occasion were said by the applicant not a syllable that would not be received and set down as evidence received exactly as if from a stranger to the suit and so in the case of the defendant wherever it were worth while in the thus written evidence the now written and abovedescribed unpunishably mendacious pleadings would have their so uncontrovertibly beneficial substitute now for mendacity practised—by mendacity is understood the quality exemplified by any discourses by which wilful falsehood is uttered habit of mendacity the habit of uttering such discourse uttered by men at large wilful falsehood is termed wilful falsehood uttered by a judge as such it is termed fiction understand judicial fiction poetical fiction is one thing judicial fiction another poetical fiction has for its purpose delectation producing in an appropriate shape pleasure the purpose here a good one or no other is so to a bad purpose it is indeed capable of being applied as discourse in every shape is but in its general nature when given for what it is it is innoxious and in proportion to the pleasure it affords beneficent no deception does it produce or aim at producing so much for poetical fiction now for judicial in every instance it had and has for its purpose pillage object the gaining power means deception it is a portion of wilful falsehood uttered by a judge for the purpose of producing deception and by that deception acquiescence or exercise given by him to power not belonging to him by law if by a lie be understood a wilful falsehood uttered for an evil purpose to what species of discourse could it be applied with more indisputable propriety than to the discourse of a judge uttered for an evil purpose how much to be regretted that for the designation of the sweet and innocent on the one hand the caustic and poisonous on the other the same appellation should be continually in use it is as if the two substances sugar and arsenic were neither of them known by any other name than sugar but the abuse made of this recommendatory word is itself a device an introductory one stuck upon the principal one so much for the delusion now for the criminality obtaining money by false pretences is a crime a crime which except where licensed by public functionaries or uttered by them to and for the benefit of one another is punished with infamous punishment power in so far as obtained by fiction is power obtained by some false pretence and what judicial fiction that was ever uttered was uttered for any other purpose what judicial fiction by which its purpose has been answered has failed of being productive of this effect if obtaining money by false pretences is an immoral practice can obtaining power by false pretences be anything less so if silver and gold are to be had the one for the other so can power and money if then either has value has not the other likewise if obtaining or endeavouring to obtain money by false pretences is an act presenting a wellgrounded demand for legal punishment so in its origin at any rate was not the act of obtaining or endeavouring to obtain by those same means power power whether in its own shape or in this or that other shape as to the period—the time at which this device had its commencement in practice can scarcely have been so early as the original period so often mentioned lies are the instruments rather of weakness than of strength they who had all power in their hands had little need of lies for the obtaining of it on every occasion on which any one of these lies was for the first time uttered and applied to use persons of two or three distinguishable classes may be seen to whom in different shapes wrong was thus done the functionary or functionaries whose power was by and in proportion to the power thus gained invaded and diminished and the people at large in so far as they became sufferers by the use made of it which is what in almost every instance not to say in every instance upon examination they would be seen to be in the present instance functionaries or say authorities of two classes are discernible     the authority from which the power was thus filched was either that of the sovereign their common superordinate—or the coordinate authority viz that of some judge or judges coordinate with that of the stealers in a certain way by the deception thus put upon him the sovereign was a party wronged in so far as power was taken from any judge to whom it had by him been given but this was a wrong little if at all felt the only wrong felt certainly and in any considerable degree was that done to another judge or set of judges say stealing or what is equivalent as being shorter than to say obtaining under false pretences in each instance if deception and by means of it powerstealing was not the object of the lie object it had none it was an effect without a cause by a man in a high situation a lie told for the purpose of getting what he had already or could get without difficulty without a lie—such conduct is not in human nature as to sufferings nominal only as above observed were they on the part of the supreme and omnipotent functionary here supposing them real no sooner had they been felt than they would have been made to cease and no memorial of them would have reached us not so in the case of learned brethren stealing power from them was stealing fees accordingly when towards the close of the seventeenth century a theft in this shape had been committed war broke out in westminsterhall and fictions moneysnatching lies were the weapons but of this under the head of jurisdictionsplitting there all the while on his throne sat the king that king charles ii but to a charles ii not to speak of a king in the abstract war between judge and judge for fees was war between dog and dog for a bone now come the real sufferers—the people subjection to arbitrary power is an evil or nothing is an evil and that an allcomprehensive one now every power thus acquired is in its essence arbitrary for if to the purpose of obtaining anything valuable—call it money call it power—allowance is given to a man on any occasion at pleasure to come out with a lie which done the power becomes his what is it he cannot do for where is the occasion on which a lie cannot be told and in particular on the whole expanse of the field of law no limits being assigned where is the lie which if in his conception any purpose of his whatever it be will be answered by it may not be told accordingly wilful falsehoods more palpably repugnant to truth were never uttered than may by all who choose to see it be seen to have been uttered and for the purpose of obtaining power by english judges take for example the common recovery fiction a tissue of lies such that to convey to a nonlawyer any comprehensive conception of it would require an indefinite multitude of pages after the reading of which it would be conceived confusedly or not at all but what belongs to the present purpose will be as intelligible as it is undeniable   descriptions of persons stolen from three—  children in whose favour a mass of immoveable property had been intended to be made secure against alienation eventual subjectmatter of this property no less than the soil of all england   landowners by whom by payment of the fees exacted from them was purchased of the judges of the court in question—the common pleas—that power of alienation which they ought to have gratis or not at all   professional men—conveyancers the whole fraternity of them—despoiled in this way of a share of such their business by the intrusion of these judges now for the falsehood—the artful and shameless predatory falsehood—by which all these exploits were performed officiating at all times in the court in which these judges were sitting was a functionary styled the crier of the court his function calling individuals in proportion as their attendance was required into the presence of the judges sole source and means of his subsistence fees in magnitude the aggregate of them correspondent to the nature of his function behold now the fiction a quantity of parchment having been soiled by a compound of absurdities and falsehoods prepared for the purpose and fees in proportion received for the same a decision was by these same judges pronounced declaring the restriction taken off and the proprietors so far free to alienate to the parties respectively despoiled a pretended equivalent being given of which presently persons whom it was wanted for—not to speak of persons not yet in esse and in whose instance accordingly disappointment might be prevented from taking place young persons in existence in indefinite multitudes from whom on the several occasions in question their property though as yet but in expectancy was thus taken—taken by these same judges whose duty it was to secure it to them now for the equivalent to all persons thus circumstanced it was thought meet to administer satisfaction it was by a speech to the following effect that the healing balm was applied—children we take your estate from you but for the loss of it you will not be the worse here is mr moreland that was always the gentlemans name he happens to have an estate of exactly the same value this we will take from him and it shall be yours exactly in this way on one and the same     day were estates in any number disposed of at the appointed price by these supposed and by suitors intituled ministers of justice such was the proceeding then and such it continues to this day there we have one fiction now for a parallel to it once upon a time in fairy land in the court of a certain judge under the seat of the crier of the court was a gold mine on a touch given to the seat by a wand kept for the purpose by the judge out flowed at any time a quantity of gold ready melted into an appropriate receptacle and on the turning of a cock stopt here we have a fiction which if it be a silly is at any rate an innocent one be it ever so silly is there anything in it more palpably repugnant to truth than in that predatory and flagitious one two points could they be but settled might here afford to curiosity its aliment—   point the first those fictions such as they are in what number could they be picked up like toadstools in the field of common law by dozens at any rate or by scores to go no farther they might be counted roman lawyers too have theirs but for every romebred fiction a dozen englishbred ones to speak within compass might be found   point the second birthday of the fiction—latest hatched and let fly to prey upon the people—was it the day next before that of the first newspaper—was it that of the last witch burnt or hanged be the species of imposition what it may—be the field of deception what it may a time there will always be after which new impostures will not grow on it but as to the time when those which have root at present will be weeded out this question is a very different one by the operation here in question good will it be said good in a certain shape was done—good for example of the nature of that which it belongs to political economy and constitutional law to give indication be it so but be it ever so great good considered as actually resulting is on this occasion nothing to the purpose only lest it should be thought to be overlooked is mention thus made of it the only good which is to the purpose is the good intended lastly as to certain ulterior uses of this species of poetry to the reverend and learned poets those of the coarsest and most obvious sort—powerstealing and moneystealing—having been already brought to view to complete the catalogue require to be added—  benefit from the double fountain constituted as above   benefit from the thickening thus given to confusion i first as to the double fountain a juggler there was and a fountain he had out of which at command flowed wine red or white without mixture this reality for such it is may help to explain one use and that a universally applying one the purpose whatever it be is it by the truth that it is best served the argument is drawn from the truth side is it by the fiction side from which the argument is drawn the falsehood such being the emblem now for the application be the mess what it may truth is always the substance of it lies how coarse and gross soever but the seasoning the purpose whatever it be—is it by the fiction that it is best served from the fiction side it is that the argument is drawn is it by the truth alone that the purpose can be served it is to the truth with whatsoever reluctance that recourse is had thus quacunque via data as the law latin phrase has it the point is gained   lastly as to the benefit from the confusion that proportioned to the extent to which nonconception or what is so much better misconception in regard to the rule of action has place on the part of those who are made to suffer in proportion to their noncompliance with it the particular interest of judge and co is served these are propositions of which the whole substance of this our humble petition is one continual proof that the giving to these two so intimately connected states of things the whole policy of this class of politicians has from first to last been universally directed is another proposition to which the same proof applies itself with the same force but to say that by and in proportion to the degree of confusion that has place in the aggregate mass of ideas produced by the aggregate mass of discourse expressed in relation to the subject and received this same purpose is answered is but to say the same thing in other words if to the intelligibility of that which is here said about unintelligibility any addition can be made by the sort of imagery so much in request—out of each one of judge and cos double fountains rises at all times a thick fog each one after another will be brought to view namely under the head of device the eleventh—decision on grounds foreign to the merits v device the fifth—oaths for the establishment of the mendacity necessitated that the ceremony of an oath is the instrument by means of which the licence to commit mendacity is effected has just been stated now as to the mode of applying the instrument to this purpose nothing can be more simple on the occasion of any statement about to be made on a juridical occasion or for an eventually juridical purpose is it your wish you being a judge that mendacity should not have place you cause the individual by whom the statement is made to have     just before the making of it borne his part in this same ceremony on the occasion of any statement so made is it your wish that mendacity should have place you abstain from requiring the performance of this same ceremony and at the same time you give to the naked statement so made whatsoever effect it suits your purpose to give to it not that it was for this purpose that the ceremony itself was invented for along with the time the cause of its invention is lost in the darkness of the early ages all that on this occasion is meant is—that it is for the purpose of organizing mendacity and giving to that vice every practical increase that the ceremony being found already in use was taken advantage of properties which we shall now present to the view of the honourable house this instrument as possessing are the following they consist in its being—   needless to wit for the purpose of repressing mendacity on judicial occasions or for a judicial purpose   inefficacious on these same occasions   mischievous to an enormous extent in a variety of ways   inconsistent with the received notions belonging to natural religion   antiscriptural   useful to judge and co eminently subservient to their particular and sinister interest and as such cherished by them first as to needlessness for the needlessness of this ceremony on the sort of occasion or for the sort of purpose in question we humbly call to witness your honourable house prime in legislation is in effect the part borne by you in your hands is the public purse with you with few and casual exceptions laws originate take any law whatsoever in the scale of importance what in comparison with the power of making that same law is the power of exercising in relation to it an act of judicature reversable of course at pleasure by the powers by which the law was enacted well then—when at the instance of the honourable house a law has been enacted—this same law was it passed upon determinate grounds or was it groundless to style it groundless would be to pass condemnation on it it having determinate grounds and those grounds appropriate of what then are those same grounds composed answer of matters of fact and nothing else for nothing else is there of which they can be composed on the occasion in question these same matters of fact whatsoever they may be will respectively either be considered as already sufficiently notorious or not if not then will the existence of them for the purpose of this same act of legislation as for the purpose of any act of judicature be considered as requiring to be established by evidence no otherwise than in as far as thus grounded and warranted can any law whatever be anything better than an act of wanton despotism most laudable accordingly—unmatched in any other country upon earth is the scrutinizing attention and perseverance so constantly employed by your honourable house in the collection of appropriate witnesses and the elicitation of their testimony of their testimony and in what shape in that which is the very best possible oral examination subject to counterinterrogation from all quarters reexamination at any time and with the maximum of correctness secured to it by being minuted down as elicited and subjected afterwards to correction by the individual from whom it emanated behold here a mode of proceeding dictated by a real desire to elicit true and appropriately complete information the desire accompanied with a thorough knowledge of the most effectual means for the accomplishment of it well then for securing to each article of information thus elicited the same character of truth at the hands of each witness putting out of the question the spiritual motive what are the temporal motives which in the shape of eventual punishment in case of mendacity your honourable house makes application of answer in a direct shape imprisonment only with or without fine in an unimmediate and indirect shape fine for the extraction of which the imprisonment is the only instrument now then as to the ceremony called swearing or taking an oath whether it be for want of power whether it be for want of will—the single case of election judicature excepted and that no otherwise than in pursuance of a special act of parliament—no use does your honourable house ever make of this same ceremony what follows does mendacity find the honourable house impotent on the contrary much more effectual is its power against this vice than that of ordinary judicature with its expensive prosecution and severer punishment why because while the mode of elicitation employed is such as needs not the assistance of the ceremony its mode of procedure is such as is able to cause the punishment to follow instantaneously upon the offence yet has it as yet a weakness to which consistency will one day it is hoped apply the obvious remedy standing at the highest pitch at the commencement of each parliament it sinks this indispensable power as the parliament advances in age till at last it is sunk in utter decrepitude after such a demonstration of the needlessness of this ceremony but for the importance and novelty of the subject other proofs might be put aside as being themselves needless important the subject may well be styled or     no other is so for so long as this ceremony has place justice to the prodigious extent that will be seen is absolutely incapable of having place to the benefit of the testimony of quakers ever since the year      justice has without the benefit of this ceremony by various statutes been admitted in cases called civil cases and now by a statute of      in cases called criminal and penal cases if then as a security against mendacity the ceremony is indispensable in the case of all other men can it be needless or safely omitted in the case of these moreover on any one of these occasions what is there to hinder a nonquaker from personating a quaker clothed in the habit and speaking the language of a quaker suppose a nonquaker by his evidence giving success to doe in a case in which otherwise it would have gone to roe the imposture afterwards discovered would success change hands on the evidence of an impostor of this sort suppose a man convicted of murder and executed the imposture being afterwards discovered would the felony be transmuted into a nonfelony and the hanging operation be in law language declared void not only in the case of a class of men so well known as this of quakers but in the case of a class comparatively so little known as that of moravians has justice been in possession of this same benefit ever since the year      by statute    geo ii ch  0 of detriment to justice from this allowance in what instance was any suspicion ever entertained was not the assuredness of the absence of all increased danger of mendacity from this admission in civil cases—was not this the cause of the extension given to it in criminal cases so much for needlessness   now as to inefficiency considered with reference to the purpose here in question oaths stand distinguished into assertory and promissory but in both cases the sanction is precisely the same take then for example oaths of the promissory sort because these stand clear of various points of contestation which have place in the case of assertory oaths whereas in the case of a promissory oath if violation has place seldom does the fact of the violation stand exposed to doubt now then for the examples example the first protestant sees in ireland bishops    archbishops   together    previously to investiture oath taken by every bishop promising to see that in every parish within his diocese a school of a certain description shall have place of the aggregate of these oaths what in the year      was the aggregate fruit performances     perjuries   0 when received and communicated—so at least says the solemn office—when received and communicated behold the preservative power of the holy ghost in these minds against perjury example the second in england through the university of oxford pass one half of the   000 or   000 churchofengland clergy through the university of cambridge the other half in oxford preeminent in uselessness and frivolousness a volume of statutes receives at entrance from each member in every article of it as security for observance an appropriate promissory oath now for the effect on no day does any one of these academics tread on the pavement of that same holy city without trampling upon some one or more of these oaths held up to the inexorably conniving eyes of the constituted authorities has been the contempt thus put upon this ceremony—held up not by strangers only but by members—not by laymembers only but by clerical members—for more than the last half century by a clerical member—vicesimus knox—in a work editions of which in number between  0 or  0 are in circulation so much for promissory oaths to come back to assertory oaths stand forward customhouse oaths for demonstration of the inefficiency—the uncontested and incontestible inefficiency—these two words supersede volumes exacted to a vast extent the assertion of facts of which in the nature of things it is not possible that the assertor should have had any knowledge how prodigious the benefit to finance and trade if asseveration with appropriate punishment in case of mendacity were substituted and by adverse interrogation a defendant made subjectible to a limited loss as by equity interrogation he is to loss of all he has thus simple is the arrangement by which without the illusory assistance of the thus universally contemned ceremony finance might be made to assume a new and healthful face trade be made to receive changes in great variety generally regarded as beneficial and pounds by hundreds of thousands ayear—not to say millions be saved so much for needlessness and inefficaciousness   now as to mischievousness of the immense mass of evil constantly flowing from this source a part and but a part—has as yet been presented to the view of the honourable house—namely under the last head the head of mendacity   by so simple a process as the declining to act a part in this ceremony any man who has been the sole percipient witness to a crime may whatever be that crime—murder or still worse—after appearing as summoned give impunity to it without the trouble or formality     producing thus the effect of pardon sharing thus with his majesty this branch of the prerogative and even in cases in which his said majesty stands debarred from exercising it   by the same easy process in a case called civil may any man give to any man any estate of any other man not quite so easy says somebody for would not this be a contempt and would he not of course be committed may be so but when the murderer has been let off or the man in the right has lost his cause would the commitment last for life—in a word what would become of it but to no such peril need he expose himself a process there is which is still easier i am an atheist he need but pronounce these four words the pardon is sealed or does estate is given to roe but of this more presently behold now perjury established by law established on the most extensive—established on an allcomprehensive scale established by impunity coupled with remuneration altogether irresistible such is the effect of test oaths of these oaths some are or may be assertory some promissory some assertory and promissory in one declaration of opinions entertained declaration of course of actions determined to be pursued or of opinion determined to be entertained to be entertained spite of all conviction and persuasion to the contrary for perjury in this shape premium the highest given for good desert in any shape—for appropriate aptitude in the official situations the most richly remunerated of the whole of the expenditure of government a vast proportion thus employed in raising annual and continually increasing crops of perjuries and while such is the reward impunity is absolute and secure oh the admirable security a man who with or without pecuniary reward has for any number of years together as above been leading a life of perjury is to be regarded—not only as capable but as almost sure of being stopt from giving his acceptance to any of the very richest rewards in the kings gift stopt by the fear of no more than what if anything may follow from one single instance of perjury and that a completely unpunishable one—made to refuse for example an archbishoprick of canterbury with its £  000 ayear and its et cæteras upon et cæteras sowing oaths and reaping perjuries is a mode of husbandry in a particular instance affected to be disapproved by blackstone but in that instance compared with this the scale is that of a gardenpot to that of a field bidding thus high for perjury is it possible that of the selfsame man it should be the sincere wish to prevent it what then says somebody the fear of punishment at the hands of the almighty—is that to be set down as nothing the answer is yes on this particular occasion as amounting absolutely to nothing but of this presently by the inducting of these same reverend right reverend and most reverend selfstyled perjurers for so they are specially declared to be by these their own statutes has been established the national school of church of england orthodoxy these things considered and the use made of oaths on judicial occasions—westminster hall not to mention its near neighbourhood may it not be styled the great national school of perjury what then says somebody are all tests meant to be thus condemned oh no tests for declarations of the party concurred with by a man on this or that occasion may be useful useful and even necessary and at any rate unexceptionable in some cases by acceptance in other cases by nonacceptance useful indications may be afforded on an occasion of this sort who are they whom you choose to be considered as siding with this is the question propounded by the call to join in the declaration and in this case no mendacity need have place   so much for needlessness inefficiency and mischievousness now as to repugnance to natural religion this supposed punishment for the profanation on whom is the infliction of it supposed to depend on the almighty no but in the first instance at any rate on man alone no oath tendered no offence is committed no offence committed on no man punishment inflicted according to the oathemploying theory man is the master the almighty the servant in respect to the treatment to be given to the supposed liar the almighty is not left to his own choice in the event in question at the requisition of the human the divine functionary is made to inflict an extra punishment exactly of a piece with the authority exercised by a chiefjustice of the kings bench over the sheriff of a county is the authority there by every man who has purchased it pretended to be exercised over the almighty in westminsterhall procedure the chiefjustice is the magisterial officer the sheriff of the county in question a ministerial officer acting under him a written instrument called a writ the medium of communication through which to the subordinate the command of his superordinate is signified in the case of the oath the man by whom the oath is administered performs the part of the chiefjustice the almighty that of the sheriff acting under him and the kiss given to the book performs the service of the writ is it by a country attorney dignified by     the title of masterextraordinary in chancery—is it by this personage that the oath is administered in this case it is the attorney that the almighty has for his master now and by the shilling paid to the attorney—by this shilling it is that the almighty is hired on the expectation of the addition thus to be produced to the spiritual punishment appointed by the almighty of himself for mendacity—on this alone depends the whole of the molehill of advantage if any such there be capable of being set against the mountain of evil that has just been brought to view of mendacity variable is the maleficence on a scale corresponding to that of the maleficent act of which it is made or endeavoured to be made the instrument of the profanation of the ceremony the guilt if any is one and the same infinitely diversified in respect of degree of importance are the purposes to which this instrument such as it is is wont to be applied does it in its nature possess any capacity of being by its variability in quantity and thence in form accommodated to these several purposes not any the punishment if any the infliction of which is expected is in every instance the same for which the attorney for his shilling draws upon the almighty this draught will it be honoured but says somebody for binding a mans attention to the importance of the occasion some mark of distinction between an assertion that is and one that is not intended to be legally operative—may it not be of use yes doubtless but for this purpose no such preposterous pretended assumption of authority over the creator by the creature is either necessary or in any degree useful by the word asseveration the appropriate extraordinary application of the faculty of attention is already sufficiently indicated on occasions of the sort in question in the instance of the people called quakers by special allowance from the legislature already in use is the word affirmation this word might not improperly serve but the word asseveration is perhaps in some degree preferable since it presents to view more assuredly than does the word affirmation the idea of a special degree of attention and decision beyond what has place on ordinary and comparatively unimportant occasions   now as to repugnancy to scripture—thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain so says the second of the ten commandments swear not at all these are the words of jesus as reported in the gospels above all things swear not these are the words of st james in his epistle but for texts of scripture when troublesome there are rules of interpretation one of them is the rule of contraries says god to man—thou shalt not perform any such ceremony says man to god—i do perform this ceremony and thou shalt punish every instance of disregard to it suppose the almighty prepared to punish every or any instance of disregard to this ceremony you suppose him employed in sanctioning disobedience to his own express commandments if to the compellers of such oaths punishment in a life to come were at all an object of consideration the punishment attached to disobedience—to commandments thus plain and positive would produce in their minds an impression rather more efficacious than what has been seen produced as above by the punishment supposed to be attached to a disregard for the purely human and recently invented ceremony but for the use of so useful an instrument of profitable maleficence no punishment is too great to be encountered the punishment say they what matters it turning aside from it we extinguish it the thus imagined supernatural punishment has it really any efficiency in the character of an auxiliary to human punishment and a security against maleficence in its several shapes if yes why thus narrow the benefit producible by it—why not make out at once a complete list of maleficent acts of all sorts fit to be in due form of law converted into offences this done collectively or upon occasion severally the promissory declaration may be attached to them and the book kissed this done and not before consistency will take the place of its opposite and so far the practice of swearing against conviction cease   so much for needlessness inefficiency repugnancy to natural religion repugnancy to revealed religion as well as abundancy in mischievousness now for use to judge and co—multifarious and extensive is this use the capital use establishment of the mendacitylicence with the increase given to the profit by written pleadings keeps pace with the mischievousness of the practice and has been already brought to view but the use of oaths to the partnership does not stop here the greater the quantity of immorality in all shapes but more particularly in that of injustice the greater the quantity of the profits for the more immorality the more transgressions the more transgressions the more suits the more suits the more fees this series presents a clue or say a key which comes to the same thing to all the arrangements which enter into the composition of judgemade law by the confusion with which the field of law has thus been covered observance of oaths or breach of oaths according as countenanced by a judge being regarded as a merit and a duty thus it is that judges have come to be regarded as invested with the power of converting right into wrong and wrong into     right right and wrong following continually the finger as the phrase is of the law decency as well as that inadequate degree of efficiency which their own particular interest requires to be given to those parts of the law on which personal security depends join in necessitating as above some restraint on mendacity in certain cases at the same time their official and professional interest requires that to a vast extent that same security should be inefficient by a compromise between these two antagonising interests has been produced the form of the prosecution for perjury not applying the temporal punishment but in the comparatively small number of instances in which it has been preceded by this ceremony and application of it requiring a separate suit with two witnesses to give effect to it—a suit of which the expense to the prosecutor is great and the advantage in case of success limited to the few cases in which it has for its effect the reversal of the judgment grounded on the false testimony they thus make a show and no more than a show of wishing to extinguish the vice to the propagation of which so far as profitable to them their endeavours have been so diligently and successfully directed bating this rare case ere any such prosecution can have been instituted signal must have been the triumph of passion over prudence among ten thousand perjuries committed is there so much as one punished for ten might have been put a hundred or for a hundred a thousand built originally for feasting westminster hall is thus become the great national school for perjury picking out men in whose breasts the aversion to mendacity is strongest and most incontestible—picking out these men and expelling them from the witnesss box with ignominy stampt on their characters—is another service extracted by judge and co from this ceremony in the instance of one half of that order of men who are so richly paid for professing to impress morality in all its shapes upon the conduct of the rest of the community the universality of habitual perjury has been already brought to view one of those suits which the existing system engenders in such multitudes—a suit in which one of the parties is conscious of being in the wrong has suppose place one percipient witness there is who being tendered for admission as a narrating witness is on good grounds believed by this dishonest suitor to be an atheist but atheist as he is nothing does it happen to him to have or to be so much as supposed to have to bias him and warp his testimony one way or the other and no man is maleficent without a motive answering to his call this man places himself in the witnesss box the learned counsel has his instructions sir says he do you believe in a god what follows answering falsely the proposed witness is admitted he cannot be rejected answering truly he is silenced and turned out with ignominy the martyr to virtue the martyr to veracity receives the treatment given to a convicted felon the atheist was unseen and silent these lawyers drag him into broad daylight and force into the public mind the poison from this confessing and thus corrupting tongue what will not the advocate do—what will not the feefed judge support him in doing for their fees an inquisition this high—commission court all over for the purpose of thus punishing the offence they create it themselves accessaries before the fact themselves suborners individuals they thus invest with the power of pardon—thus do these sworn guardians of the kings prerogative individuals—and what individuals in the first place these same atheists in the next place all christians and other theists whom they have succeeded in rendering mendacious enough to pretend to be atheists a murderer suppose is on his trial necessary to conviction is the testimony of an individual who has just mounted the box before the oath is tendered—first may it please your lordship let me ask this man a question says the counsel for the murderer thereupon comes the dialogue counsel—sir do you believe in a god proposed witness—no sir judge—away with him his evidence is inadmissible out walk they arminarm murderer and atheist together laughing murderer to commit other murders pregnant with other fees robbers in gangs go about suppose and to suppress testimony murdering all whom they rob and all who are supposed by them to have seen or to be about to see them rob on being taken one of them suppose turns kings evidence question by prisoner or prisoners counsel—do you believe in a god answer in the negative off goes the witness and off with him goes the prisoner will it be said that the condition not having been performed that is to say the procurement of the defendants conviction the pardon will not be granted and the accomplice will be hanged not he indeed no sooner does any one of these murderers enter the witness box than by judge and co if not an atheist already he is thus converted to atheism the consequence is—the necessary evidence being thus excluded the virtual pardon of the whole gang—this man along with the rest—takes place of course another use to judge and co from the   0 allcorrupting ceremony the shilling per oath received for the administration thereof the shillings in front with pounds in many cases in the background hence patronage with reference to the situations in which this profit is received considerations these by no means to be neglected what is there that is ever overlooked in the account of fees another case an instrument in the hand of hypocrisy—an instrument to cajole a jury with—is another character in which the ceremony is of special use to a judge it forms a charm by the fence of which transgression in every shape is rendered impossible to him gentlemen of the jury you are upon your oaths i am upon mine mine calls upon me to do so and so quoth the ermined hypocrite out comes thereupon whatever happens to suit his purpose on any adequately great occasion appropriate gesture—application of hand to bosom might give increase to stage effect speaking of a noble lord as having been saying so and so—my lords said a judge once he smote that sacred tabernacle of truth his bosom your oath what oath who ever saw it—where is it to be seen unless it be on the back of the roll on which is written the body of your common law one of three things either you never took any such oath at all or if you did it was either a nugatory or a maleficent one a promise for example on all occasions to make sacrifice of all other interests to the interest of the ruling one an old printed book there is intituled the book of oaths and of one or other of these two descriptions are the several oaths therein stated as taken by judges at any rate whatever oath you took if any in no ones presence was it taken but that of him by whom it was administered in what better light therefore than that of a fresh act of mendacity and imposture can any such mention of an oath be ever regarded by a reflecting juryman so much for the punishment of mendacity under the existing system now suppose a system substituted having for its ends in view the ends of justice great beyond present possibility of conception would be the security which against fraud and deception would be given by attaching punishment to mendacity in whatever instance mendacity had been uttered either on a judicial occasion or for a judicial purpose punishment would stand attached to it of course against fraud and maleficent deception to whatsoever purpose endeavoured to be applied great not only beyond example but beyond conception would be the security thus afforded oaths and perjuries abolished—punishment for mendacity would be at liberty to bend itself and would of course bend itself to the form of every offence to every modification of which the evil of an offence is susceptible judicial is the occasion in so far as it is in the course of a suit actually commenced that the assertion is elicited judicial the purpose that is to say the eventual purpose where the assertion is uttered for the purpose of being eventually employed as evidence should ever a suit have place on the occasion of which it might serve as evidence take for instance a false recital in a conveyance in an engagement meant to be obligatory false vouchers in accounts thus in the case of a voucher receptor in account with creditor produces from venditor or from faber a voucher acknowledging the receipt of a sum of money for goods furnished to receptor to be employed in the service of creditor in fact he has received no more than half the sum the other half being undue profit divided between them under the existing system on evidence in no better shape are accounts audited evidence received as conclusive the mere production of a receipt to creditor in this case what difference does it make whether it be by a forged receipt that he is defiauded of this money or by a falsely asserting though genuine receipt as above yes for no such false assertion is there any punishment appointed under the name of punishment under the name of satisfaction refunding of the undue profit yes but for this a suit in equity is necessary a suit in which for the recovery of five shillings at the end of five years or in case of appeal ten years creditors may have to advance £ 00 or £ 000 losing in case of success a fourth part of the money in unallowed costs on no better security against fraud than this have public accountants received discharges for hundreds of millions of pounds on the ground of any such voucher any such venditor or faber might be made examinable it any time and in case of original fraud as above or false asseveration in the course of the examination punishable according to the quality and quantity of the wrong fraudulently or otherwise mendaciously false recital in conveyances or in engagements meant to be obligatory including contracts—falsehood in the recitals of instruments in which registration of obligatory dealings of either of those two classes is performed newspaper or other paper under false denominations printed and circulated for the purpose of influencing the prices of public securities—all these vehicles of falsehood would thus receive a mode and degree of repression at present unexampled and until now unconceived thus intimate is the connexion between legalized swearing and frand in a word as has been seen between this compulsorily and irresistibly legalized vice and crime and immorality in every imaginable shape with lawyers profit from every imaginable source     swear not at all—cease to take the name of the lord in vain by these commandments repeated every day at table with or without the grace before meat in every house more would be done towards the extinction of crime and immorality than would ever be done by preaching though every house were to have a pulpit in it how long will men continue to seek to cause god to apply a punishment he had no intention of applying—to cause him—say rather to force him leaving only the time and the quantum to his choice for on the ceremony performed the everlasting punishment is assumed to follow as a thing of course when will legislators and judges cease to be suborners of perjury—of perjury on an allcomprehensive scale the passion for these universal oaths and which is the same thing for perjuries can there be no means of administering to its gratification without the boundless expenditure of crime immorality and consequent misery if without the special and specific mischief produced in so many shapes as above simple oaths with correspondent perjuries will content them perjuries of both sorts assertory and promissory they may have their fill of each man may perform them for himself and he may have strings of beads to tell them on each man may thus perform them for himself or in proportion to his opulence he may for adequate remuneration cause them in any desirable quantity to be performed by others by means of preestablished signs he might even for this same purpose press into the service the powers of machinery and steam he might perform them in the chinese style and for every oath taken have a saucer broken and thus at no greater expense than the sacrifice of religion morality and happiness confer a benefit on that branch of trade for the loss by assertory perjuries amateurs might indemnify themselves by increase given to the stock of promissory ones if this be not agreeable let all hitherto published editions of the bible be called in and appropriately amended editions substituted out of thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain let be omitted the word not for swear not at all after the word swear let be inserted the words swear and cause swear whatever you will whenever by you or yours anything is to be got by it thus would be wiped clean the irreligiousness of the practice and nothing would be left in it worse than the immorality of it not inconsiderable is the service so recently rendered by the extending to cases styled criminal the admission so long ago given to quakers and moravians evidence in cases styled civil yet how inadequate and thence how inconsistent the remedy if it stops there finally in whatsoever is now deemed and taken to be perjury guilt over and above that which consists in the mendacity either has or has not place if guilt there is none then by the supposition the ceremony by which the mendacity is constituted perjury is of no use if guilt there is we humbly pray that whatsoever by the honourable house can be done may be done towards exonerating us and the rest of his majestys subjects from the burthen of it and in particular such of us whose destiny on any occasion it may be to serve as jurymen for if in perjury there may be guilt we see not how by mens sitting in a jurybox it is converted into innocence accordingly that which in relation to this subject we pray for in conclusion is—that by the substitution of the words affirm and affirmation or asseverate and asseveration to the words swear and oath all persons at whose hands on a judicial occasion any declaration in relation to a matter of fact is elicited or received may be put upon the same footing as in and by the statute of the  th of his present majesty george iv chapter    quakers and moravians are in respect of matters therein mentioned and that on no occasion on which in the course of a trial a person is called upon to deliver evidence any question be put to him having for its object the causing him to make declaration of any opinion entertained by him on the subject of religion now for the petty jurymans oath assertory or promissory—to which class shall it be aggregated as the interval between promise and performance lessens the promissory approaches to till at last it coincides with the assertory assertory beyond doubt is the witnesss oath as clearly would be the jurymans if the verdict followed upon the hearing of each witnesss testimony as promptly as the delivery of that same testimony follows upon the performance of the swearing ceremony of this instrument the inefficiency as to the production of the professedly desired effect—that is to say the exclusion of mendacity—its efficiency on the contrary as to the production of the opposite effect with the perjury in addition to it—these are the only results the exhibition of which belongs in strictness to the present purpose but another point too closely connected with this and too important to be passed over is its mischievousness another distinguishable point is the absurdity of this part of the institution and without bringing this likewise into view neither the inefficiency nor the whole of the misefficiency can be brought to view indeed to show the absurdity of the notion is to show its mischievousness at any rate if intellectual imbecility in the public mind     be a mischief and adherence to gross absurdity a proof of it mark well the state of the case men acting together in a body twelve business of the body declaration of an opinion on two matters taken in conjunction—matter of fact and matter of law first as to the matter of fact subjectmatter of the declaration a question between a and b a being either an individual or a functionary acting in behalf of the public on a certain occasion at the time and place in question did an individual fact belonging to a certain species of facts take place or not this species of fact—is it of the number of those in relation to which provision has been and continues to be made by such or such a portion of the law of this sort in every case are two points in relation to which each man of the twelve is called upon to deliver his opinion as expressed in one or other of two propositions one or the other of which they being mutually contradictory propositions cannot fail of being true laying out of the question for simplicitys sake the rare case of a sort of verdict called special yes on the question of law for the comparatively rare case of a special verdict excepted in the subjectmatter of the opinion declared is the matter of law included as often as a verdict is delivered say in cases called civil but implicitly but in cases called penal as often as the verdict is against the defendant most explicitly for in the legal sense of the word guilty which is the only sense here in question be the act what it may doing it is not being guilty unless that act stands prohibited by some law really existing law in the case of written statute law feigned to exist in the case of common law in this one of the four or five different meanings of the word be the subjectmatter of opinion what it may—be the class of men what it may—be the number of them what it may—to cause them to be all of one mind all you have to do is to put into their heads the opinion it is your wish to see adopted and having stowed them in a jurychamber keep them till they are tired of being there in what abundance might not time labour and argument—all these valuable commodities—thus be saved take the uncertainty of the law this if not a proper subject for redress is at any rate in no inconsiderable degree an actual subjectmatter of complaint make but the full use of the juryboxes or though it were but of one of them this uncertainty may at command be changed into unanimity and this unanimity if not the same thing as the certainty will at any rate be the best evidence of it or at any rate the best consolation for the want of it having taken them up from these several courts—taken them up from the seat of aggregate wisdom which they occupy altogether—pass through this machine the twelve judges you save arguments before these sages pass through it the members of the house of lords you save arguments on appeals and writs of error before the house of lords to return to the unlearned twelve to each one of them application is at the same time made of two distinguishable two widely different instruments one is the oath of the application made of this instrument what in this case is the object to secure in this instance verity to that declaration of his which is about to be made the other instrument is a certain quantity of pain pain according as he and the others comport themselves increasing in a quantity proportioned to the duration of it from the slightest imaginable uneasiness to a torment such as if endured would extinguish life but which no man in the situation in question was ever known or so much as supposed to have endured a compound of several pains is this same pain principal ingredients the pains of hunger and thirst slighted and first commencing ingredient the pain of privation consisting in the nonexercise of whatsoever other occupations would have been more agreeable under these circumstances if so it be that as soon as the evidence with the judges observations on it if any are at a close either of the two mutually opposite opinions is really entertained by all of them on the part of no one of them does any breach of his oath take place as little on the part of any one of them does pain in any degree take place the verdict is pronounced by the foreman without their going out of the box but as often as instead of their delivering their verdict they withdraw into the room prepared for them then it is that a difference of opinion has place and then it is that on the part of all twelve of them together the appropriate operations begin to be performed then it is that to an indefinite amount all twelve are made to suffer that that same number of them from one to eleven may be made and until they have been made to utter a wilful falsehood and thus break the oath which they have just been made to take under the notion of its preventing them from uttering this same falsehood true it is that if any one of them there be in whose instance pain has had the effect of causing him no longer to entertain the opinion first entertained by him but to entertain instead of it the opposite opinion declared by the verdict no such falsehood will in his instance have been uttered but exists there that person who can really believe that in     the case in question pain can have any such effect and even supposing the effect produced where is the benefit to justice of the two opposite verdicts to which is it that the pain will produce the transition for it presses upon the whole number of them upon the adopters of the verdict eventually delivered as well as upon the opposers of it and whichever of the verdicts it be that is thus adopted what reason can there be for regarding this as being more likely than its opposite to be the proper one but though to produce a change in the opinion really entertained is a thing which pain cannot do in the instance of any one yet to produce a change in the opinion declared to be entertained is a thing which pain and this very pain not only can do in the instance of some one of them but is even known not unfrequently to have done in the instance of all but one of this so triumphantly trumpeted so anxiously preserved and so zealously propagated unanimity what then as often as the jury quits the box is the result answer—two doses one composed of pains the other of wilful falsehood and perjury the dose of falsehood some number from one to eleven are made to swallow the dose of pains all twelve all this without the least imaginable benefit to justice the verdict with the opinion expressed by it being given comes now the question—in what way is it that on that side and not on the other the victory terminated answer—in this the foreman having been the object of the general choice the person the most likely to prepare for acceptance one of the two verdicts is this one if then by any one or more of them the opposite opinion is entertained declaration will of course be made of it by all those who entertain it and the number on each side will thus be seen at once whereupon it is that if to any one of them a reason occurs which as appears to him has not been brought to view by advocate or judge naturally and generally every one who has in his own mind any such reason will out with it what in this case does doubtless now and then happen is that after all the observations delivered by the experienced advocates and judge together have failed to produce the impression in question an observation pronounced by one of the comparatively inexperienced jury has succeeded but this case though sometimes exemplified cannot be stated as the common one the oath to make a man speak true the torture to make him speak false such is the contrivance a twohorse cart the horses set back to back with a cart between them in this behold its parallel a contest and such a contest between will and will and by whom set on foot by the creator of the unanimity part of the institution and by whom kept up by the supporters of it in the declaration of the opposing will others in any proportion to the whole number may have joined thereupon has the pain continued to be endured by all till those on one side unable any longer to endure it have gone over to the other side exists there that man in whose opinion by the power of pain any such change of the judgment from one side to the other ever had place exists there that man in whose opinion on any future occasion any such effect from such a cause is probable so much for opinion now for experience experience says that while in this assembly in which there is torture to produce it unanimity thus constantly takes place—in another in which there is no torture to produce it instances in abundance are continually happening in which it does not take place it is by the institution of another sort of jury—the grand jury—that the experience is furnished every day where this institution has place before these same petty jurymen in number exactly twelve had pronounced their pretended unanimous opinion on that same question they under the name of grand jurymen in number from thirteen to twentyfour inclusive with dissentient voices in any number from one to eleven inclusive had been pronouncing theirs yet onlyon one side does a grand jury hear evidence on the two opposite sides the petty jury in the opposition and conflict which in the petty jury case has place is there anything that is of a nature to render coincidence of opinion the more assured—more assured than when the evidence is all on one side now if in either of these cases there could be the shadow of a reason for the compulsory unanimity in which case would it be in the case of the grand jury assuredly rather than in that of the petty jury why because in the grand jury as above only on one side is evidence ever heard in the petty jury constantly on both sides is it by conflict in evidence that agreement in opinion is more apt to be produced than by agreement in evidence such being the absurdity of the device such its inefficiency to every good purpose behold now the bad purpose in relation to which it is efficient one case alone excepted of which presently   first as to justice assured possessor of the irresistible evil the fabled wishingcap is yours enter in triumph into any jurybox you please on your will depends the verdict     compared with this power of yours what is the influence of the most skilful judge he can but cajole you necessitate behold how sure your success how small the cost of it every time the jury have staid out of court so much as an hour not to say every time they have gone out of court at all—there has been a difference of opinion and next to a certainty perjury scarcely more than one instance of endurance of the uneasiness for so long a term as fortyeight hours has ever been known yours being the verdict behold in this sufferance the limits to the utmost price you can have to pay for it man of desperate fortunes would you retrieve them in civil cases as often as it happens to you to be on a jury and the value at stake is such as makes it worth your while if on the wrong side there is consciousness of wrong and the case next to a desperate one the more depraved the character of the wrongdoer the more assured you will be that an offer to share it with you will not be refused in penal cases keep on the lookout for the richest criminals defendant with another mans money in your hands look well over the jury list—observe whether there be not this or that one of them whose surely effectual service may be gained by appropriate liberality murderer incendiary go through the whole list if one experiment fails pass on to another you have nothing to lose by it—you have everything to gain by it   now as to religion behold the effect here lowering the efficiency of the religious sanction in its natural and genuine state clear of this spurious pretended additament—is or is not this an evil in scarcely more than one known instance has the force of the oath had the effect of causing the torture to be endured for so long a time as eightandforty hours thus weak being the religious sanction even with the benefit of this reinforcement what would be the amount of its influence if operating alone next to nothing would decidedly be the answer were it not for the torture but by the torture this argument in proof of the inefficiency is at any rate weakened if not repelled altogether for from the insufficiency of the religious sanction to prevail over pain when screwed up to such a pitch as to extinguish life it follows not that any such insufficiency has place where no such pain has place oath or no oath perjury or no perjury scarcely will any man apprehend for himself at the hands of the almighty punishment for nonfulfilment of an obligation for performance of which the physical capacity will in his eyes be altogether wanting at any rate scarcely will it to any man appear probable that to any considerable extent the obligation will in quality of a cause of such endurance have been capable of producing any considerable effect or accordingly that it is consistent with almighty wisdom to employ it to such a purpose and as to the cessation of the endurance after a duration comparatively so short why make an attempt the success of which is plainly impossible that in these considerations there is more or less of reason will hardly be disputed but from this it follows not that they will present themselves to everybody and in every eye to which this or something to this effect does not present itself the efficiency of the religious sanction in its natural state will to say the least be by this supposed reinforcement greatly weakened not to say reduced to nothing by these considerations is moreover suggested a course of experiment by which on the degree of efficiency if any on the part of this ceremony no small light would it should seem be cast continuing to apply the torture as at present in all instances apply the ceremony in some omitting it in others then let observation be made of the proportionable number of instances in which the jurors betake themselves to the retiring room and of those in which they do not and in regard to those instances in which they do give this proof of the efficiency of the religious not forgetting the moral sanction minute down the length of the endurance of those right reverend persons who as above had sworn each of them to set up and endow schools the majority are known to have actually forborne to commit the correspondent perjury but as to jurors on the part of all those who have ever sworn to forbear to express an opinion opposite to their own notwithstanding all torture—in other words to forbear from perjuring themselves what instance was ever known of such forbearance conclusion this supposed or pretended effect of this spurious additament strengthening the instrument it is added to real effect weakening it mark now the sort of charity which the unanimity part of the institution and the use of such an instrument as the oath for the production of the effect proves and inculcates proves to have existence on the part of the creators and preservers of it inculcates into those minds to whom the force of it is applied numbers suppose eleven on one side one alone on the other says the one of them now to himself—do what the others may never will i perjure myself saying this does he not at the same time say this also yes—these my brethren eleven in number—all these i will make perjure themselves damned i will not be myself but damned shall be these my brethren if the word damned be not the proper one substitute ye who object to it substitute that which is     ye—if after this exposure any such there be—ye who persisting in the application made of the ceremony in the application made of it in any case and in the case of jury mens oaths in particular—do really believe that for every instance of perjury a punishment over and above that for simple mendacity will in the life to come be suffered by the delinquent—think of the magnitude of the evil which you are endeavouring to perpetuate take balance in hand and say—whether by the application thus made of the ceremony it is in the nature of the case that good in any such quantity as to out weigh the evil should be produced take any man by whom in any instance this perjury has been committed either he believes that punishment in the life to come will attach upon him or he does not if not then is the oath in its professed character in the instance in question completely ineffective if he does think then of the suffering which it produces inefficient or mischievous and who can say to what a degree mischievous such is the alternative now for the benefit from this unanimity meaning the benefit—if not to the creators to the preservers and promoters to entertain any such opinion as that by pain unanimity of real opinion on the part of every or any twelve men is actually produced may be or not be in the power of human folly but to produce the desire and the endeavour to cause this same opinion to be entertained is but too much in the power and too abundantly in the practice of human knavery to the existing system of englishbred jury law in general and to this part of it in particular continues to be ascribed this miracle then comes the practical use a system by which such miracles are at all times wrought and these miracles such delightful ones—how impossible is it to change it for the better how dangerous to meddle with it in so conspicuous a part as this no change in the englishbred judiciary procedure system could be so made or attempted without drawing the public eye upon the whole of it but let but the public eye pervade the whole of it behold it falls to pieces such of judge and co was the end in view and such to judge and co has been the use such moreover it will continue to be so long as jurors shall continue to be made of clay and judges the potters working it but under their hands thanks to their carelessness it has grown and continues to grow stiffer and stiffer while teaching these their pupils thus to contemn the law these sages have themselves fallen to such a degree into contempt that the scholars themselves have at length begun to contemn their own teachers every day is this contempt increasing and if so it be that contempt of a bad system is necessary to the substitution of a good one a more beneficial result than these two conjoined cannot be wished for thanks to this carelessness yes for it is by arbitrary power above that the arbitrary power below superior on many occasions to that of its creator has as hath been seen been created by arbitrary power in one quarter or the other thus it is that everything is done in both the law is trampled upon or the mixture of oaths perjury and torture this is one effect therefore of the oaths blind and speechless acquiescence under an absurd tyranny being the result by what process of reasoning were the inventors led to expect it answer—by the following on each occasion the portion of law to which the jury are called upon to join in giving execution and effect being supposed beneficial—as for the purpose of the argument it cannot but be one thing desirable is of course that in the instance in question and by means of the verdict pronounced execution and effect should be accordingly given to it but at the same time another thing alike desirable is that that same desirable effect being produced it shall by the people at large be believed to be so this desirable belief if produced in what way then will it be produced in this way in the body of men thus selected the people at large behold their own representatives and moreover their own reporters better ground for their persuasion than the report made by these their reporters they cannot have on the occasion in question they the people have not themselves had the means of informing themselves these their representatives and reporters have now then how to make the people believe that on every occasion on which a petty jury is employed everything is thus as it should be such was the problem the solution this on this as on any other occasion take any considerable number of unobjectionable persons for judges—the larger the portion of those who agree in the same opinion the greater is found by experience the probability of their being in the right thence it is that on every occasion in the majority of such men the confidence is greater than in the minority still however remains this same minority by which in proportion to its number this so desirable confidence is diminished and prevented from being entire now then let but this troublesome obstacle be entirely done away entire is thereby rendered this so desirable confidence well then—apply the torture the minority vanishes another feature belonging to jurytrial is the secresy of which the retiring chamber is the scene but not belonging to the subject of oaths this feature belongs not to the present purpose     would but the mendacity content them this they might have without the oath without the oath the torture would give it them at least as surely as with but for such important purposes as above this same instrument of imposition was needed and on the same occasion in particular to make men by the terrific appearance shut their eyes and prevent them from seeing into the absurdity of the contrivance in the shape of an exception allusion has been made to one good effect of the power of conquest thus given to the strongest of the twelve wills the good effect is this a law suppose has place by which were execution and effect given to it maleficence would be infused into the whole frame of government absolutism for example with all its attendant miseries individuals at the same time are not altogether wanting each of whom if in his capacity of juryman the law in question were brought before him for execution would oppose to it this irresistible will would in a word apply his veto to it by the king and the lords this veto is applicable to the laws in the first stage of their progress—the stage of legislation by juries in the last stage—the stage of judicature in the case of offences styled political and in these perhaps alone is its usefulness indispensable as it is concentrative meaning by political offences those by which the effective power of the functionaries exercising in chief the powers of government is struck at treason for example sedition and political defamation meaning in this last case acts striking at the reputation of men in official situations considered as such in which class of cases constituting as it does the main not to say sole security against absolutism rather than part with it better it were to endure much more than the evil of it in all other cases that by the fear of punishment at the hands of the almighty scarcely endurance to the amount of two days has ever been produced is indeed matter of demonstration since as above observed to that amount in no instance whatsoever has the effect been produced at any time but that in instances relatively not unfrequent by sympathy for the happiness of the community at large corroborated by antipathy towards men regarded as acting in hostility to it instances of endurance such as have actually been productive of this good effect there seems reason sufficient to believe to have had place to this generous selfdevotion does the country appear to be altogether indebted for such portion of actual though unsanctioned and ever precarious liberty sole security for all other salutary liberties the press is in possession of that but to too great an extent the abovementioned disastrous supposition stands verified is but too undeniable under the existing system take away this irregular power of the jury neither are laws wanting nor power conjoined with will to give execution and effect to them sufficient to convert the form of government such as it is into as perfect an absolutism as anybody could desire determined instruments of absolutism—and as such with scarce an exception determined and inexorable enemies of the press have at all times been—all english judges accordingly on every occasion of a prosecution for a socalled libel in which censure in any shape has been applied to the conduct of any public functionary in that same proportion has been the constancy of the directions given by them to juries to pronounce for their verdict the word guilty yet every now and then has an english jury refused to render itself in another sense guilty by the utterance of that same momentous word now then admitting the effect to be good in what way—by what means—has this same determined will been productive of it by contributing to give execution and effect to the body of the law no but by successful obstruction and frustration applied to it accordingly in this instance is it any part of our prayer that the torture thus applied should be taken off no but that so long as the form of government continues what it is it should be continued one set of cases there is in which the real or what comes to the same thing the supposed interest of the ruling few is in a state of but too decided opposition to that of the subject many and to the whole extent of these cases our prayer is that this same state of things anarchical as it is may continue unimpaired thus much for elucidation to make out any catalogue of these cases belongs not to this place will it be said that in some of these cases it is to the direction of the judge and not to the evidence that the verdict has been in opposition perhaps so but at any rate neither are cases wanting in which with the salutary view in question verdicts have been given by jurors in the very teeth of evidence upon their continuing prepared upon occasion so to do depends so to us it appears all possibility of escape from the jaws of absolutism not that we are not fully sensible that in various particulars the power of the jury is in the nature of the institution of essential not to say indispensable service to justice in particular in respect of the obligation it lays the judge under of giving reasons for his conduct and bestowing on the question the degree of attention necessary for that     purpose as also the furnishing to him such information respecting various grounds for it as he could not otherwise be in possession of but as an ultimate test of truth that the least should possess a better chance than the most exercised and instructed judgment of being the most apt is a notion which we do not feel it in our power to embrace but on the subject of juries more will be to be said under another head vi device the sixth—delay in groundless and boundless lengths established delay need it be said is denial while it lasts one third of the year justice pretended as above to be administered the two other thirds not so much as pretended such was the state of things determined upon and produced accordingly a calculation was made one third of the year was found to suffice for getting into the law granary all the grist that the country could supply it with that was the time for the mill to go remained the two other thirds on which the miller was free to amuse himself one third of the year said he will suffice for getting in all the money that the whole people can muster for laying out in our shops work for one third of the year amusement for the two other thirds sittings out of term time belonged not to those days at the present day while some judges as far as gout will let them sit at ease other judges overwork and overfatten themselves but so managed is the work that the delay with its profits and its miseries continues undiminished moreover by the delay was left a correspondent interval for incidents capable of being made productive of fresh fees what is the day on which justice ought to sleep—what the hour that on which injustice does so too look now to other departments see how things would go on if like delay were there what if during one part of the year taxes being collected during the other two thirds they were left uncollected what if during one third of the year the naval force being on duty during the other two thirds the seas were left open to enemies and pirates what if during one third of the year the army being on duty the other two thirds the country were left undefended while enemies were at the work of plunderage and devastation from internal enemies for want of justice the sufferings of the people would not be so great as from external enemies for want of defence true but a sufferings not being the greatest possible was no reason why men should be subjected to it how came it that in those days while men were guarded in some sort against sufferings at the hands of external they were subjected to it at the hands of internal evildoers answer—by the suffering produced by the foreign adversaries these judges would themselves have been sufferers by the sufferings produced by the domestic adversaries they were gainers look now to professions what if on being called in by a man with a stone in his bladder a surgeon were to say to him lie there and suffer while i am amusing myself four months hence i may perhaps come and cut you by surgeons this is not said no surgeon has a monopoly of surgery judges do say this judges in small numbers have among them the monopoly of the commodity sold under the name of justice in the eyes of blackstone all this evil is so much good first because it was done so early in the good old times but above all because it was done by lawyers to a husbandman during harvest time attendance in a court he observed would have been attended with inconvenience true and this was one reason why instead of two or three hundred miles he should have had but ten or twelve miles to travel ere he reached it attendance to get back a farming stock unjustly taken would have been inconvenient true but leaving it in the hands of the depredator and thus leaving the harvest to rot in the ground was still more inconvenient so much for harvest time but all the year is not harvest time and the whole remainder of the year had its judges sabbaths as well as harvest time sabbaths not of days but of months continuance what the people now suffer from the system of delay thus organized—what the judges now get by it belongs not in strictness to the present head but neither is it without claim to notice chiefly to the cases called civil applies what is above now for cases called penal behold here the interest of judges changing and with it of course the provision made by them in penal cases and in particular in those most highly penal not a day in the year but courts are open to receive complaint and complaint made men complained against guilty and innocent together are put into jail how so because as above observed judges have bodies judges have goods judges have lives so also as well as other men have all those who in point of interest are in any particular way connected with them bodies goods and lives which but for some such protection might be wounded carried off or destroyed when in jail there they are guilty and innocent together from two days to     as chance pleases how so because to judges and those who are in league with judges     whether in this case a man is innocent or guilty—stays in jail two days or     days makes no difference not to speak of counties and cases in which the     days may be doubled oh yes to judge and co the time does make a difference for from the difference between the two days and the     days come fees jail produces bailing and bailing produces fees innocent or guilty those who can find bail and fees are let out those who are too poor to find either stay in how can it be otherwise under english judgemade law the only unpardonable crime is poverty contamination contamination between uncompleted examination and definitive trial whole days weeks and months are rolling on contamination thickening all the while complaints of this evil not sparing not least abundant by this or that one of those by whom it is caused he who can remove the evil and does not causes if not the commencement at any rate the continuance of it of such contaminators the most insensible the most obdurate the most inexorable the most inexcusable are they not legislators all contamination in prisons—all unintended sufferings in prisons—all possibility of escape from prisons—they might prevent and they will not why will they not one word panopticon explains the mystery pitt gave acceptance to it while he lived—gave support to it such as he was able royal vengeance stopped it interest sinister and allpowerful interest opposed to everything good in proportion as it is good keeps it still out of existence a little while and the inventors will both of them have the merit of being dead when their eyes cannot be rejoiced at the sight of it then will it rise from under the oppression which has thus long kept it down then will the public eye open itself then will public indignation kindle then will the public voice break out afresh and resistance no longer be deemed compatible with prudence to conclude—delay gave ease delay bred incidents incidents were made to breed fees so it must have been in those early times so it is in these present times ease and fees—fruits so sweet both together from one plant how felicitous two causes there are by either of which without blame in any shape to anything or anybody—to a judge or to the system of procedure—delay to any amount may be necessitated of these causes those whose interest is served by the delay and by the system in which it is an inseparable ingredient take of course their advantage and do what depends upon them towards making the people believe that the existing delay is alike necessary in the cases to which these causes do not apply as in those in which they do   one is nonforthcomingness of evidence of this cause the influence it is manifest extends itself to every case to every species of suit   the other is complication complicatedness of the subjectmatter or other circumstances belonging to the suit this applies not beyond a particular class of suits but in the nature of things this is unavoidably but too extensive subjectmatter suppose a mass of property in the course of the suit operations to be performed on it collection and distribution of the component parts of that same mass as in the case of the disposal made of the effects of a person lately deceased or of a person in a state of insolvency over what parts of the globe may it not happen to the subjectmatter on the one hand to both debtors and sharers in the balance if any on the other to be dispersed so likewise where without death on suspicion of insolvency demand is made of an account by a party to transactions to which it may happen to have been not less complicated than the above in a country cause by this or that accident—absence for example of a material witness—trial without loss of cause to the party in the right is at that moment rendered impossible what is the consequence the cause goes off for six months expense of witnesses counsel attorneys all disbursed in waste and at the end of the six months if it happens to it to be on the remanet list for another six months—unless the party is ruined by the preparation for the first trial profit to judge and co upon the second and perhaps upon a third necessary or not motion for a new trial with additional profit thereupon according to circumstances suppose now the court sitting all the year round the accident of one day may now be repaired the next of further particulars as to the evil and causes of delay mention will require to be made under the head of jurisdiction split vii device the seventh—precipitation necessitated under the feegathering system states of things the most opposite—delay and precipitation—concur in giving existence to the desired effect of delay the mode of establishment and the relative usefulness have just been seen the precipitation grew by degrees out of the delay at the early period in question scarcely could it have been contemplated not but that from the first precipitation with its evils were among the natural effects of the opposite abuse but at present it flourishes and on each occasion produces its fruits and only for the purpose of the present time is the     state of the system at that early period here brought to view be the business what it may if of the time that might and should have been allotted to it a portion is kept unemployed proportioned to the increase given to the quantity of the business will be whatever hurry takes place in the course of the time which the business is allowed to occupy suits at common law and as such brought for trial or pretended so to be brought before a jury may be divided into two classes those of which it is known that by possibility they may be tried by a jury and those of which it is known that they can not cause of incapacity of being brought under the cognizance of a jury complexity of modes of complexity capable of producing this effect examples are the following—   multitude of facts which by one and the same demand or defence are undertaken to be proved or disproved on one or both sides for example in an account   multitude of witnesses liable to be examined in relation to each alleged fact especially if alibi evidence or evidence as to character is received these sources however are but two of a multitude of distinguishable sources out of which complexity is in use to arise suit called on jury in box the impossibility of trial is universally recognised what follows off the suit goes to arbitration aptly learned and wellwigged gentlemen in plenty there they sit all known as such by the judge choice is made of one for each side or the same for both now again comes the time for delay five guineas aday or less secures and maximizes it exemplary are then the care and deliberation for securing the whole of the mass of evidence which the case affords the powers are not now altogether adequate but neither would they have been found so had the trial gone on for under the existing system no assemblage of powers adequate to the purpose has placed anywhere setting aside this deficiency and premium for delay here may be seen the natural mode of procedure supposing the judge but one with an audience sufficient in quality and quantity to compose a bridle for his discretion and he salaried instead of feed here would everything be as it should be but the misfortune is—that instead of being substituted to the elsewhere established technical mode of procedure the natural mode is here added to it leaving the burthen unalleviated so much for all jury causes taken together enter now the topographical distinction—country causes and town causes the country outweighing the town causes in the scientific mixture of delay and precipitation country causes are dispatched post haste the whole machinery running round in a circuit at each assize—upon the blind fixation principle of which presently—allotment made of a certain number of days—two three or four as the case may be business for which two or three hours might have been more than sufficient or two or three months less than sufficient crammed into the compass of those same two or three days by leaving evidence unheard arguments undelivered or unattended to—one part of the whole number of suits set down for trial is now made to undergo that process the other part remain unheard and are called remanets or remanents six months is the shortest interval before they come upon the carpet a second time that is to say if come they do for various are the causes by any of which they may be extinguished deperition of evidence drainage of purse death death in a certain case whether natural or no not the less violent because lingering offence manslaughter to say no worse manslaughter by judge and co with their delay expense and vexation substitutes—how safe convenient and profitable—to poison sword and dagger remanets increase and multiply begotten by the remanets of spring are the remanets of michaelmas eminently instructive would be a regularly published list of all of them now as to town causes here the scene changes of delay considerably less thence so of precipitation for trials in the whole of england with the exception of the metropolis assizes in the year no more than two in some counties no more than one in the metropolis terms four with sittings before in and after each total twelve and in each of the twelve upon an average more days than in an assize under these circumstances in the metropolis may be seen a choice made not made by one hercules but by two of them the one who has fewest causes gets most ease the one who has most causes gets most fees health suffers and martyrdom to duty is the name given to canine appetite for fees velocity in horsemanship sees itself rivalled by velocity in judicature mark now how admirably well adapted is this compound of delay and precipitation to the ends of judicature carried on to the last link through the chain of useless proceedings has been the corresponding chain of fees so much for fees pending the suit may have been for years not a syllable all the while suffered to present itself to the mind of a judge such is the fruit of the mechanical mode of judicature of which presently substituted to the rational so much for ease then comes the agreeable circumstance of making recommendation of the man or men by whom though without the name the functions of   0 the judge are then to be performed so much for patronage the boots that fitted all legs—the sevenleagued boots—may be seen in fable the judicial establishment which should parliament so please would fit itself to all quantities of business may be seen as below in sober truth deputation is the name of the instrument by which this quality would be given to it powers of deputation is the name given to the so highly elastic and selfaccommodating boots viii device the eighth—blind fixation of times for judicial operations where flexibility is necessary fixation made example—most prominent effective and instructive—that which is afforded by the appointment of days for attendance at the judgment seat attendance of parties or witnesses or both commencement suppose given to the suit—as in every case it might and should be—by application made by some person in quality of suitor or in case of necessity by some substitute of his at the sitting of the judge where a suit is intended simple information without suit being out of the question the applicant demanding that he himself or some person mentioned by him be admitted as pursuer against some person as proposed defendant if on this first occasion the suit for the commencement of which the application is thus made is not dismissed some day for the continuance of it will of course be to be appointed some day thereafter say for example in ordinary cases the second third or fourth day as it may happen distance in place taken into account reckoning from the day on which the originating application is made so much as to what should be the practice now as to what it is in pursuance of the device here in question—say upon the blind fixation principle the existing system appoints for all cases without distinction some one day by general rule for each subsequent operation fifteen days suppose reckoning from the one last preceding blind fixation say without difficulty for blind when made by a universally and indiscriminately applying rule such fixation cannot but be as to the originating application—in neither case can in the nature of things any fixed day for it have place such application imports actual appearance of a suitor in the presence of the judge but applied to the existing system how erroneous is this conception for such is the established etiquette to no suitor till the day on which conclusion is to be given to the suit is his lordship at home what then is the mode by which commencement is given to it answer this by a person acting as an attorney for the plaintiff the appropriate instrument the writ as the phrase is is taken out in plain english bought at the justice shop of a clerk employed by the judge in serving out the commodity to every one who will pay for it no question asked the writ itself is a mass of unintelligible absurdity but the result is that if the proposed defendant does not constitute himself such by appointing an attorney to act for him in the correspondent manner the judge will at his charge cause the plaintiff to have whatever it is that he demands in regard to defendants setting aside for the present the question as to witnesses copursuers and codefendants what is clear is that sooner or later to each proposed defendant the faculty ought to be afforded of acting if so disposed in contestation of the demand made at his charge by the individual admitted as pursuer but to his so acting a necessary condition is that he should have received notice of his being called upon so to act to his being so another condition necessary is that a mandate for the purpose should have been delivered at some individual spot which at that same moment is the place of his abode now then as to this same abode it may be within a stones throw of the justicechamber or without being out of the local jurisdiction of the court at about three hundred miles distance more or less in the first case supposing the defendant at home and the judge at home and disposed to hear him two or three minutes would suffice for the production of the necessary intercourse i e the interview between him and the judge in the chamber of justice in the other case twice as many days would not suffice what on an occasion of this sort does judicial practice it appoints one and the same day for every individual defendant no regard paid to distance in place or quantity of time necessary to be expended in passing from the one place to the other so much for the operation—the operation of attending or as the word is appearing now for instruments where all that is to be done at the appointed day is appearance in a chamber mentioned short in comparison is the interval that may suffice for adequate notice and such and no other was the state of things at the primeval period all along in view but where within the appointed interval an ulterior operation comes to be performed that operation consisting in the drawing up and exhibition of a written instrument of a certain sort in a word say one of the sort of written instruments above spoken of by the name of written pleadings widely different now is the aspect of the case the time requisite may upon a scale of indefinite length be varied by the quantity of writing necessary not to speak of an unconjecturable variety of other circumstances and thus it is that in     this case so it may be that by the next day may be afforded notice long enough or by the next day two months notice not long enough against the notices being neither too long nor not long enough the chances it is evident are so to speak as infinity to one of the individual in whose instance attendance is requisite to be paid or some other operation performed—some instrument already in existence and established or some written instrument not already in existence to be framed and thereupon exhibited the residence is as above supposed to be within the jurisdiction of the court but on the other hand it may in fact be in another hemisphere and so it frequently is no matter the day is fixed—fixed by the general rule fifteen days suppose are given for a proposed witness with his evidence to make his appearance from british india or australia or peru such then under the direction of this blind fixation principle is the practice throughout the whole of the existing system of the technical judicature it was the natural and in a manner the necessary result of the virtual and effective exclusion which at the primeval period all along in question by the exclusive use of a language foreign to them was put upon the parties of this same blindness behold now the consequences for in these consequences may be seen the motive—the motive by the operation of which the eyes were at that time shut and to this day continue to be shut in each of the two opposite events disservice is rendered to the interest of justice correspondent service to the interests of judicature the time allowed is it too long if yes then by the overlength is created so much needless delay and of evil in that shape the consequences have been already brought to view is it too short then comes a demand for the enlargement of it and with this demand comes down a shower of fees a motion requires to be made a motion having in a commonlaw court commonly for its support some alleged fact or set of facts with an affidavit or set of affidavits by which allegation of their existence is made and of this motion the ground made is here by the supposition in point of reason incontestible but it follows not that in point of fact it will not be contested from the motion have at any rate come some fees and from the contestation if any will come many more fees every motion made is in fact a suit within a suit and of the thus needlessly interpolated suit the expense is abundantly greater than under a system having for its ends the ends of justice would in the vast majority of cases be the whole of the needful expense by motion understand here a motion which is not of course for motions are divided into motions of course and motions at large or say not of course of the mention thus made of the distinction the object is that notice may thereby be received by the honourable house that every sum obtained for making a motion of course is money obtained from the suitors by extortion practised on false pretences no motion being really made sharers in the produce of the extortion the attorney the advocate the subordinate judicial officers and the judge of this contrivance for the manufacture of motions—mark well the absurdity in any other character than that of the manufacture of fees if in judicature this is right let it now be applied to legislature and observe the consequences except where the appropriate facts are deemed of themselves sufficiently notorious no operation is ever performed by the honourable house no proceeding carried for which a determinate ground has not been made by special evidence by your honourable house either in the whole house or in and by its committees according to the occasion and the purpose evidence is convened from every part of the island and upon occasion from every part of the globe now then for arguments sake suppose what in reality is not possible—suppose an honourable member to stand up and make a motion that on every occasion on which any person is ordered to be in attendance at the house for the purpose of being examined the day of attendance shall be on a day certain and in every instance one and the same say for example the fifteenth day reckoning from that on which the motion shall have been made a motion made to any such effect—would it not be regarded as evidence of mental derangement and that but too conclusive yet in judicature this is no more than what has all along been the practice and till this moment without objection by all judges professing at the same time to be directing their practice to the ends of justice but justification will perhaps be attempted and if it be imagination will be set to work for the creation of it process fallacy result in so far as successful illusion and deception principal instruments of the fallacy the words irregularity and regularity the mode in which they have acquired this recommendatory property seems to be this with the word irregularity sentiments of disapprobation have from the earliest time of life stood associated at school irregularity has betrayed itself by straying out of bounds at a later period by purchase of present pleasure at the expense of greater good in future contingency irregularity is therefore a bad thing and as such attended with bad consequences but bad consequences ought to be prevented and to this end whatever operation     is chargeable with irregularity ought to be set aside and to this purpose considered as not having been performed whence the motion for setting aside proceedings as the phrase is for irregularity but of irregularity regularity is the opposite irregularity being a bad thing regularity is in a proportionable degree a good thing and whatsoever is good ought to have place everywhere apply it accordingly to judicial procedure whatever operation requires to be performed a day certain ought to be fixed for the performance of it and intimate is the connexion between regularity and certainty and as fixation is the mother or daughter no matter which of regularity so is she of certainty in proportion as the interval is too short and thence the existence of motions for enlargement more certain the rule receives the praise of strictness for strictness is regularity in a transcendent degree or say in perfection accordingly equity practice teems with rules of this kind—say timefixation rules—compliance with which is notoriously and confessedly impossible rule—is it a good thing yes in so far as directed and with success to a right object no if directed to a wrong object no even if laid down without an object for on the field of law all rule imports coercion and taken by itself coercion is evil and that evil pure now then the rules in question—what are they to outward appearance nothing worse than rules without an object but in inward nature and design rules with a bad object rules laid down for a bad purpose for the purpose of producing by extension under colour of justice the object of the allruling passion—fees ix device the ninth—mechanical substituted to mental judicature of the arrangement by which the parties and in particular the first applying party the plaintiff was excluded from the presence of the judge this was an immediate result as well as an intended fruit already in the blindfixation device may be seen part and parcel of it a peg or a nail driven into a board is the prototype of a day fixed how to cause the suit to be carried on down to the last stage without the judges knowing anything of the matter this was the problem to be solved and solved it was fruit of the contrivance profit gained all trouble all time all labour all responsibility saved by the parties in conjunction that is to say not the parties but their respective agents with the judges subordinates all impregnated with interests repugnant to the interests of parties everything requisite to be done was to be done agent fighting against agent with arms respectively bought by them at the shop kept by the judge for the purpose mechanical this mode may truly be styled in opposition to mental of no such faculty as those the aggregate of which is termed mind any application being at any part of the time made by him irrational and nonrational are terms that fall short of the monstrosity of it a ciderpress worked by steam is the emblem of a judicatory acting in pursuance of this device by the press with its moving power the juice is squeezed out of apples by judges and by means of the machinery of which their predecessors were the inventors and themselves the preservers and improvers the money in the shape of fees is squeezed out of suitors by the piston no thought is applied either to the apples or to the sweets extracted from them by the judge as little to the operations performed and instruments exhibited under the authority of his name or to the effects of them on the suitors not so as to the sweets little are they in danger of being out of mind an attorney along with a fee puts a written paper into a box the judge knowing nothing about the matter this done into the same or another box another fee is dropped with another written paper of which the judge has the same knowledge by each fee the agent on one side purchases of the judge the faculty and benefit of plundering impoverishing and vexing at the same time his own client and the suitor on the other side whereupon the agent of the party on the other side does the like and thus the compliment as the phrase is is returned for elucidation follows an example that of signing judgment by this one all others may be rendered needless i have signed judgment says somebody who would it be supposed is this somebody a judge no but an attorney the attorney of one of the parties what—is not then the judge the person by whom the act of signature is performed not he indeed but the attorney is he by whom alone any thought is applied to the subject any judgment exercised the judge signs nothing a clerk under the judge signs what is given him to sign as above under the fixation system as above a day has been fixed for the attorney of the party say the defendant to do something say to send in some written instrument on pain of loss of cause the day passed the attorney takes to the proper officer the instrument styled the judgment and so as above a clerk of the judge puts his signature to it the problem has been already mentioned the result aimed at in the first instance is judicature without thought in so far as this is effected the solution is complete in so far as this is unattainable next comes judicature with the minimum of thought in this case an approximation is all that lies within the power of art and science     of the case in which the solution is complete that in which a clerks is the hand by which the judgment is signed is an example the judge whose name has been written by him on a piece of paper or parchment knows no more about the matter than his learned brother who is sitting at the same time upon the calcutta bench at all times of the whole number of actions commenced a great majority would probably be found thus disposed of for such will be the case where the so styled defendant being by indigence disabled from becoming so in reality sits helpless while the suit is taking the course which the mechanism has preestablished as to his property instead of going in proportionable shares among his creditors it is in the first instance by judge and co divided if not the whole of it always a large part of it among themselves creditors are made to abate from their demands judge and co know not what it is to make abatement one little improvement remains to be made substitution of an automaton to the judge written by a penman of this sort have been seen lines more beautiful than were ever written by a judge of the essential characteristic of english judicature the grand instrument of delusion—the masquerade dress—this deputy would not be left destitute bowels if given to him would be but surplusage if his principal had had any he would not have been where he is suppose now a system of procedure under which everything was done by the appearance of the parties in the presence of each other before an unfeefed judge creditors more than one—equitable adjustment as the phrase is would have place equitable adjustment without that injustice for which this phrase has too often been made a mask for the reducing on both sides taken together the burthen to its minimum the arrangements requisite would be made to the debtor respite might be granted where to both interests taken together the grant were deemed more beneficial than the denial of it respite to the debtor is indeed so much delay to the creditor but delay to the one may be a less evil than ruin to the other where besides the creditor by whom the demand has been made other creditors remained unsatisfied all of them being called in a composition would be made among them they appearing in person as far as needful under the direction of the judge the effects would be divided among those to whom the shares were due instead of a fellowship consisting of attorneys counsel bankruptcy commissioners judiciary functionaries of various sorts and their universal patron by whom the seals are put to the universal system of plunderage x device the tenth—mischievous transference and bandying of suits when justice is the object cases of necessity excepted in whatsoever judicatory a suit is begun in that same is it continued and ended where fees are the object it is without any such necessity or use transferred of course from one judicatory to another where after transference it does not return to the judicatory from whence it went say transference where it does return say bandying appeal is not here in question in case of appeal a suit is not without special cause sent off from one judicatory to another in the case here in question it is without any cause instances of cases in which justice is the object are afforded by one of the two classes of the cases in which jurisdiction is given to justices of the peace acting singly preparatory and definitive—by these two appellatives let them be distinguished preparatory where from the judicatory in which it originated a suit to receive its termination must be transferred to some other definitive when it is in the originating judicatory that the suit is not only begun but continued and ended to the class of cases in which the jurisdiction is definitive belong those in which justice is the object in the preservation of the practice not in the invention and creation of it consists in this case the device first as to the simple transference in the case in which the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace is of the preparatory kind—from his judicatory according to the place in which the suit originates the nature of the case and the gravity of the punishment it is transferred to one of four others   if in london and middlesex in the grave cases to the old bailey   if in the country in these same cases as also in the lighter ones to the assizes   in the metropolis as above in some cases to the assizes in others to the general sessions of the justices of the peace   in the metropolis in the lightest cases to the sittings before in and after term in the kings bench in its way to each of these ultimate or penultimate judicatories if it has arrived at its destination it has been strained through that seat and instrument of secresy partiality and irresponsible despotism the grand jury evidence time and money of all these valuable articles loss in vast and incalculable abundance is the consequence in all these instances the case is in one degree or other a penal one for a faint conception of all these losses and of the useless and mischievous complication by which they are effected take now     that state of things which in respect of the evidence is most simple and which at the same time is not unfrequently exemplified percipient witness to the transaction but one circumstantial evidence none suppose the originating judicatory aptly constituted and appeal allowed what in this case should hinder the suit from being ended where it began a duty that might be imposed on the judge as upon the justice of peace it is imposed—is that of causing to be set down every syllable of the evidence this done why should it not be made thereupon his duty to pronounce judgment and in case of conviction give execution and effect to it what says somebody if death were the consequence answer—o yes though death were the consequence provided always that in every case appeal were allowed appeal to a judge with jury in cases to which the powers of a jury were deemed applicable is this the course no from the justice of the peace it must go to a grand jury from the grand jury if not sunk in that dark pit it must go to one or other of the four judicatories above mentioned three times over must the tale of this percipient and narrating witness be told here then in every case is the labour expense and complication of two appeals without the benefit of one were appeal instituted it would no otherwise be allowed than upon grounds deemed sufficient and in so far as it was deemed subservient to justice say in one word of use on the other hand under the existing system there is the complication of appeal organized and established in all cases including those in which the operation is without ground and without use were the matter of the first narrative preserved it might serve as a check and a security for the correctness of the second and so the first and a second for the correctness of the third no neither of the second nor of the first is such use or any use made moreover for deperition of the evidence by design or accident—by purchase emigration sickness or death all this time all these chances are allowed i here then is loss the first loss of evidence ii now for loss of time— i old bailey in the year sessions   average duration of each session days  0 time lost days from   to  ii kings bench terms   sittings before in and after term as many times of trial these same sittings time thereby lost days from   to  iii assizes in the year days of sitting in most counties   in some but one in each town from   to   days lost from   to     in some cases no less than     iv general sessions of the justices of the peace in the year sittings   times of trial these same sittings days of sitting upon an average  time lost days from   to  iii now for loss in money only for remembrance sake can this item be set down to determination it bids defiance so as to the loss in the two other abovementioned shapes from anything that could be done towards filling up the above blanks the benefit would not pay for the burthen according to his opportunities every person whose regard for human suffering suffices for the motive will perform the operation for himself so much for simple transference now for vibration or say bandying that is to say—after sending the suit from the originating judicatory to another regularly bringing it back to the first neither was this branch of the device part and parcel of the original system in process of time two causes concurred in the production of the effect cause the first as opulence and with it the possibility of finding the purchasemoney for the chance for justice received increase the local judicatories being killed business kept flowing in to greater amount than kings bench and common pleas together knew what to do with in the compass of that portion of the year which under the name of termtime had originally been allotted to it cause the second at the same time the burthen attached to jury service borne as it was twice in the year by men in dozens from each county travelling for kings bench suits in the train of the king during his rambles or though it were only to a fixed place such as london from cumberland or cornwall was such as in the aggregate became intolerable hence came the circuit system that system by which part of the time originally under the name of vacation consecrated to idleness was given up to business and to a correspondent amount ease exchanged for fees judges being detached from the westminsterhall courts to save to jurymen a more or less considerable proportion of the time and money necessary to be expended on journeys and demurrage as to the local judicatories thus extinguished they sat every day of the     at least nothing was there to hinder these days was anything like an adequate equivalent allowed for the     by the circuitsystem principle the allotment of a finite and minute quantity of time for an infinite quantity of business when it is conducive to public health that by medical men wounds shall be dressed teeth drawn and limbs amputated at full gallop—the circuit mode of trying causes at like speed will be conducive to justice     under the technical system if ever in a case such as this evil receives alleviation it is from some other evil it is from the device by which mechanical operation is substituted to mental it is from this that the evil produced by the bandying device by which a suit is dealt with as if it were a shuttlecock may be seen to receive such palliative as it is susceptible of that the series of the proceedings of which a suit is constituted should be divided between judicatories more than one is a source of misdecision for which in some cases indeed necessity affords even a justification but for which nothing short of necessity can afford so much as an excuse why because in this case the judge on whose judgment the fate of the suit depends has had before him no more than a part of the matter of which the ground of that judgment ought to be composed in the case of circuit business this source of misdecision is purposely established and universalized in every one of the three commonlaw courts in the metropolis it is that the suit takes its commencement and with it the history of it called the record when on the circuit the detachment of judges sent from westminster hall in couples make their progress through the counties with them travel these same records and so again on their return whereupon they are reconveyed to the offices from whence they issue of this practice of dealing with a record as with a shuttlecock what is the use none whatever always excepted the universal use serving as a pretence for fees a shuttlecock is lighter than a record and would in these cases be an advantageous substitute to it of the whole proceedings in each suit the essential part need it be said is the evidence well then of each record this same evidence constituted one might have supposed the principal part well then does it compose the principal part no nor so much as any part whatever a mixture of immaterial truth and absurd lies such is the matter of which the principal part is composed as to the evidence instead of a complete written designation of everything relevant that has been said traced by a responsible hand the judge takes or does not take what he calls his notes which notes are of course in quality as well as quantity whatever it pleased him to make them on a motion for a new trial but not otherwise they are read now then for the palliative it consists in this setting aside occurrences which are purely accidental and which happily do not take place—perhaps in one suit out of twenty—no more than one judge is there in truth whose mind is in any part of the proceedings applied to the matter of the suit this is the judge under whose direction has been performed the elicitation of the evidence auspices were what a roman emperor contributed and received admiration and praise for when a victory was gained a thousand miles off auspices are what the judges of a westminsterhall judicatory contribute to a suit begun and ended in their courts when from the circuit the record is brought back by the judge under whose direction the evidence has been elicited to the westminsterhall court in the office of which the suit and the record took commencement the form by which judgment is pronounced receives the handwriting of the chief justice as in his sleep a plate of glass would his breath without his knowing it and thereupon if the judgment be in favour of the plaintiffs side and money is to be raised in satisfaction of a debt pronounced by the judgment to be due is sent down ordinarily to the county to which the records useless journey had been made an order called a writ of fieri facias by which a functionary styled the sheriff of the county is required to raise the money by sale of the defendants goods and remit it to the office of the court in which the suit was commenced when it was at westminster and thence in the very justice chamber in which the suit took its commencement that the elicitation of the evidence belonging to it had to be performed here was no journey for the record to perform next to none when in the city of london at less than two miles distance a trial performed at a county town in the course of a circuit was said to be performed at the assizes a trial performed in westminster or london as above was said to be performed at nisi prius nisi prius when interpreted is unless before and with that interpretation your petitioners choose to leave the matter rather than attempt to lead the honourable house through the labyrinth through which often beginning at nonsense the mind must make its way ere it arrives at common sense but the county at which the elicitation of the evidence is to be performed—what shall that county be under the natural system there would be variety but without difficulty without difficulty because without decision without decision because by the judges unfeefed as they would be nothing would be to be got by it under the existing technical system chicane is busy difficulty proportionably abundant hereupon comes a sort of a thing called a venue question shall it be changed or remain unchanged in plain english the county in which the trial is performed—shall it be that which by means of the appropriate gibberish the plaintiffs attorney had fixed upon for this purpose such is the stuff out of which under the technical system what is called science is     composed if a suit were sent to be tried at the venue and the motion were for change of unless before the profundity of the science would be rendered still more profound one thing is throughout intelligible at the bottom of everything are fees at the bottom of the unless before are fees at the bottom of the changeable venue are fees the greater the quantity of parchment in the shape of a record the greater the quantity of gold in the shape of fees the greater the patience of us his majestys subjects the more cruelly will every one of us be trod upon by every dishonest man who is richer than he and by the men to whom under the name of judges we are delivered over to be tormented the more insatiably squeezed for fees particular case just alluded to that of a motion for a new trial judges of the three westminsterhall commonlaw courts    before one alone it is that the trial has been performed two to one therefore is the chance that the abovementioned palliative such as it is will not have had place for upon the notes taken by the one judge at the assizes in the county or nisi prius at the metropolis is grounded the decision of the four judges in westminster hall on the question whether the new trial shall or shall not have place under natural procedure supposing a new trial it might instead of the next quarter or half year take place the next day and thus before the witnesses were dispersed let not mistake be made absolutely considered neither on simple transference nor yet on bandying can condemnation be passed consistently with justice suppose two hundred local judicatories having each of them in its territory a witness or a party whose testimony was needful in one and the same suit on such case transference to some one or bandying the suit to and back from each might perhaps be productive of less delay and expense than the fetching of them all to the originating judicatory the grievance consists in the performance of both operations conjointly and as a matter of course where there is neither need nor use sending for example on the strength of the word venue suit parties witnesses and record to cornwall or cumberland when all are within a stones throw of the seat of ultimate judicature xi device the eleventh—decision on grounds avowedly foreign to the merits or say decision otherwise than on the merits or more shortly decision not on the merits under all the devices as yet brought to view the sinister design has shrunk from observation and with but too much success sought something of a veil for the concealment of it but by him by whom for the designation of the decision pronounced or sought by him this phrase was employed all veils were cast aside and the principle acted upon avowed and exposed to all eyes in all its deformity and foul nakedness to all eyes yes but these eyes—whose were they under one or other of two descriptions they all come eyes of the sharers in the guilt with its profit or eyes—which by the devices that have been brought to view they had succeeded in blinding concealing from them the cause and the authors of the suffering they were experiencing all the while but for this blindness insurrection would have been universal the yoke of lawyercraft shaken off all the other devices rendered useless and universal abhorrence not to speak of condign punishment the only ultimate fruit reaped from so much illspent labour by the authors to decide sometimes according sometimes not according to the merit—such has been my habit such continues my determination what a profession this for a judge in what other class of men could any instance of such openlyavowed depravity ever have been found—in what other part of the official establishment any such avowal of accomplished inaptitude look to the military my design is sometimes to obey my commanding officer sometimes to disobey him look to the financial my design is sometimes to hand over to the treasury the money i have collected sometimes to put it into my own pocket look to the medical profession my design is sometimes to cure my patients sometimes to kill them in the soldier the taxcollector and the surgeon if such there could be by whom respectively such language could be held would be seen the exact parallel of the judge who avowedly and purposely decides otherwise than according to the merits in painting the deformity of this practice can any power of exaggeration go beyond the plain exposition of the simple truth in what instance on what occasion did the honourable house ever profess to make a decision not in accordance with the merits on the occasion of any dispute between child and child between servant and servant did ever any member of a family nonlawyer or even lawyer ever declare himself thus to decide the essential word merits being a word over the import of which something of a cloud may on this occasion appear to hang whatsoever may be necessary we humbly hope will not be regarded as misemployed while employed in dissipating it to have a clear view of the sort of operation meant by a deciding not according to the merits a man must first have a correspondently clear view of the sort of operation     meant by a deciding according to the merits taken in its allembracing description a decision according to the merits is in every case a decision by which on the occasion in question execution and effect is given to the law to the really declared will of the legislature in the case of statute law to the imagined will of the imagined legislature in the case of common law in that sense in which it is synonymous to judgemade law in the sort of case called a civil case that which is done by a decision according to the merits is giving to the plaintiff the benefit claimed by his demand if so it be that his individual case is contained in the species of case in which it has been declared by the law that by every individual whose case is included in that same species of case a benefit of the sort so designated shall on his demand be put in his possession by the appropriate judge thus giving to the plaintiff the benefit in question if his case is within that same species of case and thereby of necessity subjecting the defendant to the correspondent burthen refusing the benefit to the plaintiff if his case as above is not within the species of case and thereby keeping the defendant clear and exempt from the correspondent burthen in the sort of case called a penal case a decision according to the merits is a decision by which the defendant if guilty is pronounced guilty if not guilty not guilty on each occasion two questions essentially different how intimately soever connected come necessarily under consideration the question of law and the question of fact but of this distinction for the present purpose nothing further will require to be said only that it may be seen not to have been overlooked is this short mention made of it such being the description of a decision according to the merits now in exact contrast to it comes the description of a decision not according to the merits in its general description as above a decision according to the merits being a decision by which on the occasion in question execution and effect is given to the law in the case of a decision not according to the merits on the occasion in question execution and effect is not given to the law in a civil case a decision according to the merits was a decision by which the plaintiff was put in possession of the benefit in question as above a decision not according to the merits is accordingly a decision by which in that same same case a refusal express or virtual is made so to put him in possession as above in a penal case a decision according to the merits was a decision by which if the defendant was guilty he was pronounced guilty if not guilty not guilty a decision not according to the merits is accordingly a decision by which if the defendant was guilty he is pronounced not guilty if not guilty guilty here then are four distinguishable forms of injustice and by every decision not according to the merits in some one or more of these forms is injustice committed moreover in no other than in one or other of these same four forms by a judge acting as such can injustice be committed into one or more of them will be found resolvable every decision to which with propriety injustice or say contrariety to justice can be imputed of the injustice committed by means of this device the prime instrument is the word nullification with the other words nouns substantive nouns adjective and verbs connected with it and the phrases in the composition of which they have place null void null and void bad error irregularity flaw vacate avoid avoidance quash set aside annul nullify fatal quirk quibble compared with this of nullification of all other modes put together in which injustice is capable of being committed by decisions not according to the merits the importance would be found inconsiderable the burthen of research and examination would not on this occasion be paid for by the benefit of the acquisition in the group composed of these four great aggregates are united four elementary ingredients by universal consent acknowledged in the character of so many modifications of injustice these are punishment expostfacto or as some style it retroactive—disappointment of established expectations complete arbitrariness misseated punishment of retroactive punishment the so flagrant and incontestable injustice is an established and frequently drawnupon source of condemnation and this even under statute law under which it is so rarely inflicted even by the worst constituted and worst exercised governments in the case of judgemade law this retroactivity is of the very essence of this species of law as contradistinguished from statute law and this even when the decision is on the merits but when not on the merits it stands upon ground very different from what it does when on the merits ground widely different and much worse when on the merits there is always some analogy between the state of the case on the occasion of the decision in question and the state of the case on some anterior decision or decisions to which reference is made and those to which the analogy it bears is looked upon as being the closest are uniformly those which are looked out for in preference how     constantly opposite in this respect is the case where the only grounds on which the decision is formed are such as avowedly have nothing to do with the merits—bear no analogy whatsoever to the merits as to punishment the name is on this occasion employed because whether or no the suffering produced is produced under the name of punishment such upon the individual who suffers is the effect now as to disappointment of an occurrence from which expectation of benefit in any shape experiences disappointment pain in some degree or other is a constantly attached consequence in the exclusion put upon this pain may be seen the sole but perfectly sufficient immediate reason for giving to every man whatsoever is deemed his own instead of suffering another to get or keep possession of it no otherwise than by statute law and in proportion to the extent of it can this so desirable exclusion be effected by statute law preestablished foreknown and forenotified of judgemade law the general incapacity of conveying this same so desirable information is the essential and distinctive characteristic but on every occasion as above even under judgemade law it is more or less extensively an object of endeavour to confine this sort of uneasy sensation within as narrow bounds as may be to exclude it altogether if possible and at any rate on each occasion to render the probability of its having place as small as possible on the contrary in the case of a decision not on the merits the probability of the existence of evil in this shape is at its maximum in a word it coincides with certainty for unless where in the individual case in question corruption or some uncommon distortion of the intellectual frame on the part of the judge is supposed or suspected to have place by whom is it that the existence of any such phenomenon can naturally be apprehended as that of a judge so lost to all sense of shame as to stand forth a selfdeclared perpetrator of injustice now then by the practice of deciding on grounds palpably foreign to the merits has power to this degree arbitrary been actually established in themselves by english judges in general they are expected to tread in one anothers steps and in the degree in which this so indispensable habit is conformed to depends altogether such feeble and even vacillating degree of security as it is in the power of judgemade law to afford but when at length the eyes of the public have to a certain degree opened the evil which has been the result of their thus treading in one anothers steps in some cases of quibble has become so palpable and grossly mischievous—giving impunity for example to murderers because some word has been miswritten or left unwritten by somebody—when things have come to this pass not only allowance but applause has been bestowed on a departure then it is that the judge finds himself at perfect liberty to give or to refuse impunity to the murderer at pleasure if he refuses it liberality is his word if he gives it stare decisis now as to the complete arbitrariness arbitrary to a degree of perfection if in any case is the power of a judge in a case in which without danger either of punishment at the hands of the law or so much as censure at the hands of public opinion he can give success to plaintiff or to defendant according as he happens to feel inclined such is the case where within his reach he sees two opposite sources of decision from either of which he can draw at pleasure one which will give success to the plaintiff the other to the defendant a sort of vase has been seen from which at command wine either of one colour or another has been made to flow from this emblem the name of the double fountain principle has been given to the principle on which by this means and in this shape a power which to the extent of it is so completely arbitrary has been established to such a pitch of perfection has the exercise of power in this shape been carried that of late days a judge has been seen scouting the quibble one day giving effect to it the next to what cause such inconsistency should be ascribed—whether to corruption or to that wrongheadedness which to so great an extent judgemade law cannot fail to propagate it is not possible to determine today it is probably wrongheadedness tomorrow it may be the other cause while decision on any other ground than the merits is allowed of in any case thus the matter must continue and for the extirpation of this enormity nothing short of an entirely new system of procedure can suffice lastly as to misseated punishment delinquency such as it is being imputed to one person not on him but on some other—and that other one to whom no delinquency in any shape is imputed is the burthen of suffering imposed the attorney say of the plaintiff is supposed to have written some word wrong for this impropriety real or pretended if real intended or unintended his client the plaintiff is made to lose his cause if the case be of the number of those in which in conjunction with the individual the condition of the public at large is considered as suffering as in the case of robbery and murder—of those in which the evil diffuses itself through the public at large without infringing on any one individual more than another as in the case of an offence affecting the revenue—in either of these cases it is the public that thus for the act of the individual is made to suffer to the guilty individual impunity is thus dealt     out to the not guilty individual or public groundless sufferings in the expression by which upon any operation or instrument nullification is pronounced employment given to a sort of fiction is involved one operation which has been performed is spoken of as if it had not been performed the instrument which has been brought into existence is spoken of as not having had existence at any rate things are put and professed to be put into the state in which they would have been had no such operation no such instrument had place amidst instances of mendacity so much more flagrant scarcely would such a one as this have been worth noticing but for exemplification and explanation of the effects this mention of it may be not without its use an offender for example has been brought to trial and conviction has ensued in the instrument of accusation say the indictment one of those flaws manufactured perhaps for the purpose has been discovered in consequence of the observation arrest of judgment as the phrase is has been pronounced what is the consequence whatever has been done is to be considered as if it had not been done information which has been elicited is to be considered as not having been elicited evidence by which the fact of the delinquency has been put completely out of doubt having been elicited and with perfect accuracy committed to writing is to be considered as never having had existence in civil cases the effect is the same the same convenient extinction of evidence has place when a new trial has been granted and brought on though in this case not being needed no such word as nullification or any of its synonyms as above is employed peremptory and dilatory by these two words are designated the two so widely different effects produced in different cases by nullification case in which the triumph of injustice is most complete that in which the effect is peremptory or say definitive because a word has been misspelt by a copying clerk a convicted murderer for example walks out of court under the eyes of his deliverer and accessary after the fact—the quibblesanctioning judge—to commit ulterior murders throughout the whole field of penal law of nullification pronounced on the proceedings on grounds foreign to the merits this according to the general rule and expressed in the language of roman law by the words non bis in idem is the effect needlessly promotive of guilt as this rule would be in any case it would not be near so amply so as it is were it not for the blind fixation principle applied to days as above endless is the variety of accidents—endless the variety of contrivances—by any one of which a necessary witness may be kept from being forthcoming at the day and within the hour prescribed while on a circuit the judges with their et cæteras are circumgirating as if by steam on a wheel without a drag humanity that humanity which has penny wisdom for its counsellor that humanity which can see the one object under its nose but not the hundred of the like objects at a few rods distance applauds the impunity given in this case consistency would if listened to extend the impunity to all other cases then would society fall to pieces and in blackstones phrase everything would be as it should be all this supposes the case to be of the number of those called criminal or penal for to these words substitute the word civil the eyes of humanity are closed in every case called civil a new trial may be granted in cases called penal not in the case called civil the loss a defendant stands exposed to may amount to pounds by tens of thousands ayear in the case called penal it may not amount to ten shillings but cases called civil may on revision be found pregnant with fees to any amount cases called penal are comparatively barren when the immediate effect is no more than dilatory the evil is not so complete nor in every part certain but to a more or less considerable extent evil has place in every such case—evil by delay and delay of justice is so long as it lasts denial of justice add to this evil by expense of the repetition—that evil out of which cometh forth that same relative good—judge and cos profit—the contemplation of which constituted the motive and efficient cause by which the arrangement was produced add now the effect of the instruments of regularly organized delay called terms and circuits combined with that of the blind fixation principle applied to days now in the case of a new trial comes an interval in some cases of halfayear in others of a whole year interposed between the original series of proceedings and the repetitional proceedings if granted in this state of things to a prodigious extent the dilatory operation of the virtual nullification put upon the original set of proceedings becomes in effect peremptory and conclusive a necessary witness dies goes off of himself to the antipodes or is bought off of the suitors at whose charge in case of nullification the quibble has been made to operate or without need of nullification the necessary piece of evidence has been kept out of the way the purse or the spirits have become exhausted as often as this has place the dilatory effect though in name and outward appearance less pernicious than the peremptory is in reality much more so the expected remedy is extinguished and to the expense and vexation attached to the pursuit of it a fresh quantity is added   0 such is the advantage which by the so elaborately and successfully organized system is given to dishonesty when conjoined with opulence that in many instances to the purpose of the preponderantly opulent depredator or oppressor by whom the depth of his destined victims purse has been sounded so far as regards ultimate success the difference between the peremptory and the dilatory effect of nullification may be made to vanish xii device the twelfth—juries subdued and subjugated not at the period here in question was this exploit hatched juries it seems probable were not at that time in existence but it was at that period that the foundation was laid of the power by which this subjugation was accomplished and the only use of the inquiry being how the yoke imposed on the people by judge and co may be shaken off—a yoke of which this forms no inconsiderable a portion a topic so important could not be left untouched the origin of the jury institution is lost in the clouds of primeval barbarism inference must here be called in to do the work of narrative that which inference suggests is this of some greater number twelve or any other determinate number could not but have been a sort of committee to the eyes of the historian not uniformly distinguishable was the entire body and the committee when the one supreme criminal judicatory—the sometimes metropolitan sometimes travelling judicatory—was instituted then all over the country were extinguished the small territorial and adequately numerous local judicatories in which the inhabitants in general took that part which scarcely in those rude ages could be well defined and if ever so well then defined could not now be determined and stated what was to be done even under the then existing thraldom subversion completed at one explosion might have been too shocking to be endurable come to me wherever i am and sit under me as you do now under your several judges come to me i do not say all of you for in that case all production would be at a stand—but a part of the number selected from the whole in a word a committee and let the number of it be twelve when from one of these small judicatories a suit was first called up to the one high and great one something to this effect must it should seem have been said the shorter the journey the less burthensome the duty whether this be more or less burthensome the more important the occasion the more plausible the excuse for the imposition of that same duty thus it was that practice might make its way by degrees as to the number why twelve answer—twelve was the number of the apostles in favour of no other number could so cogent unanswerable a reason be assigned be this as it may in the very nature of the case never could juries have been altogether acceptable associates to judges how should they any more than independent houses of commons to kings whatsoever was the disposition of the judge partial or impartial crooked or upright proportioned to the share they took in the business most frequently by intellectual inaptitude but sometimes by intellectual aptitude sometimes by moral aptitude they would be troublesome act they could not without being so by their mere existence a troublesome duty was imposed upon the judge the duty of giving something in the shape of a reason for the course prescribed by him here then on each occasion on the neck of the judge was a yoke which if it could not be shaken off was to be rendered as light as possible in case of noncompliance it might by nullification as hath been seen be got rid of but nullification as hath also been seen did but half the business true it is that when applied to cases called civil it could always prevent a wellgrounded demand from taking effect but it could not so constantly give effect to an ungrounded one applied to penal cases it could at pleasure give impunity to crime but especially in capital and other highly penal cases scarcely of itself could it be made to subject innocence to punishment what remained applicable was a compound of intimidation and delusion intimidation applied to the will delusion to the understanding of the intimidation employed the one word attaint will serve to bring to view a specimen persons all twelve imprisoned moveables all forfeited dwellings all laid low habitations lands completely devastated with et ceteras upon et ceteras maleficence must have been drunk when it came out with this pandoras box actual cautery applied as often as a fleabite was to be cured down to the present hour this is law continued such by judgemade law in the course of a few centuries statute law added a few trifles that these serious things might remain unaffected statute law is repealable common law unrepealable parliaments are allowed to correct their own errors judges under the name of the tyrant phantom remain irresistible uncontroulable and incorrigible no otherwise it is true than by compliance on the part of twice the number could vengeance be taken for the noncompliance of the twelve but the instances first chosen for this infliction would naturally be those in which on the part of the sufferers the delinquency had been least questionable at any     rate upon judge and co would infliction in such sort depend that of noncompliance attaint could scarcely fail to present itself as a more or less probable consequence of an infliction thus atrocious the frequency as it presents itself in the books is perfectly astounding to a reflecting mind no otherwise than by attaint could the effect produced in these days by new trial be produced in those as often as a new trial is granted now conceive the pandoras box opened there note well the efficiency of the instrument like the fabled razors it performs the work of itself without need of a hand to guide it as it is with corruption so is it with intimidation to produce the effect neither discourse nor expression of will in any other shape is necessary for the production of the effect relative situation is perfectly sufficient where the intimidation was inapplicable afterwards when at length the stream of civilization had washed it away altogether—remained as the only instruments applicable arrogance and cajolery of the two instruments arrogance was of course to the operator the more acceptable the use of it presented no great difficulty the law quoth the judge is so and so so far the judge but what law no law was there in the case who made it the law—meaning that portion of it to which he gave the force of law—it was he who made it made it out of his own head made it for his own purpose whatsoever that purpose happened to be take for example libel law a libel what is it answer—if i am a judge any piece of printed paper it would be agreeable to me to punish the man for is he a man i choose to punish i make it a libel is he a man i choose not to punish i make it a nonlibel but is it possible that to a man in power it should be agreeable to leave unpunished any individual audacious enough to say anything otherwise than agreeable to a man in power o yes it is just possible witness morning chronicle in the days of perry and lord chiefjustice ellenborough now suppose a code in existence juries are now emancipated judges in effect now no longer dupes no longer tools and by the shackles imposed on the mind made slaves judges in effect now because ennobled and qualified so to be the law say they is so and so how should it be otherwise not be what they thus say it is the book is opened there the passage is—they see it more effectually learned would be the least learned juryman in such a state of things than under the existing system the most learned judge to the existing system apply be it remembered these remarks not to an improved system under which judges would be made responsible and appeals to a superior judicatory effectual as well as the appeal to public opinion strengthened by extension given to publication under such a system greater might be the power reposed in the experienced less in the unexperienced hands thus stands the law under the existing system when a declaration to this effect is made by a judge from what set of men in the situation of jurymen can noncompliance how necessary soever to justice be ordinarily expected in this case that being assumed as true which in every common law case is so opposite to true—that is to say the existence of the law in question—to the judge must this same law be known if to anybody as to these his unlearned pupils to them it is completely unknown so the inward consciousness of each man of them testifies with the law which thus at the very moment of its being made is revealed to them begins and ends their knowledge in such a state of things so effectually by the consciousness of their own ignorance were they and are they blinded their appointed guides may to any degree be blind without being seen by them to be so under these circumstances what but blind compliance could then be—aye or can now be—the general practice what exceptions there are are such as are formed by here and there a rare occurrence operating upon a rarely exemplified set of dispositions of the acquitted decapitator mention has been made above if by a union of past absurdity and present arrogance a jury can be brought to this to what is it they cannot be brought but in that case how much is to be ascribed to judges influence how much to jurymens abhorrence of death in the character of a punishment cannot be affirmed with certainty and so long as the punishment is death impunity will every day be approaching nearer and nearer to the being every days practice xiii device the thirteenth—jurisdiction where it should be entire split and spliced jurisdiction has two fields—the local and the logical the local or say territorial divided into tracts of territory the logical divided into sorts of cases in the local field that which the interests of justice require is as hath been seen multiplicity in the logical field as will be seen unity so much for reason now for practice where by the interests of justice multiplicity was required the interest of judge and co established as has been seen the unity where by the interests of justice unity was and is required the opposite interest of judicature that is to say that same sinister interest will now be seen establishing multiplicity from the expression jurisdiction split let it not be conceived as if at the initial point     of time in question the field of legislation was in its whole extent covered as it were by one large block and that at different times thereafter by the introduction of wedges or otherwise the block was broken into the existing splinters connected together as they may be seen to be by the conjunct sinister interest the case is that it is by degrees as will be seen that the aggregate composed of the splinters has been brought into its present so commodious state namely in some instances by fissure in other instances by the gradual addition of portions of new matter spliced to the older splitting and splicing—by the union of these two operations has the actual aggregate result been brought into existence matter of the aggregate this of the substantive branch of law different masses three or four and for giving execution and effect to them more than twice as many of the matter of the adjective or say procedure branch of law constituted every one of them chiefly of the fictitious or say judgemade sort with only here and there a patch of real law—of legislaturemade law—stuck in in the keeping of these portions of matter in the hands of different sets of judges not in the originally placing them in these or any other separate hands consists at present the sinister practice—the device in the union of them in each territory in one and the same hand the sole remedy as to the spliting in some instances the operation by which it was effected was performed at one stroke that is to say by one statute call the mode in this case the allatonce or

military functionaries—the like in relation to seaservice military functionaries admiralty prizecourts on the subject of these judicatories the demand for explanation not being cogent and room being deficient the sole purpose of the mention here made of them is the apprehension lest otherwise they should be supposed to have been overlooked mark here the chaos different branches or say masses of substantive law spun out in this dark way by judgemade law thus lamentably numerous and for giving execution and effect to them to each a different mass of procedure or say adjective law masses framed in so many different modes and upon different principles singlejustice courts pettysessions courts and smalldebt courts the more entitled to remark as affording perhaps the only instances in which judicial procedure has had for its main ends the ends of justice essentially repugnant to the ends of justice need it be said—essentially repugnant if anything can be—this system of disunion proportionally subservient to the actual ends of judicature hence the arrangement so recently employed in keeping it up in particular as between equity courts and commonlaw courts conducive to the ends of justice will this splitting and splicing work be said to be well then here follow a few improvements on the same principle to the bankruptcy court add a stockbreaking court to the insolvency court a nonsolvency court a nonpayment court a nonliquidation court and a nondischarge court each with a different mode of procedure taking for the twelfthcake the jurisdiction of the aula regis let lots be drawn by all these courts for these their respective styles and titles allot to each of these courts one commissioner to begin with then three commissioners the number in the insolvency court in its improved state then the square of three   then the cube of three    then the fourth power of three    by which last the number of the commissioners of bankrupts or bankruptcy will be surpassed by eight and proportionally improved upon to secure what is called qualification meaning thereby appropriate aptitude impose as a task and test the having partaken of a certain number of dinners in some one of four great halls of situations of different sorts in under or about these courts number capable of being occupied by the same person at the same time ten by which the number occupied by a son of the exchancellor the earl of eldon will be outstript by one to complete the improvement conclude with pensions of retreat after ten years service and pensions for widows orphans and upon occasion sisters at the end of a certain length of time the existing incumbents will be found each of them at the same time insufficiently and more than sufficiently apt as was the case with the metropolitan police magistrates then will be the time for adding onethird to their salaries with or without the like addition to the other just mentioned so equitable and comfortable appendage we proceed now to present to the view of the honourable house the evils of which this system of disunion is and so long as it continues in existence cannot but be so abundantly productive we shall point out the cause by which it has been produced namely the mixture composed of primeval inexperience and sinister interest in particular in regard to imprisonment for debt on its present footing to wit at the commencement of the suit—a period at which     it is so frequently groundless and so constantly ungrounded it will be seen that it had no better origin and efficient cause than sinister interest in its foulest shape special original cause as will be seen of this abuse the splitting of the common pleas jurisdiction from that of the kings bench thereafter immediate cause the grand battle between the two courts in the reign of charles the second the use of confusion has already been brought to view behold now one preeminently useful mode or efficient cause of it in the practice of a large proportion of all these courts both branches of law spun out together the substantive branch out of the adjective in the shape of twist by the judge in the course of the operations of procedure the twist afterwards woven into piecegoods by the firm of reportmaker reportmakers bookseller abridgmentmaker and his abridgments bookseller and in this way it is that on pretence of judicature over the whole field of law power of legislation continues to be exercised exercised by the combination of such essentially and flagrantly incompetent hands are you a chief justice have you a law to make to make on your old established mode the following is your recipe take any word or number of words the occasion requires choosing as far as they go such as are already in the language but if more are wanted you either take them from another language old french or latin or make them out of your own head to these words you attach what sense you please to enable you to do by this means whatever you please one thing only is now wanting this is that in the accustomed form by some person other than yourself for you cannot yourself as in some countries give commencement to a suit the persons and things to be operated upon must be brought before you by the kings attorneygeneral or an individual in the character of plaintiff this done you go to work according to the nature of the case is it a civil one to the plaintiff you give or refuse as much of defendants property as is brought before you is it a criminal or say penal one you apply or refuse to apply to the defendant the whole or more or less of the punishment demanded for him at your hands this you do in the first instance before and without any law to authorize you for no such authorizing law have you any need of after which in the way just mentioned what you have done receives in print authority extension and permanence from the abovementioned hands being by them manufactured into a sort of fictitious law doing the office of and upon occasion overruling an act of parliament from the process pursued in the principal of these manufactories a conception it is hoped tolerably clear and correct may be formed of the manner in which this species of manufacture has been and continues to be carried on these are—  equity courts   commonlaw courts   courts christian alias spiritual alias ecclesiastical courts i turn first to the selfstyled equity courts words comprising the raw materials trust fraud accident injunction account with the word equity at their head—here we have the whole stock of them or thereabouts stock in words small but in matter as abundant as heart can desire one of them the masterword equity—so rich is it that out of it and by the strength of it anything could yet and to this day can be done that lust of power or money can covet what can it not do it can take any ward every infant out of the arms of any and every father and at the fathers expense keep cramming it with the pap of imposture and corruption till the father is reduced to beggery and the entire mass of the childs rendered as foul as that of the crammers mind equity what means it a bettermost yes and that the very best sort of justice but justice being the whole together so good a thing what must not this very best sort be be it what it may that which on each occasion is done by the judge of an equity court is it not equity well then by the charm attached to this fascinating word to whatsoever he does not only compliance and acquiescence but admiration and laud in the accustomed and requisite quantity are secured ii next as to the commonlaw courts and in particular the great criminallaw court—the kings bench conspiracy blasphemy libel malice breach of peace bonos mores with their et cæteras—of these raw materials is composed the stock of the commonlaw manufactory that which equity does for chancellor that or thereabouts the single word conspiracy would of itself be sufficient to do for chiefjustice of kings bench with this word in his mouth what is it a chiefjustice cannot do who is there he cannot punish what is there he cannot punish for persons conspire things conspire—to produce effects of all kinds good as well as bad in the very import of the word conspiracy is therefore included the conspiracy to do a bad thing now then so as proof has been but given of a conspiracy that is to say of the agreeing to do a something or the talking about the agreeing to do it the badness of this same something and the quality and quantity of the badness follow of course they follow from the vis termini the very meaning of the word and may therefore without special proof be assumed     so far so good where you have two or more to punish but how if there be but one in this case a companion must be found for him but this companion it is not necessary he should have a name he may be a person unknown for because one of two criminals is unknown is it right that the other should escape from justice so much for the kings bench manufactory taken singly now for ditto and common pleas united cases and suits called civil verbal stock here—case trover assumpsit with their et cæteras conspiracy blasphemy peace and malice—these words were found already in the language and whatsoever was the occasion or the purpose required only a little twisting and wresting to make them fit it bonos mores trover and assumpsit had to be imported bonos mores and assumpsit from italy trover from france all of them had to undergo in the machinery more or less of improvement ere they were fit for use face would have been as intelligible as case and served as well had fortune been pleased to present it clover as trover mumpsit as assumpsit but case trover and assumpsit had fortune on their side iii now as to court christian no fissure violent or gradual requisite here nothing requisite to be done otherwise than in the quiet way by splicing by splicing performed imperceptibly and in the dark in the pitchy darkness of the very earliest ages no need of custom of snatching in the manner that will be seen presently from any other branch of the judge and co firm simple addition was the only change needed mode of proceeding or say recipe this—take any act of any person at pleasure call it a sin add to it a punishment call the punishment a penance observe that the agent has a soul say that the soul wants to have good done to it say that the penance will do this good to it if frightened at the word sin the people endure to be thus dealt with anybody is employed to accuse anybody of any one of these sins if then he fails to make answer in proper form you make him do this penance so of course in case of conviction now as to fees fees you receive for calling for the answer fees for allowing it to be made fees for making it and so on successively for every link in the chain but suppose no such answer made oh then comes excommunication an operation by which whether he does or does not think that he will be made miserable in the other world he will at any rate be made sufficiently so in this a circumstance particularly convenient in this case was and is that besides the fees received in the course of the prosecution the penance and the excommunication themselves have been made liquifiable into fees sin in this case it was necessary should be the word not crime or civil injury but the same obnoxious act might and may still be made to receive all these different appellations and on account of it the agent dealt with in so many different ways made to wit after the truth of it has by the three different authorities in and by their several different and mutually inconsistent processes been ascertained the act suppose a blow and the sufferer a clergyman common pleas gives to this same sufferer money for remedy to the civil injury kings bench takes money from the man of violence for the king court christian takes money from the same for the good of his soul distributing the bonus among the reverend divines spiritually learned brethren true it is that upon proper application made—one of these same judicatories the kings bench to wit may stop proceedings in one of the others—the court christian to wit but defendant—what gets he by this one certain suit for the chance of ridding himself of another and note that in this fourth suit the mode of establishing the fact which is the ground of the application is different from every one of the modes respectively pursued in the other three such is the species of manufacture spinning out of words the sort of piecegoods called law and that of the goodness that cloth would be of if spun out of cobwebs now then even from early time—time so early as the year     —time not posterior by more than two centuries to the original period all along in question—what need or pretence has there been for it not any so early as the year      parliament gave birth to an idea by which had it been pursued appropriatelymade law might in no small proportion have been made in such sort as to occupy the place usurped by the spurious sort thus spun out blindfold in the expostfacto way in the course of judicature at the tail of a paragraph having for its subjectmatter an odd corner of the field of law the scribe of that day as if by a sudden inspiration soars aloft and as if from an airballoon casting his eyes over the entire field goes on and says and whensoever from henceforth it shall fortune in the chancery that in one case a writ is found and a like case falling under the law and requiring like remedy is found the clerks of the chancery shall agree in making the writ after which for appropriate confirmation follows reference duly made to the superordinate authority the next parliament behold here provision made for codification here was seed sown but the soil not yet in a state to admit of the growth of it in     the barbarous mode of expostfacto judgemade law were therefore of necessity fumbled out such indispensable arrangements without which society could not have been kept together for ages by common law alone equity not being grown up to sufficient maturity were these arrangements made but after all that had been thus done and amidst all that was afterwards doing by common law abundant and urgent remained the need of such arrangements in addition to those the topics legislated upon in this same blind and spurious mode by chancellors with the word equity in their mouths may serve to show   trust   fraud   accident these three have been already mentioned add to them—  injunction meaning prohibition as to use made of property in immoveables   injunction as to pursuit of remedy at common law   account expressions all these so handy and commodious because singleworded add to them moreover   obligations to deliver in kind things due   obligation to perform in kind services due these with the exception of injunction as applied to commonlaw suits belonging to substantive law add to all the following which belong to adjective law or say judicial procedure   elicitation of evidence from the parties on both sides—oral from their testimony real and written from their possession  0 at the time allotted to elicitation of orally elicited evidence the quantum rendered always adequate to the demand    elicitation and recordation made for eventual use without actual suit all these objects had and still has common law as we shall show left in a manner to shift for themselves left either without any provision at all made for them or without any other than such by which the purpose cannot in any tolerably adequate degree be answered think now of the enormity of the deficiency left and inaptitude exhibited by the assemblage of all these gaps—   first as to trust think of a system of law under which in relation to this head nothing or next to nothing was done over the whole field of law particularly over the civil extends the demand for the matter which belongs to the head of trust power exercisable for the benefit of the possessor it is called power power in so far as not exercisable but for the benefit of some other person or persons is called trust in particular in the hands of all public functionaries considered as such what power soever has place is so much trust   secondly as to fraud over the whole expanse of the field of law more particularly the penal branch extends the need of provision in relation to fraud in whatever shape maleficence operates fraud shares with violence the privilege of officiating as its instrument   thirdly as to accident of the import of this term the vagueness immediately strikes the eye but for bringing to view some conception of the application on this occasion made of it—the two words—conveyance and obligatoryengagement may here serve of the provisions requisite to be made under this head the principal beneficial purpose is the prevention of disappointment the grand and allcomprehensive purpose by which the purport of the portion of law occupied in the giving security for property requires to be determined   fourthly as to injunction applied to the purpose of restraining mischief to immoveable property injunction meaning interdiction or say inhibition or prohibition for in ordinary language we speak of enjoining a man to do a thing as well as to forbear doing it as to the operation performed under this name by a court of equity it has for its correspondent and opposite operation that which under the name of a mandamus is performed in the courts of common law in the case of the mandamus the act commanded is a positive act in the case of the injunction commonly a negative act note here by the bye that to the provision made by both these remedies together belongs the property of inadequateness for to the evil whatsoever may have been the amount of it which antecedently to the attempt made by them respectively to stop it has already taken place—no remedy do they attempt or so much as profess to make application of no compensative remedy no satisfaction in any other shape no punitive and at the charge of an honest what is the profit which a dishonest man will not be ready to make if assured that the worst that can happen to him for it is the being stopt from making more to himself no punishment to the party wronged no satisfaction but as to any such ideas as those of allcomprehensiveness and adequacy nearer would they be to a bed of colchester oysters than they are to a bench of english judges—a bench—whatsoever be the number of seats on it whether one four or twelve   fifthly injunction as applied to the pursuit of remedy at common law now for a riddle to itself by itself this operation would not naturally be expected to be seen applied it would be to the same operation performed by equity what suicide is to the species generally understood by the name of homicide as little would it under the same judicial establishment have been applied to the operations of any judicatory by another calling itself a court of equity if to common sense in union with common honesty it were possible to obtain admission into such a     theatre setting up one judicatory to put a stop at the command of any man that will pay for it to the operations of another and frustrate what in profession were its designs and this without so much as a supposition of error on the part of the judicatory so dealt with—in an arrangement such as this may be seen a flower of ingenuity that assuredly would in vain be looked for in any other field than that of english judicature but though no commonlaw court as such nor therefore any commonlaw court which is merely a commonlaw court has as yet it is believed been in the practice of thus dealing by itself yet an english judicatory there is which being like the marine corps of an amphibious and moreover of an ambodextrous nature has been and as often as called upon continues to be in the practice of robbing the chancery shop of this part of its custom by employing one of its hands in tying up the other and one portion of its own thinking part such as it is in frustrating what had in profession been the designs of the other this riddle is the court of exchequer for a parallel suppose this—enactment that no public building shall ever be erected—no church no palace no prison no posthouse—without employment successively given to two architects the first to erect a building in one style—say the gothic—the second to pull it down and erect upon the site of it another in a different style—say the grecian taken in both its parts matched thus in absurdity would the equity injunction system be exceeded it would not be were the mental cause of the evil mere folly without knavery gotham itself would find itself here outgothamised   sixthly as to account think of a judiciary establishment with three superior courts in it professing each of them to settle mutual accounts to any amount and on that ground receiving fees before anything is done and at the hands of all applicants these professed auditors two out of the three all the while unprovided with the machinery without which that which they undertake to do cannot be done the case is—the process of account is—not as in other cases a simple and transitory but a compound and a continuous process the subjectmatter being an aggregate composed of two sets of demands made one on each side each of them in case of contestation capable of affording the matter of a separate suit the process continuous as it is the common pleas the only one of the three courts which in a case between subject and subject took cognizance of it by right gave itself no means of performing otherwise than within the relatively short and determinate space of time into which the business if performed at all could be injected and condensed like the business of a play under the dominion of the unities this business the only judicatory capable of going through in all cases is the equity court this has it is true machinery enough and takes time enough but the machinery of it having for its object and effect the multiplication of fees and thence the prolongation of time the only sure result is the division of a large proportion if not the whole of the property of the accountant parties among the tribe of auditors and it is like a prize in a lottery if any portion of the net balance finds its way into the pocket of him to whom it is due   seventhly as to delivery of things to the right owner the case of restitution included think of a system of law by which no one moveable thing whatsoever was or to this day is so much as undertaken to be secured to the rightful owner no not so much as undertaken for if a man not even imagining himself to have right on his side has possessed himself as without exposing himself to punishment he may do of whatever moveable thing of yours you most value—a horse a picture an unpublished manuscript for example—what remedy have you an action behold now how much better off in this case your dishonest adversary the wrongdoer is than you the party wronged only in case of its not being worth so much as it is valued at does he give you back what he has thus robbed you of and by this action what even in case of success is the utmost you can get not unless the man who has thus injured you so pleases the thing itself but instead of it what is called the value of it this value being what has been set upon it at full gallop by twelve men brought together by chance twelve men not one of whom unless by accident understands anything about the matter the estimate having been thus made this same wrongdoer it is who after the days or months he has had for consideration takes his choice and determines whether to let you have your property back again or to convert it to his own use and this money when the jury have awarded it to you will you have it clear not you indeed not this money will you have but the difference between this and what you will have to pay your attorney after he has received what in the name of costs has been awarded to you at the expense of the wrongdoer and the amount of that same money received—what will it be something or nothing or less than nothing as it may happen provided always that the said wrongdoer has the money and that money capable of being reached by the so precariously effective process of the law estates in land money in the funds shares in jointstock companies with property in an indeterminate number of other shapes being of the number of things not thus reachable       eighthly as to fulfilment of obligatory engagements think of a system of law which gives not effect to any one sort of engagement which men living in society have need to enter into unless the intended violator of the engagement pleases in this case behold the same favour to the wrongdoer as in the justmentioned case instead of fulfilment money received from the dishonest man if he has it and choose to give it unless he choose to give it none agree for example for the purchase of an estate common law does not so much as profess to give it you natural procedure would give it you in a few days equity will give it you or not give it you but when at the end of several times the number of years the case is that bating the obtainment of a lot of land in entirety or a portion of it by partition among coproprietors or a portion by a writ called an elegit in lieu of a debt—a process too complicated and rarely exemplified to be worth describing here—such is the lameness of the law that for administering to a party wronged satisfaction for the wrong the only species of remedy which the commonlaw partners in the firm of judge and co are saving the narrow exception afforded by the case of a mandamus to this hour provided with is that which consists in money money of the defendants if after paying charges by good fortune any such money is left and can moreover be come at for which purpose the sheriff of the county that is to say under his name and by his appointment a nobodyknowswho seizes and causes to be sold whatever is comeatable and saleable the remedial system being in such a state that a man may have to the amount of any number of millions in the shape of government annuities and each one of a variety of other shapes without the sheriffs being able were he ever so well disposed to come at a penny of it one consequence of which is that a dishonest man with other mens money in his hands may consume it in luxuries or do anything else with it he pleases if he had rather continue in a comfortable apartment in a prison than part with it so much as to substantive law now as to adjective law and therein as to evidence   ninthly as to elicitation of evidence from the testimony and the possession of parties think of a set of judges with whom it was and still is a principle to keep justice inexorably destitute of evidence from this its most natural most instructive and oftentimes sole and thence indispensably needful source a defendant suppose is in court is this or is it not your handwriting my lord chiefjustice—will he put any such question to him not he indeed will he suffer it to be put to him as little good reason why infinite is the crop of fees that would be nipt in the bud by any such impertinence and if a question of this sort were to be allowed to be put what reason could be given for refusing to give allowance to any other considering how unpleasant it would be to a dishonest man with an honest mans money in his hands to part with it still more so to a malefactor to do anything that could contribute to his punishment—considering all this and in all sincerity sympathizing with these their partners and best friends—conscience in these tender hearts revolts at the idea of any such cruelty thus it is with the commonlaw branch of the firm somewhat less sensitive are the nerves of the equity branch evidence it has brought itself to draw from this so surely reluctant source but it is on one condition and that is—that years be employed in doing that which might be so much better done in a few minutes and pounds by hundreds or thousands in doing that which might be so much better done at no expense  0 tenthly as to the time allotted to the elicitation of really elicited evidence and the adjustment of the quantity of it to the demand very little to the taste of the commonlaw branch is any apt adjustment of this sort in what manner it reconciles opposite mischiefs—delay and precipitation—turning them both to account has been shown under these same heads general rule—the less the quantity of such evidence and the less the time consumed in the elicitation of it the better for nothing is there to be got by it as to elicitation in the epistolary mode nothing even at this time of day does common law know of any such thing for this employment of the pen neither at the primeval period in question nor for many centuries thereafter were hands sufficient to be found that sort for which alone there was in all that time clerk power in sufficiency was that which being essentially false was distinguished as above mentioned by the name of pleadings—written pleadings and by which as much money thus employable as the pecuniary means of the country could furnish was to be got so much for common law for equity it was that fortune reserved this the richest mine in the field of procedure observing how much was to be got by penmanship it sets its inventive genius to work and having invented this new mode of elicitation stept in proffered its services and got to itself this new branch of the evidenceeliciting business terms and conditions as usual time by years pounds by hundreds or thousands as above under the head of the mendacity device reference is made to the present one for a hotbed and mode of culture in and by which this fruit so delicious to learned palates is forced now for a sketch of it frequently not to say generally a part more or less considerable     of the evidence necessary to substantiate the plaintiffs case has for its source the recollection of the defendant of course not always without more or less of hurt to his feelings can this sort of information be furnished by this same defendant in tender consideration thereof commonlaw judges as above refuse so much as to call upon him or even to suffer him to furnish it the keeper of the great seal and of the kings conscience is not quite so difficult he has his terms however to make with the plaintiff and they are these whatever the defendant knows that will help your case you will of course says his lordship to the plaintiff be for asking him for and putting questions to him accordingly good and the answers he shall give but it is upon this condition before you ask him how the matter stands you must yourself begin and tell him how it stands otherwise no answers shall you have this is what you must do as to every fact you stand in need of now then to do this you must of course for each such fact have a story framed such as will suit your purpose but that it is your counsels business to do for you he and he alone knows what is proper for the occasion what it consists of is a parcel of lies to be sure but thats his concern not yours you have not to swear to them i and mine get money by all this so there is no harm in it and as you do not swear to it you cant be punished for it as to another world that to be sure there is and with a gods court in it but there it is your counsel that will have to answer for it not you you cant help it no nor he neither without losing his fees i for my part have some thousands of these lies upon my back or i should not be where i am look at me what am i the worse for it    eleventhly as to elicitation and recordation made for eventual use without suit be the occasion what it may be the source what it may evidence obtainable today may cease to be obtainable tomorrow here then may be seen a deficiency but as to the want of supply for it at the early age in question no wonder it should have had place in the field of justice much insight into future contingency was not to be expected from men who to so vast an extent were blind to what was in this same field passing under their own noses for this deficiency equity had no objection to afford a supply but of course upon her own terms—those terms which have so often been brought to view those terms required a suit on purpose for a suit was necessary to equity how little soever necessary to justice as to recordation—at the early period above mentioned clerkpower enough there was for the pleadings—the mixture of lies and absurdities above described none was there for the evidence the only sort of matter which presented a chance of being chiefly composed of relevant and material truths accordingly in the mass of matter called the record no sort of matter can there be so sure of not being found as that which stands distinguished by the name of evidence not but that to prove its own existence the entire hodgepodge may on a particular occasion fees being first received be admitted under the name of evidence to prove for example that a man was convicted of murder but by what it was that the murder was produced—whether for example by an endeavour to kill the man or by an endeavour to kill a fowl for for this has a man been convicted of murder—if this be what at present you want to know in the newspaper you may be sure to find it in the record you will be sure not to find it such for exigencies of all sorts being the provision made by common law before the birth of equity—made in the commonlaw courts before the formation of the equity courts—behold now the account given of it by blackstone speaking of an old book in latin called the registrum brevium—composed chiefly of forms of orders called writs given in the name of the king to the sheriffs—in it says he iii     every man who is injured will be sure to find a method of relief exactly adapted to his own case described in the compass of a few lines and yet without the omission of any material circumstance so much for blackstone to the dream of this reporter would you substitute the sad reality for a put no for omission put insertion make these corrections the picture will be nearer the truth dates none arrangement none other than the alphabetical either in the collection itself or in judge fitzherberts commentary on it and in the additions made to that commentary in any subsequent editions made of it so much for the universal oracle such is the source from whence the notions of the universal unlearned as to what the law is have down to this time been derived to return to equity court in the provision made by common law gaps requiring to be filled up sure enough sufficient sufficient in number sufficient in magnitude necessity of filling up sufficiently urgent but for the filling them up was any additional court either a necessary or so much as a proper instrument an additional court thus kept distinct and separate from the court to which it was added more particularly a court invested with such powers as in relation to the court it was added to were assumed by this same so called court of equity—a court superior to it in effective power and yet without being either in name or nature a   0 court of appeal from it taking up the matter at the pleasure of any man who without any ground whatsoever would pay the price set upon the injustice at any stage of the suit riding over the competent authority and rendering useless everything that had been done and throwing away every penny that had been expended in that same judicatory the thus maltreated judicatory all the while not the less abundantly lauded for the being regarded as requiring to be thus dealt with a sort of severance this mischievous enough—and as such worthy enough of remark at any time but at present a circumstance which gives to it in the particular case in question a particular degree of importance—gives to the particular case of severance here in question and produces accordingly the need for thus dwelling on it is—the care which on the occasion of the recently instituted improvements has been taken to keep it up this same severance and of course along with it the uncertainty delay vexation expense and lawyers profit engendered by it lastly as to the aggregate composed of the four courts thus instituted—the several separate denominations of necessity attached to them the jurisdiction formed by the several splinters thus put side by side and the mischievous consequence flowing of course from the very nature of the operation—splitting and splicing operation of the application thus made of so many different names the consequence is—the implied information and assurance of the existence and thence of the necessity of so many different natures and modes of proceeding on the part of the several courts thus differently denominated in the case of these denominations what serves to fix and thicken the cloud composed of them is their being derived from different sources in some cases the source is the name of the species or rather as will be seen the subspecies of suit in other cases the initiatory process—that is to say the written instrument by the delivery of which or the operation by the performance of which the suit takes its own commencement behold them here they are— i under the species of suit termed civil name of the initiatory process if in the common pleas action if in the kings bench in one sort of case action likewise in another sort of case comes the name of the instrument mandamus name of an operation by which it is preceded motion for a mandamus in another sort of case name of the instrument quo warranto name of the antecedent operation motion for a quo warranto in an equity court including the equity side of the amphibious court—the exchequer—bill in the commonlaw side thereof action in another sort of case in a christian court name of the instrument libel ii under the species of suit termed criminal or penal—common to all these courts in one sort of case is one subspecies attachment to which denomination is in some cases substituted the circumlocutory and milder denomination constituted by the antecedent operation—motion that the defendant may answer the matter of the affidavit this being the initiatory instrument in another sort of case in the kings bench name of one sort of instrument indictment in the same sort of case in that same court name of another sort of instrument information name of the antecedent operation motion for leave to file an information in the same sort of case still in that same court name of the instrument again information name of the antedent operation filing an information to wit by the attorneygeneral without motion in another sort of case in the exchequer name of the instrument qui tam information in another sort of case in the christian court name of the instrument libel again note here by the bye in the case of this word libel the confusion further thickened by the giving to one and the same appellative the commission of officiating as the sign of two opposite things signified namely an alleged disorder and a professed remedy sufficient it is hoped this exhibition without the addition of the rarer sorts of suits such as the scire facias and its et cæteras such is the enrichment which the vocabulary of english jurisprudence has actually received from the principle pursued by this practice the employing different operations with different instruments for the attainment of the same end what bounds are there to the ulterior enrichment which from the same principle it might with as good reason be made to receive take a few examples— first as to courts by multiplication given to the names and with them to the species of these judicatories one example may here serve take for a model the court of equity with this its sentimental name additional courts with like imitative names—court of probity court of integrity court of common honesty court of honour court of righteousness another such winning name court of conscience in point of propriety forming a striking contrast with the court of equity has already been brought into employment by statute law take secondly and lastly for the instrument of multiplication and confusion the name of the instrument by which commencement is given to the process model in this case the word libel—a word meaning in the original latin a little book proposed imitative names of instruments—leaf sheet roll scroll volume yes volume for in some cases     in equity more especially scarcely to the existing sort of instrument—the bill to wit—would even this appellative notwithstanding the seeming exaggeration be altogether misapplied now as to the degree of appositeness with which the signs are here coupled with the things signified for an emblem of it take two hats into one put the things into the other the signs which done then having drawn out of the one a thing draw out of the other a sign for it as on a twelfthday styles and titles are coupled with slices of cake and names of cakeeaters in the aggregate of all this surplusage may moreover be seen one out of the host of visible examples of the way in which by the english lawyer as by the astrologer—and for the same purpose—has been created out of nothing a sort of sham science correspondent to this science with the art belonging to it is the list of official functionaries employed on this occasion in the exercise of the art note well the multiplicity and ingenious variety of their denominations by one single one alone of the four westminsterhall courts the kings bench is furnished the list which follows but for a standard of comparison note first the sorts of functionaries which under the official establishment hereinafter proposed for giving execution and effect to the here proposed natural system of procedure would be requisite and necessary under the command of the judge here it follows—  registrar   prehensor or say arrestor   summoner   doorkeeper   jailor now then follows the list of those actually in existence as above under the kings bench—  chief clerk   master   marshal of kings bench prison   clerk of the rules   clerk of the papers   clerk of the dockets judgments satisfactions commitments c   clerk of the declaration   clerk of the common bails posteas and estreats   signer of the writs  0 signer of the bills of middlesex    custos brevium    clerk of the upper treasury    clerk of the outer treasury    marshal and associate    sealer of the writs    judges clerks    sheriffs of london and sheriff of middlesex    secondaries    undersheriff  0 ushers tipstaffs c here at length ends the list of the swarm of locusts which buzzes about this one of the four courts—the kings bench places of feeding no fewer than ten some of them not less than three miles from one another calculate who can the quantity of time consumed with expense correspondent by attorneys in the journeys necessary to be made all over this labyrinth xiv result of the fissure—groundless arrest for debt comes now the battle royal—battle of the courts battle for the fees result groundless arrest as at present on pretence of debt effect imposed on innocence an aggregate of suffering vying in severity with that inflicted on the aggregate of crime let it not here be supposed though it were but for a moment that on imprisonment for debt condemnation without reserve is meant to be pronounced condemn in the lump—condemn without exception—imprisonment and even imprisonment for debt for debt you would condemn all satisfaction and as well might you for all crime condemn all punishment look for the proper time you will find it in that of the second of the operations requisite to be performed in the course of the suit at the time of and by the first the existence of an adequate demand for this same second operation having been ascertained improper time that of the first operation this same first operation being the arrest itself performed without any such ascertainment performed by the judge without inquiry and at the pleasure of any one who will purchase of him this service at the price he has set upon it—upon so simple a distinction turns in this case the difference between the perfection of good and the perfection of evil ascertained asks somebody the existence of this same adequate demand by what means answer by this means—to give commencement to the suit attends in court the plaintiff and stating his demand states at the same time the need there is of the arrestation subjectmatter of it either the body of the proposed defendant or some property of his or both this operation in the next instance otherwise on hearing of the demand off go person or property or both and therewith all hope of recovery for the debt—all hope of effectual justice mark now the security afforded by the here proposed course against the oppression now so completely established and so abundantly exercised—the oppression exercisable at pleasure by any man in the character of plaintiff on almost any man in the character of defendant at the same time the superior efficiency of the means afforded for the recovery of the debt being thus in the presence the applicant is completely in the power of the judge unlimited is the amount of the punishment to which in case of purposed and mischievous misrepresentation he may be subjected in this state of things two opposite dangers present themselves to the judges choice in case of the nonexercise of this power of precautionary seizure—danger of injustice to the     detriment of the plaintiff by loss of the debt in case of the exercise of this same power danger of injustice to an indefinite amount to the detriment of the proposed defendant thus dealt with between these two opposite mischiefs who does not see that no otherwise than by a scrutiny into the circumstances of each individual case can any tolerably well grounded choice be made and for this scrutiny no source of information has place as yet other than the evidence of the applicant extracted by his examination an information without which or any other under the existing system arrestation is performed without scruple that is to say on the body and with as little might it be though at this stage of the proceedings it never is on property this power then either it is exercised or it is not if yes security will need to be taken for two things   for the applicants effectual responsibility to the purpose of compensation or that of punishment or both as the case may require   for his being eventually reached by a mandate or in case of need by a functionary armed with a warrant for arrestation wheresoever it may happen to him to be during the continuance of the suit—a security this last the demand for which it may be seen has place in the instance of every person to whom for whatever purpose in whatever character it happens to have presented himself to a judge a security with which for reasons that will be seen judge and co know better than to have provided themselves with why say attendance not appearance because by lying lips and pens the word appearance has been to such a degree poisoned as to be rendered unfit for use when in the record entry is made of what is called the defendants appearance in court what is the real fact never that he the defendant has made his appearance in court always that an attorney employed by him has made his appearance nor even this in the court but in another place to wit in one of the offices of the nature of those contained in the abovementioned list to return to the applicants here proposed actual attendance in most instances it will be possible and with advantage practicable but in some instances it will be either impossible or not with advantage practicable of these last cases for the purpose of the here proposed system a list has been made out so likewise of all the shapes of which the justmentioned security is susceptible which list may be seen below so likewise of all the several diversifications of which the mode of securing intercourse or say communication with an applicant or any other person who has made his appearance during the continuance of the suit is susceptible for the institution of this little cluster of arrangements a combination of common sense and common ingenuity with common honesty was indeed necessary but at the same time sufficient in the provision made by the existing system where is there to be seen any symptom of the union of these same requisites how should there be without the existence of the applicant in the presence of the judge at the outset of the suit nothing of all this can be done and as there is such continual occasion to observe scarcely can the presence of a dun be more appalling to a spendthrift than in a civil case to an english supremecourt judge the presence of an individual whose property and under the system of mechanical judicature as hath been seen in most cases without knowing anything about the matter he is disposing of now for want of some such as these proposed arrangements under the existing system behold the state of things general rule this at the pleasure of any man without grounds existing or so much as pretended to exist any man may be arrested and consigned to a jail with no other alternative than that of being if able and willing to pay for the accommodation consigned to an arrestinghouse called a lockuphouse or a spunginghouse exceptions are—  where the debt does not amount to so much as £ 0   where when it does amount to that sum the plaintiff omits to make an affidavit whereby he avows upon oath that the sum demanded by the suit is justly and truly due and this without adding upon the balance so that a man to whom another owes £ 0000 may be arrested by him on a particular account specified for £ 0 originally the sum mentioned on the occasion and for the purpose of the limitation thus applied was no more than £ 0 it is by a recent act that it has been raised to this same £ 0 in the year of our lord      original act that of the    geo i ch    year of our lord      date of the act under which for the benefit of the court of common pleas the practice of arrest for debt was established year of our lord      thus had the abomination been reigning a hundred and sixtyfive years before so much as this alleviation was applied to it yet such as it is keen in judge and co was the sense of the injury thus done to the whole partnership faces lengthened by the recollection and report of it were witnessed by persons yet alive oh precious security mark now a set of incidents any one of which would suffice for rendering it ineffectual—   in case of mutual accounts a man who is a debtor on the balance and moreover in a state of insolvency in such sort as to be incapable of making compensation for the wrong is free to make use of it in such sort     as to inflict vexation and perhaps ruin on the creditor thus dealt with   no limit is there to the multitude of knowingly false demands which to the wrong of one man may thus be made by any other and this without his being at the expense of a perjury by which however if committed he would not in more than the trifling degree which under the head of oaths has been seen be exposed to hazard   to a man who is about to leave england having therein no property or none but what he is taking with him or none which by such inadequate means as the law affords can be come at this apparent check is it will be seen no real one   on so easy a condition as the finding another man who being a man of desperate fortunes will for hire perform his part in this so extensively contemned ceremony—any man may cause his intended victim to be arrested for sums to any amount and thereby for a sum for which it will not be possible for the victim to find bail   the assertion is admitted without being in any case subjected to crossexamination hence the invitation to mendacity and perjury   to those alone whose connexions on the spot in addition to the opulence of their circumstances admit of their finding bail is the privilege of being conveyed to a spunginghouse instead of a jail extended so much for inadequacy now for incongruity to the abovementioned efficient causes of inadequacy may be added the following features of incongruity relation had to the existing system—   swearing to the existence of the debts the affidavitman is forced to swear to his knowledge of the state of the law that same law which with such successful care it has been rendered and kept impossible for any man to know   the testimony thus delivered is testimony delivered by a man in his own favour in contradiction to a rule and principle of common law note that inconsistency not inaptitude is the ground of condemnation here general result—with the exception of the privileged few every man exposed to ruin at the pleasure of every other who is wicked enough and at the same time rich enough to accept of the invitation which the judges and their associates in the iniquity never cease thus to hold out to him so much for the evil done by the battle and the good which so obviously should have occupied the place of that same evil now for the battle itself origin of the war—power thence custom surreptitiously obtained from parliament by the judges of the common pleas a little after the restoration at the expense of the judges of the kings bench the power thus obtained was that of employing in an action for debt this same operation of arrest in giving commencement to the suit by the known acquisition of this power was made to all who would become customers the virtual offer of the advantage that will be seen in the case of the honest plaintiff it consisted in the obtaining his right in a manner more prompt and sure than before in the case of the dishonest plaintiff to this same advantage was added as has been seen the power of ruining other persons in a number proportioned to the compound of cupidity mulevolence and opulence belonging to him at pleasure this plan succeeded to admiration common pleas overflowed with customers kings bench became a desert roger north brother and biographer of lord keeper guildford at that time chiefjustice of the common pleas depictures in glowing colours the value of the conquest thus made at this time hale—the witchhanging hale—prime object of judge and cos idolatry—was chiefjustice of the kings bench chagrined to the degree that may be imagined by the falling off of his trade he put on of course his considering cap what was to be done after the gravest consideration he at length invented an instrument as a manuscript of his published in hargraves law tracts informs us—an instrument with the help of which he himself with his own hands succeeded in stealing that same power which the legislature had given to the court of common pleas yes so he himself informs us so blind to the wickedness of telling lies and getting money by it—so dead to the sense of shame had been made by evil communication this so eminently pious as well as bestintentioned judge that ever sat upon a westminsterhall bench name of the instrument the ac etiam description of it not quite so short to give it we must go back a little at the primeval period so often mentioned the great allcompetent judicatory had received of course at the hands of the conqueror this same power of arrestation applicable at discretion at the time when by the original fissure the allotment of jurisdiction was given to the common pleas—to that judicatory to enable it to give execution and effect to its decrees was given the power of operating to this purpose on property in certain of its shapes the power of operating on person not being given to this court except that at the end of a longprotracted course of plunderage of which presently came the process of outlawry outlawry—a rich compost in which in a truly admirable manner barbarity and impotence to the proper and professed purpose were combined     on this same occasion the cases remaining to the kings bench branch of the allcomprehending jurisdiction after the fissure were those in which under the name of punishment suffering was purposely inflicted sometimes called penal sometimes criminal was the class composed of these cases by the words treason felony and misdemeanor were originally marked out so many degrees treason the highest in the scale of punishment with like effect between felony and misdemeanor was afterwards inserted the word premunire in process of time a little below misdemeanor kings bench contrived to slip in the word trespass and thus armed as opportunity served it began its encroachments on the jurisdiction and fees of the helpless common pleas misdemeanor meant and means misconduct or say misbehaviour trespass meant transgression transgression in the original latin transgressio is the going beyond a something the something on this occasion understood was of course a law not that any such thing was in existence no matter on this as on every other part of the field of common law it was feigned when for anything or for nothing it was the pleasure of the king or of any man whom it pleased him to allow thus to act in his name that a person should be dealt with in this manner plaintiffs attorney went to the shop and the foreman on hearing it sold him an order directed to the sheriff in the body of which instrument that functionary was informed that defendant had committed a trespass and from the sheriff the information would in course pass on to the defendant when the time came for his finding himself in lobs pound in process of time came a distinction a distinction between trespass simply and trespass upon the case much the wiser the defendant was not for the information in either instance how much soever the poorer trespass meant nothing except that the man was in the way to be punished and trespass upon the case meant just as much here then were two instruments now for another such this was the word force whatever was done by force not warranted by legal authority was it was seen in everybodys eyes a crime out of this word was accordingly made this other powersnatching instrument one vast acquisition thus made with it and it was a vast one was the cognizance of suits having for their subjectmatter title to landed property to every man who claimed a portion of land intimation was given—that if he would say he had been turned out of it instead of turned out using the word ejected relief should be given to him by kings bench relief by exemption from no small portion of the delay expense and vexation attached to the preliminary and as will be seen so ingeniously wiredrawn process of the common pleas ejected means turned out by tossing and how could anybody be tossed out of anything without force emboldened by success thus brilliant they went on—these preeminently learned and ingenious combatants—to the case of adultery here court temporal had to fight with court christian alias spiritual court spiritual had seen in this practice a sin and dealt with it accordingly with this sin common pleas had found no pretence for intermeddling more fortunate more bold and more sharpsighted was his lordship of the kings bench he saw in it so he assured and continues to assure the sheriff a species of rape a crime of some sort it was necessary he should see in it and the nearest sort of crime was this of rape it was committed he said vi et armis—by force and arms this invention was quite the thing that arms had in every case more or less to do in it was undeniable and seeing that on the occasion in question motion could not but have place and considering that motion can scarcely be made without a correspondent degree of force thus was this part of the charge made good and in return for their custom injured parties received from the learned shopkeeper at the charge of the adulterers money under the name of damages inconsistency was here in all its glory crime had punishment alone not damages for its fruit this was a principle yet adultery was thus made into a crime and at the same time made to yield damages it was thus a rape and not rape rape that it might be made into a crime yet not rape because if it were rape adulterers would be all of them to be hanged to which there were some objections of the weapon employed on this occasion the form was the same as that of the weapon employed as above in the war with the court of common pleas and here follows a further explanation for which it must be confessed that former place was the more proper one but in discourse clouds are not quite so easily dissipated as formed speaking to the sheriff after commanding him to take up the defendant on the ground of an accusation of trespass—trespass not giving intimation of anything except the eventual design of punishing as for a crime—his lordship went on to add as also to a demand on the score of debt to an individual naming him here then by his learned lordship were two real crimes committed in the same breath for the purpose of pretending to inflict punishment for and really reaping profit from this one imaginary crime one at the charge of the common pleas judges to whom alone by magna charta as above belonged the cognizance     of cases of debt the other at the charge of every member of the community thus subjected to the power of groundless arrest and imprisonment as above on this occasion in dumb show—dumb indeed but not the less intelligible—was this his language—all ye who believe yourselves to be in the right and all ye who know yourselves to be in the wrong but at the same time wanting the accommodation for the purpose of ruining some person you have fixed upon come to my shop there is my prison and to it he or she shall go thus much to wishedfor customers now to the sheriff take up thomas stiles and put him into your jail when there he will be in our power we will make him pay a sum of money which john noaks says he owes him such in the address of the chiefjustice to the sheriff was and is the language of the appropriate document—the only source from which any conception could be formed of the calamity into which the proposed defendant was and is thus destined to be plunged it was a writ addressed to the sheriff of the county in which the defendant was or was assumed to be resident—will be in our power be it so but suppose him actually in their power—his being so did it give them in relation to their younger brethren of the common pleas any right which they did not possess before as to his being already in their power neither was this the case nor was it so much as supposed to be but should it so happen that the sheriff had taken the man up and brought him to his lordship whose clerks signature is to the writ then the destined victim would be in his said lordships power and then he would make him comply with the demand or defend himself against it or abide the consequences as yet here is no lie but if the supposed residence of the destined defendant were anywhere but in middlesex then came the demand for lies and with it the supply lie the first—averment that defendants residence is in middlesex and by this was constituted the warrant such as it was for writ the first with its fees lie the second—said defendant is lurking and running about latittat et discurrit in this county of  the blank being filled up with the name of the county in which it suits the purpose of the plaintiff or his attorney to suppose him to be this is what he was and is told in the text of another writ addressed to the sheriff of county the second for whose information the writ addressed to his brother of middlesex is thus recited and the difference between the cost of the one writ and that of the two writs is a tax or penalty which all persons who omit to live in middlesex pay for such their default such was the plan of the counterinvasion serious and sensibly felt it cannot but have been to the potentate whose domain was thus invaded how to get back the advantage was now the question under english practice deception need it now be said is on each occasion the readiest most efficient and favourite instrument a man had forged a hand—dont trouble yourself about proving the forgery said his learned adviser forge a release a similar instrument was accordingly fabricated by the common pleas and succeeded not but the reconquest had some difficulties to contend with for as honest roger informs us kings tax and chancellors fees were affected by it but these difficulties being the only ones and these removed kings benchs mouth was thus closed no hypocrisy here for a cloak of any sort no demand so much as suspected two sharpers playing off their tricks against one another—such is the character in which even with his approbation the two lord chiefjustices are held up to view by this confidential brother of one of them outwitting one of the words employed device another increase of business the avowed object of business such as has been seen proportioned to the success the exultation produced by it proportioned to the amount of the booty the triumph of the irresistible robbers sole interests so much as pretended to be consulted the interests of judge and co of this firm his majesty was as above declared one of the partners the swinish multitude with their interest no more thought of or professed to be thought of than so many swine the kings bench was not the only place at the hands of which the helpless offspring of magna charta lay exposed to invasion another inroad was that made by the court of exchequer in the pretence made in this case no such downright and allinvolving lie was however included in this case the king was indeed stated as delivering the commandment and forasmuch as his majesty knew not on any occasion any more of the matter than the pope of rome—in this shape and thus far was a lie told but that which his majesty was represented as insinuating though but insinuating had commonly more or less of truth in it it was that the plaintiff was in his majestys debt a state of things which would of course have place in the instance of any man who had tax to pay or service to render but this same court of exchequer to which no such power had been given what business had it to meddle or make while there sat the common pleas to which the power had been and continued to be given had there even been no such judicatory as the common pleas     the only persons in whose instance anything done by the exchequer could contribute to the proposed effect would have been such as were in a state of insolvency nor yet all of these for till all demands on the account of the king were satisfied never was so much as a penny allowed to be touched by any other creditor than his said majesty yes as above observed insinuating and nothing more for all that his majesty is represented as saying is that the plaintiff says he owes a debt to his said majesty not that such is really the case so much for this enormity out of it grew another to which the word bail gives name finding bail as the phrase is is the name of one species of those securities allusion to which has been made as above in this case after having been arrested by an emissary of the sheriffs and consigned to the appropriate gaol or on paying for the indulgence kept in the house of this same emissary or some person connected with him name of the house a lockuphouse or spunginghouse he is if certain persons render themselves responsible to the sheriff or without this security if the undersheriff so pleases liberated these persons are styled the bails number of them one two or more commonly two as to what they undertake for it is in different cases different but for the most part it is the consigning the defendant to the gaol or else satisfying the plaintiffs demand as to the remedy which this same security affords—nothing could be more completely of a piece with the so industriously and inhumanly fabricated disease to the comparatively opulent an alleviation—to the comparatively indigent an aggravation complete in an admirable degree of perfection is the machinery employed in the application of it to such a degree that lengthy treatises are occupied in the description of it enormous the complication—proportionable of course the delay vexation and expense produced by it as to all this suffering what do judge and co care about it just as much as they care for the rest of the mass of suffering which the system in its other parts organizes—what a steamengine would care for the condition of a human body pressed or pounded by it directed to its proper end the process of judicial securityfinding is an operation having for its object alleviation to the hardship inseparable from the process of subjecting a patient to the sorts of operations performed upon him by the judge in each individual case applying the maximum of the alleviation of which that particular case is susceptible to all the several modifications of which this hardship is susceptible to apply one and the same modification of this process—is about as reasonable as it would be to apply to every species of disease one and the same medicine of the modifications of which this process is susceptible we shall presently have occasion to present a view to the honourable house on each occasion to the circumstances of the individuals in the individual case does the nature of things render the adaptation of it necessary and on no one occasion under the existing system can it be thus adapted in some cases of which the present case is one on the defendant but in other cases and on the occasion of every suit in the first instance that is to say at the outset of the suit on the plaintiff does the obligation require to be imposed in each such instance to the elicitation of the same individualizing circumstances the examination of the individual by the judge himself is necessary and to this process one exception excepted of which presently not more unquestionable can be the abhorrence of the most profitable malâ fide suitor than under the existing practice that of an english judge on each occasion the subserviency of the operation to the purposes of justice will depend upon the proportion of the hardship of being subjected to the particular obligation in question and the hardship which were it not imposed might have place probability being in both cases taken into account as to incarceration and confinement the more extentious and vexatious the modes of them respectively are the more urgent is the motive by which the sufferer is impelled to make choice of this bailfinding or any other mode of escape from them escape perpetual or temporary only as the case may be choice that between the fire and the fryingpan whichever it be that is embraced the exigencies of the lord chiefjustice were of course effectually and abundantly provided for from the bailing process fees upon fees from the incarceration a vast mass at once in the shape of patronage forty thousand pounds has been stated as having been refused on the occasion of the recently alleged mutiny from £ 000 to £ 0000 ayear stated as being the profit of the jailor to ascertain in each case the quantum of the enjoyment extracted by these two associates from the misery of the many—the quantum and thence the proportion—is among the operations the performance of which we beg leave with all humble submission to propose to the honourable house required at the hands of plaintiffs the security would have kept out dishonest plaintiffs—judge and cos best friends and customers of course it was not to be thought of hypocrisy required that the profession should be made and so in the language of some of the courts it was made—si fecerit te securum sinister interest required that it should be no better than a pretence performed or exacted of defendants directly opposite is the effect of this same security     thus placed the obligation renders the abovementioned ample service as to this matter—the jakes of late so notorious by the name of the secondarys office in the city of london—this abomination with the immense mass of filthy lucre at the bottom of it and the forty years patience of the constituted authorities under the stench of it speaks volumes to the case in which the process of taking examinations was and is an object of abhorrence to the judge an objection has just been alluded to as having place it is this to the sight of mere parties and in particular in the situation of plaintiffs at the outset of the suit at which stage the examination might nip it in the bud abhorrence unassuageable—to persons coming in at a stage at which the suit is established and the examination can have no such injurious effect open arms and welcome why this difference answer at the first stage the examination would exclude fees at this subsequent stage it necessitates fees to the performing or hearing the examination of a party in relation to the matter of his suit the horror of an english judge is as above insuperable to the hearing and conducting the examination of the same man under the name of a bail in relation to a matter foreign to the matter of the suit—repugnance none cause of difference the so often assigned universal cause examination of the party the time being that of the outset of the suit would as above nip the feeharvest in the bud examination of bail gives increase to it after all it depends upon incidents—incidents too intricate to be here developed—whether it is by the four sages—or now of late days one of them—that the opposition and eventual justification—so the examination is called of the bail—shall be performed or by some attorney without the benefit of that same scrutinizing process the attorney is an undersheriff—the undersheriff of the county in which as above the species of egg called the venue has been laid or into which it has been removed the undersheriff is on every occasion the deputy of the sheriff the sheriff is a great landowner who every year a fresh one is appointed by the king a servant who in the teeth of reason and scripture is appointed to serve not two only but twice two masters that is to say at the three westminsterhall commonlaw courts with the addition of the court of general sessions of the peace to this same business as well as to all business but that of parade the sheriff contributes—what a roman emperor used to contribute to a victory gained at a thousand miles distance—auspices the sheriff auspices the attorney mind and legal learning legal learning an accomplishment in which authorized by their sanction the one in so inferior a degree learned thinks it not robbery to be equal to the four sages if with the requisite amendments necessitated by change of times the system of local judicatories were restored—each judge would for all purposes be provided with his own ministerial subordinates and for all of them be would be responsible in the city of london the acting functionary under the sheriffs is styled the secondary forty years of depredation production of so many unheeded mountains heaped up one upon another of correspondent misery have at length attracted to the subject the attention of the local authorities but while eyes are shut against causes eloquence may abound effects all the while continue undiminished moreover in the same bailing process there is a gradation witness the phrases bail below and bail above bail below are bail whose aptitude is established by the attorney bail above are bail whose aptitude after or without opposition is established by the four sages bail above are in some cases the bail below thus promoted in other cases a fresh couple above and below together bail generate bailbond bailbond assignment thereof with eventual suit bond assignment and suit—fees to justice use for bail and assignment the same as for an old almanack from these particulars imperfect as they are some conception how inadequate soever may be formed of the proportion in which the aggregate property of all the unfortunates so arrested is transferred from the ordinary and undignified destination of operating in satisfaction of debts to the dignified function of contributing to the fund provided for the remuneration of legal science note here that he who makes a prudent use of the offer so liberally held out by the judges to every man—the offer thus made to ruin for him on joint account as many men as he wishes will take care that the debt sworn to shall be greater than the utmost sum for which for love or money bail can by the destined victim be procured here ends our exposition and we humbly hope the sufficient exposure of the devices by the too successful practice of which the attainment of the ends of radically corrupt judicature have been substituted to that of the ends of justice praying thus for justice and that justice accessible we proceed to pray for the means necessary to the rendering it so rendering it so to all of us without exception in particular—of the arrangements which in our eyes are calculated to produce that so desirable     effect and for the establishment of which we accordingly pray—a brief intimation is presented by the propositions following— i first as to the judiciary establishment   that for suits of all sorts criminal as well as civil there be two instances or say stages or degrees of jurisdiction style and title of the judges before whom the suit is brought in the first instance judges immediate—of those before whom it is brought in the second instance or say in the way of appeal judges appellate   that with two exceptions and these as limited as the nature of the service will permit to each judicatory cognizance be taken of all sorts of causes those included cognizance of which are at present taken by the aggregate of the several authorities by which judicature is exercised which courts will have to be abolished as soon as the causes respectively pending before them shall have been disposed of this to exclude complication uncertainty collision delay and useless expense   that these exceptions and these the only ones may be the following—military judicatories for the maintenance of discipline land and sea service included and ecclesiastical judicatories for the maintenance of ecclesiastical discipline on the part of ecclesiastical functionaries belonging to the established church   that for taking cognizance of suits in the first instance judicatories may be established in such number and situations that by an individual whose house is the most remote from the judicatory which is the nearest to it the portion of time during which in the day in question the justicechamber is open may be passed by him therein without his sleeping elsewhere than at his own home and that accordingly no individual may have more than twelve miles or thereabouts to travel in order to reach his own judicatory   that as in the existing principal court there be not in any instance sitting at the same time any more than one single judge this for individual responsibility—the sole effectual—as well as also for saving expense and delay by mutual consultation and argumentation   that to obviate delay and failure of justice every such judge be empowered and obliged to provide substitutes styled as in scotland deputies one or more having for their sole remuneration the prospect of being constituted judges principal and that when there has been time for a competent length of probation no man who has not served as depute shall be capable of being constituted judge principal in which way the provision of judge power will be as it were elastic adjusting itself at all times to the quantity of the demand judges thenceforward none but such as have served an apprenticeship to pure justice and not to the indiscriminate defence of right and wrong as at present   that seeing that if the power of deputation be conferred as above mentioned hands in number sufficient for every exigency need never be wanting every judicatory in the kingdom will hold its sittings every day in the year without exception unless needless delay and denial of justice are not deemed more consistent with regard for justice on some days than on others and that no exception be made by the sabbath unless and until it shall have been proved that the god of justice is indifferent to justice and that he who was content that an ox or an ass should be delivered out of a pit would be displeased at the animals being delivered out of the hands of the wrongdoer and that the sale of mackerel on that day is a work of more urgent necessity than the gratuitous and uninterrupted administration of justice lastly that no exception be made by the night time unless and until a night shall have been pointed out during which injustice sleeps in which so may justice likewise seeing moreover that to certain purposes under the name of police justice is in certain places in that part of the twentyfour hours even under the existing system actually administered   that to each such judicatory he attached a competent set of ministerial officers sufficient for giving in all ordinary cases execution and effect to its mandates but with power as at present in case of necessity to call in aid all persons in general the military force included this instead of the sheriff that one man who hitherto in despite of scripture and reason has been employed to serve not merely two but twice two masters this to exclude the complication with the consequent collision litigation useless expense delay and vexation which from this cause have place at present   that of these ministerial officers such as are now employed in the intercourse between judges on the one part and the respective subordinates as well as parties and witnesses on the other part such as are now empowered to use force as well as to officiate without force be distinguished by some such name as prehensors or arrestors the others distinguished from them by the name of judiciary messengers or for shortness messengers and that for trustworthiness and economy the business of messagecarrying be as far as may be performed by the machinery of the letter post  0 that the remuneration allotted to judiciary functionaries ministerial as well as magisterial be the whole of it in the shape of salary and that by no functionary belonging to the judiciary establishment money     or any other valuable thing or service under any such name or in any such quality as that of a fee be receivable on any occasion on any pretence this to exclude the expense delay extortion and vexation which have ever hitherto been produced by the multiplication of judicial instruments and operations for the purpose and with the effect of giving correspondent increase to the masses of fees    that such remuneration be paid the whole of it at the expense of the public at large no part of it at the expense of any individual or body of individuals interested fines for misconduct as below excepted this to avoid excluding of any person from the benefit of justice every person who in the suit in question is not able to pay the whole mass of the fees exacted on the occasion of that suit being at present as well as having at all times hitherto been thus excluded and because that which the rest of the community enjoy without litigants do not obtain otherwise than by and with litigation with its vexation and expense—the benefit of justice    that to obviate the danger and suspicion of partiality through private connexion no judgeimmediate principal shall remain in the same judicatory for any longer term than three years or thereabouts and that for this purpose an appropriate system of circuiting be accordingly established but that for continuing in an unbroken course the business of recordation or say registration the functionary by whom it is performed be stationary    that in every justicechamber for the better administering of that security which it is in the power of public opinion to afford for conduct apt in every respect on the part of judges—commodious situation be allotted for two classes of persons under some such name as that of judiciary inspectors the one composed of suitors waiting for their suits to come on say expectant suitors or suitors in waiting the other of probationary lawyers of whom presently    that in all sorts of suits without exception a jury shall be employable but to lessen the aggregate weight of the burthen of attendance—not till after an original hearing before the judge sitting alone nor then but by order of the judge whether spontaneous for example for the purpose of confronting such of the evidence as requires to be confronted or else at the requisition of a party on one side or the other in which case it shall be obligatory on him to order and carry on a fresh hearing termed a recapitulatory hearing or say a new trial before a jury organized in manner following    that in cases of all sorts one excepted all functions belonging to the judge one excepted shall be exercisable in common with him by the jurors the imperative or say the effectuative being that on which the effect of the suit depends being for the sake of individual responsibility allotted exclusively to the judge functions thus exercisable these—  auditive applied to everything that is to be heard   lective applied to everything that requires to be read   inspective applied to everything that requires to be seen   interrogative applied to all questions that require to be put   commentative applied to all observations which they think fit to make   ratiocinative applied to whatever reasons they think fit to give for anything which they say or do   opinative exercised by declaration made of opinion in accordance or discordance with the opinion which on the occasion of the exercise given to the effectuative function is pronounced by the judge exercised collectively as by juries under the existing system the opinative exercisable individually all the rest    that the class of cases in which the effectuative function as above shall be exercisable by the jury so far forth as to render of no effect a judgment of conviction if pronounced by the judge alone shall be that in which the higher functions of government as such have or may naturally be supposed to have a special personal interest for example—treason rebellion sedition defamation to the injury of a public functionary or set of public functionaries as such and the like    that for lessening the burthen of attendance on juries—instead of a number so superfluous as twelve a lesser number and that for the sake of a majority an uneven one—that is to say three or at the utmost five—be employed by which arrangement the practice of perjury on the part of juries in a number varying from one to eleven—perjury to wit by falsely reported unanimity with torture for the production of it will be made to cease for the better direction one out of three or two out of the five being of the class of special jurymen the foreman being to be of this class    that the institution of a grand jury with its useless delay incomplete secret naturally partial and inconsistently though happily limited applicability—be abolished    that for receiving appeals from the decrees and other proceedings and conduct on the part of the abovementioned judges immediate there be judicatories appellate all single seated in such number as experience shall have shown to be necessary if more than one station of all of them the metropolis that being the central spot to which persons from all parts of the country have occasion to resort for other purposes and at the same time that in which the bestformed and most effective public opinion has place—public opinion most influential and salutary check upon the conduct and security for the good conduct  00 of these as well as all other public functionaries and as below no evidence being proposed to be received other than that which has been orally elicited in the court below and consigned to writing no attendance by parties or witnesses will on this occasion be necessary and that after the outset of the here proposed change no person be capable of serving as judge appellate who has not for a certain length of time served as judge principal immediate  0 that in each judicatory as well appellate as immediate for officiating in suits in which government on behalf of the public at large is interested—there be a functionary under the name of the government advocate with deputation and on the part of the principal migration as in the case of the judge and superordinate to them all a government advocate general    that for administering professional assistance to suitors who by relative weakness bodily or mental are disqualified from acting as plaintiffs or defendants for themselves—or by relative indigence from purchasing assistance from professional hands—there be in each judicatory a public functionary under the name for example of eleemosynary advocate also with deputes and migration as above    that considering how opposite in their nature are the duties and habits of the judge and the advocate—impartiality the duty of the one partiality the duty and proposed misrepresentation the unavoidable practice of the other—no functionary be transferable from one to another of these lines of service    that at the head of the judiciary establishment there be placed a single functionary styled as in other countries justice minister at whose recommendation subject to his majestys pleasure as at present by the chancellor shall be filled up all other judicial situations    that accusations or complaints made against a judge immediate or appellate on the score of official delinquency or relative inaptitude from any other cause be heard and determined by the justice minister    that accusations or complaints made for the like cause against the justice minister be heard and determined by the house of lords and that on that consideration no person during the time of his officiating in the situation of justice minister shall be capable of sitting in the house of lords nor yet in the house of commons    that considering the inherent and indefeasible comparative inaptitude of so numerous a body for the purpose of constant and protracted judicature in all cases and the next to universal habitual nonexercise of this function on the part of their lordships in criminal cases—and that in civil cases their jurisdiction is in so large a proportion at present employed nor could ever fail to be employed as an engine of delay and expense operating to all his majestys subjects but a comparatively few as a denial of justice—it may please their lordships to confine the exercise of their judicial function to the abovementioned cases with the addition of such criminal cases in which at present a member of their own house is party defendant—thus making a generous sacrifice of their uncontested rights on the altar of justice    that when it has been covered by a coating of legislaturemade law the field of legislation be preserved from being overspread by an overgrowth of judgemade law for interpretation or melioration amendments proposed in terminis by judges on the occasion of the several suits being by appropriate machinery attached to the code of course unless negatived by a committee of the one house or the other—and that when these arrangements have been made no reference for any such purpose as that of interpretation to anything said by a judge in any one suit be permitted to be made in any other suit of this arrangement another use will be—that of their applying the necessary preventive to the mischief which might otherwise be produced by discrepancy between the decrees of the several appellate judicatories if more than one this when the field of law has been covered by legislaturemade law and in the mean time though not equal facility equal necessity will there be for the like provision during the time that to so immense an extent the field has no other covering than that which is composed of judgemade law—of judgemade law—that spurious and fictitious kind of law if such it must be called with the dominion of which so far as it extends all security is incompatible so much as to the judiciary establishment follows what we humbly pray in relation to procedure    that as in former times no suit shall receive its commencement but by the personal appearance of some individual in open judicatory which individual shall be responsible for his conduct in relation thereunto and to that purpose shall before he is heard for any other purpose make declaration—not only of his present abode but of such abode or abodes at which any mandate issued by the judge may be sure to reach him at all times down to that of the termination of the suit that for the purpose of all ulterior judicial processes every missive addressed to him be considered as having reached him except in case of any such accident as without  0  blame on his part may come to be alleged by him for the purpose of excuse saving to such applicant the faculty of changing such address from time to time on giving timely information thereof    that exceptions excepted the person so applying be a party whose desire it is to be admitted in the character of pursuer of which exceptions examples are—  giving simple information of an offence appearance on behalf of any person or persons   purpose of the appearance giving simple information without desire to be admitted pursuer say pursuer in all cases instead of plaintiff in civil cases and prosecutor in criminal cases as at present  0 that for noncompliance with judicial mandates an allcomprehensive system of appropriate excuses be looked out for and on the supposition of the verity of the alleged facts allowance given to them    the person by whom the matter of excuse is submitted will in general be the person to whom the mandate is addressed but in several cases such as sickness absence c from other persons excuses for him must of necessity be accepted    that the institution of excusegiving which under the name of casting essoins had place in former days when the attendance of parties instead of being as now prevented was compelled—be for this purpose reviewed and the extension which the exigence of justice requires be given to it    that on every occasion the proceedings be regulated by regard paid to convenience to wit the mutual convenience of all individuals concerned parties and witnesses this being a matter which they being on all occasions in the presence of and under examination by the judge can on each occasion be ascertained whereas under the existing technical system the rule being framed without the possibility of knowing anything of the distinguishing circumstances of individual persons and things the necessary consequence is—that in a vast majority of instances the convenience of individuals some or all is made the subjectmatter of a needless and reckless sacrifice    that all judicatories being sitting every day in the year without intermission evidence in so far as indication of its existence has been afforded by the applicant when admitted as pursuer be in such order as in each suit shall be indicated by the exigency of the individual case from each source as soon as obtainable called for and elicited and this without distinction as between copursuers coplaintiffs defendants and extraneous witnesses on both sides    that to the institution of securityfinding in general and that of sponsorship or say auxiliary bondsmanship in particular—be given the whole extent of the application and good effect which the nature of things allows to be given to them    that accordingly all the sorts of occasions on which and all the modes in which it is capable of being employed be looked out for—for the purpose of employing on each individual occasion that mode which may be employed with the most advantage to all interests concerned of modes of such security capable of being employed examples are the following— i intervention of bondsmen styled auxiliary bondsmen one two or more according to the magnitude of the sum regarded as requisite and their capacity of contributing to make up such sum each individual contributing such part as his circumstances enable him and his inclination disposes him to contribute as to the partys joining in the bond it would under the here proposed system be a needless and useless ceremony the judicatory having his property as effectually at command without it as with it ii deposit of money by the party in the hands of the registrar of the judicatory iii deposit of money by these same bondsmen in the hands of the registrar iv deposit of any moveable subjectmatter or subjectmatters of property of considerable value in small compass in the hands of the registrar v impignoration or say pledging of any immoveable or any incorporeal subjectmatter or subjectmatters of property belonging to any such auxiliary bondsmen vi with consent of the party ambulatory confinement of his person he staying or going where he pleases so it be in the custody of a person or persons appointed for that purpose vii under the same condition stationary confinement in a place other than a prison viii at the instance of the party himself imprisonment notwithstanding its afflictiveness it may happen to this security to be necessary for example in a case where security being deemed necessary to be exacted of the other party and the finding of that security highly afflictive the party in question is by strangership relative indigence or bad character disabled from finding any security less afflictive    of occasions requiring that such security be exacted examples are the following— i at the charge of a defendant need of security to a plaintiff the defendant being on the point of expatriating either his person or his property or both and the value of what is demanded at his charge bearing a large proportion to his property at the same time that supposing the demand groundless or the security needless the wrong done to the defendant if either his person or his property were  0  detained might be ruinous to him as for instance the whole of it being on the point of being expatriated on a commercial speculation in a vessel engaged by him for that purpose and he about to embark for the purpose of superintending the disposal of such his property ii on the occasion of the establishment of a mode of intercourse as above with the judicatory during the continuance of the suit want of trustworthiness may produce the need of the exaction of security at the charge of the individual in question iii whenever for any purpose it may be requisite that security be exacted at the charge of a party on either side of the suit need may also have place for the exaction of a countersecurity at the charge of the party applying for it note here that of the infinite variety of occasions on which the need of securityfinding is liable to have place the practice of bailing is but one and on each occasion the chances of its being the least inconvenient one are as infinity to one    that in regard to evidence whether the source be personal real or ready written no distinction be made between parties and witnesses who are not parties—say extraneous witnesses that is to say that from both it be alike receivable and exigible seeing that so it is in the existing smalldebt courts in the aggregate of which more suits have place than in all other courts put together in regard to exaction penal suits not excepted seeing that in the equity courts such exaction has place though by means of it the richest proprietor may be divested of the whole of his property and instances are known in which rather than submit to such a loss men have sustained imprisonment for life    that the mode employed in the elicitation of evidence under which appellative is included every averment made either by an applicant or by a party on either side be in each individual suit according to the demands of that same suit in respect of general convenience one or more of the three modes following to wit—  the oral elicited in the originating judicatory   the oral elicited in another say a subsequential judicatory to which for the convenience of a party resident in the territory thereof the inquiry is for the purpose of his examination transferred   the epistolary by means of interrogations approved of by the judge of the originating judicatory  0 that no response in the epistolary mode be received otherwise than subject to the eventual examination of the respondent in the oral mode at any time should demand have place for such examination in the judgment of the judge    that instead of being applied as in equity practice without necessity and to the exclusion of the best that is to say the oral mode the epistolary mode of eliciting evidence be no otherwise employed than for one or other of two causes namely—  either for exclusion of preponderant evil in the shape of delay expense and vexation   or of necessity elicitation in the oral mode being impracticable as for instance where at the time in question the residence of the person addressed is in the one or the other of the sister kingdoms in a distant dependency or in the dominions of a foreign state in all which cases the expense and delay of commissioners sent to the places in question will thus be saved    that for avoidance of perjury and abolition of the encouragement given to falsehood by the distinction between statement upon oath and statement to which though made without oath efficiency equal to that which is given to statement upon oath is as above shown in many cases given—no oath shall on any judicial occasion or for any eventually judicial purpose be in future administered but that every statement made on any such occasion or for any such purpose shall be termed an affirmation or asseveration and that for falsehood in respect of it whether accompanied with evil consciousness or say wilfulness or with temerity or say culpable heedlessness any such punishment purely temporal shall be appointed as the nature of the case may be deemed to require consideration in each case had of the nature of the offence to the commission of which such falsehood shall have been deemed subservient and that as often as in the course of the suit which gave rise to the falsehood—all the evidence that can bear upon the question of falsehood has been brought forward conviction and punishment may have place even on the spot without the formality and expense of an additional suit on purpose just as at present in the case of an act styled an act of contempt committed in the face of the court    that for rendering substantial justice and for avoidance of needless multiplicity of suits statements and other evidence relative to the whole of a series of wrongs be elicitable on the occasion of one and the same application such satisfaction in so far as it is in a pecuniary shape being adjusted to the state of pecuniary circumstances on both sides this where it is on one side only that complaints have place and that where there are two parties between whom for a greater or less length of time a quarrel has had place each in the way of recrimination may elicit evidence of divers wrongs of different sorts at different times from the other in which case what on the aggregate on the score of  0  compensation is due from the one forms a setoff to what is due from the other—satisfaction be accordingly allotted for the balance as also on one of the parties or both if in the judgment of the judge the case requires it—a fine be imposed for the benefit of the public on the score of the portion of the time of the judge and his subordinates which at the expense of the public has thus been occupied    that with the exception of suits in which by reason of their comparative unimportance it is purposely left unpreserved—all evidence elicited in the oral mode shall under the care of the registrar of the judicatory be minuted down as it is uttered and that of this with the addition of any such evidence as may have been adduced in the readywritten form or elicited in the epistolary form be constituted the main body of the document which under the name of the record shall in case of appeal be transmitted from an immediate to the appellate judicatory and that for this purpose the mode in which the minutations are made may be that in which under the name of the manifold mode is already in use and in which legible copies say rather exemplars to the number of eight or more are written at once whereby all danger of error as between one such exemplar and another and all expense of the skilled labour requisite for revision are saved    that towards defraying the unavoidable costs in the case of persons unable to defray them—a fund be established under the name for example of the helpless litigants fund    that all factitious costs being struck off and unavoidable costs transferred on the revenue—and professional assistance in so far as needed provided gratuitously as above—fines or say mulcts be imposable on any party in proportion as he is in the wrong which imposition may have place in a degree of amplitude far beyond any which under the existing system would be endurable if added to the burthen at present indiscriminately imposed under the name of costs on the injurer and the injured and that of these fines the produce may constitute the basis of the helpless litigants fund in the case of the wrongdoer the requisite distinction being all along made between evil consciousness and rashness or say culpable heedlessness not accompanied with evil consciousness and that for any incidental misconduct manifested in the course of the suit such fines be moreover imposable even on a party who on the main point is in the right so also on an extraneous witness not forgetting however that where the case presents to view a party specially injured no such fine can with propriety be imposed unless more be needed on the score of punishment than is due on the score of compensation forasmuch as the burthen of compensation produces as far as it goes the effect of punishment the effect—and commonly even more than the whole of the effect forasmuch as by the consideration that from his pain his adversary is receiving pleasure will naturally be produced a chagrin which cannot have place in the case when the profit goes into the public purse    that as well of the judiciary establishment code as of the judicial procedure code the language be throughout such as shall be intelligible to all who have need to understand it no word employed but what is already in familiar use except in so far as need has place for a word on purpose and that to every such unavoidablyemployed word be attached an exposition composed altogether of words in familiar use and that throughout the signs thus employed be of themselves as characteristic as may be of the things signified now for the general character of the two opposite systems that which is in existence and that which is herein as above humbly proposed as a succedaneum to it behold first the existing system— justice to judge and co a game judge and co the players stake in different proportions the means of happiness possessed by the aggregate of all litigants established a universal chain of tyrannies established by power to every individual to tyrannize over every other whose circumstances are to a certain degree less affluent in every case instrument of tyranny utter ruin utter ruin by the enormity of the expense alike welladapted to the purpose of the oppressor that of the depredator and that of him who is both in one is this same instrument this in hand a man may oppress he may plunder the same person at the same time considered with reference to its real ends could any more accomplished aptitude—considered with reference to its pretended ends—could any more accomplished inaptitude be obtained by a premium directly offered for the production of it so much for the existing system on the other hand such as hath been seen in brief outline is the system of arrangements dictated by a real and exclusive regard for the happiness of the community in so far as it depends upon the application made of the power of judicature we invite the wellintentioned—we challenge the evilintentioned—to elicit and hold up to view all proofs and exemplifications of its inaptitude whatsoever alleged imperfections have been  0  found in it will of course in case of adoption be removed by the constituted authorities but considered as a whole we cannot but flatter ourselves that in quality of a subjectmatter of adoption after such amendments made no arguments will be found opposable to it other than ungrounded assertions vague generalities narrow sentimentalities or customary and already exposed fallacies now for an apology an apology for the freedom with which the vices of the existing system have been subjected to exposure and its utter inaptitude for its professed purpose we trust demonstrated in this inaptitude coupled with the aptitude of the proposed succedaneum will be found the best and we humbly hope a sufficient apology for this boldness how striking soever the contrast it forms with accustomed usage another apology we have to make is that which is so undeniably requisite for the freedom with which in addition to the character of the system that of the class of persons concerned in the administration of it is held up to view for this liberty our plea is that of indispensable necessity for unhappily the state of manners considered—on their part at any rate on the part of the great majority it is not in the nature of man that this or any other system should be received by this class otherwise than with opposition and that opposition hostile and strenuous in proportion to the serviceableness in the thus exposed system and the disserviceableness of the here proposed system to their respective real or supposed particular interests on which occasion what again is but too natural is that beholding with serenity and even delight the torments out of which and in proportion to which their comforts are extracted by it the unction of their panegyrics will continue to be poured forth upon the thus exposed system in proportion to its need of them which is as much as to say in exact proportion to its mischievousness thence it is that the doing what depended upon us towards lowering as far as consistently with justice may be the estimation in which their authority is held by public opinion—became how painful soever an indispensable part of this our arduous enterprise—assured as we could not but be of its finding that so influential authority in its whole force with all its weight on every point pressing down upon it of an imputation which will of course be cast upon the line of argument thus taken by us we are fully aware this is—that the weakening the force and efficiency of the whole power of the law is a natural effect—not to say the object—of these our humble endeavours to this charge we have two answers— one is—that from this cause no such consequence will really follow the other is—that while by this same cause the power of the law will not be diminished the security for its taking its proper direction will be increased first as to the apprehension of the evil consequence produced by a superficial glance natural enough this apprehension must be acknowledged to be by a closer view it will we trust be dispelled that which produces the effect aimed at by the law—what is it is it anything other than the expectation that on contravention the inflictions at the disposal of the functionaries in question will accordingly be applied to the contraveners but of any such infliction when the decree for it has passed will the application depend upon public opinion no surely on no such fluctuating basis does public security rest the persons on whom it depends for its efficiency are in the first instance the judges themselves in the next place in case of need the supreme authority with the whole force of the country in its hands when a judgment has been pronounced is it in the power of this or that individual or individuals in any number whatsoever to prevent the execution of it no assuredly now as to the desirable good consequence this consists in the giving strength to the limitative check applied to the power of the judge by the power of public opinion—sole source from which on the several individual occasions this so necessary and from all other hands unobtainable service can be received yes we repeat it—sole source true it is that in theory and by the practice of times now past impeachment is presented in the character of an appropriate remedy hands by which it is applicable those of the honourable house but in fact only in appearance is it so on no other condition than that of leaving—and that to an indefinite degree—inadequately done or even altogether undone its superior and altogether indispensably legislative duty—could be undertaken by the house this judicial and as such inferior and comparatively unimportant function witness the testimony so amply afforded by experience witness the warren hastings impeachment witness the melville impeachment take away the check applied by the tribunal of public opinion—here then is the power of the judge nominally and theoretically controuled really and practically uncontrouled and of this same uncontrouled power what sort of use has been made and so long as it continues upon its present footing cannot but continue to be made has we humbly trust been sufficiently seen already well then of the power of public opinion in consequence of the information hereby afforded to it what is the application reasonably  0  to be expected the universal power of the whole country—will it employ itself against itself but the lower the trustworthiness of these same functionaries is in the scale of public opinion the less efficient on each occasion will be capable of being made its resistance to this indispensable check—the only one as hath been seen from which any controul can be experienced by it undangerous in perfection gentle in perfection continually improving selfimproving—what other power can be so completely incapable of being abused as this only by the check applied by it can the efficiency of a judges sinister leanings be lessened only by the force of reason can the direction taken by this guardian power be determined as to any such fall as that just mentioned—whatsoever may be the sensation produced by it—in their predecessors and themselves these functionaries may behold the original authors whom they have to thank for it instead of being what it has ever been and continues to be and never can but be—had the use made of their power been the direct reverse of what it has been—no such state of the public mind—no such sensation in the individual mind could have had place while speaking of this same downfal it is not without unfeigned regret that we can contemplate the hurt which by this our humble petition cannot but in a greater or less degree be done to the interests and feelings of individuals and this not only eventually by the establishment of the here proposed system but actually and immediately by the picture here drawn of the causes by which the demand for it has been produced but wellgrounded as these their apologies cannot be denied to be no reason will they afford why the exertion necessary to the putting an end to the abuses apologized for should in any way be slackened the surgeon with whatsoever concern he may behold the sufferings of the patient under the necessary caustic cannot hold himself exempted by the consideration of them from the obligation of putting it to its use nor yet under these regrets for this hardship on individuals is alleviation independently of that afforded by the contemplation of the allcomprehensive benefit to the public altogether wanting classes the interests of which would be affected by the proposed reform these two—the professional and the official as to the professional class not to near so great an amount if to any as at first view might be supposed would be the detriment to their pecuniary interests for long would it be before their situation could be in any way affected by the change suppose the matter already before a committee of your honourable house long would it be before the reforming process would by a bill brought in in consequence so much as take its commencement long beyond calculation notwithstanding the utmost possible exertions employed in giving acceleration to it would be the time occupied in the continuance of that same process long even supposing both houses unanimous in their approbation of the measure considered in a general point of view and how much further could it fail of being lengthened by the exertions which it would be so sure of finding everywhere opposed to it—opposed by the best exercised and strongest hands such is the length of time during which all such professional men as the bill found already in possession of business would be enjoying the fruits of it without diminution or disturbance so much for that class all this while all men who but for the apprehended fall off would have engaged in the profession will have had before their eyes the prospect of it and the notice and warning given by that prospect on the other hand in like manner will these same eyes have had before them the augmentation and it has been seen how ample a one given to the number and value of the aggregate lists of judicial situations correspondent will accordingly be the number of those whose destination will by that prospect be changed from the indiscriminate defence of right and wrong in the capacity of professional lawyers to the pure pursuit of the ends of justice in the situation of judge moreover proportioned to the amount of this secession would be a further indemnification to those already in the possession of business so many men whose course has thus been changed so many competitors removed the class upon which chiefly the loss would fall is the attorney class a certain class of suits there is by which on the present footing business with its emolument is afforded to the attorney none to the advocate class business for example begun altogether without prospect of successful defence and thence carried through actually without defence action for example with or without arrest for indisputable and certainly procurable debt barristers not deriving any profit from the present existence would sustain no loss from the cessation of these actions but as to the length of the interval before commencement as also the exclusion put upon competition—in these advantages the attorney class would possess an equal share as to the official class nothing whatever in a pecuniary shape can any of its members have to apprehend from the change from all such apprehension they stand effectually secured by the application so constantly made of the indemnification principle to the interest of men of their order at any rate whatsoever ground of complaint on this score may in  0  but too many instances have been felt by functionaries belonging to lower orders after all of all regrets from such a source the complexion would be what it would be if the sufferings instead of these were those of medical men from improvements made in the state of general health and longevity improvement such as that made by the substitute of vaccination to inoculation imaginable improvement by discovery made of a neverfailing specific for example against the ague the rheumatism the gout the stone the cholera morbus the yellow fever the plague or by the universal drainage of all pestiferous marshes now as to the effect producible on estimation and thence on feelings altogether unavoidable and indispensably necessary to the establishment of the everlasting good upon the allcomprehensive scale on which it is here endeavoured at—has been the production of the transient evil upon this comparatively minute scale before the running sore kept up at present under and by the existing system could with any the least chance of success be endeavoured to be healed it was necessary it should be probed and the sinister interest in which it has had its cause brought to light and held up to view now in the case of the class of persons unavoidably wounded so far as regards damage to estimation are alleviations and those very efficient ones by any means wanting in the first place comes the consideration that what is important to them so far from being peculiar to them is nothing more than what has place incontestably and confessedly in all other classes of men whatsoever in the minds of the men here in question indeed but no otherwise than in those of all other men with the exception of the heroic few prevalence of selfregard over all other regards and this on every occasion is among the conditions of existence place all regard for the interest of a in the breast—not of a but of b and so reciprocally the species cannot continue in existence for a fortnight true it is that in this or that heroic breast on this or that occasion under the stimulus of some extraordinary excitement social feeling upon the scale of such an allembracing scale may here and there be seen to tower above regard for self but to no man can the not being a hero be matter of very severe reproach when therefore as here interest from the very first—interest real or what comes to the same thing imagined—has been made to clash with duty sacrifice of duty is with exceptions too rare to warrant any influence on practice sure and as such ought to be calculated upon and taken for the ground of arrangement and proceeding in all political arrangements men are the creatures of circumstances placed in the same circumstances which of us all who thus complain can take upon himself to say or stand assured—that in the same circumstances his conduct would have been other and better than that which on such irrefragable grounds he is thus passing condemnation on and complaining of of the existing race whatsoever may be the demerits they have at once for their cause and their apology not only the opposition in which in their instance interest has been placed with reference to duty but the example set them in a line of so many centuries in length by their predecessors and in ancestor worship how this our country has at all times vied with china is no secret to any one the concluding observation how small soever may be the number of the individuals to whom it will be found to have application is—that to the imputation of hostility to the universal interest by perseverance in the preference given to personal interest it depends upon every man to remain subject or liberate himself from it as he feels inclined and the more powerful the temptation the more transcendent will be the glory of having surmounted it and whatsoever may have been the strenuousness and length of his labours in the augmentation of the disease ample may be the compensation and atonement made by his contributions to the cure of it such are the considerations from the aggregate of which our regrets for the manner in which the feelings of the individuals in question cannot but be affected have experienced the diminution above spoken of but were those regrets ever so poignant our endeavours for the removal of the boundless evil of the disorder would not be for will anybody say they ought to be in the smallest degree diminished by the consideration of the partial evil thus attendant on the application of the sole possible remedy assuredly ours will not nor will as we hope and believe the accordant endeavours of the great majority of our fellowsubjects on this occasion a circumstance to which we cannot but intreat the attention of the honourable house is the uniform and almost universal silence in which by professional men in bringing to view or speaking of proposed reforms or meliorations this universal cause of all the wrongs and sufferings produced in the field of law has as if by universal agreement entered into for the purpose been as far as depended upon them kept out of sight of the several elements of appropriate aptitude as applied to this case—intellectual aptitude and active talent are on this occasion assumed to be the only ones in which any deficiency in the appropriate aptitude of the law itself in any part has ever had its source the only ones on which the degree of this same aptitude depends the only ones  0  of a deficiency in which there can ever be any danger as to appropriate moral aptitude—on every such occasion exclusively intent on the interest of the public without so much as a thought about their own interest in any respect and in respect of profit in particular—that all persons in this department sharing in the possession of power and with them all persons engaged in the exercise of the profession are and at all times will be—this is what is tacitly but not the less decidedly assumed assumed and with what reason with exactly the same as if the assumption were applied to all persons engaged in trade now then in this state of things while on every occasion universally thus referred to the wrong cause what can be more impossible than that the disorder should ever receive from the sole true recipe deduced from the knowledge of its true cause its only possible remedy vain however how extensive soever—vain at any rate so far as regards us your petitioners—will henceforward be this so decorous and prudential silence the nature and magnitude of the mischief and the nature of its cause being at length alike known to us as to this silence the decorum attached to it notwithstanding we humbly trust that in the honourable house it will not any longer be maintained for so long as in that sole source of appropriate relief it has continuance so long will all possibility of effectual remedy be excluded and so long as the disorder continues unremoved by no silence anywhere else can our ears be closed or our tongues or our pens be stopt yes as to us your petitioners the film is now off our eyes thus wide open are they to the disorders of which we complain and to the urgency of the demand for the remedy of which at the hands of the physicians of the body politic we thus humbly but not the less earnestly entreat the application to some it may be matter of no small wonder how such sufferings as at all times have been experienced should at all times have had for their accompaniment such almost universal patience but in this case patience has been the natural fruit of ignorance the language in which these torments of the people have in this case had their instrument being about as intelligible to the people at large as is the gibberish spoken by the race of gypsies we beseech the honourable house to ask itself whether of the enormities above brought to view one tenth would not suffice to justify the practical conclusion here drawn from them—whether of a system thus in every part repugnant to the ends of justice and injecting into every breast with such rarelyresistible force the poison of immorality in so many shapes the mischief can be removed otherwise than by the entire abolition of it coupled with the substitution of a system directed to those ends and pure from all such corruptive tendency—whether the inaccessibility of justice be not of the number of those enormities—and whether the house itself will henceforward be anything better than an enemy to the community if with eyes open and hands motionless it suffers that inaccessibility to continue for our parts—respectfully but not the less earnestly we conclude as we began with the continual and till accomplishment neverabouttocease cry—holy holy holy justice accessible justice justice not for the few but for all no longer nominal but at length real justice abridged petition for justice to the honourable the house of commons in parliament assembled   justice justice accessible justice justice not for the few alone but for all no longer nominal but at length real justice—in these few words stand expressed the sum and substance of the humble petition which we the undersigned in behalf of ourselves and all other his majestys longsuffering subjects now at length have become emboldened to address to the honourable house the case we accordingly take the liberty to state followed by a prayer humbly suggesting a plan for the removal of the grievance is this—   that of the expense without which application to judges for the service which as such they are appointed to render cannot be made nor if made continued the effect is such—that in cases called civil altogether and in cases called penal to a vast extent justice is not only sold at a dear price to all the few who have wherewithal to purchase it but utterly denied to all who cannot and that those who are thus oppressed are thus subjected to wrong in all shapes without redress   that the delay is such that in many cases in which under a proper system a few minutes would suffice—and even under the system established does in cases to a narrow extent actually suffice—more than as many years elapse before a man can obtain possession  0  of what at the end of that interval are universally seen to have been and to continue to be his manifest and indubitable rights   that while thus unapt for redress of wrong it is exquisitely well adapted for the commission of wrong for such is the mode in which commencement is given to suits that is to say without security given for compensation for wrong if done by means of the suit that without so much as imagining himself to have any just ground of demand whatsoever—any man who is able and willing to pay a certain price may as we shall show stand assured of effecting the utter ruin of any one of ninetenths or ninetynine hundredths of the whole body of the people   that this state of things has for its cause the undeniable fact—that from first to last the interests of all persons concerned in the administration of justice have been in a state of opposition as direct as possible to their acknowledged duty and the interests of the community   that this oppositeness had for its original cause the penury under which government at that time laboured it not having in its then existing state wherewithal to pay salaries and being thereby laid under the necessity of allowing the functionaries of justice to exact for their own use payment in the shape of fees payable for processes carried on in the course of the suit for processes carried on—that is to say either for instruments written instruments communicated or thereby or otherwise operations performed   that under and by the influence of the sinister interest thus created—has been generated the existing system of judicial procedure a procedure having for its ends—instead of the ends of justice—the swelling to its utmost endurable amount the evil composed of the expense delay and vexation for the sake of the profit extractible out of the expense to the use of the several partners in the said sinister interest to whom taken in the aggregate may accordingly without injurious misrepresentation and with instructive and beneficial application to practice the style and title of judge and co be allotted   that though by a late act in the case of the judges of the supreme westminsterhall courts salaries have been substituted to fees—yet this substitution not being extended to those their subordinates of whose situations they have the patronage the comparative sinister interest in unabated efficiency still continues gift being still allowed and gift being in all cases a source of proportionable benefit to the giver in some cases of even greater pecuniary profit than sale is as in the case of the gift made of the next presentation to an ecclesiastical benefice by the patron to his son and that even were this same supposed remedy effective against further increase of the grievance—which however it is not in its nature to be—still the system of factitious expense delay and vexation offspring of the sinister interest would remain as it does in all its mischievousness   that the boundless weight of human suffering thus imposed is not in any part of it as some suppose natural and unavoidable but in the whole artificial as also in the whole removable as in and by the suggestion contained in the prayer of this our humble petition we will humbly show  0 that amongst others of the devices which in consequence and by means of the norman conquest have been contrived and employed for the compassing of this same sinister object the results are these which follow—devices some of them first employed at and during that same period others at different successive periods grafted on or employed in fertilizing the first devised radical ones   —i device the first—exclusion of the parties from the presence of the judge this at the very outset of the cause down to the last stage that thereby parties in general and the most opulent in particular may be as they accordingly are necessitated to employ in all even the most simple cases as substitutes a class of men whose profit rises in proportion to expense delay and vexation and who exercising their profession under the dominion of the sinister interest which they have in common with that of the judges have the benefit of their support towards the reaping and increase of this same sinister profit a master device this serving as a necessary instrument of the employment given to most of the hereinafter ensuing devices    a collateral mischief is—that by this exclusion the door is shut against evidence from that which is commonly the most instructive source and thereby decision necessarily given in favour of the side in the wrong in every case in which no other than the thus excluded evidence is obtainable this in some cases while in other cases by a glaring inconsistency the thus excluded evidence is admitted    in particular in the judicatories called equity courts in which the plaintiff is admitted in and by his bill to extract evidence through the medium of the pen from the bosom of the defendant in which state of things the defendant—unless his professional assistants are deficient in appropriate aptitude—moral intellectual or active—slides in in and by his answer whatsoever averments present in  0  his and their joint opinion a probability of operating in favour of his side    not but that for two distinct purposes—in so far as may be without preponderant evil in the shape of delay vexation and expense is necessary to justice the thus excluded attendance—  for bringing to view all facts which are of a nature to operate in favour of any party on either side   to serve as a check upon the sinister interest whereby their respective professional assistants are prompted as above to swell to its maximum that same evil for the sake of the profit extractible out of the expense    note also that so far as it can be effected without preponderant evil as above not less needful is this attendance on the part of principals or say intended benefitees for example wives children and their offspring wards and members of associated companies for the protection of their interests against misconduct on the part of their respective trustees that is to say husbands fathers and other progenitors guardians and agents of various denominations with or without collusion with their several professional assistants in the suit   —ii device the second—language unintelligibilized instead of the mothertongue of the parties the language originally employed in wordofmouth discussion being the language of the conquerors that is to say norman french and the language employed in written instruments the latin    thence was created the necessity of employing these so little trustworthy trustees not only as assistants and advocates but even as interpreters between the englishspeaking parties and the frenchspeaking judges    out of these two foreign languages in conjunction with the mothertongue has been made up the jargon by which to so great a degree the same continuance has been given to the same design—the translation at length made by order of parliament notwithstanding whereby to so great an extent false and delusive lights have been substituted to total darkness   —iii device the third—written pleadings worse than useless necessitated by this means justice was denied to all who could not afford the expense of hiring the manufacturers of this sort of ware—sold to all who could and would be at the expense and even now such continues to be the case and being paid in proportion to the quantity thus it is that by this sinister interest they stand engaged to give every practicable increase to it  0 now then as to the supposed necessariness and usefulness of these same instruments really necessary are and in every case on the plaintiffs side—statements—  of the demand made by him   of the ground of it in point of law   of the ground of it in point of fact   of the evidence by which it is supported   of the persons on whom the demand is made these are—  in the first instance as above—the defendant   on failure of compliance on his part by performance of service demanded at his hands—the judge the service demanded at his hands then the correspondent service rendered by bringing about that which was demanded at the charge of the defendant or what is regarded as an equivalent to it in like manner in case of noncompliance on the part of the defendant correspondent statements in justification of such noncompliance    of all this matter what is there in these same written pleadings answer—really and distinctly expressed nothing nothing but a confused and redundant yet imperfect hodgepodge composed of more or less of it    moreover for procuring custom at the hands of individuals who know they are in the wrong—as well as for giving increase to the quantity of jargon which parties are constrained to buy—a distinction has been made between pleadings and evidence and this in such sort that while on the one hand of statements to which the name of evidence is given punishment under the name of punishment is in case of wilful falsehood made the consequence—on the other hand to those to which the name of pleadings is given no such consequence is attached and thus it is that to all such leftpurposelyunpunished falsehood allowance or say licence is given at the same time to these same masses of falsehood which are not so much as pretended to be entitled to the name of evidence is given a surer effect than to any the best and most satisfactory evidence since when the party on either side has come out with one of these pleadings the party on the other side if he fails to encounter it with a correspondent mass is visited with the loss of his cause and thereby with a suffering which may be any number of times as great as that produced by punishment under the name of punishment would be and thus it is that the licence so given to mendacity operates as encouragement to and reward for the commission of it now then this same failure when it takes place—what has it for its efficient cause his being in the wrong and at the same time conscious of being so answer judge and co if both these fail his inaction is circumstantial evidence and to this we give the effect of conclusive evidence   0    such is the conclusion now as to the justness of it not to speak of others—one circumstance which the failure is not less likely to have had for the efficient cause is—want of wherewithal to pay for this same thus necessitated mass of surplusage and the greater the quantity of it the more probable this fulfilment of the dishonest suitors wishes and thus it is that by continuance given to the length of the mass any man may make sure of consigning to utter ruin any other man whose circumstances are to a certain degree less affluent and under the name of justice the faculty of oppression is sold to the best bidder    addressed to the supporters of the existing system follow a few plain questions— if in relation to any point it were on any occasion your wish to learn the truth of a case of any sort from a child of yours or from a servant of yours—   would you refuse to see him   would you send him to or keep him at a distance from you   would you insist on his not answering otherwise than in writing   would you on the occasion of such his writing insist on his coming out with a multitude of lies some stale and notorious others new and out of his own head   would you so much as consent to his mixing up false information in whatever quantity he chose—and that in an undistinguishable manner—with whatsoever true information it was that you had need of   would you establish an interval of four or five months forced silence between statement and statement question and answer or one answer and another   would you take any such course if you were acting as chairman of a house of commons committee making inquiry into the state of things in relation to any subject for the information of the legislature   would you if acting in the character of a justice of peace whether singly or as chairman at a meeting of a number of justices of the peace sitting in special sessions and making inquiry into the matter of a question of any sort civil or penal coming within your competence    well then this however is all of it the exact description of what has place as often as the process of delivering written pleadings is carried on carried on as it is under the eye and by order of all the judges and this as well in the equity courts as in the commonlaw courts this is what in the commonlaw courts to go no higher has place from beginning to end has place until the suit reaches the jurybox—not to go along with it any further    now then on the part of those by whom this was the course in which judicial inquiry was ordained to be carried on can you now that that course is thus laid open to you—can you for a moment suppose that justice was ever the end in view can any man of common sense suppose it can any man of common honesty declare himself to suppose it can it really be believed by any man that dispatch is promoted by an inexorably standing still for four or five months    iv device the fourth—mendacity licensed rewarded compelled and by judge himself practised of the manner in which by and for the benefit and profit of judge and co falsehood has begun and continues to be licensed rewarded and on some occasions compelled it has been necessary to give some intimation under the head of written pleadings falsehood wilful or not as it may happen on the part of the utterers wilful at any rate on the part of the judges—the suborners follow under the present head instances of compulsion more manifest and avowed as also of the practice of it by themselves    first as to compulsion in the proceedings of the courts styled courts of equity in contradistinction to courts of common law it is—that features of compulsion are in a more particular degree prominent after the process which has the effect of a summons—the instrument with which the suit begins is a paper called a bill commencing with a case or say a story and continuing with a quantity of interrogative matter by which answers are called for answers to a string of questions grounded on the several statements or say averments or allegations contained in the case to these averments is given on this occasion the name of charges    now then of this same case—what is the composition falsehoods in a more or less considerable proportion it cannot but have and in the larger proportion it commonly has penalty on noninsertion of them refusal to impose on the defendant the obligation of giving answers to the question in which case they will not be of any service to the plaintiffs purpose they will not be contributory to his obtainment of his right the evidence sought for by them at the hands of the defendant remains unelicited  0 seat and source of the falsehood this into the composition of the case or story enter commonly two distinguishable parcels of alleged facts all supposed to be relevant to the matter in question and necessary or at any rate conducive to the purpose of constituting an adequate ground for the demand made at the charge of the defendant by this same instrument of demand object of it a service in some shape or other at the hands and at the charge of the defendant and     eventually in default of compliance on the part of the defendant the correspondent service at the hands of the judge namely the production of such compliance or some other service regarded as an equivalent for it    contents of one parcel of these same facts such of them as without any information from the defendant are so the plaintiff conceives known to him the plaintiff as also to some other person or persons regarded by him as having had perception of them and being able and about to be willing to declare them or at any rate as being in some way or other in his power to make proof of this in whatever degree of particularity is necessary to constitute the requisite ground—call these the already known facts as to this parcel all that is wanted at the hands of the defendant is admission seeing that by this the need of application to any other person for the purpose of information will of course be superseded    contents of the other parcel such supposed facts as in contradistinction to the foregoing may be styled unknown or soughtfor facts sought to wit at the hands of the defendant the case being that for making proof of them information such as it is in his power to afford and perhaps in his alone is regarded as requisite in relation to these facts all that in the plaintiffs mind in a form more or less particular and determinate has place being a conjecture or say suspicion of their existence    now then as to these same soughtfor facts—for what reason is it that by the plaintiff they are thus sought for answer—for this very reason because they are not known to him yet in relation to the facts thus unknown to him is he obliged to make declaration that they are known to him which declaration is constantly the offspring of the inventive genius of his professional advisers and assistants without such false declaration from them—writing in the plaintiffs name—no information at all will the learned judge suffer to be attempted to be elicited from a defendant purport of the rule expressive of the obligation this—every interrogatory must have a charge for the support of it    plaintiff for example creditor of a person deceased defendant his executor to some amount or other property in some shape or other is left by the deceased but to what amount and in what shape this is what the plaintiff is altogether ignorant of for information in relation to it—information in such shape as shall constitute an adequate ground for the demand made of the debt—this is what is thus sought for by plaintiff at the charge and at the hands of the defendant well then to a question asking whether property of the deceased to the amount requisite is in existence and if yes what it consists of and so forth will a judge compel any answer to be made not he indeed otherwise than upon condition and this condition—what is it answer—that in the bill a multitude of declarations or say averments assertions or statements shall be inserted—statements giving an account more or less particular of the several abovementioned unknown facts facts by the supposition unknown to the very individual who is thus compelled to assert that he knows them on which occasion the learned draughtsman finds himself under the not altogether unpleasant or unprofitable obligation of bringing to the view of his lordship who will never see it a statement of every sort of thing which it is regarded as possible should in the aggregate mass of the property in question have been contained and the richer the quantity of this poetry in prose the richer the reward to the industry of the firm of judge  co in all its branches    note bythebye in the case where no information is wanted at the hands of the defendant the consequence of resorting to him in this mode for admission instead of to a nonparty—say an extraneous witness—for information and thereby for proof consequence naturally expected that is to say by a man who has never looked into equity procedure delay and expense saved for to the defendant application says he must be made at any rate for payment of the debt this continues he being necessary when you are about it add to the demand of the money due a demand of the information necessary to the proof of its being due—the information being thus obtained and from the defendant himself saved thereby is the delay and expense of the endeavour to obtain it from sources in number and distance altogether indefinite such as to delay and expense is the economy in appearance how stands it in reality answer—in natural procedure it would have place but in equity procedure what the plaintiff gets by it if the defendant being rich enough so pleases is—in regard to delay substitution of years to minutes and in regard to expense hundreds or thousands of pounds to shillings is this handwriting yours yes or no for the answer to a question to this effect spoken by a justice of the peace less than even a second of time would serve and by an answer in the affirmative would be decided many a suit which under equity procedure while questions and answers are written occupies years    so much for licence remuneration and compulsion of mendacity now for the practice of it practisers as well as compellers of mendacity—never for a moment let it be out of mind—the judges themselves fiction is the appellative by which the sort     of falsehood thus by judges coined in their own mint has at all times been distinguished nor was the choice thus made of the appellative a blind one established they found it in a situation of favour in the public mind—established by means of the application made of it to the purpose of designating poetry and romance and thus it was that into a portion of the favour associating with those always agreeable and sometimes useful productions of the imaginative faculty they thus contrived to let in these constantly not only useless but enormously mischievous ones so much for the nature of this species of poetry    now for some accompaniments belonging to it in every case of the utterance given to these falsehoods evil consciousness—styled in their language mala fides—has on their part been an accompaniment fradulent obtainment the object subjectmatter of the obtainment money to wit either immediately that is to say in the shape of fees or mediately through the medium of power parent of fees persons thus wronged—in so far as the subjectmatter was composed of money—the people in the capacity of suitors in so far as it was composed of power the fellows and competitors of these same judges as also in various indirect ways the people again one way—the being in the course of the scramble between judge and judge consigned to imprisonment and through imprisonment frequently to utter ruin as under the head of groundless arrests for debt will be found distinctly visible so much for the morality of the practice    now as to the effects of it beneficial effects none mischievous effects these— i mischief the first and most prominent depredation and oppression as above on each individual occasion at the charge of assignable individuals in the capacity of suitors   —ii mischief the second arbitrary power acquired and exercised allow a man to assume the existence of a matter of fact—of an event or state of things by which supposing it really to have had existence the assumption and exercise of power would have a justificative cause—allow him this what is the power which you do not thus allow him to assume of this indirect mode of assumption in preference to the direct what is the consequence—any diminution of the evil no but on the contrary an addition to it namely the evils produced as will be seen by the nature of the instrument thus employed  0—iii mischief the third birth given to a particular instrument of arbitrary power an instrument to which exposition and exposure have been given elsewhere under and by the name of the double fountain mechanism thus alluded to a vessel invented by jugglers contained in it wine of two sorts and colours out of it come the one or the other at the word of command whenever any one of these fictions has been established thus is it with truth and falsehood on the individual occasion in question to this or that sinister purpose of the judge which of the two is it that is most suitable is it the falsehood out comes as usual the established falsehood and on this it is that the proceedings are grounded is it the truth back goes he to the original truth and on this are the proceedings grounded now consequence to jugglers reputation what at the hands of the people anything in the way of censure oh no they look on and stare instead of censure comes in either case praise on this occasion as on every other praise at the hands of judge and co and their dupes—praise without stint for everything be it what it may which by these same hands is done whichever be the ground taken by the decision praise appropriate in shape and quantity stands prepared for the reception of it is it the falsehood topic of eulogy strictness of the regard manifested for established rules for the precept expressed by the words stare decisis is it the truth topic—liberality and paramount love of truth and substantial justice who shall blame the holy love of substantial justice of the double fountain one form this under the head of decision on grounds foreign to the merits will be visible another    thus it is that on each occasion according as it happens to him to feel disposed disposed by whatsoever motives—whether by corrupt profit to himself by sympathy or antipathy towards individuals or parties—the judge has it in his power to determine the suit in favour of the one side or the other and this without any the smallest danger either of punishment at the hands of government or so much as censure at the hands of public opinion   —iv mischief the fourth in the minds of well intentioned judges generated by the incongruous mixture confusion thence relative intellectual inaptitude—one efficient cause of misdecision on the part of the judge delay in the proceedings with expense and vexation at the charge of suitors   —v mischief the fifth of that part of the rule of action which continues in the aerial shape of common in contradistinction to statute law—the texture vitiated and the allpersuading and incurable inaptitude increased and this as well in the substantive as in the adjective branch of the law it being through the machinery of the adjective branch or say the system of procedure that the cobwebs of which the substantive branch or main body of the law in so far as manufactured by judicial hands is composed and thus it is that in the minds of the manufacturers the     confusion and intellectual inaptitude and in the work the consequential inaptitude extends itself over the whole fabric which by this means is manufactured into an opaque mass into which the most learned among lawyers have no better than an indistinct insight and we the people at large next to none at any rate none such as enables us of ourselves to guide our course by it witness in particular the law of real property   —vi mischief the sixth by the example set by a class of persons who by all these devices hereinbefore mentioned and hereinafter mentioned have hitherto succeeded in rendering themselves objects of almost universal respect and confidence and by means of those sentiments in addition to their uncontroulable power masters of our conduct the public mind has been and continues to be to a deplorable degree impregnated with the poison of mendacity in this so highly corruptive shape and thus it is that demoralization and disintellectualization go hand in hand   —v device the fifth—oaths for the establishment of the mendacity necessitated as intimated on the occasion of the written pleadings device mode in which the ceremony of an oath has there been employed as an instrument of mendacity and as will be seen maleficence in so many other shapes the following—to assertions on the occasion of which the ceremony is employed the distinctive appellation of evidence is applied and to wilful falsehood contained in such assertion punishment is attached while to falsehood the assertion of which is not accompanied with the performance of this same ceremony no punishment is attached in mendacity has been seen an instrument by which such enormous increase is given to the evil produced to suitors thence to the good produced to judge and co by written pleadings in the ceremony of an oath may now be seen an instrument by the use of which the production of the mendacity is effected    purposes for which this ceremony is employed two—  securing veracity at the hands of witnesses   securing fulfilment of duty at the hands of functionaries more particularly on the part of jurymen   mischievous in both instances we trust it will on examination be seen to be thus efficient to evil purposes   inefficient and   needless to all good purposes in both cases   —i first as to its application to testimony and on that occasion as to its mischievousness   abundantly sufficient to warrant and necessitate abolition would surely be its abovementioned property of producing mendacity were it the only one   —  but to this is added another of most appalling magnitude yes the giving impunity to crime in every shape the most obvious not excepted in the hands of every man—the most worthless and mischievous not excepted—does it place the power of producing this effect thus sharing with the sovereign the prerogative of pardon called into the witnessbox conscience he declares will not suffer him to bear a part in the ceremony not unfrequently have instances of such refusal made their appearance none in which punishment in any shape has been attached it the insincerity howsoever real not being manifest nor proveable punishment for the refusal would be persecution and that persecution happily too odious to be endurable    without the ceremony for this long time in civil cases now of late in criminal cases admission has been given to the testimony of quakers and moravians i am a quaker or i am a moravian suppose is in purport the averment made by the person thus called upon—this said who shall gainsay it  0 suppose even punishment applied how would the matter be mended applied it could not be till after the impunity had been effected    moreover even were the infliction sure it might be made worth a mans while to undergo it    so in any case called a civil case may he in like manner give or sell success to either side    murderous robbers might thus go on in impunity for any length of time in the commission of the crime in the number regarded as requisite they join in it a reward a high amount with pardon as usual being offered to any one of them for information some of them—one or more proffering testimony against the rest trial coming on they declare themselves atheists whereupon they refuse to bear a part in the ceremony true it is that in this case conviction not taking place pardon is not earned nor need it for no testimony being delivered acquittal follows of course acquittal on the part of the prisoners for no evidence is there against them on the part of the informer for no evidence is there against him but says somebody by simple and direct refusal to swear unaccompanied with any such declaration of opinion will not the same effect be produced and is it not produced accordingly natural enough this question but to find an answer to it belongs not to the present purpose    yes atheists of quakerism or moravianism declaration can no longer serve but atheism remains as good as ever power of pardon a share in the kings prerogative remains the reward for it       —ii secondly as to its inefficiency still as applied to testimony—to a mode of punishment which might in an almost unexampled degree be efficacious it substitutes a mode in an extraordinary degree inefficacious of contempt of court when in any other shape committed in court commitment to prison being an instantaneous consequence the same consequence might be attached to such contempt in this shape under the name of evidence testimony when orally delivered not being received without an immediately previous oathtaking thus it is that mendacity whenever it is thus committed is committed in the shape of perjury and in this shape this mode of proceeding against it has been—if not employed at any rate threatened in which case no individual is there on whom the expense and vexation attached to the character of prosecutor would be imposed accordingly what in relation to this matter we shall have humbly to propose is—that in every case in which it is seen that the whole of the stock of evidence which the suit affords is brought out at the time of the perjury punishment for it may instantaneously follow    so much as to efficiency when the ceremony is not employed how stands it now that the oath is so almost universally employed punishment none without the concurrent testimony of two witnesses nor then but at the expense of a separate prosecution commenced at a distant point of time and with such disadvantageous prospects as to success proportion of the number of cases in which prosecution has place to the number in which delinquency has place—at what shall it be set say for example at a venture—out of ten thousand scarcely so much as one so much as to inefficiency    thirdly as to needlessness for a complete and conclusive demonstration of this property of the ceremony we humbly beg leave to call on the testimony of the honourable house compared with the importance of the legislative what is that of the judicial function when for the formation of a ground for a legislational proceeding evidence is called in in what instance is employment ever given to this ceremony by the honourable house    thus efficient to bad purposes inefficient and needless to any good purpose whatsoever in particular—in particular to that of giving execution and effect to the law—far indeed is it from being so to the sinister interest of judge and co    already mentioned has been its needfulness with relation to the profit by written pleadings  0 add to this the encouragement and invitation given to dishonest plaintiffs and defendants by the chance which it produces of failure on the part of honest ones and thence the addition of dishonest to the aggregate of honest demands and defences the profit to subordinate judicial functionaries by the fees partly in the direct way partly in various indirect ways necessitated and to judges their superordinates correspondent profit in the shape of patronage—all by the clumsy and complicated machinery which to so large an extent is on this occasion employed    see the country over for example attorneys converted into masters extraordinary in chancery and for no other purpose    note now the consequence as to delay and nondecision and misdecision or in one word failure of justice no machinery at hand no oath capable of being administered and the testimony how important soever the purpose lost and the purpose frustrated frustrated—always for a time not unfrequently for evermore    so much for its effect when employed on a judicial occasion as well as for a judicial purpose now as to its effect when employed on an occasion not judicial there not being any actual suit in the case only for an eventual judicial purpose to wit in case of prosecution for perjury in respect of it under this head in proof of its inefficiency the bare mention of the words customhouse oaths might of itself be amply sufficient other instances in which the quality of it is demonstrated and the number ascertained might be adduced but the range of them being less extensive respect for religion and its teachers commands our silence—one observation alone excepted namely that to oaths whether assertory or promissory the sanction is the same    so much for testimonial oaths now as to official various are the occasions on which correspondently various the purposes for which under the existing system the obligation of giving employment to this ceremony has place principal occasion that of entrance upon office declaration with relation to opinions—promise with relation to conduct on neither of these occasions is punishment as for perjury or punishment in any other shape attached to what is regarded as a violation of the oath in all these cases whatsoever good consequence is looked for from the solemn promise with the oath attached to it would we humbly contend he equally obtained by a promise declared with like solemnity unincumbered by the oath    in all these cases intended or supposed effect of it is—its operating as an instrument of security real effect operating as an instrument of deception and consequent insecurity reliance being placed on this inefficient security others that would be efficient     and applicable remain unlooked out for and unapplied    take for example the feefed judge whatsoever line of conduct—conformable to justice or adverse—that it happens to be agreeable to him to take—pronounced with appropriate emphasis out come the words—my oath his oath—does he say what oath—who ever saw him utter any form of words under that name and if uttered what would it be found to amount to just nothing some vague generality vying with cobwebs in effectively binding force    enter now upon the stage jurymens oaths—and with them the everywhere abundant and perennial crop of jurymens perjuries to the exercise of this important function the indispensable obligation of bearing the supposed effective and so much relied on part in this ceremony stands attached at the same time for the production of declared unanimity—truly or falsely declared as it may happen continuance in one and the same apartment without respite or refreshment except by permission of the judge though death by inanition with the antecedent course of torture be the consequence torture to such a length at no time ever endured or endurable    here then as to the consequence in the shape of perjury declaration of opinion it is opinion itself it is not in the power of torture to produce here then as often as diversity of opinion has place here are two antagonizing forces applied to one and the same man at one and the same time here is the oath to make him speak true here is the torture to make him speak false the torture—this altogether irresistible instrument employed in the manufacture of perjury    first as to the prevention of mendacity to this altogether needless on inspection will be seen to be this ceremony with the perjury thus essentially sticking to it thrown away the price—and it has been seen how dear a one—paid for the use of it look in the first place to natural religion if mendacity independently of this or any other ceremony does not stand prohibited—prohibited which is as much as to say visited with punishment what else is there that does what then is the additional security that it affords no other can it be than that which would be afforded by some extra punishment apprehended in the future life at the hands of the almighty as about to be undergone on the score of the thus supposed aggravation over and above that which would be apprehended if the ceremony were not employed  0 now then for this supposed additional security what is the price paid an assumption is made and acted upon and what is it that to the purpose in question the power of the almighty is at the disposal of any and every man who for any purpose chooses to employ it of any man howsoever bad for any purpose howsoever bad the creator an instrument in the hand of every one of these his creatures—an instrument on the part of which compliance is more assured than it can be on the part of a slave—the almighty more surely obsequious to the will of the most wicked man upon earth than a sheriff is to that of the judge    look lastly to revealed religion on this score we humbly beg that now at length by the constituted authorities and in the first instance by the honourable house it may be taken into consideration whether in addition to these considerations or even without the aid of them the words swear not at all in more passages than one attributed to the holy author of our religion might not suffice to put an end to swearing in compliance with compulsion imposed by those same authorities    as to mendacity the production of this so abundantly thus produced commodity—is this then the object neither to this purpose is it at all needful legislators if simple mendacity will content you—mendacity without perjury for a zest to it—abolish the ceremony there remains the torture which is quite sufficient to produce the thus desired effect    note here the effect of the torture in the production of mendacity belongs not precisely to the present head it is however too influential on justice and the efficiency of the main body of the law to be suffered to pass without notice it is—the placing the decision and thereby in so far the lot of the parties—the placing both under the command of the strongest will in other words of the most longsuffering and persevering stomach    of this ceremony such as it is is what is called a violation a sin so many times as being employed it is violated so many are the sins created not to say committed abolish the ceremony the manufacture of these sins is at an end and sins in number altogether infinite saved from being committed such the security supposed to be thus given against mendacity true it is that times were when—not merely on a certain occasion for a certain purpose—not merely in conjunction with other securities for veracity—but singly and to the exclusion of all such other securities—this ceremony having been instituted was frequently performed    witness the so stated wager of law occasion demand of money on the score of debt purpose the obtaining a discharge from the demands witness the defendant himself testimony assertion in general terms     denying that the money forming the subjectmatter of the demand is due with this witness came a chorus consisting of twelve others styled compurgators subjectmatter of their testimony their belief that what their principal and leader of the band—the defendant—had been saying was true but these times what were they times of primeval and grossest ignorance superstition and barbarism    in conclusion as to the whole of this momentous subject and our respect for the time of the house not permitting us to do anything like complete justice to the importance of it we humbly beg leave to give intimation to the honourable house that the form of a petition in which fuller consideration is given to it is in print and universally accessible    that in no case this part of the institution is productive of good effects is more than we take upon us to affirm on it depends for its existence the latent but not the less efficient virtual veto possessed by the jury and thus by the strongest stomach among them over the laws if on any point of law to which jurytrial applies the statute law and common law together is in a state of opposition to the welfare of the community—in this respect beneficial in so far is the effect of jury trial in its present shape and on this part of the institution we beg it may be considered whether that liberty does not depend—the liberty of the press to wit—on which everything else which in a peculiar manner is good in the form of government depends but to this and the other cases in which the constituted authorities have a particular interest more or less adverse to the general interest such as treason sedition and the like this feature may be preserved without its extending to any other cases    in any case to produce whatsoever good effect is expected from the ceremony the substitution of the word affirmation or to give indication of deliberateness asseveration to the words swear oath and maketh oath might we submit most fully and effectually suffice    to conclude neither to the prevention of mendacity nor if such should be the pleasure of the king in parliament to the preservation and augmentation of mendacity or as it is more familiarly called lying is the preservation of this cumbrous and dissensionsowing ceremony necessary this we have already taken the liberty to observe and show and we humbly trust that to the preservation of that veto which as above so long as the government of this country continues in its present form is so indispensable—this same ceremony will not be found to be in any way more necessary  0—vi device the sixth—delay in groundless and boundless lengths established delay is so long as it lasts denial and we invite and challenge any person to say why though it be but for an hour denial of justice should have place    in the process of judicature—of the various sources or say causes of delay—all of them factitious—the work of judge and co—samples will it please the honourable house to behold them the eight here following— i source the first vacations—the year split into terms—four in the year—with intervals between them styled vacations during which last so far as could be contrived denial of justice remains established terms four vacations as many in the whole year of     days aggregate number of days allotted to administration of justice    to denial of justice     add sundays in term time    total     to justice not so much as a fourth part of the time allotted to injustice   —ii source the second circuits—for country causes no trial but on circuits circuits in the year at the most no more than three till the other day but two in some counties now two till the other day no more than one in these cases what is the crime for which denial of justice—in a word outlawry for this it is so long as it lasts is thus made the penalty is it the crime of living at so great a distance from the metropolis if not on the account of crime on what other account is the condition of one part of his majestys subjects of all ranks rendered in so essential a respect to such a degree inferior to that of all besides   —iii source the third fixed days—between one proceeding and another intervals established by fixed days of which further on under the head of blind fixation days the same length of interval the same for every individual suit say for example of a fortnight whereas necessary will be in some cases no interval in others a day in others again a year or years none where upon plaintiffs own showing his demand is ungrounded a day or less for notice when the residence of both parties is in the near neighbourhood years one or more when at the moment defendants residence is for example at australia in this latter case if as in the established mode inaction on the part of a defendant is by the judge acted upon as if it were conclusive evidence of the justice of the demand and judgment and execution take place accordingly—here delay gives place to what is still worse namely precipitation of which presently with misdecision and misconduct for its certain consequences       —iv source the fourth written pleadings—of these above if a mass of written allegations being exhibited loss of cause is as under the existing system established as a penalty for the nonexhibition of correspondent counterallegations—allowance of time for framing them is necessitated and on each individual occasion time adequate to the need delay in indefinite quantity is thus made necessary to justice   —v source the fifth mischievous removals—needless transference and bandying of suits transference of a suit from the judicatory in which it has been commenced to a different one in which it is to receive termination or continuance as to which under the head of device the tenth mischievous transference c   —vi source the sixth equity procedure—the mode which has place in the judicatories called courts of equity a mode altogether different from that which has place in the judicatories called the commonlaw courts and in the shape of delay as also of expense in a prodigious degree still more productive of torment   —vii source the seventh court christian alias spiritual court alias ecclesiastical court procedure—of this mode differing again from both the others—and in lengthiness of delay and expense vying with that of the equity courts—mention is made only to show that it has not been overlooked for though in delay as well as expense it view with the most dilatory of the two—yet the number of suits carried on in it is to such a degree comparatively small that the use derivable from the picture of the additional torment produced by it would not on the present occasion pay for the space of time and labour it would necessitate   —viii source the eighth procedure in appeals that is to say demands made to a superordinate judicatory for reversal or other change in the judgments otherwise styled decrees—ultimate or intermediate styled interlocutory—pronounced in the judicatories—original or say immediate—in which the suits respectively took commencement or received continuance    to procedure in equity courts and on appeals development is to the present purpose necessary and here follows first as to equity procedure endless would be the task of giving anything like a correct and complete sketch of the system of delay of which the judicatories styled as if in mockery courts of equity present the scene a few slight touches are the following—  0—i in regard to elicitation of evidence modes in one and the same suit three namely the epistolary or say written mode and two varieties of the oral or say wordofmouth mode    epistolary mode employed at commencement questions styled interrogatories put by plaintiffs to defendants name of the instrument of which they form a part the bill    between each such string of interrogatories and the correspondent string of answers name of the aggregate the answer an interval of months in one amply extensive parcel of the whole number of these suits the end in view as prescribed by interest is on the plaintiffs side the maximization—not of dispatch but of delay that interest being accompanied with the faculty of multiplying those intervals of delay by an unlimited number sufficient of itself is this state of things to spin out into years a suit to which by an interview between the parties in the presence of the judge as in the case of procedure before a justice of the peace termination might be given in the same number of minutes debt for example on a note of hand whether for forty shillings or forty thousand pounds    to elicit per contra for the benefit of the defendant whose selfdisserving evidence has thus been elicited the like evidence from one who is plaintiff in this same suit another such suit commenced by a bill styled a cross bill is made necessary thus lest the abovementioned delay should not be sufficient—what in a commonlaw court would be but one suit is split into two    note that as yet not a particle has been elicited of that which comes from the only source from which a commonlaw court will suffer any evidence to be elicited—namely the testimonial or other evidence capable of being furnished by extraneous witnesses extraneous on the present occasion so called of necessity to distinguish them from parties where as above information is received from them or called for at their hands say accordingly party witnesses or testifying parties and before the elicitation of any such evidence is so much as commenced money to the amount of hundreds or even thousands of pounds may at the pleasure of the plaintiff if rich enough be extorted from the defendant if he has it and thus is his utter ruin produced   —ii oral mode employed subsequently in the elicitation of the evidence of extraneous witnesses and sometimes in the elicitation of ulterior evidence from the defendant scene the examiners office mode of examinations secret   —iii oral mode employed in addition to the above in the elicitation of evidence relative to matters of detail scene the office of the subordinate judge styled a master in chancery for attendance at this office not more than an hour at a time ever allowed in the same suit and by any one of these actors of all of whom it is made the interest to maximize the delay the hour may be cut down to     a time too short for the doing any part of the business nor does any such meeting take place till after three appointments with an interval of several days between the second and the third for these actors if so they may be called for every one of them fees extorted by the power of the superordinate judge the chancellor as if they had all attended the master establishing this mode of obtaining money under false pretences and sharing largely in the profits of it of late years the salaries of these functionaries have received large increase and this and all their other modes of depredation left undiminished had the enactment made by parliament it is that of the    geo ii ch  §   been applied to them as it would have been had they not been in a public trust not one of the judges by whom for several generations these situations have been occupied—not one of them who would not over and over again have been either whipt pilloried or transported for only by power and consequent impunity and complicity with judges of a still higher order not by innocence are they distinguished from those delinquents who under the name of swindlers are every day so dealt with   —iv by these judges vacations made for themselves some of not less than seven months out of the twelve witness declarations made by men of the first eminence in the profession made in print years ago and confirmed by the confession implied in uninterrupted silence    all this forms as yet no more than a part of the length of delay established in equity procedure in the greater number of the individual suits carried before the superior commonlaw courts—after the commonlaw suit has been made to run its length still farther length may be added to it added by any defendant who being rich enough has an interest in so doing namely by a suit styled as above an injunction    in the year      april    year  th of the present reign issued a commission purpose of it so therein declared introduction of improvements and changes subjectmatter declaredly confined to equity courts and their proceedings five years within a trifle have elapsed and in all this time no improvement made in consequence no change made but such as in comparison with the abuse was in extent conspicuously trifling and in quality has proved to be worse than none  00 in addition to this another commission instituted in the year      composed of a different set of commissioners subjectmatter expressly confined to the superior commonlaw courts and their proceedings as if in the practice of two sets of courts with their branches of jurisdiction to such a degree entangled throughout the whole field—it were possible to make any substantial improvements—improvements in either—without change and for that purpose allcomprehensive scrutiny applied to the other  0  we humbly entreat the honourable house to consider whether it be in the nature of man that a separation of this sort thus deliberately made by or by the advice of persons perfectly conversant with the whole of the business could have had any better object than the giving perpetuity to a system of depredation and oppression thus portentous we shudder at the bare idea of the honourable house rendering itself an accomplice of such enormities by remaining silent and inactive after receipt of this our humble petition and forbearing to apply either the remedial system which we shall take the liberty to suggest or some other not less effectual if any other such there be  0  now for the remaining source of delay—appeals and writs of error omitting particular cases in endless variety when on the ground of alleged misdecision a suit is transferred from a relatively inferior to a relatively superior court—if it be in equity procedure appeal is the name—the name given to the operation or the instrument by which the transference is effected if it be in commonlaw procedure writ of error is the name appeal is the term thus put foremost as presenting to an unlawlearned mind a clear idea writ of error a confused one  0  note that only for alleged misdecision that is to say either at the conclusion or during the continuance of the suit are either appeals so called or writs of error received but not more effectually done is injustice by misdecision than by nondecision by nondecision whether after a suit instituted or for want of a suit instituted  0  causes of such want any one of these which follow—on the minds of persons wronged— i opinion of the relative inaptitude of the system ii opinion of the relative inaptitude of the judges one or more employed in the application of it iii fear of being at any time after commencement and before conclusion sunk into the gulf of ruin by the weight of the purse on the other side iv or in other situations relative indigence such as to produce an utter incapacity of giving so much as commencement to the suit  0  in some instances in the case of a writ of error the appeal goes immediately from the fourseated court in westminster hall to the house of lords in other instances     another and more numerouslyseated westminsterhall judicatory of appeal is interposed under the name of the exchequer chamber  0  by an appeal in which and whatsoever way denominated—an additional mountain of delay is set down upon the mountains above sketched out but of appeal in both cases there are stages upon stages mountains upon mountains set down one upon another  0  for an example of the stages or say stories in this pile—behold in blackstone the following sorts of cases to which they apply those called civil— i from various inferior courts to the common pleas iii  0 ii from the common pleas to the kings bench iii  0    iii from the kings bench to one of the three courts all confounded under the name of the exchequer chamber composed of so many different lists of judges iii    iv from the exchequer chamber to the house of lords iii     0  note well the organization of this chaos from the four judges of the common pleas appeal to the four judges of the kings bench from these back again to those same four judges of the common pleas who are thus expected every one of them to pronounce condemnation on his own act with the addition however of the four judges styled barons of the exchequer which same court of the exchequer is inferior in rank says blackstone iii    not only to the court of kings bench but to the common pleas also thus to apply conviction to an alleged error in one court the business of two others is put to a standstill to complete the confusion nothing more is wanting than to give an ulterior appeal from the exchequer chamber immediately or through the medium of the house of lords to a court composed of the judges of some one or more or all of the judges of the courts herein just mentioned under the name of the inferior courts  0  of the gradation here exhibited was ever any instance exemplified in practice probably not but why not answer—because the rapacity and wickedness of judges—creators and preservers of this system—have to such a degree outrun the wickedness of their pupils the attorneys and the opulence of individuals whom they have thus employed in the endeavour to convert them into dishonest suitors   0 now as to appeal and its stages in the socalled equity courts    —i when the suit is in the first instance brought before the chancellor stage of appeal but one—appeal to the house of lords    —ii when the suit is in the first instance before the vicechancellor each party has the option between an appeal immediately to the house of lords or first to the chancellor then from him—as in the instance of this same appellant or of the party on the other side—a further appeal may be made to that same right honourable house    —iii so where the suit is in the first instance brought before the other subordinate equity judge whose title is the master of the rolls a functionary who under this absurd title has for centuries exercised the functions of a substitute to the chancellor in a word those of a vicechancellor though without the name     in equity procedure stages of appeal have place disguised under different denominations    —i under the name of exceptions to report appeal from the judicatory of a master in chancery to that of the chancellor the vicechancellor or the master of the rolls as the case may be    —ii under the name of a rehearing appeal from any one of those functionaries to his successor    —iii under the name of a rehearing appeal from any one of them at one time to himself at another time for thus are two sorts of proceedings so different in tendency disguised under the same name     by the master of the rolls or the vicechancellor a definite decree suppose has been pronounced plaintiff or defendant losing his cause by it proposes to himself to take by means of appeal another chance to which then of the two judicatories shall the appeal be made—the chancellors court or the house of lords for answer—the solicitor of the losing party takes the soundings of the two purses of his clients and of the adversarys if in his clients there is depth enough for both courts he recommends the chancellors as the most eligible court namely that from thence if without reproach to himself he has the good fortune to succeed in making his client lose his case a second time he may carry it into the house of lords in which there being no ulterior judicatory it will be his interest for reputations sake and accordingly his endeavour to gain rather than lose it from the chancellor to the house of lords that is to say from the chancellor under that name to him said chancellor under another name this course it being that which in the situation of a solicitor it is every mans interest to take is that which with a view to legislative arrangements every man unless prevented ought to be expected to take and as to a solicitor so should this expectation apply itself to every dishonest plaintiff or defendant who being in the wrong and knowing   0 that he is so has formed a plan for purchasing of the judges in question the faculty of acquiring or retaining the estate in question by the ruin of the destined victim thereby availing himself of the offer which though not in words is not the less in deeds held out by the several members of the learned brotherhood to all who are respectable enough to be able to give acceptance to it yes respectable enough for in the language of the opulent opulence and respectability are names of the same thing     a word or two as to the particular sources of profit profit to judge and co from the delays manufactured as above i by the delay are produced as above dishonest suits and defences which otherwise would not have place the evil hour is thus staved off to the last moment to a dishonest defendant the delay produces for a time if he be solvent at any rate common interest of money correspondent to the duration add if in trade profit of trade if he be insolvent the faculty of converting the whole to his own use of this profit what part if any shall be net depends upon the proportion as between debt and costs of suit of the costs one constant portion is—that which is laid hold of by judge and co the dishonest mans partners and accomplices laid hold of in the first instance and before so much as a farthings worth is paid to any one of those to whom the debt is due   0—ii when the debt is such that the interests amounts to still more than the price paid to judge and co for the delay the delay follows of course    —iii delay breeds incidents incidents fees who shall number the varieties of these prolific incidents iv bred out of one incident—namely the incident of death—one inducement to delay is in cases to a large extent the extinction put upon the suit by the death of a party on one side or the other—and on either side or each side deaths of parties may have place by dozens and scores invited by judge and co for joint profit the injurer by delays made when in the situation of defendant helps to consign the injured plaintiff to a lingering death the result of vexation judge and co having taken care to exempt from the obligation of making compensation the murderers representatives a tort is a sort of thing that dies with the person such is the expression given to the rule in the lawyers dialect of the flash language    —v when these factitious delays were first instituted the minor portions of the year sufficed for as many suits as money could be found in the country to pay for in fees the major part being consecrated to ease in proportion as opulence has increased ease has been exchanged for fees     in the business of the department of justice is factitious delay useful and as such justifiable if so apply it to the finance and defensive force departments apply it to the military departments land service and sea service in particular in time of war not more indefensible is it in those than in this     whence this difference answer—in these cases were any such factitious delays established government would fall to pieces in these cases accordingly they are not established in the justice department government however badly can go on the delay notwithstanding in these accordingly they are established so much for government now for surgery to a patient who wants to be cut for the stone does the surgeon ever say wait with the stone in your bladder till i have nothing else to do no by the medical man no such thing is ever said by the feefed judge it is in effect as often as he makes a plaintiff wait for his money when wanted for making payment to the surgeon whence the difference answer—from this—to produce the delay without losing the customer is not in the power of the surgeon it is in the power of the judge and so far from losing he is a gainer by it     on this occasion as unhappily on so many others religion is pressed into the service of injustice to st hilary a catholic saint—to st michael a protestant as well as catholic saint—to christ jesus—to wit by the word easter nay even to the whole incomprehensible trinity as st athanasius so truly styles it—does this miserymaking employment stand assigned    out of the sabbath is made another pretence which of you shall have an ox or an ass fallen into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbathday by whom this is said may it please the honourable house to consider if when it is by mere accident that the damage has been produced worship of the god of justice is no sufficient warrant for delay of justice how much less when it is by injustice—by groundless distress for rent suppose or by robbery by the worship of the god of justice would not an appropriate overture be furnished to the oratorio of judicature     wives converted into widows children into orphans both by slow murder rendered destitute depredators fattened upon the substance of these victims judge and co contrivers and sharers in the booty—such is the scene presented by the fruit of this wisdom—of this branch of ancestor wisdom the branch to which we are indebted for the plantation of judgemade law   when sleeps injustice so may justice too   delays the wicked make the injured rue these two memoriter verses it is our humble     wish to place in the memory of the honourable house    —vii device the seventh—precipitation necessitated excess on one side is thus made the parent of excess on the opposite side by delay is produced precipitation and reciprocally by precipitation more delay grand and principal instrument of precipitation jurytrial as hitherto conducted but to its efficiency vast addition made by circuits     of the suits out of which a pretence for recurring to this mode of trial is manufactured classes two one composed of those which by the very nature of the case are rendered incapable of receiving their termination from a judicatory so composed   0 instance account a case in which under the name of one single suit may be included suits in a number altogether indefinite suits as many as the account contains items each with a separate batch of evidence belonging to it     the other class of these indeterminable suits is composed of those which are rendered such by accident that is to say by the magnitude of the aggregate of the evidence in the case of elizabeth canning prosecuted for perjury—time about the middle of the last century—seven days passed before the trial was concluded since then instances of still longer duration might perhaps be found     in the interval that has place at present between circuit and circuit what limit can be assigned to the number of suits that might present themselves if the door shut against them by this institution were thrown open     behold now judge and co syringe in hand forcing and injecting the whole mass of all the suits into a compass of three days or in some counties two days what is the consequence on condition of their being heard badly—in regard to some portion of the whole number possibility of being heard has place and accordingly heard they are in regard to the rest even under that condition no such possibility has place     on those which remain in hand is stamped the appellation of remanents or remanets for judge and co the more remanets the better the more fresh suits for redress of one and the same wrong not that the number of these disastrous effects is—at all times or even commonly—altogether as great as that of the efficient causes for commonly by the postponement some in number more or less considerable are at this stage of their existence prematurely killed cause of death deperition of evidence or death of a party more frequently perhaps than either on the part of the injured plaintiff exhaustion of the power of finding the matter of fees but for this remanets in swarms might go on begetting one another to the end of time     when one of these indeterminable suits comes to be called on brought to view then is the discovery—that from the first such it was in its very nature rediscovered on every circuit is this discovery rediscovered for centuries past but the jurybox is not the less worshipped why answer—because as at present constituted trial by jury is in every instance trial with lawyers     fresh suits produced by precipitation are—  in an immediate way new trials   in an unimmediate way namely by means of remanets arbitrations    —i first as to new trials greater in this case may to the parties be the expense greater accordingly to judge and co the profit than by the original suit for preceded always is the new trial by motion for ditto which said motion is one sort of suit carried on for the purpose of determining whether another suit shall be carried on or not shape of the evidence on which the original suit is determined the best shape shape in which the excretitious suit is sometimes determined the worst shape—namely affidavit evidence barristers necessarily employed as well as attorney whereas in the original suit it may have been carried down to trial and perhaps most commonly is without the intervention of argumentation by barristers commonly that is to say where the general issue as the phrase is being pleaded no demand has place for written pleadings of more than a determinate and comparatively short length    —ii now as to arbitrations of the disadvantages this sort of suit labours under with correspondent advantage to judge and co samples are these—   power for the attainment of evidence comparatively inadequate not comprehending the power of obtaining it from all places not ascertained whether in it is universally comprised any power for rendering attendance on the part of witnesses effectually obligatory    —  if not then on many occasions the body of the evidence will be not merely incomplete but in the sinister sense of the word partial admitted and perhaps exclusively witnesses with a bias on their testimony—willing witnesses as the phrase is and these biassed all of them in favour of the same side of which state of mind the very fact of the willingness affords some although not conclusive evidence   0—iii evidence of parties admitted it cannot be without giving up as completely adverse to justice the general exclusionary rule excluded not without substituting misdecision     or denial of justice to right decision in a large proportion of the whole aggregate number of the suits demand for which has place yes denial of justice for in so far as it is foreknown that by the exclusion put upon evidence necessary to success all chance of success is excluded—in so far the suit will not be instituted    —iv professional persons if chosen as arbitrators must be paid here—be the payment ever so moderate and wellregulated—here will be a vast addition to the expense the remuneration being over and above that which at the expense of the whole community is given to the permanent judges—judges so styled and intituled    —v but in cases thus disposed of the mode of payment is in a flagrant degree corruptive and adverse to the professed end it is payment by the day a mode by which a premium is given for the maximum of delay and extortion corruption delay and extortion which it is not in the power of human sagacity to prevent punish or so much as discover and hold up to view corruption which it is not in the power of flesh and blood to remove    —vi these professional judges who are they naturally such of the choice of whom selfregarding or sympathetic interest is more likely than regard for the interest of justice—more likely than appropriate aptitude—to have been the cause in the train of the judge come always along with the briefholding briefless barristers of the choice made cause not unfrequent and certainly none so natural as recommendation at the hands of the judge proportioned to the value of every situation is that of the patronage by which it is conferred and recommendation taken patronage is exercised    —vii question which of the suits shall be tried—which by being left untried converted into remanents this will depend upon the result of the conflict of interests yes but of whom—the suitors no but of learned lords and ditto gentlemen by sinister interest full is the swing enjoyed in this case into it is it possible for the eye of public opinion in any degree to penetrate     in respect of favour manifest it is here upon how different a footing stand the forced arbitrations brought on in this circuitous mode compared with those spontaneous ones which originate with the parties so many spontaneous arbitrations so many usurpations upon the authority of learned judges moreover most commonly the arbitrators will be unpaid or at any rate unlawlearned individuals whereas on the circuit a suit will not only have already brought grist to the learned mill but have moreover brought with it a superior chance for finding learned arbitrators    —viii device the eighth—blind fixation of times for judicial operations i only in relation to the exigencies of the case and the interests of the sincere among suitors not in relation to judge and cos profits will in this case the blindness be seen manifested    —ii blindness to the exigencies of the case yes to all exigencies to all differences between time and time to all differences between place and place    —iii between dishonesty and insanity on the part of the creators and preservers of this arrangement—that is here the question—what—for holding intercourse with the judicatory—for paying obedience to its mandate—appoint in all cases the same day for every individual subject to its authority—on whatever spot wherever at the time he happens to be whether within a stones throw of the justicechamber or at the landsend and whether in england or in australia in peru or in nova zembla except for the purpose of deception is it in the nature of man that any such arrangement shall have presented itself to a sane mind no not of honest blindness is this the result but of sinister discernment on the part of the contrivers taking advantage of that blindness which on the part of the people has with such deplorably successful industry been organized so much for the policy of dishonesty     behold now the policy of common honesty and common sense yes and everywhere but in the land of chicane common practice i no suit being suppose ever commenced but by application made to you the judge in your justicechamber by a proposed plaintiff—or in case of necessity a substitute of his—settle with him before you let him depart the means of intercourse with him during the continuance of the suit the further obligation being at the same time laid on him of continuing the line or say chain or series of those means by timely information of every such change as shall eventually have place reference being moreover at all times made to such other individuals whose assistance to these purposes may eventually become necessary   0—ii learn from him as far as may be the like means of intercourse in the first instance with all other individuals whom his examination presents to view in the character of defendants extraneous witnesses or coplaintiffs or say copursuers    —iii at the first attendance of each such other individual make with him the like settlement    —iv should any subsequent attendance on the part of the same or any other individual be for the purpose of the suit necessary—accident     and other exceptions excepted—let the time fixed for it be as early as without preponderant evil in the shape of expense and vexation it can be    —v accidents for example death sickness impassableness of ways calamities casualties confinement or transference by force by fraud or the like    —vi correspondent arrangement as to inspection inspection of things moveable requisite to be inspected by you in the character of sources of real evidence    —vii so as to things immoveable    —viii so as to persons by sickness or infirmity rendered immoveable    — so as to instruments in writing whether already written or for the purpose in hand requiring to be written allowance made in this last case for the quantity of time likely to be made requisite by the quantity or the quality of the matter    —ix as to the requisition thus to be made of the maximum of dispatch note the exceptions following— i when of two individuals attendance at the same time is requisite the residence of both or either—from each other and from the judgmentseat—is at the time at a certain degree of remoteness in this case for the attendance of him whose residence at the time is nearest postponement that is to say to the earliest time at which attendance can be paid by him whose residence is most remote—is necessitated by the exigency of the case    —ii so in regard to any greater number of individuals on whose part conjunct attendance is necessary   0—iii so when the exigency of the case requires the attendance of one individual to be postponed till after attendance paid by this or that other     with each individual with whom for the purposes of the suit intercourse is holden—places for intercourse and in that respect modes of intercourse two—  the justicechamber   other places at large in the justicechamber by attendance of the individuals there other places in extraordinary cases by visitation transition or say migration thither on the part of the judge thus as to intercourse in the oral mode for intercourse in the epistolary mode in ordinary cases it will be carried on by transference made of the written instrument or other source of evidence from place to place transference of letters by the post for example from and to the justicechamber will be this transference in most cases     in this way will conjunct provision be made for the exigencies of each individual suit and for the convenience of each individual concerned—delay expense vexation—all minimized so much for the policy of honesty     return we now to the policy of dishonesty as it presents itself to a closer view on the part of each such individual requisite will be the performance of some operation and included under the head of operations is that which is performed by the exhibition of some written instrument or other moveable source of evidence as above     behold now the course which in regard to each such operation and each such instrument the dishonest plan prescribes for each such operation on the part of every individual concerned—fix one and the same day then to the minimization of the evils in question—the evils to wit of delay vexation and expense you will substitute maximization for in each individual instance the chances against the so fixed days being a proper day are as infinity to one    —i in regard to operations it will be your care to maximize the number of those by which birth is given to written instruments for in this case superadded to the profit—profit in the operation—is the profit upon the instrument on this occasion reciprocal generation has place operation produces instrument instrument operations    —ii so the length of each such instrument    —iii so the number of the instances in which for the performance of the several operations days are appointed on which the performance of those same operations respectively is impossible for by the impossibility the need of ulterior operations and ulterior instruments will be established    —iv so and thence the number of instances in which need of application for further time and application accordingly shall have place in particular the number of those in which the allowance of such time shall be a subjectmatter of contestation    —v so accordingly of the instances in which the notices without which compliance cannot have place shall not have been received   0—vi so accordingly of those in which the notice shall not have been given    —vii so likewise of those in which whether the notice has or has not been received and given respectively—shall be the subjectmatter of contestation    —viii so likewise the expense of special messengers employed by professional assistants in this instance chiefly of the attorney class in making communication of such notices—the expense to wit for the sake of the profit extractable out of the expense    —ix so accordingly the number of such journeys and the length of and difficulties attendant upon each    —x so likewise in regard to the journeys employed in the making seizure definitive or provisional and instrumental whether     of persons or things for the purposes of justice that is to say whether for execution and effect to be given to a decree of the judge or for evidence to be elicited for the purpose of constituting a ground for it     admirable under the existing system is the equipment made for this species of chase—partyhunting to wit and witnesshunting—a chase in which the fox instead of being the huntee is the hunter and his object is to catch—not as early but as late as possible and through as many turnings and windings as possible     behold here an example for the purpose of obtaining at the hands of the defendant the service he stands engaged for—say the money he stands engaged to pay—engaged to wit by a bond to which his signature stands attached adequate ground for regarding it as being his signature is necessary this defendant the judge sees standing or sitting in court shall this same judge say to same defendant is this your handwriting not he indeed no nor any person by word of mouth never since the conquest was any torment thus barbarous inflicted by word of mouth nobody the hardship of saying yes or no would be unendurable in writing yes so it be by the plaintiff and by a bill in equity length from half a dozen pages to any number of sheets of ordinarilysized letterpress as to time at the end of years five or more as it may happen yes or by word of mouth so it be by learned counsel to a witness who has been hired to come say from australia for this purpose if there be no person whose residence is less remote and by whom the information can be afforded both those resources failing the defendant by the hands of judge and co pockets the money the right owner loses it think of a judge with this spectacle before his eyes turning them aside from it—lifting them up to heaven and proclaiming in solemn accents his love of justice     by the arrangements hereinafter submitted put down altogether would be this pastime     as to fees inexhaustible is the source of them thus created by chicaneries about notice     under the existing system to this relatively so desirable state of things with what consummate skill and success and not less consummate effrontery the blank fixation device has been adopted may now be with sufficient distinctness visible   0 to all these sinister purposes it has been seen how indispensably necessary was the primordial radical and allproducing device—exclusion of parties severally and collectively from the presence of the judge     so will it presently be seen to all these same purposes how exquisitely well adapted is the system of mechanical substituted as far as possible to mental judicature     nor yet for reconciling the public mind to this host of enormities and of sufferings produced by them—are pleas altogether wanting pleas with which pleasing or imposing ideas stand associated words such as they are have been found in uniformity regularity and strictness pleas furnished by the ascendency so extensively prevalent of imagination over reason     uniformity what uniformity answer—that produced by the fabled arrangement in which between the bed and the men reposing on it uniformity in length was produced by cutting off the redundant part of each body which was longer and stretching out to the requisite length each body which was shorter than the bed here is uniformity and this being done according to rule here is moreover regularity and for the display of the heroic strength of mind requisite and produced by this branch of the gymnastic exercise added not unfrequently is the word strictness strictness in the observation of justicekilling and miserybegetting rules    —ix device the ninth—mechanical substituted to mental judicature in so far as in the production of any effect machinery is employed instead of human labour machinery is employed instead of mind for example in the shape of a man an automaton figure such as has been seen forming writings with its hands     origin of this device a problem a problem from the beginning proposed to one another by judge and co purport of all this—how to administer justice without a thought about the matter reward for solution—trouble time labour responsibility—all minimized meaning always by time judge and cos time ditto profit of course on this as on all other occasions maximized nowhere in euclid is to be found any problem more skilfully and effectually solved than by judge and co this     for proof as well as elucidation one example will supersede all need of recourse to others this is—the operation styled signing judgments machinery and mode of operation this     machine a pair of scales invented by the demon of chicane in derision of the scales of justice kept in one scale papers styled judgments kept vacant the other for the reception of fees drop into it the appropriate fee up rises the appropriate judgment this the attorney the plaintiffs attorney takes in hand and off it goes to the sheriff for execution such is the way in which money to the amount of hundreds of pounds thousands or tens of thousands is made to pass     from defendants pocket into plaintiffs his lordship under whose auspices this legerdemain is performed what knows he of all this exactly as much as his learned brother in calcutta     to such perfection is the invention brought—so complete the mechanism produced—not so much as even in pretence is it by the judge that the effective operation is performed i have signed judgment quoth plaintiffs attorney nor yet is so much as this true what is true is—that it is by a journeyman of the chiefjustices that the signature is performed all that the attorney has done is the paying him for so doing and the journeyman—what knows he about the matter answer—that an instrument which on the blind fixation principle as above should by defendants attorney have been put in by a certain day had not been put in by that same day     now for a reason for such judicature where shall it be found without so much as a particle of blame on the defendants part or even on his attorneys part in how many cases may it not happen that the failure took place   0 in a system having for its end the ends of justice—in a word in the here proposed system cases forming so many grounds of excuses would as in the infancy of english jurisprudence received under the name of essoigns be looked out for and a list formed of them but suppose even blame and to any amount might not compensation if to the same amount suffice—compensation instead of the ruin of which execution given to the judgment may be productive     persons     obtaining money     by false pretences     may be punished by fine and imprisonment or by pillory whipping or transportation these words stand part of the marginal abridgment of the first section of the statute  0 geo ii ch    §   in the statutes at large which statute is in ruffheads edition of the statutes referred to under the head of cheat swindler as the name by which in common parlance persons so offending are designated seeing this we humbly entreat the honourable house that it may be considered whether by the highseated functionaries by whom fees are obtained by warrants for attendance paid before them although such attendances were never paid nor intended so to be money has not at all times been obtained by false pretences as also to consider whether if there be either in a legal or a moral sense guilt in the obtaining money by such means the guilt is lessened by the power by means of which such obtainment is effected whether if functionaries so seated in those and other judicial situations were not to every practical purpose in this respect above the law obtainment by such means would not be an act of extortion and as such a crime and whether by the addition of extortion and on the part of a suitor the impossibility of avoiding to comply with the demand so made the moral guilt attached to the idea of chicanery or say swindling is in any degree lessened we acknowledge that it is in the power of the honourable house with the assent of the house of lords and his majesty in parliament not only by connivance but by express enactment to give impunity and encouragement to the above and any or all other persons who being constituted in authority obtain money by false pretences and this while persons not constituted in authority are for obtaining money on false pretences punished in manner above mentioned and moreover that it is fully in the power of that authority of which the honourable house is a branch to give impunity and encouragement to every enormity to whatever extent maleficent and by so doing to cause the act not to come with propriety under the name of a crime nor the actors to be with propriety denominated criminals and accordingly to cause to be punished as for a libel all persons speaking of these under that name which accordingly we forbear to do otherwise than hypothetically as above but we humbly entreat the honourable house to consider whether it would not be more for their honour and dignity to endeavour to repress maleficence in this as well as in every other shape than in this or any other shape give impunity and encouragement to it     if instead of this mechanical mental were the mode of judicature how would the matter have been managed answer—of each individual case of each individual person concerned the circumstances would be looked to of each individual person the feelings taken for objects of sympathy and consideration respite upon occasion granted pecuniary circumstances on one side as well as the other taken into the account claims of other creditors not neglected though not parties to the suit nor privy to the application by which it was commenced    —x device the tenth—mischievous transference and bandying of suits instead of transference and bandying the one appellative removal might better have been employed removal—that is to say of a suit from one judicatory to another     removal may be and is either—  established or   incidental established when by usage it takes place in every individual suit of the sort in question incidental when it does not take place but in consequence of some extraordinary operation performed by some person for that purpose some person usually if not exclusively a party on one side or the other of the suit     under the existing system when it     has place incidentally a certiorari is the name of the written instrument by the issuing of which the removal is produced of this further on     subjectmatter of the established removals two namely—i incorporeal the operation performed on the occasion of the suit corporeal the written instruments brought into existence or into the custody of the judicatory in consequence of the commencement given to the suit including every such account or say history as happens to be given of these same operations as also any such other things moveable if any as happen to have been presented or intended to be presented to the view of the judges in the character of sources of evidence—that is to say real evidence    —ii in case of removal whether established or incidental the suit is by some other judicatory received call this the recipient or subsequential and for distinction call the firstmentioned judicatory the originating original or primordial    —iii if after removal the suit does not return to the primordial judicatory call the removal transference or simple transference if it does return oscillation or bandying in case of bandying the transference is followed by retrotransference    —iv emblems—of oscillation a pendulum of bandying battledore and shuttlecock  00—v where oscillation has place returns are in any number secured by what has been called preestablished harmony at battledore and shuttlecock to every return a fresh application of mental power is indispensable  0 —vi as to precipient judicatories they have place of course in a number correspondent to that of the oscillations of the pendulum or the strokes of the battledore  0 —vii from the operation here termed removal distinguish that designated by the word appeal under every system appeal is for cause assigned namely on the part of the judge of the originating judicatory either misdecision or nondecision productive of the same effect as misdecision misdecision either ultimate or interlocutory or say interventional in any case misconduct in the case of what is here meant by removal no allegation or supposition of any such misconduct has place  0 —viii under the here proposed system incidentally both simple transference and removal have place but in every case it is for cause specially assigned thence in the way of bandying not in the way of oscillation  0  under the existing system in no case will the removal be seen to have any good cause assigned or assignable good cause none but as to effects bad effects in abundance bad in relation to the interest of the community and the ends of justice thence herein as above termed mischievous good at the same time in correspondent abundance relation had to judge and co and their particular and sinister interest and thence in relation to the actual ends of judicature  0  to return to the here proposed system and to the good effects which under it are deducible from the removal in question and would accordingly be deduced from it execution evidence intercourse—to one or more of these objects will be found referable everything that can be said of the operations or instruments which have place in judicial procedure  0 —i execution to wit of the enactments of the substantive branch or say the main body of the law under which head is comprised everything that does not belong to the adjective branch or say procedure enactments really existing in the case of legislationmade imaginary in the case of judgemade law  0 —ii evidence for the purpose of forming a ground for what is done in the way of execution  0 —iii intercourse to wit between the judge and all other persons concerned for obtaining evidence and effecting execution including the securing the means of such intercourse from the commencement to the termination of the suit  0 —iv giving to all these several objects accomplishment with the minimum of delay expense and vexation to the individuals concerned   0—i first as to execution for this purpose need of removals—of removals in a number altogether unlimited—may have place in proof of this a single example may suffice judgeshires as herein proposed say two hundred for whichsoever purpose—say satisfaction to a party wronged or punishment—seizure and sale of defendants effects requisite within any number of these judicial territories so many portions of these effects may happen to be situated in this case even though perfect intercommunication of jurisdiction was to have place between the judge of each judgeshire and the judge of every other still preponderant convenience might require that for this purpose employment should be given to the power of the judge of this or that subsequential judgeshire originating judgeshire or say judicatory suppose in london of the effects one parcel in liverpool of seizure and sale the purpose might perhaps as conveniently be fulfilled by mandate from the london judgeshire but for the discovering what they are and in whose possession situated suppose evidence necessary and that evidence composed of the testimony of a person resident in liverpool here expense and delay in no small proportion will be saved if it be by a liverpool     judge instead of the london judge that the examination of the liverpool witness is performed    —ii as to evidence in regard to evidence what is desirable is that in each individual case whatsoever evidence the case affords be obtainable in whatever part of the globe it happens to be situated whether in england ireland scotland a distant dependancy or a country under foreign dominion obtainable with the best security for its completeness and correctness and with the least delay expense and vexation with least delay and accordingly from persons and things in any number at the same time     good effects in this respect obtainable from removal and not otherwise these— i obtainment of evidence not otherwise obtainable    —ii obtainment of it in the best shape that is to say that which it assumes when elicited in the oral mode when otherwise it could not be elicited but in a less instructive shape namely when elicited in the epistolary mode    —iii obtainment of it from its several sources namely persons and things in any number at the same time for the purpose of the same suit and in each instance in that one of the two modes which on that individual occasion is best adapted to the aggregate of the purposes of justice    —iv accomplishing the elicitation not only with the minimum of delay and vexation but that minimum laid in each individual instance on the shoulders best able to bear it namely those of the public at large in so far as practicable without preponderant evil in the shape of addition made to the expense     for all these several purposes removal of the suit from the originating judicatory to some other or others is eventually necessary that is to say in so far as the means necessary for the accomplishment of these three several objects respectively in the best mode fail of being in the power of the originating judicatory and at the same time are in the power of some other which accordingly is constituted the subsequential and recipient judicatory     of the benefit in all these shapes a necessary instrument will be seen to be the division of the local field of judicature into the abovementioned compartments styled on this account judgeshires extent of each judgeshire limited in such sort that the justicechamber being in the centre every inhabitant not disabled by infirmity may during the sitting of the judicatory be in attendance therein without passing the night elsewhere than at his own home     mode of elicitation oral or epistolary places the originating or subsequential judicatories in any number according to the exigency of each individual case     eventually subsequent to epistolary oral elicitation now for the first time this arrangement object of it check upon security against falsehood   0 where for correctness and completeness of the whole body of evidence the confrontation of all persons speaking to the same fact is regarded as necessary—confrontation accordingly not otherwise place either the original or some subsequential judicatory     so order in respect of time of elicitation as between the several examinands that is to say coplaintiffs if any—defendants and other persons at large in the character of extraneous witnesses     now as to retrotransference and retroreception or say return of the suit to the originating judicatory demand for it will in some instances have place in others not purpose of it continuation of the series of operations by which commencement had been performed     by all these arrangements taken together minimized will be seen to be the burthen of the expense that is to say—  by minimization of the extent of the judgeshire the quantity of the expense of journeys and demurrage   by transferring to the letterpost the conveyance of such of the written instruments as are contained within the compass of an ordinary letter expense of intercourse in so far minimized   by laying on the shoulders of government and thereby of the public at large that same expense together with the whole of the remuneration of all judicial functionaries—minimized will be the hardship of the burthen by its being laid on the shoulders best able to bear it thus provided for by far the greatest part of the expense other part by fines for delinquency on the part of defendants where there is no individual specially wronged and for misconduct in the course of the suit on the part of suitors on both sides particularly if in the shape of falsehood always remembered that the burthen of compensation has the effect and even more than the effect of money to the same amount exacted and applied to the use of the public or in any other way disposed of     by the evidenceholder understand the person whose testimony is requisite or who is in possession of the writing or other thing which is the source of the evidence when of this evidenceholder the residence is at the time in the dominion of a foreign power elicitation in the epistolary mode may be practicable or not with advantage according to circumstances practicable it will be in so far as by any means he happens to be in effect subject to the power of the judicatory means of such subjection subjectmatters of     property whether moveable or immoveable in possession or expectancy certain or contingent so circumstanced as to be susceptible of seizure by the judge so as to subjectmatters termed incorporeal that is to say rights of all kinds from the impracticability of making this mode of elicitation available in some cases no reason assuredly can be deduced for the not employing it in any case in which it can be made available     in so far as for any of the above purposes on any of the above occasions removal in each of the two modes with or without retrotransference to and retroreception on the part of the originating judicatory has not place—manifest it will now it is hoped be that the jurisdiction of the whole territory cannot but be as the phrase is—lame and in what a multitude of its organs and muscles jurisdiction is under the existing system lame and to all good purposes impotent will be manifest to every person in proportion as his conception of that same system is correct and complete     for extraordinary removal sole case this—by a judicatory or by a tribunal of exception cognizance taken suppose of a suit which lies not within its competence here will be a case—either for the extinction of the suit altogether or for the removal of it into the sort of judicatory to which those exceptions excepted cognizance is given of all sorts of cases tribunals of exception these—military judicatories for the establishment of appropriate discipline among military functionaries in both branches—land branch and sea branch—of that service ecclesiastical functionaries in a country in which an ecclesiastical establishment has place for the establishment of discipline among ecclesiastical functionaries     removal in both shapes will in some cases of necessity have place in the same judgeshire for example as between the judge principal and judge depute—in case of death simple transference in case of temporary inability through illness—perhaps simple transference—perhaps oscillation or bandying may be the more eligible course only that it may not be supposed to be overlooked is this need mentioned     enter now the existing system short account of it as to this matter this—the purposes for which—the occasions on which so as to be conducive to the ends of justice—say in a word useful—the removal will take place have been seen under the existing system for none of these purposes on none of these occasions has it place on none but where the rare case—that of applying a check to usurpation alone excepted it is worse than useless     intricate is here the complication vast the labyrinth constructed by it to let in upon the whole expanse the full light of day would be an endless enterprise only by way of sample upon a holeandcorner or two can a few rays be endeavoured to be cast   0—i sample the first mode of established removal the simple transference mode   class of cases and suits that called criminal species of cases that called by the nonsensical term felony thus denominated from the sort of punishment attached to it nonsensical because no idea does this denomination afford of the nature of the evil nor therefore of the cause for which it is thus dealt with     course taken by the suit in these cases this— case the first—judicatory in which the suit is tried the original commonlaw judicatory having for its seat in a country cause the assize town i originating judicatory that of justices of the peace one or more acting otherwise than in general sessions as above ii first recipient judicatory the grand jury for the county sitting at the place where the trial is about to be performed iii second and last recipient judicatory that in which the trial is performed as above in this case it is in that same town that the judgment is pronounced place of execution varying but no return in any case to the originating judicatory     note that in the case of homicide—a crime belonging to this same class of felony—an originating judicatory taking cognizance antecedently to the above is the court called the coroners inquest judge the coroner with a jury called the inquest jury     of these removals note now the consequences in regard to evidence short account this shape in which the evidence is elicited more or less different in all these cases the mass elicited on the first occasion made no use of either in the second or the third the mass elicited in the second made no use of in the third the two first masses—after the expense labour and time employed in the elicitation of them thrown away     even of this third mass no use is made for any purpose subsequent to the verdict for being elicited in the oral mode it is not committed to writing by authority—only by accident that is to say by this or that individual by whom the profit on publication is looked to as affording a sufficient return for the labour and expense of minutation     in one class of cases the suit does receive its termination in the same judicatory in which it has received its commencement these cases are of the number of those consigned to the cognizance of a justice of the peace acting singly or two or more in conjunction out of general sessions now then     supposing the judicatory aptly constituted why except in the cases provided for under the herein proposed system as before why should it not so do in these and in a word in all other cases and where is the case in which the judicatory should be otherwise than aptly constituted     in the originating judicatory—namely that of the justice of the peace acting singly—sometimes a part only of the stock of evidence which the individual can afford will have been elicited—sometimes the whole of it as it may happen but where the whole of it does happen to be elicited the suit is not the less sent in to those other judicatories     moreover where after the whole of the evidence which the suit affords has been heard including the evidence on the defendants side—be this evidence in its own nature ever so satisfactory and as against the defendant conclusive yet thereupon when the suit has been transferred to the secret judicature—the grand jury it is liable to be and not unfrequently is decided the opposite way on evidence heard on one side only meantime evidenceholders have had from a day to half a year given to them—to go off of themselves or to be bought off—and in prison the defendant guilty or not guilty that same time for contaminating as the phrase is or being contaminated or both if not guilty there to moan under the oppression thus for the benefit of judge and co exercised on him and whether he be guilty or not guilty the country is made to suffer under the expense of keeping him in a state of forced idleness     cases in which removal in the oscillation or bandying mode is employed these all suits termed civil commenced in any one of the three commonlaw westminsterhall courts     in westminster hall they take their commencement without elicitation of evidence their commencement viz in the office of a clerk mode the mechanical mode as above the judges not knowing anything about the matter applications incidental and accidental excepted for example for leave to plead or for putting off the trial   0 for elicitation of evidence in a country cause off goes the suit to an assize town there as the phrase is to be tried to wit by the elicitation there performed by a judge dispatched thither from one of the westminsterhall courts with a petty jury     the trial performed back it comes to the judicatory from whence it had emanated and there it is that in the mechanical mode as above it receives judgment this done then back again it goes to the same county for execution but for execution the office it goes to is—not any office belonging to the court in which it originated nor that in which the trial was performed it is the office of the sheriff of the county in which the suit was tried     such is the operation of the judgment when it has for its subjectmatter a person or a thing moveable or immoveable whereupon the officer causes hands to be laid upon the person or the thing and in the ordinary course does by that same person or thing what by the judgment he has been bid to do but in some cases the suit has for its subjectmatter nothing on which hands can be laid—nothing but a fictitious entity—an incorporeal thing—to wit a right or an obligation in which cases as execution consists in the extinction of the obligation or the right words contained in the judgment suffice—words without acts and deeds for the performance of it     now for removal upon an almost universal scale—removal by certiorari exceptions few excepted from all courts a suit is at any stage removable into the kings bench instrument of removal a writ styled in the judge and cos dialect of the flash language a certiorari in the language of honest ignorance a sisserary witness the threat ill fetch you up with a sisserary     eminently mischievous to the community at large correspondently beneficial to judge and co is this same monster mischief it does in two ways—  by its operation when not killed   by its dead carcase when by a clause in a statute killed of such as are let live the effect is—from a less expensive and comparatively to judge and co unprofitable judicatory to send up the suit to a more expensive and more profitable judicatory as to the carcases they are those of the certioraris killed in embryo or endeavoured so to be that is to say in and by every statute by which additional jurisdiction is given to a justice of the peace or other summarily acting judicatory in this case one of two things—either by the insertion of the clause by which the death is produced so much rubbish is shot down into the statutebook or else danger of inefficiency is left by the noninsertion of it note by the bye that in every such statute this is but one of a string of efficient causes of inefficiency which must be thus dealt with or the like effect will follow     yes endeavoured to be for as lawbooks show not in every instance has the endeavour been successful on this occasion as on all others in comes the established habit of judge and co when a clause of an act of the legislature is brought before them they pay obedience to it or run counter to it as they feel inclined moulding the law is among the phrases on this occasion employed     now for the instrument and document   0 which in case of removal whether established or incidental is the corporeal subjectmatter of this same operation the suit being the incorporeal subjectmatter of it of this instrument the proper contents will be composed of a statement or say history of the several proceedings carried on in the course of the suit proceedings—that is to say appropriate operations performed and written instruments framed and issued or exhibited contents for various purposes proper for the purpose of appeal and in so far as that is in contemplation altogether indispensable     of this history by far the largest the bulkiest part will consist of an account of the evidence to the evidence which by this means for this purpose has in the course of the suit by the correspondent operations been elicited in the wordofmouth mode—the expression given to it by the pen by the taking it down as the phrase is or in one word the minutation of it will constitute a written instrument     hereupon in the instance of each individual suit will arise two questions—  shall the minutation be performed   when it is performed shall the result be for any and what length of time preserved to both these questions the proper answer will depend—upon the proportion between the profit in the way of use elicitable from the document and the loss composed of the expenses always understood—that wheresoever appeal is in contemplation preservation will of course not be less necessary than creation     as to all matters besides the evidence so small in comparison will in every instance be the bulk of them that of what is necessary to either of these operations of no part can the expense be grudged   0 obvious as may seem these observations not so obvious are they as to be superfluous for by them will judgment have to be pronounced on the practice of the existing system in relation to the subjectmatter of them     enter now accordingly the existing system to the difference between courts of record and courts not of record prodigious is the importance attached by it mountains in the survey taken of them the courts of record molehills the courts not of record     now as to the treatment given by the two sorts of courts to the mass of evidence belonging to the suit in the record of the courts of record not a syllable of this same evidence is ever inserted and in particular in those of the westminsterhall courts—the kings bench the common pleas and the commonlaw side of the half commonlaw half equity court—the court of exchequer     in the records of the courts not of record every syllable of the evidence elicited witness—  the chancery court including its subordinate branches the vicechancellors and the master of the rolls court—  the courts held by the bankruptey commissioners and which are also courts subordinate to the chancellors court—  the equity side of the exchequer court     between the real state of things and the pretended state as intimated by the denomination thus given—whence this seemingly strange difference answer—by the commonlaw court it is that this nomenclature was framed courts to which the depreciatory denomination was attached by them the shops of their rivals in trade rivals with whom for a length of time they had fierce battles till at last an accommodation was come to—of course at the expense of customers and of those who should have been but by the expense were kept from being customers     of the particulars contained in the instrument styled the record as framed in the courts selfstyled courts of record what shall be the account given short account this— i written pleadings which ought not to have been exhibited ii mendacious assertions by word of mouth and in writing which ought not to have been uttered iii delays such as have been seen which ought not to have been made iv ulterior delays—fruits such as have been seen of the precipitation established v products of the blind fixation as above—days appointed for operations which it was foreknown could not on those several days respectively be performed vi operations which in pursuance of the system of mechanical vice mental judicature are stated as having been performed by the judge though if performed at all it is not by him that they have been performed vii removals made which ought never to have been made     prefaced the whole by a fabulous history of apparitions statements asserting appearances as having been made by unhappy defendants and in these courts what defendants are not unhappy who from beginning to end never did appear they not knowing nor having it in their power to know what to do had they appeared and knowing but too well that had they appeared their appearance would have been of no use     as to the written pleadings—note that though otherwise than in an eventual indirect and disguised way as above the effect of evidence is not given to them—not unfrequently more voluminous are they than the evidence is or would have been if properly elicited         as to suit and record taken together—under the existing system general conclusion as intimated at the outset this to any useful purpose removal none to purposes worse than useless removal in abundance    —xi device the eleventh—decision on grounds avowedly foreign to the merits ☞ for the matter belonging to this head reference may be made to the fulllength petition   0—xii device the twelfth—juries subdued and subjugated ☞ for the matter belonging to this head reference may be made to the fulllength petition    —xiii device the thirteenth—jurisdiction split and spliced in the fulllength petition pages     and     have been seen the sorts of courts splinters from the one original aula regis each with a different scrap of jurisdiction number not less than thirteen without reckoning others which in process of time came to be superadded number of judges in these respectively from one to an undefinable greater number species of functionaries acting in various ways in subordination to the judge in one alone of these same thirteen sorts of courts as per fulllength petition page  00 more than twenty not to speak of the other sorts of subordinates acting in the other sorts of courts all these species instead of the four or five which in every court would as per page     with the addition of no more than two or three others in some special cases be sufficient     that confusion may be still worse confounded behold now a sample of the diversification which in these same judicatories with their additaments the denomination given to the character of judge has been subjected to the function belonging to that character being disguised under and by most of those several denominations a sample only—not a complete list for the labour of making it out would have been unrequited and unendurable here they are—   lord high chancellor   lord keeper of the seals   lord commissioner of the great seal   master

commissioner of the customs    commissioner of the audit office    auditorgeneral of greenwich hospital    commissioner of a court of claim     as to the confusion in which the enumeration thus made of them is involved—so far from being a blemish it may be stated as a merit serving as it does to render the portrait the more appropriate and perfect a representation of the original     behold another evil produced by the jurisdictionsplitting and not brought to view in the fulllength petition this is—the allpervading denial of justice produced by the exclusion put upon one or other of the two remedies which wrong in every shape calls for namely the satisfactive and the punitive modes of procedure the fissure makes two—the one styled civil the other criminal in and by the civil you may demand the satisfactive in and by the criminal the punitive in some cases you may have the one in other cases the other but with scarce an exception both together—either by one and the same     suit or by two different suits—you cannot have as to courts—the satisfactive remedy you are admitted to demand at the hands of either of two courts—the kings bench or the common pleas not to speak of the exchequer the punitive you are not admitted to demand in more than one of these two courts namely the kings bench moreover there is another sort of court in which in some cases you may demand the punitive namely the provincial court—the quarterlysittings justice of peace court whether after obtaining in this court the punitive remedy you can take your chance for obtaining in one or other of the two metropolitan courts the satisfactive—say who can never yet it is believed has the experiment been made moreover from this local court the suit may without reason assigned by means of a sort of a crane termed a certiorari as per     be raised up into one or other of these two higher and more expensive courts and this either by the author of the wrong or by you—the party wronged     of this severance by cooperation and a sort of tacit concert between judge and co on the one hand and the rest of the ruling and influential few on the other—advantage was taken to give additional strength to their power of exercising depredation as well as oppression at the expense of the subject many by the high price put upon the chance of receiving the article at the hands of judge and co the satisfactive remedy in so far as not obtainable but by procedure in the regular mode was effectually denied to the vast majority of these same subject and oppressed many so far as dependent upon law these that were unprivileged were thus laid completely at the mercy of the thus privileged classes in all cases to which the application of the punitive remedy did not extend itself     dear it is true was the price still however in the eyes of a large proportion of those to whom the privilege was thus granted the advantage was and is worth the purchase by each man the privilege is possessed and whether exercised or no exercisable at all times all his life long and to a certainty whereas the inconvenience of paying for it namely by the expense of going to law or being at law—is a danger the magnitude of which is by each mans confidence in his own good fortune concealed from his regards     this being the imposed price—how happened it that the intended victims were not deprived of the benefit of the punitive remedy as well as of that of the satisfactive answer—this they could not be without an allcomprehensive sacrifice of all security against wrong—a sacrifice in which the sacrificers themselves as well as the intended victims would be included to the security of the privileged classes it was necessary that not only they themselves should be preserved from depredation and oppression altogether but that the unprivileged classes should be preserved as far as might be from depredation and oppression at the hands of one another otherwise production would cease and with the subjectmatter of depredation the power of exercising it to this purpose it was therefore necessary that application of the punitive remedy should in a more or less considerable degree be kept free from the clogs by the strength of which the satisfactive remedy had been rendered unattainable to the unprivileged and devoted many     how to effect the severance was however the difficulty of this difficulty the primeval penury brought to view at the outset of the fulllength petition had been certainly one cause the want of sufficient discernment and talent perhaps another whichever were the case so it happened that the machinery employed in the application of the punitive remedy was no other than that employed in like manner upon the satisfactive whence it happened that the load of factitious delay and expense laid upon the one pressed also upon the other     without the fiat of a grand jury for example captain of the prisoner could not take place and except at the metropolis no grand jury sat but at the assizes and the assizes were not held oftener than twice ayear in any county nor than once in some counties nor in any county did they last more than two or three days and suppose the caption effected trial could not take place till the next assizes what as to offences were the consequences abundant as they were upon the continent criminal offences operating by force were in england in still superior abundance in the time of henry vi fortescue then chancellor takes notice of this superiority and makes it matter of boast in the reign of henry viii as may be seen in barringtons observations on the statutes no fewer than   000 individuals suffered death by hanging—about  000 ayear upon an average this out of a population not half so great as at present   0 of the marriage of queen mary with philip of spain one consequence was—the putting england in this respect upon a level with the continent romebred was the species of law by which the continent was then as now principally governed and under romebred law persons accused of crimes might be apprehended at all times by a statute of philip and mary this power was given to justices of the peace in the case of a criminal suit thus was caption with commitment accelerated still trial remained at an undiminished distance but how inadequate soever to the purpose of deterring others—commitment made in this mode would of itself so long as the incarceration continued give effectual security as against future offences on the part of the same delinquent for     while a man is in jail he cannot commit crime out of it sagacity neither was nor is wanting to perceive this incontestable truth     with this arrangement the contracting parties—judge and co of the one part and the rich and powerful of the other part—were and continue to be well satisfied true it is that upon this plan this so regularly and uniformly applied lot of suffering of about twentysix weeks or fiftytwo weeks applied without regard to quality of guilt is—when in consideration of quality of guilt a few weeks and not more ought to be suffered—applied in addition to those few weeks true it is moreover that it is applied to the innocent who ought not to suffer at all true it is moreover that all this while the innocent part of the thus forcibly mixed company thus dealt with are as the phrase is contaminated and the guilty are occupied in contaminating as well as in being still further contaminated but what care i for all this says to himself noble lord or honourable gentleman none of it can ever fall upon me or any friends of mine no danger is there of our being thus taken up and if we were we should be bailed of course then as to the contamination this could not be put an end to without innovation and that would be out of the fryingpan into the fire besides there is a satisfaction in having thus to talk of contamination as it is the poor alone that are exposed to it it gives a zest to the pleasure we feel in the contempt we pour upon them it magnifies the great gulf which is fixed between them and us such is the almost universally established sentimentality and correspondent language in the upper regions as if by far the most maleficent of contaminations were not that which as hath over and over again been demonstrated in these same upper regions and in particular in the part occupied by judge and co has its source     thus it is that over and above the power of depredation as well as oppression which from the nature of things the rich and powerful as such unavoidably possess at the expense of the poor and helpless—they possess this vast additional power derived how indirectly soever from positive law     by this confederacy it is that the most powerful obstacle to law reform is constituted judge and co having by the price put by them upon what is called justice placed the satisfactive remedy out of the reach of all but the favoured few—noble lords and honourable gentlemen run in debt under the assurance of having it in their power to cheat creditors and thus by the higher orders are the lower orders spoiled as by the israelites the egyptians so completely by a mixture of pride and cupidity is all sense of shame capable of being extinguished that right honourable and noble lords have been heard to say and without contradiction to insist that for small debts in this case there ought to be no remedy why no remedy because affording a remedy against injustice encourages extravagance as if with this or any other encouragement that could be given to extravagance the extravagant could ever be the majority as if without consent on his part wrong in a pecuniary shape could not be done to a man in a variety of ways as if dishonesty were not still worse than extravagance as if whatever were the amount the loss of what is due to him were not a greater evil to any man than the payment of what is due from him to another is     in pursuance of this same policy property in a shape in which noble lords and honourable gentlemen have more of their property than in all other shapes put together is exempted from the obligation of affording the satisfactive remedy—in a word from the obligation of paying debts while property in these other shapes is left subject to it noble lords or honourable gentlemen contract debts and instead of paying them lay out the money in the purchase of land land being exempted from the obligation of being sold for payment creditors are thus cheated noble lords son is too noble honourable gentlemans son too honourable to pay the money but not so to keep the land     for the like reasons mortgages and other charges upon land are not to be in an effectual way by registration or otherwise made knowable why because if they were money of which it were known that if lent it would not be recovered would not be sent extravagance would thus be lessened swindling as above would thus be lessened and in a country in which a man who is rich and not honest receives more respect than a man who is honest and not rich—obtainment of undue respect for opulence not possessed would thus be lessened     for device xiv—result of the fissure—groundless arrests for debt—see the fulllength petition     or  0 supplement to device v oaths necessitated fulllength petition pp     to     abridged petition p     art   —consummation of the mass of evil shown to be produced by this device as above by this one instrument evil is capable of being produced more than by all others put together for by it besides the evil produced by itself eternity is capable of being given to the evil produced by all those others     or    even without this addition sufficient for any ordinary appetite for the pleasure of maleficence should be

liberals—conceive a don ferdinand conceive a don miguel bent upon procuring for himself these two gratifications—either of them or which would save trouble both together—for the accomplishment of these objects added suppose the obligation of making reapplication of those tortures the application of which used to be common for some of these same purposes—nothing can be more easy two formularies for this purpose are already to be had from geography and history he goes to work thus an appropriate oath of the promissory kind is framed all public functionaries take it functionaries administrational—judicial—military all schoolmasters and schoolmistresses take it they administer it—all of them—to their respective boarders and scholars all husbands administer it to their wives all parents to their children who by the form of it stand engaged to transmit it to their children and so on to the latest posterity behold here a sort of estate tail for the barring of which no fine no recovery is available   0 or    dangerous enough in an absolute monarchy of which there are so many examples—it is still more dangerous under a pure aristocracy of which there is one example and under that composed of monarchy and aristocracy of which there is another example a monarch has caprices an aristocracy has no caprices by the monarch of the day the oath imposed one hour may be taken off the next hour the oath imposed by the monarch of one day may be taken off by his successor—the monarch of the next day under an aristocracy relief has no such chance long before the aristocracyridden monarchy of england had begun to lighten the yoke of religious tyranny on the necks of the catholic subjects austrian monarchs had nearly removed it off the necks of their protestant subjects     or    to the extent of the evil produced by this instrument addition may be made day after day and as to duration—if by it the existence of the evil can be secured for two days together so may it be to the end of time     or    those who are so fond of it when employed in giving support to their own sinister interests or prejudices on one part of the field of law—might do well to think how capable it is of being employed against those same interests or prejudices on another part of that same field a radical who wishes to see it continued to be employed against catholicism should have considered how capable it is of being employed against radicalism against radicalism yes or against any the smallest melioration in the form of the government     or    lord castlereagh and lord sidmouth when they enacted the six acts should after making a few more such acts—whatsoever were necessary to complete their plan—have taken this method of giving perpetuity to it without touching the invaluable coronation oath an amendment tacked to it would have done the business at once the heavier the yoke thus laid on the necks of the subject many the more exquisite would then have been the tenderness of all royal consciences     or    will it be said—no formidable as the instrument is the application made of it will never be carried to any such lengths let him that says so say—at what point it is that the application will be sure to stop let him say—at what point the appetite for power will be sure to stop this point found let him say—whether after having reached that point one day it may not go on the next     or    observations these—which by their importance may it is hoped atone for the irregularity committed by the insertion in this place given to them more abridged petition for justice to the honourable the house of commons the petition of the undersigned showeth   that so far as regards the law in general and the constitutional branch in particular the main object of attachment and veneration is—the law called magna charta the earliest of all statutes now recognised as such and upon occasion as such it is spoken of by all legislators and all judges   that although in large proportion the happiness of us all does in truth depend upon the degree of observance given to a certain clause of it yet in respect of that same clause is this same fundamental law grossly notoriously and continually violated violated by all judges who are styled judges and that violation connived at by legislators   that though in and by this clause it is said in so many words—to no one will we delay to no one sell to no one deny justice meaning by justice judges service—the sort of service performed by a judge as such yet is this same justice in all commonlaw equity     and ecclesiastical courts wilfully delayed to all—sold at a vast and extortious price to those who are able to purchase it—and denied to all those who are unable in which sad case are the immense majority of the whole people   that the sale thus made of the service performed by a judge was produced and is continued by the mode in which remuneration was made for such service the matter of such remuneration coming out of the pockets of those by whom alone the benefit of such service was supposed to be reaped and increasing with the number of the official operations performed or falsely said to be performed—and the number and length of the written instruments framed or falsely said to be framed—on the occasion of such service of which remuneration each distinct portion so received is styled a fee   that setting aside the case in which he is paid as by money in the shape of salary without prospect of increase of pay by length of time—there are two modes in which a workman of any sort is paid for the service done by him or supposed to be done one is that in which he is paid for the quantity and quality of the work done or supposed to be done this is called payment by the job and the work is called jobwork the other is that in which he is paid according to the time during which he is occupied or supposed to be occupied in doing the work this is called payment by the time and the work is called timework   that for letting in operations upon operations and written instruments upon written instruments and applications for enlargement of the time—a proportionate quantity of delay has been and is made necessary and here may be seen the sinister interest in which the factitious part of the delay has its source   that in whichsoever mode the payment is made—where in official service there are masters and servants styled superior and subordinate occupied or supposed to be occupied in the same work—there are two modes in which the benefit of such remuneration finds its way into the pockets of the superior—in the present case the judge one according to which each fee is paid to himself the other according to which the fee is paid to the possessor of some office under him of which he has the patronage and that thus it being the interest and put into the power so has it been and continues to be the practice of judges—to raise to the utmost the price paid by the suitors for the service of the subordinates of these same judges   that the same community of sinister interests which in the case of the official class of lawyers has place between superiors and subordinates has place between the whole of the official class and the whole remaining class that is to say the professional their emolument being composed of payment made for service done or supposed to be done to their respective clients—the parties the more suits the one class gets the more suits the other gets and the more money the one gets the more money the other gets upon each suit and thus it is that by the judges to swell their own emoluments to the utmost the suitors who would be sufficiently vexed by the suit without being taxed are taxed three times over by payments to the judges by payments to their subordinates and by payments to the professional lawyers the classes of whom are for the same sinister purpose multiplied without limit and not only without use to but greatly to the detriment of truth and justice   that while thus benefiting themselves by the sale of justice the same judges—by the same means—produce benefit to themselves by the denial of justice for that in so far as a judge saves himself from being called upon to perform his appropriate service without losing money by so doing—he obtains ease and as the total amount of the remuneration depends—partly upon the number of the suits partly upon the amount of profit upon each suit—and the number of the purchasers decreases as the price increases—the price demanded will consequently be always as high as without lessening the total profit by lessening the number of the purchasers it can be made to be here then in the sale of what is called justice as in the sale of goods a constant calculation has at all times been carrying on and that the price is no higher than it is is owing to this—namely that if it were higher more would be lost by the number of the persons prevented from being customers than gained by the extra tax imposed upon those who become customers  0 that thus although in point of morality it is and in point of law it ought to be made the duty of a judge—to make the number of those to whom his service is rendered as great and the service rendered to each as great and as cheap as possible—yet so it is that it having as above been made his interest as well as put into his power to render the number of those to whom his service is rendered as small and the service rendered to each as small and dear as possible—his interest is thus by these arrangements put into a state of opposition to such his moral duty—opposition as complete as possible    that in respect of expense such is the effect of this sinister interest that where money or moneys worth is the subject of dispute—in the commonlaw courts the least amount of the expense is on each side under     the most favourable circumstances upwards of £ 0 while in cases to a large extent it amounts to hundreds of pounds and in the equity courts to much more and by appeal from court to court one above another under different names—it may be and is raised to thousands of pounds in the equity courts to little if anything short of tens of thousands of pounds and this in cases in which under the only mode of procedure really conducive to or aiming at justice of which mode presently the suit would be heard and determined without any expense in the shape of money and at an inconsiderable expense in the shape of time    that in cases of bankruptcy and insolvency matters are so ordered that—in a great not to say the greater part of the individual instances—the persons among whom the greater part not unfrequently the whole of the effects are distributed are—not the creditors but the lawyers—the lawyers of both classes and as if to thicken the confusion and increase the plunderage—insolvency and bankruptcy in themselves the same thing are dealt with by two different sorts of judicatories—examining into the facts in two different sorts of ways upon two different sorts of principles every insolvent having moreover given to him the means of making himself a bankrupt    that in the courts called equity courts matters are so ordered that when a fortune is left for example to a female by a last will so it is that in cases to a large extent she cannot receive it till it has passed through an equity court and the consequence is that if the fortune—say £ 0000—has fallen to her at a period of early infancy and upon the strength of it she has made and received promise of marriage—upon coming of age when she should receive it if at the end of eight years from the death of the testator she has received so much as a penny for her subsistence it is a favourable case for her and by an opponent if he chooses to be at the expense may this delay as witness a trustworthy writer be doubled or trebled the proceeds being in the meantime swallowed up by the judges and their confederates    that by intervals of inaction between one part and another of the same suit—intervals of from eighteen to one hundred and twenty days between term and term and of six months or twelve months between assizes and assizes—matters are so ordered that on the occasion of a penal suit which by proceeding as before a justice of the peace would have been heard and determined in a few minutes—the accused guilty or innocent is confined in a prison for six months or twelve months there to linger before the definitive examination called the trial is performed thus is produced the somuchlamented contamination a disease not least deplored by those to whose profit and those by whose indifference it is suffered to continue all this while if for a single moment injustice sleeps why should justice even in sabbath time if the god of justice forbids not the drawing of an ox or an ass at that time out of a pit—with what reason can he be supposed to forbid the drawing an innocent man woman or child out of a prison or to forbid for a moment any operation necessary or conducive to the prevention suppression or punishment of crimes or to satisfaction for the suffering    that in an equity court an answer—which by proceeding as by a justice of the peace might be brought out in the same minute as that which produced the question—may be made to take five years or more to extract—if he to whom it is put will distribute among the judges and other lawyers the price put upon the delay and in cases to a great extent when the answer is thus obtained all the use made of it is—the enabling a man to give commencement to another suit—a suit at common law the commonlaw judges—whatsoever question they allow to be put to a witness at the trial that is to say towards the conclusion of a suit—not suffering any question to be put to a party at the commencement of that same suit and why even because if they did suits in large proportion would in less than an hour be each of them nipt in the bud—these same individual suits of which in equity the mere commencement may as above be made to last more than five years    that on pain of losing his right—whatsoever may be the value of that same right—this is the course which a man may be obliged to take in order for example to put it to another man to acknowledge or deny his own handwriting—this being the only course which can be taken when no third person—who has seen him write or in any other way is sufficiently acquainted with his handwriting—can be discovered and made to answer commonlaw judges refusing to suffer any such question to be put to any person who is a party to the suit to insincerity thus scandalous on the part of a suitor who is conscious of being in the wrong affording in this way encouragement and reward    that on a proceeding before a justice of the peace or in a smalldebt court the matter of law and the matter of fact on which the demand is grounded are brought forward at the very outset and in many if not most cases the evidence in support of it at the same time and so either at that same time or on as early a day as may be it is in regard to     the defence and here if in any one case this mode of proceeding is in a greater degree than any other that can be employed conducive—not only to the exclusion of needless expense delay and vexation—but moreover to right decision—we humbly entreat the honourable house to consider whether it can be any otherwise in any other case    that in the commonlaw courts—both in cases called criminal or penal and in cases between man and man called civil—so lost are judges to all sense of shame that not only do they carry on but openly avow—yes and in so many words—the practice of giving decisions not grounded on the merits that is to say of deciding contrary to justice for by a judge how is it that justice can be contravened or injustice committed if it be not by purposely deciding otherwise than according to the merits and to this dissoluteness is given the denomination and the praise of strictness and such is the blindness produced by the arts of delusion on the public mind—that this abomination is by nonlawyers commonly supposed to be because by lawyers it is said to be necessary or at any rate conducive to justice    that accordingly it is without scruple that they give one mans whole property to another man for no reason than that some lawyer official or professional or some clerk in the employ of one or other of them or of some third person has inserted in some word material or immaterial in some writing material or immaterial a letter which is or is said to be a wrong one—or has omitted a right one  0 that by the same means and on the same pretence and without any the least symptom of regret they give habitually and constantly impunity to crime in every shape the most mischievous and atrocious not excepted    that for example it was but the other day that a man—who beyond all doubt had cut off the head of a child was at the instance of a judge and for no other reason than that a word in a written instrument had been wrong spelt acquitted by which same means with the approbation of all the judges impunity may at any time by any man in the situation of a lawyers clerk be given to any other man for any crime and under favourable circumstances the crime may be planned and impunity secured to it beforehand    that this practice is the more flagrantly inexcusable—inasmuch as while it is carried on by a commonlaw judge it is not carried on by an equity judge nor unless by accident and in imitation of the bad example so set by superiors is it by a justice of the peace or by a smalldebt court    that on any occasion the same judge who on this or that former occasion has framed his decision on grounds contrary to the merits declines if he pleases to pursue this course and makes a merit of so doing that in this way any set of these judges may—under the direction as usual and in compliance with the will of the chief—give the thing in question—the estate or the money—to whichever of two men he pleases by which means without possibility of discovery corruption to any amount may on the part of judges in any number have had place    that by all judges who are commonly styled judges—commonlaw judges as well as equity judges not to speak of others who are not so styled mendacity in one shape or other is—openly as well as habitually—licensed rewarded necessitated and practised and by these same judges by such mendacity is filthy lucre knowingly and wilfully obtained    that by habit to such a degree is all shame for the practice of so scandalous a vice extinguished—that when a criminal who conscious of his being guilty confesses himself so to be—the judge as a matter of course by persuasion purposely applied engages him to declare himself not guilty as if supposing it desirable that other proof should be made it could not as well be made without that lie as with it    that in like manner what frequently happens is—that when no one entertaining the least doubt of the mans guilt he is accordingly by the jury about to be declared guilty—the judge by persuasion purposely applied engages them to declare him not guilty and—so wretchedly by thoughtless excess in the punishment has the law been contrived—the law or that which passes for such—meaning the common law in contradistinction to the statute law—that in the individual instance more evil is perhaps excluded by abatement in that same excess than produced by the immorality and the insubordination thus exemplified    that in common law under the name of judges and in equity under the name of masters in chancery—judges have been and habitually continue to be in the practice of exacting fees for operations never performed for attendances for example never paid thus adding extortion to fraud at the same time not merely admitting but compelling the lawyers of the parties to be sharers in the same guilt thus multiplying the expense to the suitors for the sake of the profit to the lawyers—and this abomination—though brought to their view by evidence which they have caused to be printed—the commissioners appointed for the purpose of perpetuating on pretence of abrogating abuses—have together with the abovementioned and so many other abuses suffered to pass without     calling for its abrogation—and without censure or token of disapprobation    that under the system thus faithfully howsoever imperfectly delineated—every man who is to a certain degree wealthy has it completely in his power to ruin any other man who is to a certain degree less wealthy than himself at the expense of a proprietor—whether the property be in the possession of the one or the other—gratification may thus be given by the wealthy man to his avarice at the expense of any man proprietor or nonproprietor to his avarice or to his groundless hatred or vengeance the poorer the victim the less time and money will the gratification thus afforded to the oppressor cost him in the lawyers of all classes and more especially in the judges—on condition of distributing among them the requisite sums in the established proportions—he will on this as on other occasions behold and find his everready instruments    that accordingly under such judges and such laws security for whatsoever is most dear to man—property power reputation personal comfort condition in life life itself—is an empty name—witness in regard to all real property the printed declaration of an honest lawyer whose name is so happily to be found on the list of the commissioners appointed to make report to the honourable house on that subject no title says he in so many words at present can be considered as perfectly safe—and it is by the sinister interest herein holden up to view that this as well as the other portions of the law have been brought to this pass  0 that to keep the door shut as close as possible against all endeavours to apply to that system of disorder and maleficence any effectual remedy—pains are constantly taken to induce the persuasion that of all these disorders the cause is to be found—not in human maleficence but in the unchangeable nature of things—but in any such notion what degree of truth there is we leave it—after the exposure thus made—we leave it to all men to imagine and we humbly leave it to the honourable house to pronounce    that should it be affirmed that this our humble representation is exaggerated and in proof of its being so should it be asked—how if the provision made for the support of rights and exclusion of wrongs were no better than as above represented society could be kept together—should this be asked the answer is—that it would not be kept together but for three things namely  st the circumstance—that the man of law though from delinquency in the shape of fraud from which in his view of it he has little or nothing to fear—he has more to profit than to suffer—yet as to crimes of violence—under the impossibility of providing protection for himself without extending it to the community at large—he feels it his interest to do more or less towards the exclusion of them— d the guardian influence of public opinion under favour of that liberty precarious as it is which the press is left in possession of— d and last an expectation—though produced by delusion in spite of experience—that on each occasion will be done that which ought to be done or something to the like effect on which last account we cannot but acknowledge that it were better the delusion should continue were it not that it is not possible that the disorder should any further than it is laid open receive any effectual remedy    finally in regard to the so oftenmentioned summary system which is of course represented by lawyers and thence regarded by others as having nothing but dispatch to recommend it we humbly insist and challenge them to disprove it that for rectitude of decision and thence for giving execution and effect to the law in all its parts—it is far better adapted—not only than the system styled regular but moreover than any other that can be named    we therefore humbly pray—that with such extensions and other amendments as may be found requisite—this same system of summary procedure may be universally established—a judiciary establishment suited to the application of it instituted—and the system styled regular completely extirpated    for further particulars of the grievance and the main cause of it but more especially of the remedy—we take the liberty humbly to refer the honourable house to the forms of petition intituled fulllength petition for justice abridged petition for justice and petition for codification—all bearing the name of jeremy bentham who thereby has made himself throughout responsible for the correctness of the statements therein contained and to those who cannot find time for the perusal we leave it to imagine and say—whether a man by whom a life of more than fourscore years has been passed without spot and more than sixty of them employed on works on legislation which in every part of the civilized world are known and regarded with approbation—would on a subject and occasion of such importance—in the face of that same world lightly hazard any assertion without some substantial ground     supplement which may be added or not to any one of the three or any other proposed petition section i corruption—its imputability to english judges   corruption is generally spoken of as the ne plus ultra of depravity in a judge by englishmen the english are commonly spoken of as forming in respect of clearness from this stain an honourable contrast with the judges of other countries after reference made to what is above we entreat those whom it may concern and the honourable house in more especial manner to consider—whether either corruption or something still worse is not beyond dispute with few or no exceptions but too justly imputable to english judges for—if denial and sale of justice with profit by the amount of the sale be not corruption or something still worse what is   like other trades—the trade which may with propriety be termed the trade of corruption may be carried on—either in the retail or in the wholesale way in the retail way when it is at the charge of individuals only that it is carried on in the wholesale way when it is at the charge of hundreds of thousands and millions that it is carried on by sale of justice at the charge of tens of thousands with benefit in the shape of pecuniary profit by denial of justice at the charge of millions with benefit in the shape of ease   by the word corruption only in that which has just been styled the retail mode is the thing itself commonly brought to view in this case the conception formed of the magnitude of the evil produced is naturally much exaggerated cause of the exaggeration this in so far as carried on in the retail mode whatsoever intercourse has place on the occasion is of course carried on in secret by the secresy suspicion and that on the most incontestable grounds is excited facts though it were in small number transpiring by accident—especially when other persons of note are concerned in them or affected by them—suffice to produce in the public mind the conception—that the instances in which it has place are much more numerous than in reality they are under governments and in judicatories in which means of corruption producing profit by money or moneys worth received in the direct way have place—the probable number of these instances is not very great why because in this case the receiver must put himself in the power of the giver and because a proposed giver will not without such a sum in his hands as will he thinks suffice to outweigh the fear of the risk in the mind of the judge incur the risk of being delivered over to punishment by that same judge   in a direct way in the shape of money small indeed comparatively speaking is the probability that on the part of an english judge corruption should have place why because so far as concerns reputation—by a judge a bribe could not be received in a direct way without his putting himself as above in the power of the bribegiver but indirect ways there are in which no such danger has place—where for example it is not the judge but a connexion of the judges that receives the benefit in question—and that from a connexion of the party especially if it be in the shape—not of money but for example of a lucrative office or a lucrative bargain   note here that on the part of a judge as on the part of any other man—where in this or any other shape misconduct has place—the amount of the evil in all shapes taken together being given it matters not what has been the motive in the case of a judge—besides selfregarding interest in respect of money or moneys worth at the hands of individuals—temptations to the operation of which his probity stands exposed are—selfregarding interest in respect of desire of the matter of good in that and other shapes at the hands of government together with sympathy and antipathy as towards individuals or classes of any sort—on whatever account—private or public now then—to corruption—if corruption is the name to be given to misconduct otherwise than from blameless misconception—to corruption in the retail mode from all these sources the probity of the judge stands more or less exposed—in all countries and in all judicatories why because by all these efficient causes misconduct in any shape may on the part of a functionary in that as in any other situation be made to have place without need of intercourse with any other individual and this unless circumstantial evidence be received as sufficient without possibility of its being for the purpose of censure proved either in a legal tribunal or even in the tribunal of public opinion   thus it is that in respect of corruption carried on by functionaries in all situations   0 in the retail mode england is not much otherwise than upon a footing with other countries while in respect of the corruption trade carried on by judges in the wholesale way as above she is altogether unrivalled   without any the smallest fear of punishment—without even any considerable fear if any at all of any such disrepute as he is capable of being influenced by—an english judge on a question in which the ruling one or the subruling few are supposed by him to take an interest may commit injustice to any amount in favour of that side without danger of any such disrepute for two reasons—  because at the hands of all with whom he is in the habit of passing his time or is in any particular way connected—instead of disapprobation approbation is the sentiment he will make sure of experiencing   because in the situation of a judge—partiality in favour of that side is so general not to say universal and is the result of influence notoriously so irresistible that on the part even of those who suffer by it slight is the degree of disapprobation which it calls forth a mere nothing in comparison of that which would have place if it were by hard money to the same value that it was produced   in the case of an alleged libel for example against a government functionary as such—what man is there that ever expects that the chiefjustice will fail to do his utmost to procure the conviction of the alleged libeller—or on the prosecution of a justice of peace to screen him from punishment if indictment be the mode the jury will be directed accordingly if information the impunity will as far as possible be conferred at an earlier stage—the rule will be refused the established maxim about motives—no conviction without proof of a corrupt motive—being of itself equivalent to a statute law granting impunity to every abuse of power on the part of every individual placed in that same office a justice of peace supposing it possible that punishment be his desire would not be indulged with it for by the example of his punishment delinquency on the part of others— 000 and more acting in that same office—might be more or less checked not to speak of official men in other offices whether below him on a level with him or even above him in as far as in that office a man is deterred from abuse of its powers—it is by fear—not of conviction a disaster to which he does not stand exposed but of prosecution to which whatsoever can be done for him he cannot but remain exposed at the hands of any such adequately opulent individuals in whose breast resentment has so far got the upper hand of prudence   as to incorruptibility and independence—under matchless constitution every judge is on every occasion acted upon by that same matter of corruption of which the fountain springs from behind the throne he alone excepted who for himself has nothing to wish for nor has relation friend or enemy what then but either deceiver or deceived can any be by whom in the situation of an english judge any such quality as independence is said to have place two laws—made both of them by these same judges who never make any law—two laws—either of them much more both of them together not to speak of the fullest assurance at the hands of legislators of which presently suffice to keep banished from the mind of an english judge all apprehension of punishment in any shape for anything done in the exercise of his power one is—that which enables a public man to whom misconduct is imputed to bring down punishment on the head of the imputer without exposing himself on that occasion to any such unpleasant accident as that of hearing the truth of the imputation proved out of the adversarys or any other mouth the other is that which preserves him from the still more unpleasant accident of hearing it proved out of his own mouth where the procedure is by information true it is—that in some instances the court has refused to grant what is called the rule namely the rule by which it is suffered to go on without an affidavit denying the truth of the imputation but for preserving an oppressed complainant from being punished instead of the oppressor what would this practice do were it ever so sure to be adhered to just nothing whether any judge whose pleasure it has been to receive a bribe will have received the bribegiver with a third person in his hand to bear witness of the transaction may be left to be imagined and without such third person the evidence of the bribegiver will go for nothing for forasmuch as to conviction in case of perjury two evidences are made necessary a licence is thereby granted to every person to commit perjury wherever no evidence in addition to the testimony of one witness has had place but suppose an extraordinary case similar or other evidence not only in existence but obtainable on the strength of which it is possible that conviction may take place how stand the relative situations of the parties against conviction of the doubly guilty functionary guilty of the original oppression or depredation guilty of the perjury committed for the purpose of transferring all punishment from the injurer to the injured the chances are several to one while to the oppressed or plundered accuser or other prosecutor punishment is applied to a certainty punishment that is to say pecuniary punishment and this to an amount not ascertainable beforehand but frequently not less than some hundreds of pounds true it is that in this case not punishment but costs is the     name given to it but whether by this change of denomination any abatement be made in the suffering produced by the thing denominated may be left to be imagined true it is again—a mode there is in which if a judge or any other functionary or any other person by whom oppression depredation or any other crime has been committed wishes to see it exposed to public view—he is at liberty to put in for the indulgence this is the mode by action for in this case the alleged libeller—the defendant—is left at liberty to prove the truth of the imputation which if he does the criminal whose guilt has thus been proved obtains no damages and perhaps pays costs but somehow or other a desire of this sort is not very commonly entertained not that in all cases the guilt of the prosecutor is thus demonstrated by the mode of prosecution chosen by him for where as in the cases of indictment and information the suit is of that sort in which punishment is applied under the name of punishment to the author of the injury—and no compensation given directly and avowedly to the sufferer by the injury—in this case the testimony of the sufferer is admitted and not only so but as capable of being taken for sufficient without corroboration from any extraneous evidence but in the case in question extraneous evidence and that adequate never can be wanting it is given by every man by whom a copy of the alleged libel has been purchased accordingly if any such criminal act is imputed to a man to any man and in particular to a judge—he will proceed by one sort of suit or another according as he is guilty or not guilty if not guilty he proceeds by action if guilty he proceeds by indictment or information by information—either in the ordinary way or by information in the ex officio way in the ex officio way that is to say by the mere act if obtainable of the attorneygeneral without application for leave made in public to the court this being the case—if it be in any one of these three lastmentioned ways that he proceeds—to what a degree he exposes his character to suspicion not to say gives it up is sufficiently obvious section ii other sources of opposition to law reform   if it be of use that in the situation of udge the opposition of interest to duty under the existing system should be held up to view—not less so can it be in the case of those by whom the conduct of all judges is determinable   on this occasion may be seen two conflicting interests by which the minds or legislators are everywhere operated upon legislators and the ruling few in general to which class belong of course the judges whose case comes on this account a second time under consideration of these same conflicting interests the one acting in accordance with the official duty the other in opposition to it   first as to duty in respect of the main end of justice namely maximization of the execution and effect given to the several existing laws by whomsoever made to the legislator for the time being if to anybody belongs assuredly this duty in the character of a moral duty necessary to the fulfilment of which as there has so often been occasion to observe is prevention not only of misdecision but of nondecision where and in such sort as decision is necessary to the production of that same effect so likewise in respect of the collateral ends of justice namely minimization of expense delay and vexation   thus much for duty but as to interest unfortunately in the breast of the legislator as well as in that of the judge as such—against that interest which is in accordance with duty fight other interests which stand in opposition to it interests in accordance with duty those which belong to him in common with all other members of the community interests in discordance with and in opposition to duty all those which being peculiar to the few cannot be promoted but at the expense of those of the other members of that same community in a word of the subjectmany   so much for conflicting interests now for law in the aggregate body of the laws some there will always be by which the promotion of the interests of both sections—that of the subjectmany and that of the ruling few—will have been endeavoured at and in a greater or less degree compassed others again there will be by which the interests of the ruling few will be promoted or be endeavoured to be promoted at the expense of those of the subjectmany others again by which the interests of the subjectmany will be promoted or be endeavoured to be promoted at the expense of the particular interests or supposed interests of the ruling few   so much for legislators at large enter now in conjunction such of them as are lawyers and lawyers at large official and professional both in one and professional at large looked up to all of them by legislators as their advisers these being the only persons who can so much as profess to have any general acquaintance with the law as it is—thence it but too naturally comes to pass—that as often as any proposal for the     melioration of the system is brought forward—the opinion by them declared is as of course referred to as that on which the determination respecting acceptance or rejection shall be grounded but it being in the highest degree their interest that it shall be in a state as opposite to the interest of the people in respect of the abovementioned ends of justice as possible—and whatever it be as little known as possible—of course so it is that supposing any such change proposed as affords a promise of rendering it conformable to the ends of justice whatever knowledge each man possesses is applied—not to the promotion but to the prevention of it prevention of it—by any means and in any way in an open and direct way or in a disguised and indirect way in particular by the promotion of such narrow improvements apparent or even real so they be—either by unadaptability or by their narrowness and the consequent length of time requisite for their establishment—obstructive of all adequate as well as beneficial change   accordingly when a plan has been brought forward having for its object the establishment of an allcomprehensive uniform and selfconsistent rule of action—conducive in endeavour at least in the highest degree possible to the happiness of the whole community taken together—and this at the earliest time possible—little less than universal have been the anxiety and the conjunct endeavour to frustrate its design for this purpose silence being at once the most commodious and the most efficacious has been the means generally resorted to the most efficacious forasmuch as by declared opposition attention would be drawn to the subject and to the validity of the arguments in favour of the plan and the futility of the ablest and strongest arguments capable of being brought against it would be the more extensively perceived   hence it is—that under the existing system—while on the part of judges not only acts of wilful omission to give execution and effect to the law have place but acts are committed by which the authority of the will declared by the legislature is avowedly overruled—so perfectly undisturbed is the tranquillity manifested by legislators in cases in which no particular detriment to the particular interests of the ruling few is perceptible as plenary as can be wished is the indulgence in these cases these hired servants of the law are left to obey it or break it as is most agreeable to them   parliament enacts one thing equity rules or acts the opposite thing the earl of mansfield ablest as well as most zealous absolutist that since the aristocratical revolution ever sat upon an english bench—had for use a word admirably adapted to this purpose according to him statutes singly or in any number were on each occasion to be taken in hand and moulded  0 thus on a commonlaw bench and in equity the earl of eldon though without the use of the word was not backward in declaredly following the example as for apprehension no very strong sensation of this sort could reasonably be entertained by a lord eldon sitting in his court of equity of the same lord eldon sitting in judgment on his own conduct in his house of lords now for above these four years has indication of this mode of ruling by vigour over the law been before the eyes of the public there it is and who cares just as much the tories out of place as the tories in place    connected with this prominent and undeniable interest may be seen another particular and sinister interest which though so much less extensively shared will by its latentcy and the consequent appearance of disinterestedness naturally operate in the sinister direction with still greater force this is the interest of the exlawyer interest affected and feared for by the lawyer in office or practice pecuniary interest interest affected and feared for by the exlawyer interest created by regard for reputation reputation of appropriate wisdom wellgrounded altogether is this fear it must be confessed for proportioned to the acknowledged beneficialness and extent of any such beneficial change will be sure to be the real folly which has all along been covered by the veil of apparent and boasted wisdom occupied—first in the study of this system then in the acting under it and all along in the magnification of it the labour of a long life—and now after all and all at once a compound of mischievousness and absurdity is found to be the character of it what a shock to vanity and pride    not merely in proportion to the change

himself upon vanished    in the train of these sinister interests come interestbegotten prejudice and authoritybegotten prejudice but of these sources of opposition to whatsoever is at once useful and new—in one place or another so continually recurring has been the need—and with the need the act—of making mention—that every further mention of them here may well be spared    such being the exposure made of the opposing causes now for its practical uses uses of it may be seen two—one is showing that taking the existing system all together     no proof of its fitness to exist is declarable from its having thus long been in existence    the other use is—showing that against no one distinguishable article of the hereproposed system or of any proposed system—to any declared opinion of any individual belonging to any one of those same classes so far as it seeks to operate in favour of the existing system should any weight be attributed—any regard be paid on the contrary it should be looked upon as an argument in favour of that system to which the opposition is made in favour of it and for this reason with this subject as with every other the better acquainted a man is and the greater his appropriate ability the better able will he be to bring forward whatsoever relevant arguments in support of his declared opinions the nature of the case affords and the stronger the reliance placed by him on the effect looked for from his mere opinion the stronger the evidence of the consciousness of the depravity of the system and the weakness of all arguments producible in favour of it    to conclude in this state of things if from the pressure of the enormous and perennial load of misery from which relief is hereby endeavoured to be obtained any such relief is to be expected—it must be at the hands of one or other of three distinguishable descriptions of men in the situation of legislators one in which a sense of moral duty has place and that same sense strong enough to constitute an effective cause of action another that to which it appears that its own particular interest is so bound up with the general weal as to have more to gain than to suffer from the substitution of the good system to the bad one the third and last that in which a salutary fear in sufficient strength has place the fear lest wearied by the oppression and enlightened at length by the information received as to the causes and the authors of it—the subjectmany should in sufficient number concur in doing for themselves what ought to have been done for them and in so doing cease to exhibit that compliance by and in proportion to which all power is constituted still before this supplement is concluded a few more articles particularly the fifth and last of them may it is hoped

it is by the privilege of granting the rules to prisoners that the marshal realises the greater portion of his income which is said to amount in the gross to from £ 0000 to £ 0000 the charge for the

the feefed lawyers cruel sports    of these sham convictions of rebellion—if persevered in with the practical consequences deduced from them—what more apposite requital than a real and successful one     petition for codification the petition of the undersigned humbly showeth—that in so far as our respective consciences will allow we entertain the sincerest disposition to conform ourselves in all things to the good pleasure of those who are set in authority over us that when by any of us a wish is expressed to know what that pleasure is he is bid to look to the law of the land that when a man asks what that same law is he learns that there are two parts of it that the one is called statute law and the other common law and that there are books in which these same two parts are to be found that when a man asks in what book the statute law is to be found he learns that so far from being contained in any one book howsoever large it fills books composing a heap greater than he would be able to lift that if he thereupon asks in which of all these books he could upon occasion lay his hands and find those parts in which he himself is concerned without being be wildered with those in which he has no concern—what he learns is—that the whole matter is so completely mixed up together that for him to pick out the collection of those same parts from the rest is utterly impossible that if he asks in what book the common law is to be found he learns that the collection of the books in which on each occasion search is to be made for it are so vast that the house he lives in would scarcely be sufficient to contain it that if he asks who it is that the statute law is made by he is told without difficulty that it is by king lords and commons in parliament assembled that if in continuation we proceed any of us to ask who it is that the common law has been made by we learn to our inexpressible surprise that it has been made by nobody that it is not made by king lords and commons nor by anybody else that the words of it are not to be found anywhere that in short it has no existence it is a mere fiction and that to speak of it as having any existence is what no man can do without giving currency to an imposture when upon observing that by every judge it is spoken of as a reality and that he professes to be acting under it we ask whether it is not he that makes it we are told that this is what no judge ever does and that by any of the learned judges a question what part of the law is of his making would be received with indignation and resented as a calumny that when seeing men put to death and otherwise grievously punished by order of judges a man asks by what authority this is done he learns that it is by the authority of statute law or common law as it may happen and if he thereupon asks whether when it is upon the authority of the common law that the judge does this it is not by this same judge that this same common law is made he still receives the same assurance—that no judge ever makes law and that a question what part of the law is of his making would be received with indignation and resented as a calumny while the truth is—that on each occasion the rule to which a judge gives the force of law is one which on this very occasion he makes out of his own head and this—not till the act for which the man is thus dealt with has been done while by these same judges if the same thing were done by the acknowledged legislature it would be spoken of as an act of flagrant injustice designated and reprobated in their language by the name of an ex post facto law all this while we are told that we have rights given to us and we are bid to be grateful for those rights we are told that we have duties prescribed to us and we are bid to be punctual in the fulfilment of all those duties and so we are told we must be if we would save ourselves from being visited with condign punishment hearing this we would really be grateful for these same rights if we knew what they were and were able to avail ourselves of them but to avail ourselves of rights of which we have no knowledge being in the nature of things impossible we are utterly unable to learn—for what as well as to whom to pay the socalledfor tribute of our gratitude as to these same duties we would endeavour at least to be punctual in the fulfilment of them if we knew but what they were but to be punctual in the fulfilment of duties the knowledge of which is kept concealed from us is equally impossible that which is but too possible and too frequently experienced by us is the being thus punished for not doing that which it has thus been rendered impossible for us to do thus while the rights we are bid to be grateful for are mere illusions the punishments we are made to undergo are sad realities finally thus it is that we who in so far as such oppression admits of our being so are     his majestys dutiful and loyal subjects are dealt with as were the children of israel under their egyptian taskmasters we hear of tyrants and those cruel ones but whatever we may have felt we have never heard of any tyrant in such sort cruel as to punish men for disobedience to laws or orders which he had kept them from the knowledge of we have heard much of cruelties practised by slaveholders upon those who are called their slaves but so far as regards the mode of treatment we thus experience—whatever be the cruelties practised upon them never have we heard this to be of the number of those cruelties the negro so long as he does what he is commanded to do and abstains from doing that which he is forbidden to do—the negro—slave as he is is safe in this respect his condition is an object of envy to us and we pray that it may be ours we have heard not a little of the pains taken by the honourable house in the endeavour to put an end to those same cruelties we cannot refuse to any such endeavour the humble tribute of our applause but we hope we are not altogether unreasonable in our wish to receive from the hands of the honourable house the benefit of the like endeavours that which for this purpose we have need of need we say it is a body of law from the respective parts of which we may each of us by reading them or hearing them read learn and on each occasion know what are his rights and what his duties the framing of any such body of law cannot indeed but be a work of time this is what we are fully sensible of but the sooner it is begun the sooner will it have been completed and the longer the commencement of it is deferred the more difficult will be the completion of it completed indeed it cannot be and of this too we are fully sensible otherwise than by the king and the lords in conjunction with your honourable house but to the taking in hand this most important of all works there is a preparatory operation which we have been assured and verily believe is within not only the power but the practice of the house—of the house acting in its single capacity and by its sole authority this is what we hereby pray for and it is as follows—   that the house in and by its votes may be pleased to give invitation to all persons so disposed to send in each of them a plan of an allcomprehensive code followed by the text thereof this text either the whole of it at the same time or in successive portions as he may find most convenient   that for indemnifying each such contributor from the expense of printing the house may be pleased to give authority to him to send in such his work in manuscript to any person authorised by the house to print its proceedings that is to say for the purpose and subject to the limitation hereinafter mentioned under the assurance that the same will be printed along with the other proceedings of the house in like manner as acts of parliament are at present   as to the persons of such contributors we humbly insist that from the liberty of sending in draughts for this purpose no person should stand excluded no not any person whatsoever for suppose for example a foreigner to send in a draught better adapted to the purpose than any draught sent in by any of his majestys subjects—we see not why his being so should debar us from the benefit of it and assuredly we see not any reason whatever for any such apprehension as that by the honourable house the circumstance of the draughtsmans being a foreigner should ever cause a less welladapted draught to be employed and sanctioned in preference to a better adapted one   as to the expense that might be eventually attendant on the printing of such draughts it is no more than we are perfectly aware of but there are two arrangements which taken together we cannot but rely on as sufficient to reduce within a moderate compass the amount of that expense   one is that it be an instruction to every contributor that no such contributor shall receive the benefit of the accommodation thus afforded unless to each article or set of articles in his proposed code the reason or set of reasons by which it was suggested on which it is grounded and to which it trusts for its explanation and reception be appended   the other is—that by the honourable house power be reserved to itself by the hands of any person or persons for that purpose thereto appointed—to put a stop at any time to the printing of any such draught after which should the impression be continued it will be at the contributors own expense but that to assist him in the faculty of thus making a virtual appeal to public opinion such part of his draught as shall have been already printed shall be delivered to him to be disposed of as he shall think fit as to the obligation of attaching the abovementioned rationale we trust to it as a powerful incentive to the framing and sending in wellgrounded draughts as well as a powerful instrument for keeping the service unincumbered with illgrounded and editor illegible word ones to frame a proposed code editor illegible word editor illegible word with apt reasons all along for its support is in our eyes the most arduous as well as the most useful of all purely human tasks that the human faculties can employ themselves upon and proportioned to this our persuasion     is of course our desire—that without any exception the door should remain open to all contributors as above while on the other hand to frame proposed laws destitute of such support is what no hand that can give motion to a pen would feel to be out of its power it is what not we alone but our mothers and our grandmothers likewise would be capable of doing and might peradventure be disposed to do and it is we have sometimes heard no altogether uncommon sight to see hands little better qualified thus occupied to each such contribution should be attached a name and address this not for the purpose of determining the authorship for that might be left to each ones desire but for the purpose of responsibility in the case of any inapplicable matter sent in for the purpose of derision by persons engaged by sinister interest in the endeavour to render the measure abortive as to remuneration we humbly insist that none—in any shape other than that of the eventual honour of distinction and public approbation with the benefits which in so many shapes in amounts proportioned to the degrees of it cannot but be among the fruits of such approbation—ought to be allotted to any work so sent in so far from promoting any such remuneration could not but operate in counteraction to its proposed object as above it would operate as a notice of exclusion to every man who could not regard himself as situated within the sphere of personal favour and the higher the reward the greater would be the number of those who would regard themselves as thus excluded we beg to be believed giving as we do our assurance to the honourable house that it is not to any such purpose as that of seeing so much as proposed much less effected any change in the hands in which the supreme power of government is lodged that this our humble petition is directed and accordingly what we not only consent to but wish and desire is that out of the field of the proposed otherwise allcomprehensive code all those parts which regard the prerogative of the king the privileges of the several members of the two houses of parliament collectively and severally possessed and the consideration of the hands in which the elective function is placed be excepted unless it be—that for the sake of symmetry and completeness expression be on those several subjects given to the law as it is or is conceived to be it being understood that by the expression so given to matter of this description the draughtsman is not understood to express either approbation or disapprobation in relation to any part of it     lord brougham displayed including i boa constrictor alias helluo curiarum ii observations on the bankruptcy court bill now ripened into an act iii extracts from proposed constitutional code by jeremy bentham first published in editor illegible word   0 boa constrictor alias helluo curiarum speech of lord chancellor brougham as printed in the morning chronicle of friday september  d      in the article headed court of chancery on announcing his resolved on absorption of the courts of the vicechancellor and the master of the rolls into that of the lord high chancellor the lord chancellor sat this morning to deliver the few judgments which remained to be pronounced on matters which had been previously argued before him and having disposed of them his lordship addressed the bar to the following effect—it is a great satisfaction to me in taking my leave of the bar and of the suitors to know that i have been able to dispose of all the arrears of the business of this court and that there are no appeals unheard no petitions unanswered and no causes now unheard except those which are not ready and which have been put upon the files of the court subsequent to last june it is a very great relief to the court—it will be a very great relief to the bar—it will be a very great relief to professional men as i know it will be a very great relief to the suitors—for them to feel that they shall have their business henceforward going regularly on not incumbered by arrears and not having their minds oppressed with the harassing prospect of never getting through their business in the course of next term the benefit of all this will be felt and it will be found that the time has been well bestowed which we have been lately occupying though it may have pressed hard upon the bar upon suitors and upon other professional men who have been anxiously attending the court it has pressed hard also on the court but i have been willing to bear that pressure knowing well that the public will feel the full benefit next term it was said to a great man the most illustrious of all my predecessors that he allowed the pressure of business upon him to be more than he could bear to which he replied the duties of life are more than life memorable words to be had in everlasting remembrance by all men who serve their country the kindness and attention i have received from the bar are such as to require my most grateful acknowledgments which i now respectfully offer i beg leave to add that i have now the most sanguine hopes of being able to relieve his honour the vicechancellor from hearing the greater part of causes such as those which have been heard by him since the year      the appeals which i have disposed of within these few months have been   0 of those  0  have been fully argued and decided—indeed all of them except miller v travers which stands for the opinion of the two judges who assisted me in it the time taken in the arguments upon the appeals the average time being several hours to each shows that every one of them were cases of importance and that there has been no short cause heard by way of appeal before me this has been the cause of the length of time that has been occupied in getting through the long and heavy arrear—the arrear of years when i look into this statement i find also that in the proportion of six to four or of three to two are the number of appeals from his honour the vicechancellor to those coming from his honour the master of the rolls—arising no doubt from the great number of causes decided in the vicechancellors court and from that circumstance only it is clear therefore that at least three months of the time of this court would have been entirely saved if that arrangement could have been made which foreseeing this i propounded but unsuccessfully propounded when i came into the court i thought that every cause which was either of some importance in point of value or difficulty in point of law or of fact that came before their honours the master of the rolls and the vicechancellor almost inevitably found its way here by appeal—and generally certainly in the majority of cases only led to great expense great delay and great inconvenience whether there should ultimately be an affirmance or reversal i proposed therefore that all causes of difficulty and importance in point of value or from the law as applying     to them should at once be transferred here and heard by me as thereby the inevitable appeal would be averted the event has justified my prospective conjecture and leads me now to form the plan which i shall certainly adopt—namely that of transferring at once the bulk of that business into this court such a result was long ago foreseen by eminent men it was the opinion of sir samuel romilly—a most venerable name—it was the opinion of sir john leach then a member of parliament and of many others that the erection of a court for his honour the vicechancellor would have among other things the effect of increasing litigation and that a mass of business which did not then exist in chancery would be added to the business of the court how far that conjecture has been proved by experience must be visible to all men since    out of the  0  contested appeals were from his honour the vicechancellor and have taken up three months constant laborious and expensive attendance to all the parties concerned if however that arrangement can be made which i look forward confidently to accomplishing i shall then deem it to be my duty to give to the suitor the full benefit in all difficult and important cases of having three judges instead of one to hear their causes if this cannot be done by the law as it now stands i trust the legislature will assist me in effecting it my opinion is that it can be done without altering or adding to the law as it now stands i have the power at present to ask for the attendance of any or all the judges in westminster hall and i know not why i should not have the power of asking to be assisted by the presence of the master of the rolls and vicechancellor when necessity requires other chancellors have had the master of the rolls to sit for them when absent i have never required that and i trust i never shall but i think i may have the assistance of their honours on hearing causes of extraordinary difficulty and importance the bulk of the cases that are appealed from are not of extraordinary difficulty or importance but in all cases of that class the suitor shall have the benefit of the other equity judges being present there are two or three branches of judicature in which the presence of three judges is infinitely better than that of one first when conflicting facts are to be discussed or conflicting evidence to be heard a jury is the best forum for such a case—a single judge is perhaps the worst but three men with minds variously constituted are much more likely to come to a satisfactory conclusion than a single individual the next is where anything like discretion is to be exercised either in awarding damages or saying what costs are to be paid which is often a very important or not unfrequently difficult and delicate inquiry as too many cases are brought and kept up merely for the sake of the costs the duty of the judge there is somewhat like that of assessing damages and in the exercise of such discretion it is better to have three judges than one last of all where there are great and difficult and important points of law and equity to be settled it is much more satisfactory to suitors and to the profession which cultivates the sciences to have that law considered and settled by more judges than one these then are the considerations which principally move me to the adoption of the resolution i have formed but at the same time that i stop the great bulk of business going before his honour the vicechancellor i shall not deem it necessary to recommend elsewhere that any step should be taken at present to terminate his court though in the   d year of george iii it was expected that it would end in getting through the arrears though we have now got through the arrears i do not yet see my way to that which as an ultimate result must be deemed highly desirable his honour the master of the rolls is more sanguine as to the speedy accomplishment of it than i am but still i do not shut out from my mind the indulgence of the hope that i may see its termination at no very distant period as long however as that court shall continue to exist i shall endeavour to avail myself in all difficult and important cases of the assistance of that most learned excellent and able judge in this court i have said thus much because i thought it fit before terminating business to let the profession know it was not for nothing that i had imposed on them the hardship of these long and painful sittings—sittings however not much later—only two days later than lord eldon has sat for he having sat to the   th of august i have sat only two days longer at the same time i admit that though i have sat only two days later than usual yet i have sat many more hours in the course of the day and i am aware of the embarrassments and inconveniences that this may have caused i am not however aware that its tendency has been to abridge arguments in any case for i am sure i have endeavoured to show as much patience as any man could possess that i might not indicate the slightest indisposition to hear the longes arguments even where i have thought argument superfluous i have hardly ever stopped the reply in cases where i have been in favour of the side on which the reply was to be made and still more rarely have i disposed of cases on hearing one side only i therefore cannot charge myself with having got rid of this arrear and accomplishing this dispatch at the expense of curtailing the hearing of causes the best proof in the world of this is that one of the last i heard took up eight hours     the one preceding it took seven hours and another immediately before it took six hours three causes therefore took upwards of twentyone hours in being argued at the conclusion of the sittings which surely is a proof that there was no great desire on my part to curtail the arguments or not to hear counsel the profession therefore and the bar i am sure will rejoice as well as myself when we find we have not attended in vain while we very soon shall witness the benefit conferred upon the country by having got rid of this accumulation of business and also in the prospective arrangement touching the vicechancellors court to prevent delay and unnecessary expense to raise the character of the courts of justice in this country and to answer the arguments used by persons unconnected with them—arguments so frequently levelled against the legal profession at large the profession will feel not only that comfort and peace increased but even their own character exalted in conclusion i have to state that as long as i remain in town which must be for some weeks longer i shall devote one day in every week—saturdays—to hear motions i shall hear them in the private room and i entreat suitors not to depend on counsel who are absent or to get counsel to remain in town for the purpose but to take such counsel as are in town i have made inquiry and i find that there will be several counsel of the greatest ability remaining and i will hear them upon any motions by consent provided notice be given on the wednesday preceding to one of my officers i have directed an order to be made to that effect i do not mean to make any private arrangements a consideration but i wish to have the notice of the motion sent to me on the wednesday that i may arrange respecting my attendance in the house of lords because i am about now to sit from day to day in the house of lords during the remainder of the session but i shall not sit there any saturday when my attendance may be required here i think this court sitting by one of its branches throughout the vacation for the purpose of hearing pressing applications is one of the most essential reliefs that can be afforded to the suitor and is almost essential to the useful existence of the court and the due discharge of justice it was a remark of a learned and venerable friend of mine—one among the greatest sages of the law—i mean mr jeremy bentham—that one of the greatest evils arising from vacations was the shutting up the courts at the very time when suitors might have the greatest occasion to require access to them i do not think i can subscribe to the whole extent of his doctrine on this point but undoubtedly that there is a great benefit to be conferred by keeping always open some part of the court for pressing business i most entirely agree with him in holding his lordships address was

but the closer the scrutiny into that measure became the more deeply did i become impressed with the painful persuasion that in a man in whom for so long a course of years i have had the honour and happiness to possess a familiar friend it was in conclusion my unhappy lot to behold an adversary—and that an irreconcilable one—an adversary and to what to law reform—to that all important undertaking to which from boyhood the whole of my long life has been devoted the consequence was that in my view so long as he continued in the allpowerful situation which he now occupies whatsoever hopes i had ever entertained of witnessing a consummation so devoutly to be wished could not but remain in a state of extinction and that with all the feelings of a friend in relation to him i saw no choice but acting in relation to him as i am hereby doing—and alas in so harsh a way—the part of an enemy—the exclamation et tu brute all the while sounding as it were in my ears this determination being taken the prefixing the shorter paper to the longer one presented itself as a sort of preparatory measure that might be conducive to the end in view as to the measure more particularly here a question from first to last to see the bill thrown out has never formed any part of my wishes two results i saw included in it—the death of the existing state of things in relation to this part of the judicial establishment with its procedure and the birth of a new one in relation to the first my wishes were in entire accordance with those of my noble friend in the other alone consisted the difference throughout the whole course of my labours i believe that one rule has with undeviating adherence been conformed to by me—be the institution what it might never to engage in any such attempt as that of pulling it down but for the purpose and with the endeavour to raise up something that to me seemed better in the room of it of the observance of this rule exemplification will on the present occasion be seen under the head of amendments in the first part of these observations p     the smallness of the type had for its cause the intention of making use of the letterpost for the conveyance of this tract little did i then think of the length to which it was destined to be drawn out things left undone that ought to have been done—things done that ought not to have been done—to these two heads will be found referable the charges here made against the institution the effects of which are now beginning to show themselves among the things left undone consigning to one and the same judicatory the business performed by the court called the bankruptcy court and the court called the insolvency court that is to say under the judiciary establishment as at present constituted with its system of procedure for under the system which i have ventured to propose suits of all sorts without any exceptions worth particularizing would be taken cognizance of by a set of the same singleseated judicatories proceeding according to the same simple natural untechnical quasidomestic system of procedure in the publication intituled justice and codification petitions may be seen a slight sketch of it as to the things which in my notion of the matter ought not to have been done to hold up to view a part of them nor yet more than a part of them is the business of the ensuing pages     i boa constrictor alias helluo curiarum observations on the resolvedon absorption of the vicechancellors court and the master of the rolls court into the lord high chancellors court a boa constrictor of the first magnitude appropriately wigged and gowned crushing in his embrace the bodies and extinguishing the life of their two honours the vicechancellor and the master of the rolls both of them also appropriately wigged and gowned—no bad subject this for the graver of a cruikshank all pleasantry apart i cannot but felicitate those whose hard lot it is to become suitors in equity at the prospect which such a change presents to view one stage of appeal at least and perhaps in some cases two made to evaporate of this haleyon state of things it seems to me that i see a glimpse may it not prove a phantasmagoric one so much for what the lord chancellor calls his resolvedon arrangement but an arrangement is one thing a principle on which that same arrangement is grounded is another by one and the same person the one may be approved of the other disapproved of number in an office—of these words is formed the title of section   of chapter ix intituled ministers collectively in my constitutional code a proposition i have there advanced is—that exceptions excepted and rare indeed if any are the exceptions—be the department what it may singleseated should be every office in that department singleseated for what reason answer—for many reasons but the principal one and the most appropriate of them all stands expressed by the single word responsibility responsibility—itself a host of reasons number in a judicatory—of these words is formed the title of section   of chapter xii intituled judiciary collectively in that same code in that section to the several arguments which in support of singleseatedness had been applied to the case of the administration department are added others which presented themselves to me as applying in an exclusive manner or with peculiar force to the judiciary department to these reasons of which further on i have the mortification of finding opposed the authority of the aforesaid noble and learned lord as displayed in the string of dictums stated in the morning chronicle of the  d of this instant september as having been delivered on the occasion of an announced absorption of the master of the rolls and vicechancellors into the lord chancellors court which said oracles of our said magnus apollo are in the words following that is to say—there are two or three branches of judicature in which the presence of three judges is infinitely better than that of one   first where conflicting facts are to be discussed or conflicting evidence to be heard a jury is perhaps the best forum for such a case—a single judge perhaps the worst but three men with minds variously constituted are much more likely to come to a satisfactory conclusion than a single individual   the next is—where anything like discretion is to be exercised either in awarding damages or saying what costs are to be paid which is often a very important and not unfrequently difficult and delicate inquiry as too many cases are brought and kept up merely for the sake of the costs the duty of the judge then is somewhat like that of assessing damages and in the exercise of such discretion it is better to have three judges than one   last of all where there are great and difficult and important points of law and equity to be settled it is much more satisfactory to suitors and to the profession which cultivates the sciences to have that law considered and settled by more judges than one these then concludes his lordship are the reasons which principally move me to the adoption of the resolution which i have taken there we have his lordships dicta for my part my work intituled constitutional code being as the title goes on to say for the use of all nations and all governments entertaining liberal opinions and for the support and elucidation of the proposed enactive matter the said work presenting throughout a correspondent quantity of ratiocinative matter it would have been no small satisfaction to me to have seen the truth of my arguments which as above are     delivered in support of singleseatedness in judicature subjected to the scrutiny of so enlightened a mind and to have given to the work in question the benefit of his lordships observations on the one side or the other or on both seeing that the questions are not a few as to which with perfect sincerity by one and the same man as sir roger de coverley was wont to say much may be said on both sides this satisfaction i might have had had his lordship been pleased to add them to the pap which he was pleased to say pray for and take from a teaspoon of mine when sitting on my lap at the hermitage from which i write those of the said arguments i mean which apply to the case of the administration department that part of the work being then already in print to which arguments he might have added moreover those which apply exclusively to the case of the judiciary department for though not yet in print they were even then in manuscript and were it only for the chance howsoever feeble of their now receiving that honour i have some thoughts of sending them to the press immediately and adding them to this paper before i have done speaking of those same wishedfor observations i take the liberty of supposing them as having place on the one side on the other or on both unfortunately neither in any one of the abovementioned dicta nor in all of them put together can i find any portion of that sort of matter called ratiocinative which could with propriety be made to occupy a place in that same work of mine for for the support of his lordships proposed enactments ratiocinative has in ipse dixitical matter found on almost every occasion if not a more instructive at any rate a more compendious and to the furnisher at least a much more commodious substitute now then for the three cases in which according to his lordship three judges are better than one case i conflicting facts to be discussed or conflicting evidence to be heard of the sorts of cases for which three judges are according to him better than one this is the first mentioned but here comes a puzzle good for this case as are three judges another forum he descries and points to as being for this same case still better nay so much better as to be the best possible and this other forum—what is it even his lordships old favourite a jury and of what sort of men is the population of that same forum according to his lordships declared conception of it composed of any twelve men so they be good ones and put into a box—no exaggeration here so his lordship was pleased to assure us such after the most mature deliberation was his lordships opinion as declared on the  th of february      in and by his selfpublished speech of that date p   now then comes the puzzle this forum being the perfection of aptitude—of appropriate aptitude with relation to this very case—why not on the occasion in question take it in hand and employ it instead of the threeseated judicatory—a tribunal which threeseated as it is yet its seats being in numbers no more than a quarter of those of the forum yields still to it in point of this same aptitude in the course of the tract intituled observations on the bankruptcy court bill those same arguments may perhaps be given at length meantime any something being on this occasion better than nothing a sort of abridgment of them may be seen in the proposition following— as to the conduciveness of singleseatedness to the ends of justice comparison had with manyseatedness no otherwise can any estimate of it be formed than by the degree of appropriate aptitude in all its branches which in the two cases is likely to have place on the part of the judge or judges relation had to the functions of their office for determining on which side the aggregate of such appropriate aptitude is likely to have place in the greatest degree let attention be applied to the following propositions—   as in the case of any other functionary so in that of a judge the state of the law being given—for every practical purpose appropriate moral aptitude must be considered as exactly proportioned to the strictness of his dependence upon public opinion   singlyseated a judge finds not any person on whom he can shift off the whole or any part of the imputation of a mischievous exercise given to any of his functions not so when he has a colleague   no person does he find to share with him in the weight of that odium   no persons does he find in the same situation with himself engaged by the conjunct ties of selfregarding interest and sympathy to support him under the apprehension of it by the encouragement given by their countenance   he has it not in his power without committing himself to give to an indefensible exercise made of his functions half the effect of a vote—namely by purposed absentation and nonparticipation   he finds not in the same situation with     himself any person to share with him and in proportion draw off from him the whole or any part of any lot of approbation whether on the part of his superior officer or the public at large that may come to be attached to extra merit in any shape manifested on the occasion of any exercise given to his functions   his reputation stands altogether upon the ground of his actions he finds not in the same situation any person to help him as numbers help one another to raise a schism in the public—and by the mere force of prejudice—without evidence or in spite of evidence in relation to specific actions—to draw after them the suffrages of the unreflecting part of it   of the quality correspondent and opposite to appropriate moral aptitude the most mischievous effect is—disposition to exercise arbitrary power but that which constitutes arbitrary power in judicature is—not the unity of the judge but his exemption from the controul of a superior—from the obligation of assigning reasons for his acts—and from the superintending scrutiny of the public eye   the reproach of arbitrary power belongs on all the above accounts to the authority of many judges especially large bodies of judges in contradistinction to that of one  0 the circumstances which render plurality indispensable in sovereign legislature do not apply to judicature    so many seats so many sets are there of persons who by community of sinister interest stand engaged to secure the possessor of the situation against responsibility in every shape for delinquence in every shape so much for appropriate moral aptitude    now as to intellectual and active aptitude in a singlyseated judge most intelligence is likely to be found in so far as intelligence is the fruit of exertion    a judge by being single exerts himself the more from his seeing no resource but in his own powers    hence only in the case of a singlyseated functionary can promptitude or say dispatch be maximized    a singlyseated functionary has but one opinion and one set of reasons to give    no persons opinion has he to wait for    no person has he to debate with to gain over or to quarrel with    no person has he to put unnecessary questions to him—to propose unnecessary steps—or to necessitate useless adjournments    all the advantages that can be expected from a multiplicity of judges may be insured in a much greater degree by a numerous auditory with the addition of the whole world for readers as to everything in the conduct of a judge that any men think worth their notice and any advantage that can ever have happened by accident from such multiplicity can be imputed to nothing but the chance it affords for publicity  0 the advantages obtainable from a plurality of heads independently of exertion are needed in no more than a small number of cases and in proportion as they are needed may be had by the help of advocates and courts of appeal without putting judges more than one into the same court    to suitors—that is to say to persons having business at the office—causes of delay are in a large proportion of the number of individual cases to a greater or lesser amount causes of expense    if these principles be just the saving they will produce in the expense of the establishment is prodigious in the expense attending the collection of taxes—in the terms of loans—in the adjustment of most other plans of economy in finance a saving of a few units per cent is thought a great matter here it runs to hundreds per cent and the least saving is a hundred then as to facility the judicatory presents a difficulty of which the forum stands or if you please sits clear in the judicatory a condition required is that the minds of the members be all three of them variously constituted and in this qualification resides the differential character as the logicians say of the tribunal its distinctive excellence its sole alleged title or claim to preference but of this qualification how is the existence to be ascertained there i see a knot which staring his lordship in the face cries aloud to him—nay but you must untie me is it by identity—in the first place of professional practice—in the next place of official functions is it by the viginti and ever so many more than the viginti annorum lucubrationes applied by the whole fraternity of them constantly and with a more than ordinary degree of attention to the same subject that this same indispensable variety of constitution is to be produced uniformity rather than the promised variety is the effect i should have looked for from such a set of causes shaken out by the indiscriminate defence of right and wrong carried on through so long a course of years by the indiscriminate utterance of truth and falsehood common sense and common honesty make their escape while the remaining matter contracts in proportion subsides and coalesces in all alike into a paste of appropriate shape and colour as if cast in one and the same mould insomuch that when after the fire of london city gratitude hung up the portraits of the twelve judges in that case had not magnificence been preferred to     economy one portrait might have served for all twelve as in the nuremberg chronicle in the list of the progenitors and descendants of abraham so strong it was found was the family likeness that one venerable head and shoulders was so managed as to serve without objection for divers generations turn now to the jurybox here all is as a sailor would say plainsailing according to his lordship all that is here requisite is—that there be men—that they be good—that there be twelve of them—and that they be put into a box sir robert peel requires other qualifications one is that they be capable of being packed but the above is all that his lordship requires no need of any variation in the constitution of their minds so far from needing it sooner or later full or fasting nolens volens they must be every one of them of the same mind variety of constitution by any such property would the twelve minds be rendered the more easily liquifiable into one not they indeed they would in proportion to the degree of the aforesaid variety be more intractable and insoluble so much as to the question between singleseatedness and manyseatedness and in particular tripleseatedness now for judges and boxes if after all it be really true that identity of habits is so surely efficient a cause of variety of constitution a little arrangement or two there is which i would humbly suggest for his lordships consideration as promising an ulterior improvement grounded on his own so deliberately established principles let him take the reverend judges all twelve of them or whatever be now the number of them and put them into a jurybox setting down the box in the court of chancery and to make sure of that goodness which is the characteristic quality of a juryman and that nothing which appropriate learning and wisdom can supply may be wanting let him for this purpose borrow from lord tenterden the very jurybox which has so long been diffusing its goodness through the kings bench as to his power for making this transference in his own view of it at any rate it stands not exposed to any dispute i have power says he accordingly—i have at present power to ask for the attendance of any or all the judges of westminster hall on the other hand if this be a little mistake of his for nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit and if accordingly diversity of habits is a surer cause than identity is of variety of constitution let him once more betake himself to his old favourites the good men and true and set them down comfortably in their own box i mean not the special jurymen for the squirearchy being aristocrats are all cast in the same mould the jurymen whom i mean are the common jurymen for among them there will he as many different habits as there are trades now as to conflicting facts and conflicting evidence as to this matter a circumstance which on the present occasion seems somehow or other to have dropt out of his lordships mind is—that it is from these same conflicting facts and evidence that judges themselves deduce their conclusions and not only commonlaw judges but even equity judges and not only equity judges in general but even his lordship himself yes even his lordship himself for does he not hear bills and answers—does he not hear answers to interrogatories—does he not hear affidavits and do not these same bills and answers interrogatories and affidavits relate to conflicting facts to be discussed and conflicting evidences to be heard i speak under correction but really his lordship puts one in mind of monsieur jourdan who had been talking prose all his life long without ever being aware of it all their official lives long added to their professional have all judges—learned judges—been in the habit of hearing and dealing with this sort of intellectual matter a juryman—the first day of his being put into the box—has not heard a syllable which first day may also be the last here then we have on the bench the maximum of experience in the box the maximum of inexperience here then we have a problem calling on his lordship for solution required to show the advantages which on this occasion not to speak of other occasions inexperience possesses over experience in the box men have the evidence elicited from them in the best shape on the bench in three of the worst shapes it is in the power of human ingenuity to devise namely affidavits answers to bills and answers to written interrogatories without any answers to such questions as those same answers might suggest the deduction depending upon and varying in great measure in proportion to the badness and deceitfulness of the shape but still is it not on facts—conflicting facts—and conflicting evidence that the adjudication is made and pronounced in the one case as well as in the other true it is that in the case of the bench the conclusion is styled a judgment or a decree in the case of the box a verdict but what difference this denomination makes in the nature of the matter i must with all submission leave it to his lordship to determine true it is moreover all this while that the question—the principal question—is between judges and judge not between judges and juries the question as to juries being blown in by his lordship as it were by a side wind—in the form of a parenthesis but     howsoever it may have got in this doctrine was by far too important to be passed by unnoticed for here may be seen—and from those same most impressive lips the confession video meliora proboque deteriora sequor the jurybox with its contents being the best machinery of the two—indeed according to your own declared opinion the best of all possible machineries—what on any occasion and this in particular should hinder you from making use of it surely not any unpopularity that you can see in it   now for case the second—namely where anything like discretion is to be exercised subjectmatters of the discretion in this case damages and costs operations to be performed by the light of the discretion awarding the damages and saying what costs shall be paid thus far his lordship where anything like discretion is to be exercised this read i fell to rubbing my eyes and said to myself—am i now awake that there may be judges who on this or that occasion are capable of acting without discretion is indeed conceivable enough and perhaps his lordship may not have any very great distance to look to find one but that there should be in existence any such judge as one who by speaking of the case in which something like discretion is to be exercised as being a particular case—should give it to be understood that in his opinion by a judge generally speaking neither discretion itself—no nor so much as anything like discretion—should be exercised—this it is that makes me stand aghast the plain truth is that this same word discretion is a sort of arrow which learned judges when in a state of conflict with one another and in a rhetorical mood have been seen letting fly at one another in days of yore hector and achilles were lord camden lord chancellor—and lord mansfield lord chief justice—discretion exclaimed one day lord camden—discretion is the law of tyrants whence came it to be so even from this—namely that something about discretion and in favour of it lord mansfield had been indiscreet enough to utter thereupon as if achilles had been slain in placard types was trumpeted forth in the whig periodicals and pamphlets of the day this dictum of their hector who after all found himself compelled to turn his back upon seals and bench discretion is the law of tyrants yes—and sure enough in an unguarded moment something rather approbative than otherwise of the use of discretion had dropt from the lips of the lord chiefjustice i say unguarded for had he put before it the word sound there would have been nothing to lay hold of and the bolt would not have been shot nor if shot have stuck upon it let me not be mistaken no such intimation do i mean to convey as that the course my noble and learned friend means to recommend is the law of tyrants all i mean to say is that when employed in certain ways the word discretion is the word of parrots and that though the lip it comes from should belong to a head which had ever so full bottomed a wig over it no determinate idea—no idea capable of entering into the composition of any tolerably effective argument—would come in company with it so much for the word discretion meantime on the present occasion what is at the bottom of it if anything it is this—when the subject of decision is—not a quantity already determinate such as a house or a horse or a sum certain due on a note of hand—but a quantity which remains to be determined such as a sum of money in compensation for a wound—wound to body reputation or domestic peace vulgo crim con—then so it is that that which in the way of decision is to be done is—upon a scale of greater or less length to make choice of some one degree to the exclusion of the rest the operation of fixing upon this degree is what goes commonly by the name of liquidation this exposition you will not find in coke upon littleton but upon examination should you deem it worth the trouble you will not the less find it to be correct and so it is that this mode of decision commonly called liquidation is of the number of those the formation of which has from time immemorial been in the hands of a jury now then as to this same operation true it is they are used to it but are they exclusively fit for it semble que non no nor so much as equally fit for it used to it they are indeed but how even as eels are used to be skinned no eel is used to be skinned successively by several persons but one and the same person is used successively to skin several eels so much for damages now as to costs when for its reasonableness the quantum of the allowance made in the name of costs depends upon the propriety of the degree chosen as above—as for example in the case of the sort of allowance made to a witness for diet in part of travelling expenses—they may be in this respect and in so far upon a footing with damages but in so far as they consist of fees of judicial officers in this case they are so in but a small degree generally speaking these same fees are so many determinate quantities and so in the case of costs as between attorney and client so are the fees actually paid to counsel—degrees and liquidation are altogether out of the question here but all this while all this talk about costs not to speak of damages—what is it to the purpose be the functionary in question a juryman or a judge make what you will of discretion what difference can it make—what     difference whether the decision to be formed be called a verdict or a decree liquidation as above described or any other operation talking is one thing thinking is another talking at any rate in any determinate manner is less needful at the bar more needful on the bench on the bench talking without thinking makes bystanders shake their heads another thing of this same reasoning of his lordships application being made by him—not only to cases where something like discretion is necessary in saying what costs are to be paid but also to cases where something not less like discretion is to be exercised in awarding damages in such sort that in those cases likewise three judges are according to him in no less degree better than one this being the case may it not be that these cases likewise are among those which are resolved by him to be brought within the field of his jurisdiction as above in the same manner as these others if so then so it is that notwithstanding that for these same cases juries are so much better than judges their jurisdiction is actually resolved by him to be taken from those same favourites of his if so then alas how feeble and slippery a thing is fondness in high places—put not thy trust says somebody in holy writ—put not thy trust in princes in princes then shall we put our trust no nor yet in chancellors   case iii last of all where there are great and difficult and important points of law and equity to be settled it is much more satisfactory to suitors and to the profession which cultivates the sciences to have that law considered and settled by more judges than one settled indeed—settled—by judges and those equity judges three in number the lord chancellor himself included—as if any great and important points of law and equity or any points at all of law or equity ever had been settled by judges—by judges in the number of three or in any other number as if it were in the nature of the case that any points at all of law or equity ever should be settled by judges—by judges in any number acting as such as if any point of law could ever be settled by any other instrument of settlement than that which is composed of a determinate assemblage of words acknowledged to be the words of a determinate person or set of persons invested with the branch of power styled the legislative settled indeed yes if instead of settling the one thing needful were unsettling this is what is in the power not only of the three judges in question acting collectively but of a single one of them that is to say the lord chancellor acting severally this is what he can do—this is what he understands perfectly how to do—this is what over and over again he has done—this is what he has been suffered thus to do and without any the least notice taken of it such has been the stupidity or supineness or such the treachery and cunning of those individuals by whom in conjunction with their fellowlegislators this contempt of the highest authority in the state has been left unpunished as to proof looking out for proof of the perpetration of this crime would be looking out for proof of the existence of the sun at noonday in the mind of any law practitioner or law student of a years standing the single word registration will suffice to call up a swarm of examples of this same securiticide practice in the miscellany intituled official aptitude c in that one of its papers which is intituled indications respecting lord eldon may be seen an example not merely of the practice but of the avowal—the open avowal of it so much for settlement now for satisfaction and its conjugates satisfactory and satisfactoriness in this same satisfaction we have the end in view which the noble and learned judge has thus declaredly set before him on the occasion of the resolution declared to be on this occasion come to by him—the resolution to bring about this great change satisfactory—to whom satisfactory some person or persons in whose breasts the agreeable sensation designated by the term satisfaction will have place in consequence must be found or no such quality as that which is designated by the attributive satisfactory can have been produced by this same change out of the abovementioned three branches of judicature brought to view by his lordship as furnishing that same number of cases in which the presence of three judges is so much better than that of one—in two namely the first and third this same word satisfactory is inserted in the sentence and employed in giving expression to this so highly desirable effect but in the first of the two cases—namely where conflicting facts are to be discussed or conflicting evidence to be heard—in this case of the persons in whose breasts the sensation is to be produced no intimation whatsoever is conveyed remains as the sole case in which any such information is afforded to us case the third—namely as above the case where great and difficult and important points of law and equity are to be settled in this case then who are the persons in whose breasts this same agreeable sensation is to be produced answer—persons of two classes or descriptions namely   the suitors   the profession which cultivates the sciences—meaning for what other things can it have meant the science of law and the science of equity now then as to these same two classes   0 that to one of them the change if affected may be made satisfactory is what i can conceive though as to its being actually made so this is more than i could venture to promise myself this class is that designated by the name of the profession which cultivates the sciences but as to the other class—the class composed of the suitors whatever i may have supposed on first taking the matter in hand nothing upon a closer inspection can i descry in the change—nothing that has any tendency to produce any such agreeable effect yes if neither of their two honours were to be on any occasion thenceforward present in any court other than that in which his said lordship sits on which their own courts would take the flight to the moon whereupon as above intimated there remaining no more courts than one to these same suitors the corresponding quantity of delay expense and vexation would be saved but to say that to both these classes—namely suitors and the profession which cultivates those same sciences—one and the same arrangement will be satisfactory—to say this is as much as to say that to the sheep and the wolf one and the same arrangement of the field or the sheepfold will be satisfactory to the sheep need it be said the arrangement which on this as on every other occasion will be the most satisfactory one is that whatever it is by which the several quantities of delay expense and vexation are minimized to the profession which according to his lordship cultivates the sciences the arrangement which on this as on every other occasion will be most satisfactory is that by which the quantity of delay expense and vexation will be maximized not that considered by itself and for its own sake delay will be thus satisfactory no scarcely would it be in any degree satisfactory were it not for the use it is of in making addition to the expense and the addition made to lawyers profit by addition made to that same expense that to his lordship the arrangement thus by his lordship resolved to be made would if made accordingly be satisfactory—this is what may without difficulty be conceded but this howsoever it may have been the end in view aimed at is not any part of the end in view professed to be contemplated and endeavoured to be accomplished insomuch that when the offspring of the mountain which in her confinement has had so hard a time of it has been looked for not so much as a mouse it is believed will be found moreover as to the fields which speaking in general terms his lordship speaks of as having for cultivators the persons he mentions these are sciences but of the only two fields in particular which as above are mentioned by him as being cultivated namely law meaning common law and equity neither the one nor the other is in its entirety at least the subjectmatter of a science the subjectmatter of a science is a thing capable of being known but a thing which has no existence is not a thing capable of being known of that which is called equity no part has any existence of that which is called law that part which in contradistinction to statute law is called common law has not any more existence an act of parliament is really a law to know what there is in this or that act of parliament—to know for example what under and by virtue of an act of parliament a man is to pay in the way of a tax—is indeed to be in possession of so much knowledge and that useful knowledge but it is not to be in possession of what is meant by science any more than to know what oclock it is to know how to get money by pretending to know what on each several occasion law says or equity says—this may perhaps indeed be said to be a science at any rate the actually getting money in that way may be said to be exercising the correspondent art but sure enough neither the doing this nor the knowing how to do it is what his lordship meant when he spoke of cultivating the sciences the knowledge of what law ought to be—that is to say of that rule of action conformity to which will on each occasion be in the greatest degree possible contributory to the happiness of all persons interested—this is indeed a science but this science—how many are the men of law that ever thought of cultivating it what has ever been to be got by it what motive of any sort has any man of law as such ever had for cultivating it what bench is there that it has ever led to his lordship—did he himself ever stoop to cultivate it—did he ever deign to bestow a thought upon it is it anything better than theory and with what disdain do not noble and learned lords look down upon theory from the heights of practice so much for rules and corresponding principles—lord high chancellors rule three judges on a bench better than one corresponding principle the tripleseatednesspreferring principle—unofficial theorists rule one judge on a bench is better than three or any greater number corresponding principle the singleseatednesspreferring principle so much for rules and principles now for the application made of these same rules and principles—the application made of them by his lordship to the particular case in question what now shall i say of it to speak of it i must either profess to understand it or profess not to understand it of these two opposite professions the first is what i feel myself utterly unable to make consistently     with truth irresistibly therefore the other forces itself upon me of this dictum of his lordships the meaning not being tangible left to me are the words these i must take in hand and send my thoughts abroad in quest of some meaning for them at a former time to which i see allusion is made by him what he proposed stands thus expressed—i proposed therefore says he that all causes of difficulty or importance in point of value or from the law as applying to them should at once be transferred here and be heard by me as thereby the inevitable appeal meaning i suppose the otherwise inevitable appeal would be averted the event continues his lordship has justified my prospective conjecture and leads me now to form the plan which i shall certainly adopt—namely the transferring the bulk of that business meaning equity business in general to this court meaning the lord high chancellors court in contradistinction to those of the vicechancellor and the master of the rolls thus far his lordship now then as to importance not to speak of difficulty on the occasion of the application made of the law—where is the cause that is not of importance if that which is of importance to the suitors or to one of them is of importance then as the madrigal has it ten thousand pound to one penny—no one such could be found a cause which swallows up the whole of the property a suitor can command—is that cause of the number of those that are of importance in point of value sufficient to swallow up the whole of the property of ninetenths of the good people of england not to say ninetynine hundredths would be found to be in the case of the least importance that ever came before the court the costs expended upon it before it had received its termination the costs i say over and above the value of the subjectmatter of the dispute now then if so it be that on the subject of importance as applied to a law or equity suit there be in his lordships mind enlightened as it is anything of a misconception where shall we look for the cause of it shall it not be in the loftiness of the situation occupied by it in the eye of the learned profession and the opulent aristocracy there are two classes of men whose happiness is of importance namely the said professional class and the said aristocratical class forming together say between onetenth and one hundredth of the whole community there is one class the happiness of which is of no importance namely the remaining nine or ninetynine on this theory on a careful examination has been found to be built the whole structure of the judicial establishment in england and the whole of the system of procedure according to which that establishment conducts its operations—an establishment and a system having for their object or end in view in as large a proportion as may be the dividing between the learned profession and its best customers—namely the dishonest among the relatively opulent the property of the relatively unopulent suitors for such is the effect—the manifested the uncontroverted the uncontrovertible effect—of factitious costs and the system of procedure organized for the purpose of giving admission to them in the largest quantity possible demonstrated may all this be seen in the petition for justice well but for arguments sake let it be admitted that some causes there are which are not of importance thereupon comes the question—how—by what criterion—can those who are empowered and at the same time disposed if any such there be to distinguish—and distinguish in time to prevent suffering—those causes which are not of importance from those which are and in addition to this comes moreover that other question as to difficulty—the question—between those which are not of difficulty and those which are in the case of each individual cause is there to be a sort of preliminary trial or equivalent to a trial for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not it be of importance and so moreover in regard to difficulty if so by what course are these several preliminary suits or causes to be respectively conducted—by bill in equity—by petition as in a bankruptcy case—by a grand jury as in commonlaw penal cases—or by action real or feigned as in a civil cause—or would not trial by cross and pile be preferable to them all for at any rate it would save or at any rate if his lordship pleased might be made to save costs one thing we are informed of and that is—that of the aggregate number of causes the great bulk will enjoy the benefit of this same exaltation but still the number of them—the absolute and relative number—remain to be grasped at by conjecture now then comes the transference—the so determined transference what on this occasion can his lordship have meant by transference—to what causes was it meant to apply—to causes already in existence or future contingent causes and those only—or to both classes in each of these two respectively by what hands is the transference to be made—in what hands is it to originate will his lordship ex mero motu go to the court below take in hand the record lay it on his shoulder and thus carry it bodily into the court in which he so illustriously reigns saying or not saying—this cause is of sufficient importance to be in the first instance and thereby to a certainty heard and determined     by me—of too great importance to be entrusted at all to such a man as you sir launcelot shadwell or to such a man as you sir john leach otherwise than in leading strings with myself to hold them or will he wait for some one else and who to move his lordship for leave to bring up the cause into his lordships high court in this latter case the motion—will it be a motion of course or must it be a motion for a rule to show cause why this new sort of certiorari should not issue with liberty on the other side for cause to be shown accordingly difficulties upon difficulties thus stand in the way of this arrangement the design of which is to remove difficulties—difficulties and those such as i cannot but think will be found to be insuperable ones so much for the causes and the transference so resolved to be performed of those same causes but now for the judges—the two other judges whose destiny it is to hear or be present at the hearing of and to help determine or be present at the determination of those same causes by what means in what manner are they to be transferred from their respective inferior benches to his lordships superior bench this same transference—will it be agreeable to them respectively will it be to use his lordships word satisfactory to them may it not happen to them to be more or less recalcitrant on the one bench sits the master of the rolls but another seat there is on which if not now it may happen to him to sit any time and that is a seat in honourable house in that house sat lately the most illustrious of his predecessors sir william grant and in support of aristocratical swindling and against the cause of moral honesty and payment of just debts romilly è contrà knights service did he do there should then either of these demur will he send his messenger to them as did in charles the firsts time the honourable house to take them bodily off their own benches and set them down on his lordships—or will he himself take them up in his noble arms and on each shoulder st christopherlike carry them off and so deposit them to save this trouble will lord tenterden lend him a mandamus scarcely without an act of parliament to warrant it the attainment of which in case of need seems indeed to be among the number of his lord chancellorships resolves but then will come committees and first second and third readings to both houses and objections upon objections so much freer from difficulties would be the jury plan—the plan so decidedly pronounced by his lordship to be the better of the two good men in the shape of jurymen are as tame and obedient as spaniels show them a box and call it a jurybox they run into it at first word vicechancellors and masters of the rolls—the more i think of them the clearer i am that they would run rusty i hear them remonstrating and preaching—i see them kicking and sprawling with clouds of powder flying out of their wigs before they can be brought if ever they can be brought to sit still under his lordships eye and nodding approbation in obsequious silence before i leave this topic let me give utterance to another humble wish i have formed which is the wish to know whether jurymen apart the preference given to the greater over the lesser number stops at the number three or whether if he could get any and what greater number for his puisnes he would do so his stopping at number two having no other cause than that he knows not very well how to get any more of them to my humble apprehension if in any degree that variety of constitution in which he puts his trust were to be found in number three it would in all probability be found in a still higher degree in number four and so on in the numeration table if it be in superior magnitude in number in conjunction with variety of constitution that he puts his trust i could point to situations more than one in which he might find judicial characters for pulshes with less danger of difficulty than in the two only ones he as yet speaks of for example masters in chancery magistrates paid magistrates unpaid men qualified to be special jurymen men qualified to be grand jurymen and to add dignity ab extrà to intrinsic aptitude even a lord or two might with less reluctance than the master of the rolls not to speak of the vicechancellor be prevailed upon to lodge their sittingparts on the high bench for my own part my own opinion right or wrong is at any rate clear determinate and selfconsistent it is—that so far as depends on number in the case of a judicial situation aptitude is as the number of the functionaries occupying it inversely were it only because responsibility is so or in other words inaptitude is as the number directly and for that same reason now then what on this occasion i could wish to know is whether in his lordships opinion this same proportionality has place—the only difference between us being that between the inverse ratio i speak here to the noble and learned mathematician and the direct or whether the numbers to which on this occasion he gives his preference follow one another in perturbate order as euclid has it like cards in a pack well shuffled or in the regular rank and file order of the numeration table if masters in chancery would be satisfactory to him i dare answer for him and them he might without any dissatisfaction     on their part have them to sit with him and in whatever number would be most satisfactory to him especially if they were to have each of them all the while a newspaper to read or pen ink and paper to write letters with as some learned judges of superior order have been seen to do while learned counsel were straining their throats the masters clerks doing all the while at their respective chambers the business which their said masters were paid—by a fee for each business—for pretending to do an additional source of satisfaction in this case is that those same assessors would every one of them know his place this place is on each side that which is as far from that of his lordship—the lord high chancellor—as possible his person being encompassed with an atmosphere the repulsive quality of which is strong enough to produce that decorous effect such at least speaking from the testimony of my senses used to be the state of these things in former days nor could i without a sentiment of commiseration behold one of these learned gentlemen in the state of humiliation to which he seemed doomed his lordship not taking any more notice of him than if he were a post a master of the rolls or a vicechancellor—would he submit to this i question it this change then supposing it effected—what would be the effect of it just so much pure evil—evil without a particle of the matter or in the shape of good the business of the two subordinate courts interrupted and deteriorated and the business of the highest sphere—of the sphere illumined by the brightest luminary of the law—the business of the superordinate court not benefited nor advanced but retarded also the suitors of the subordinate courts—such of them at least as are in bonâ fide not wilfully employing the power of those same courts as an instrument of depredation or oppression—these illstarred men vexed by delay the practitioners in those same subordinate courts vexed likewise and by that same cause and to conclude the train of mourners the two unhappy subordinates—mutes and for the loss of their own business mourners—their two honours vexed likewise vexed by being humiliated dislocated disempowered dishonoured and metamorphosed into mutes singing when out of court diswigged and disgowned—singing in doleful ditty and duet nos inhonorati et donis patruelibus orbi as for me when i entered upon this discussion as the reader may have observed a ray of hope beamed upon my mind imagination presented to my view stages of appeal one or even two eliminated so much delay expense and vexation saved the matter of a mixed mass composed of salaries and fees kept in the pocket out of which in the present state of things it is snatched this hope alas has now for some time past been dissipated my wish was father my imagination mother to that thought still would sit their two honours pressing not less heavily than at present with their deadweight upon justice delay far from being diminished would as above observed be increased for while with their sitting parts on the high bench they were constituting part and parcel of the living stock of functionaries of that court the business of their own court would be at a stand of this disastrous truth a sad confirmation is afforded how could i overlook it in and by one of the very sentences in which his lordship makes mention of this transference i have power says he to ask for the assistance of any or all of the judges of westminster hall and i know not why i should not have the power of asking to be assisted by the presence of the master of the rolls and the vicechancellor when necessity requires having in view of course the familiar phrase ask and have now then what is clear is—that no such resolution can ever have taken possession of his lordships mind as that of absorbing into and swallowing up in his own noble and learned maw the whole power of all those same learned judges put together as well might he swallow up those same learned persons themselves—flesh and blood bones wig and gown and all nor at the same time is any distinction expressed between what he proposes to do by the two equity judges—the master of the rolls and the vicechancellor—on the one part and what he proposes to do by those same commonlaw judges on the other part and as to the resolvedly devoted pair of judges what is it that it is his resolve to do—to keep them tethered down to his girdle in his own custody during the whole of their official lives oh no only when necessity requires and this her requisition—when is it that dame necessity will make it that will depend altogether upon his own noble and learned discretion to his lordship on each individual—yes individual—occasion it will belong to determine in what place or places they shall be and for aught that anybody else will be able to tell they may at all times be in a state of vibration like a pair of pendulums between the court of chancery and their own proper courts as to myself and my own labours—i have spoken as above of the retribution they have received by the tokens of approbation here and there expressed in relation to them in and by the following passage with which this same speech of my noble and learned friend concludes i cannot but behold a rich reward—honourable to me on whom it is bestowed—not     much less so to him to whose magnanimity under such provocations as it has happened to him to receive from me i am indebted for it—it was a remark says he of a learned and venerable friend of mine one of the greatest sages of the law—i mean mr jeremy bentham—that one of the greatest evils arising from vacations was the shutting up the courts at the very time when suitors might have the greatest occasion to require access to them i do not think i can subscribe to the whole extent of his doctrine on this point but undoubtedly that there is a great benefit to be conferred by keeping always open some part of the court for pressing business i most entirely agree with him in holding on the social part of my mental frame this token of kindness has made the sort and degree of impression which it could not fail to make but neither by this nor any other impulse am i to be turned aside from my duty to that public to the service of which the labours of my life have so long been devoted that i am not to be corrupted by gold is already pretty well known it will now be known that i am not capable of being corrupted even by gratitude would that by anything i could say or write i could turn aside my noble and learned friend from bitbybit the word is his—from bitbybit and illconsidered unconcocted incoherent and unseasoned supposed reforms or improvements in legislation my portfolio my arms my heart are still and always will be open to him had he but on this occasion had the command over himself to resort for information to that source from whence at his desire information on kindred subjects had been so amply communicated to him and in some sort profited by alas that it had but been a little more profited by the disappointment to which so insufficiently considered a proposed and declaredlyresolvedon arrangement seems inevitably doomed with the mortification inseparable from the failure would not i cannot but think have been experienced to the functions of judicature then let him confine his exertions and his hope of glory as to legislation so far as regards origination of measures leaving the field to him whose proficiency in that branch of art and science was recognised some years before the existing successor of lord bacon saw the light never without violence done to my feelings is condemnation how loudly soever the occasion may appear to me to call for it passed by me upon any part of the character or conduct of a friend never without satisfaction to those same feelings is commendation when it presents itself as deserved paid by me even to an enemy a subject which i contemplate with sincere and unalloyed delight and with which it rejoices me to be able to conclude this unavoidably polemic discussion is the dispatch—the altogether unexampled dispatch—spoken of by his lordship in this same speech as given by him to the business of that court on which it casts so bright a lustre in what light does it not place the job—the justiceobstructing court set up by the most indefatigable implacable and irresistible enemy to justice and human happiness that his situation was ever filled by—that job which romilly one of the earliest and most attached of my disciples so strenuously and so fruitlessly fought against by the indiscriminate defenders of right and wrong this dispatch with the relief afforded by it to suitors is murmured at and attacked against these attacks one part of the defence i had rather not have seen when convinced from the statement of the partys own advocate—convinced of his being in the wrong—this judges way he tells us was—to keep the other causes waiting while the advocate on the other side was taking up the time of the court in labouring to prove his being so favourable and gratifying to advocates is of course such patience such licence such indulgence yes indeed to advocates—but what is it to suitors this comes of having judges whose apprenticeship instead of being served under masters whose interest is identical with is served in fellowship with those whose interest is irreconcilably opposite to that of the whole people besides in their capacity of suitors and those who but for the prohibitive factitious expense would be suitors but this is human nature who is the lawyers neighbour his brother lawyer this is the man whom he loves next to himself this is lawyers law and lawyers gospel being competitors they indeed like harlots of the other sex hate one another but not the less do they like wolves herd together and join in hunting and devouring their common prey not quite so much regard as is wished by the bar is paid by him i hear it said to anterior decisions may be so but be it ever so little quite as much is it as is wished by me are you an equity judge pay no regard at all say i to anterior decision set before you on each occasion this one end in view—this one principle—the disappointmentminimizing principle pay any regard to them why should you no otherwise contributory to human happiness was any one of those decisions than in so far as it operated in conformity to that allbeneficent and allcomprehensive principle if so then why not under its guidance take the direct road instead of passing through those tortuous tracks which intentionally or unintentionally     have so continually turned themselves aside from it when with equity on his lips a chancellor first entered upon this devious course what regard paid he to the anterior decisions of the till then only class of judges—the commonlaw judges for justifying such his deviation what plea could he have made if it was not this pursuing on this occasion their rules the judges would produce disappointment taking the course i take i prevent it such in spirit and in purport must if questioned have been the defence of the first equityadministering judge such at any rate is the doctrine which in my proposed experimental measure of law reform—my equity dispatch court bill—i venture to preach—the course which i propose that my dispatch court judge shall be empowered and called upon to take he to whom it appears that he knows cause or just impediment why the same should not be taken let him declare it—this the first and last time of asking not only on the subject in this speech mentioned by him—namely the undiscontinuity of the administration of justice—but moreover on that which on the present occasion is the principal subject—namely the most appropriate number for the seats on an official bench—before the public eye and thus courting that of my noble and learned friend has for this twelvemonth or more been my opinion witness my constitutional code on which occasion with scarce an exception singleseatedness as opposed to manyseatedness is advocated as the only defensible arrangement true it is that the only offices there under consideration are those of the administration department and those here in question belong to the judicial department but in that section with its sixteen pages not an argument is there which applies with less force to the judicial than it does to the administrational department in another part of that same work† to the arguments which as above apply in common to both departments are added others which in an exclusive or peculiar manner apply to the judiciary to these they not being yet in print i may perhaps before i have done give insertion here ii observations on the bankruptcy court bill that the rights in question may be enforced with as little expense delay and uncertainty as possible—this and in these words is the professed end in view as professed in and by the preamble thus much for profession—placed thus and with uncontrovertible propriety in the front of this important instrument between this profession and practice let us now take the earliest opportunity of observing what sort of agreement or other relation has place i first as to expense this has two branches one that which is charged upon the public stock the other that which is laid upon the shoulders of the parties first then as to that part of the expense which is charged upon the public here presents itself to the very slightest glance and without possibility of contestation ground sufficient for denominating the judicatory a pickpocket court—and the measure a pickpocket measure judges in number four to do the business of one superfluous situations with superfluous salaries three out of the four instituted by this bill are two sorts of courts the one first mentioned the superior of the two—this to act in lieu of that which at present is held by the lord high chancellor the other—the inferior—to act in lieu of those which are at present held by the existing commissioners seventy in number in the superior court at present existing and by this determined to be superseded what is the number of the judges answer number one one and no more here then is innovation and for this innovation what reason assigned none whatever no nor so much as the shadow of one but this determination—this effect—has like every other effect its causes and in particular its final cause—its end in view and this end in view—what is it answer until some other shall have been assigned—profit to the lord chancellor—the author of it profit to him in the shape of patronage now as to the amount of public money thus caused to be wasted and of the private emolument for the sake of which the waste is ordained the expense is distinguishable into two parcels that which is laid on the shoulders of the public at large the other upon those of the individuals interested   first as to that which is laid on the shoulders of the public mark well the items of it     lords bill page    §    in the commons bill nothing on the subject making its appearance   chief judge £ 000 0 0   puisnes three  000 0 0   commissioners six  000 0 0   chancellors secretary of bankrupts    00 0 0   registrars two   00 0 0   deputy

then for the several functionaries thus appointed and salaried   as to the three puisnes what is the use of them none whatever what is the pretence for them pretence alleged none whatever pretence insinuated perhaps this—namely that which is perhaps in §   at the bottom of the words shall be and constitute a court of law and equity now then before the word equity why insert the words law and answer because whereas a court which is called a court of equity and nothing but a court of equity has in it but one judge and therefore is not understood to need to have more than one judge on the other hand a judicatory which is called a court of common law has always had four judges to whom has been recently added another and is therefore understood to need to have four judges this being the case by these same wellimagined words law and to all men who superior to public opinion are determined to concur in picking the pocket of the public of £ 000 reasons in abundance will be furnished by these words at any rate if not to any other words in the same number though for these same three situations by no other person in these same words will be seen any reason at all or so much as the shadow of one the court of exchequer—may not this judicatory have been looked to as a sort of prop to the pretence—seeing that in this same court of exchequer there have been in all days four judges and now of late days five and as this judicatory acts sometimes according to equity rules as well as sometimes according to commonlaw rules what a system this idea of it may it was hoped be suggested by the words law and equity good but what will their three puisneships be the better for this precedent such as it is of the business the cognizance of which belongs in common to both has the fourseated judicatory ever had—what shall we say a fourth an eighth a tenth part—of that which the chancery court has had not it indeed in other words has it had a fourth sixth eighth or tenth part of the confidence not it indeed   next as to the secretary of bankrupts under the new court of bankruptcy as it is called what is he to do answer what the secretary of bankrupts under the chancellors court of bankruptcy used to do will of course be the answer if any answer be attempted to be given and under the chancellors court what was it that the secretary of bankrupts used to do in the business of procedure—of judicial procedure—absolutely nothing if i can believe my eyes look over all the books that have ever been published on the subject of bankruptcy what one piece of business will you see stated as being done by him not one under the denomination of registration would come the operation performed by him in relation to bankruptcy if any operation relative to that business had been performed by him and in that case it would fall to be performed by the functionaries instituted by the bill under the name of registrars but the case is that no such operation was performed by him what then is it that he used to do if anything that which a dishonest porter sometimes does at the house of a nobleman when for the confession that his lordship is at home he exacts a fee for admission into his lordships presence if then by the learned lords and gentlemen concerned in the drawing up of the bill it had been intended that for this same salary of £  00 ayear anything should be done that which it was intended should be done by him would in this same bill have been specified but in no part of it have i been able to find any such thing specified a curious enough circumstance is this under what title is it that this same £  00 ayear is given to him under the title of secretary to the new court substituted to the lord chancellors court—namely the so called court of bankruptcy no but under the title of the lord chancellors secretary of bankrupts a denomination by which in this bill he is constituted a functionary of and in a judicatory which by this same bill is put out of existence   then comes the secretarys first clerk     salary £ 00 and for this same £ 00 what is it he is to do answer help his master while doing nothing   lastly comes this same secretarys second clerk and what is he to do answer help his master and his fellowservant while they two are doing nothing meantime as to this part of the business one thing there is that fills me with astonishment money matters are all these mention of them—where is it to be found in the bill brought into the house of lords and printed for the use of the house of lords where is it that it is not to be found in the bill moved for that brought into the house of commons and printed for the use of the house of commons at the moment at which i am writing no provision is there for this part of the expense provision no nor so much as any the least intimation of any expense which there was to be everything of the sort remains to be introduced in the form of an amendment of this manœuvre what was the object the answer i must leave to those who are conversant with parliamentary manœuvres to me it is a perfect mystery a money bill—a money bill in effect as well as form—a money bill with all the money clauses the sums not left in blank but specified—brought into the house of lords into that branch of the constitution in whom the exercise of any such power is a violation of the declared principles of that same constitution those same clauses not to be found any one of them in the bill brought into the house of commons—in the bill brought into the only house which is competent to the insertion of them this same house of commons bill being at the same time in the wording in all other particulars identical with it save and except §    and    nothing corresponding to which has place in the lords bill though there is not in either of them anything that could constitute an objection to its being there mark now the considerations which in the mind of the fundator incipiens to judge from all appearances gave birth to the financial part of the measure mark well the order in which they appear to have presented themselves matter of the existing grievance the enormous multitude of the existing official situations and thence the enormous bulk of the aggregate mass of emolument flowing from them these sources of emolument being determined to be extinguished and with them the emolument itself now comes a problem to this effect what is the maximum of the mass of emolument which consistently with the rules of prudence can on the most plausible grounds that can be found be established in lieu of it such being the question—for answer to it presented themselves the several names of offices now existing on this part of the field of judicature—so many there are of us said they—so many pegs you will see on which under the new arrangements a number more or less considerable of new offices—one two and so on as far as eight—may be hung with salaries raised each of them to the greatest height which there can be any reasonable hope that the public will endure the weight of and whereas in the case of the existing system of the hats hung upon the pegs the number is so great and the aggregate of the expense consequently so great—hence it is that under the new system to the several pegs with the comparatively small number of hats hanging on them may without scandal be attached it is hoped a mass of emolument much greater than any which under the existing system has been attached to any one of the situations belonging to this part of the field of judicature these matters—these matters of primary—not to say of sole—importance—being settled the next question it might seem would naturally be—what are the functions which it may be proper to allot to these several official persons—to attach to these several official situations but to these same questions the answer if given would be tiresome to the reader still more so to the draughtsman and not impossibly calling upon him for attainments for which he might rummage his mind longer than would be agreeable to him before he found them and thus it was that the salaries were left to stand upon no better ground than what has been seen such as will be seen the number of these pegs all of them hollow and empty on the surface the name of an office beneath it—within it—functions none a beggarly account of empty boxes these same sweets of office the salaries being thus as yet in petto remain to be brought upon table in the sort of charger styled an amendment in addition to this amendment or string of amendments or rather in lieu of some of them one other amendment or string of amendments i would venture to propose instead of being wasted upon three logs designated by the style and title of other judges—as if for the purpose of standing in the way of the one only efficient judge styled the chief judge—let the £ 000 ayear be sans façon put at once into the pocket of their creator and patron designatus the noble and learned father and author of the measure yes seriously it is—yea in sober sadness—that i come forward with these amendments waste of money the same but from the list of the public functionaries of whose emoluments the matter of corruption is constituted three would thus be struck off and what to so many thousands of unhappy and legally plundered debtors and creditors     is still more sensibly important so many instruments of certain delay and probable misdecision and exemption from responsibility annihilated thus manifest are now the tokens of selfconscious guilt which have betrayed themselves in the face of the measure in an ordinary case the sums are left in blank left to be filled up in the committee even this is bad practice and bad practice recurred to not without a correspondent bad purpose for how many are the cases where the sums belonging to the measure constitute the vital part of it insomuch that let the sums be so and so the measure is a right and proper one if so much more a wrong and indefensible one what then would be the proper course answer to put figures in every instance—a general understanding having place as at present that in a certain stage of the business the propriety of this will come under discussion so much for ordinary practice but in the present case what is the course taken not merely are the sums left in blank but the sections    in number of which the sums in question are the subjectmatter have not any one of them a place in the bill as printed by order of the honourable house so that now on tuesday october the  th the day to which after a struggle to prevent adjournment adjournment was made of it this part—the vital part—of it—the most manifestly and flagrantly objectionable part of it—will not be before the house yet for information thus indispensable a succedaneum was at any rate to be found and this succedaneum—what was it a verbal statement by the attorneygeneral against misconception against misrecollection no security time requisite for consideration thus denied and for this miserable advantage such as it is the course taken so extraordinary—not to say though so i should expect to find it unprecedented ii so much for expense to public of expense to suitors a little further on now as to delay after noting en passant that of delay expense to suitors is an accompaniment inseparable mark here too the sort of relation between promise and performance promise delay minimized performance by addition made to number of stages of jurisdiction not to speak of other causes delay more than doubled to the two stages found in existence three others added and note—that while in each stage it is only in a retail way that delay is produced—it is in a wholesale way that where an additional stage of jurisdiction is the engine this nuisance is manufactured to come to particulars stages found in existence two—   immediate judicatories the courts held all upon the same stage by the existing seventy commissioners   appellate judicatory the court held by the lord chancellor these stages the only ones from chancellor to house of lords appeal none stages additional erected by the bill three total number five they here follow altogether ascendendo as before—   immediate judicatory court held by one commissioner see §       judicatories next above that—say appellate judicatories of the first meaning the lowest order two courts styled subdivision courts held by some three quere what three out of the six commissioners above mentioned court appealed from the six courts constituted by the six commissioners each acting singly as above see §       appellate judicatory of the second order the judicatory of which the style and title is the court of bankruptcy—with its four judges as above but under the name of court of review courts appealed from the two subdivision courts just mentioned see §     appellate judicatory of the third order the court held by the lord chancellor court appealed from the said court of bankruptcy under the name of the court of review see §     appellate judicatory of the fourth order the court composed of the house of lords court appealed from the court held by the lord chancellor see §    iii lastly as to uncertainty promise minimization of it performance augmentation maximization the magnitude of which bids defiance to all bounds on this head matter for a volume might be found a few specimens may it is hoped suffice at any rate they will exhibit as much as perhaps more than will be found endurable   under the head of delay mention has just been made of the immediate court held by a singlyseated commissioner as constituting the first stage but this same first stage is wrapt up in a thick cloud in §   it is stated and without room for doubt that of the six commissioners therein mentioned every one may sit and act by himself and so likewise in and by the next §   and thus we have a sort of promise or shadow of six singleseated judicatories but these same six singleseated judicatories supposing them to have existence who can say how many of them and at what time or times respectively they shall be in existence look here to the text in and by §   it is provided that the six commissioners may be     formed into two subdivision courts and this provision stands before that by which authority is given to them to act singly now then if and when of these six functionaries are formed two courts each court with three of the six in it how many will there be left to act in singleseatedness and in what cases and on what occasions will they so act the said six commissioners may be formed into two subdivision courts says §  —two subdivision courts consisting of three commissioners for each court well then these same two subdivision courts—by whom at what time or times in what manner—by means of what written instrument—are they to be formed in regard to each of these same six commissioners in whom shall be the determination—at what time and times he shall or may be acting in singleseatedness—at what time and times in tripleseatedness in company with two and which two of his colleagues in a subdivision court what a source of uncertainty all this—and moreover along with and by means of the uncertainty what a source of corruption and intrigue when the assets amount to half a million and a single debt to a tenth or a fifth of that sum what intriguing to get the case brought under the cognizance of this or that commissioner foreknown to be or for the purpose made to be favourable in the existing threeseated fourseated or fiveseated judicatories as it may be corruption in this form can scarcely have been practicable by the singleseatedness it may be seen how in this case it may be let in by the singleseatedness true but against singleseatedness no objection is thus formed for not without the help of the power of choice left thus arbitrary and the exercise of it thus unscrutable as above can corruption insinuate itself note how the cloud thickens—subdivision courts yes subdivision is the word by this word we are sent of course to look for the word division by the sort of court called a subdivision court for another sort of court called a division court by the mention thus made of these two parts for the whole of which they are parts look ever so long no such thing should we find even if instead of subdivision court the appellative were a division court still we should be sent by it to look for the whole of which division had been made actual division court decidedly and certainly established none but a sort of potential division court in nubibus hanging over the field in the clouds in the capacity of being brought into existence is this the said six commissioners says §   as above may be formed into two subdivision courts consisting of three commissioners for each court now then for and during any length of time whatsoever suppose them to remain not thus formed are they to remain idle no they constitute a court of which no subdivision nor yet division has as yet been made nor perhaps may ever be made here then we have our lost sheep—the division court we were looking for in this view of the matter the division court it should seem is the actual court to which though only by implication existence is given in the first instance potential courts latent—nothing more the two subdivision courts for be the object what it may existence it must have before it can be divided much more before it can be subdivided another puzzle according to this same section   two and no other is the number of the subdivision courts into which the six commissioners are to be formed but now comes the very next section §   by which they are made formable into a court or courts containing respectively any other number not greater than six for says the bill in every bankruptcy it shall and may be lawful for any one or more of the said six commissioners to have perform and execute all the powers duties and authorities by any act or acts of parliament now in force vested in commissioners of bankrupt in all respects as if      appointed      by a separate commission under the great seal now for a simple amendment which made so far as regards the number of these functionaries everything would be as it should be after the words any one dele the words or more and thereafter after the words in all respects as if insert the word he and dele the words or any one or more of them thus should we have single seatedness with the institution itself in all its utility and the designation of it in all its intelligibility thus moreover would be removed the cloud raised in §   by the talk about references or adjournments and sickness or other sufficient cause—references and adjournments which are to be made by a single commissioner unless he the maker thereof shall think fit otherwise to direct yes in the very act of doing the thing in one way the man who is doing it is to direct—whom—himself or somebody else not mentioned—somebody else guess who to do it in a different way at westminster school some three or four and seventy years ago i remember we used to be taught to make in latin certain socalled nonsense verses as a preparatory exercise for enabling us one day to make verses that should wear the appearance of sense in the present instance it looks as if the noble and learned schoolmaster having in the course of his studies on education heard of this was sending himself abroad to learn   0 by exercising himself in the art of making nonsense laws how one day in gods own good time to make sense laws but here the examination of this exercise must end or at least pause for if continued to the end of the bill in the same strain such is the length of the exercise that a volume—who can say of what size—might be occupied by the examination of it now for an argument which is nothing to the purpose—by the abolition of these seventy commissionerships i lose so much patronage for of the patronage substituted the value is not so great as of that which i give up answers these—  if you did your duty the patronage would not be worth anything to you if you did your duty you would in the instance of each situation fill it with that man who in your judgment was most fit for it and against that mans being most fit for it by whose filling it you would get anything the chances are as infinity to one   supposing however that the situations in question are moneys worth to you and that for indemnifying you for the loss of this moneys worth you ought to receive a compensation patronage is not the shape in which it ought to be given to you the shape should be—that of an equivalent addition made to the salary attached to the office why this shape answer because in addition to the evil produced by the institution of these worse than useless offices—so far as regards emolument to put you in possession of a quantity of emolument to a given amount will cost the public more if given in the patronage shape than it will if given in the officialsalary shape   as to patronage under the generally established system taken as it is so far from affording a security against unfitness it operates as a security for unfitness for be the object of the patrons bounty who he may the less fit he is for providing subsistence for himself in and by any other profitseeking occupation the more pressing is the need he has of the relief that would be afforded him by the official situation whatever it be   but not content with the profit of interestedness nothing will serve you but you must have the praise of disinterestedness would you deserve it every penny then must you give up of this useless—this so much worse than useless—patronage this praise of disinterestedness what is it that you want it for only that under favour of the delusion spread by it you may obtain the profit of interestedness to the greatest amount possible not that it is any opinion of mine that you ought to be made to act as if you were disinterested not that i want you to be made to lose any part of the emolument lawfully and honestly attached to the situation to which you have given your acceptance it would be against a fixed principle of mine—the disappointmentpreventing or as far as prevention is impracticable minimizing principle—that allcomforting principle—firstborn of the greatesthappiness principle—that principle which affords the only reason nor can there be a more substantial one for securing to every man his own whatever it may be—black men and white men in a state of slavery excepted now as to expense to suitors to this topic reference was made in speaking of the expense to the public alas poor suitors correspondent to the disinterestedness of the noble and learned arbiter of your fate is the tenderness of the mercies to which on this occasion you are consigned within the allenveloping cover of the ruleandordermaking power which you have seen is concealed the power of plunderage without stint nothing legislated upon accordingly everything left to be legislated upon and whether by a noble and learned person whose relish for fees has been so conspicuously selfdeclared any labour or ingenuity which can contribute to convey to the watering mouths a treat so delicious is likely to be left unemployed is a question the answer to which may be left to any person whose patience has carried him thus far in the perusal of these pages preeminently delightful to the eyes of a learned lord or gentleman is the case where within his grasp there exists already a fund to draw upon in this predicament are in general the cases by which the forty millions of pounds or thereabouts now in the court of chancery have been placed in it when the hands in which is lodged the money composing the remuneration for the labours and merits of learned lords and gentlemen official and professional are those of trustees—persons to whom no part of it is understood to belong—in this state of things at parting with it no such pang is generally speaking felt as is felt by those in whose case the money taken out of their pockets is their own always excepted the case in so far as it has place where the trustee out of the money placed in his hands for the benefit of others makes money for himself at each fee under the name of costs pumped out of him a party or proprietor of the money does feel a pang and as ruin approaches may at every stroke of the pump give a squeak the fund has no feeling and takes it all in patience in an ordinary case—not a farthing but in the shape of a fee is capable of producing a denial of justice and such has been the effect of it in every instance in which the     farthing has been unobtainable and such it has been in the instance of every man from whom by the machinery of what is called justice the uttermost farthing has been extracted in an ordinary case—though one of the parties is always in a state of sufferance another may be in a state of enjoyment and in this state is every man who by the everready and neverfailing assistance of learned lords and gentlemen official and professional keeps the money of another in his hands but in a case of bankruptcy all parties on both sides are in a state of sufferance and affliction in bankruptcy court accordingly learned lords and learned gentlemen have for their accommodation this agreeable circumstance namely that from this part of the field of plunderage no cry of denial of justice is wont to issue out of this so convenient tank how many horsepower is that of the pump which the learned lord so skilled in hydraulics will on this occasion put to use to his own discretion has everything of this sort been left by him but eyes there are which are upon him as he will see and to such objects the eyes of succeeding honourable gentlemen are not likely to be quite so stoneblind as at all times have been those of all their predecessors now then for the fees which are provided by this act that is to say by the act passed by the lords alone and in a part thereof of which the representatives of the people have not as yet october   been allowed to see anything §    for a fiat in lieu of a commission of bankrupts to the lord chancellors secretary of bankrupts £ 0 quære by whom this money is to be paid this is not mentioned §    fees to be paid—quære for what—nor is this mentioned—£   person by whom it is to be paid the official assignee time immediately after the choice of assignees by the creditors      out of the first monies which shall come into his hands quære how are they to be got into them person to whom it is to be paid the accountantgeneral money taken out of the pockets of those afflicted persons for a commencement and to a certainty £   now for other sums not certain nor ascertainable which by this their said lordships bill are destined to be taken out of those same pockets first comes the sum of one pound and for what and how many times to be repeated answer who can i who am copying it am utterly unable the clause follows in these words—   for any sitting of the court of bankruptcy or of any division judge or commissioner thereof other than the sitting at which any person may be adjudged a bankrupt   or any sitting for the choice of assignees   or any sitting for receiving proofs of debt prior to such choice   or any sitting at which such bankrupt shall pass his or her examination   or any sitting at which any dividend shall be declared   or any sitting at which the bankrupts certificate shall be signed by the commissioners doubts pour in here in torrents the one pound—is it during the whole of the proceeding in the case of the bankrupt in question to be paid once and once only—or is it to be repeated the figures are here inserted for the purpose of expressing the number of the times at which according to my conception it was intended to be repeated then as to the word other the brackets here inserted show how far according to my conception the application of it was meant to be carried but there is nothing that i can see that can prevent its being carried on to the end namely to the end of the clause here distinguished by figure   then as to the application and import of this important word any the requisition made by it—will it be satisfied by one pound once paid namely for the sitting which for the purpose in question is on each occasion mentioned—or on each such occasion is it to be multiplied by the number of the sittings on this last interpretation the meaning at any rate the effect of the word any is the same as that of the word every† the stock of uncertainty and unintelligibility afforded by this same   d section is not yet exhausted for here comes a mass of selfcontradicting nonsense a parallel to which could scarcely be found even in the whole statute book in line    of this section stand the words that have been seen to wit or any sitting at which any dividend shall be declared hereupon in the very next line but one—namely in line   —come these words—to wit and for every such sitting at which a dividend shall be declared the sum of three pounds now for a lesson in arithmetic to     the any one pound add every three pounds what will the sum be nonsensical as it is here at any rate may be seen one conclusion that may be deduced from it and is incontrovertibly warranted by it here then for the purpose of giving increase to money poured into lawyers pockets increase is given to expense—to factitious expense and for the purpose of this increase increase given to delay likewise so many sittings at each of which a dividend is declared so many three pound fees for this service rendered to the profession at the expense of the afflicted a premium offered to all those in whose power it is to earn it this in performance of the promise made in §  —that the rights       be enforced with as little expense delay and uncertainty as possible so much for these same fees and the pockets out of which they are to be pumped but now what is it that is to be done with them short answer given to the noble and learned author of this bill to do with them what the duke of newcastle claims a right to do with his own that is to say what he pleases for the long answer see lords bill section    person to whom they are to be paid the lord chancellors secretary of bankrupts—     paid     to a separate account to be entitled the secretary of bankrupts account and all monies to be paid into the said account shall be subject to such general orders touching the payment in investment accounting for and payment out of such monies for the purpose hereinafter provided as the lord chancellor shall think fit to prescribe there ends this   st section by this provision an instrument to the consideration of which the mind is unavoidably led is that over which when into a certain court money is to be paid the money it has been said is told the instrument is a gridiron and the court is the court of exchequer meaning the court called the receipt of the exchequer for the telling of these monies what is it that his lordship may think fit to prescribe animate instrument—animated by the £  00 ayear—animate instrument part and parcel of his live stock his abovementioned secretary this is already settled but the inanimate instrument—part and parcel of his dead stock—this remains to be settled the gridiron if that be the species of instrument employed for the business of this tellership—what shall the individual instrument be shall it be the one kept as above in the exchequer and from thence borrowed or shall it be a bran new instrument kept for the purpose in the court of bankruptcy under the care of the said lord chancellors said secretary of bankrupts—in which case with the help of a little improvement à la mode de brougham it might moreover be made to serve for the telling of the forty millions which in some way or other are already at his lordships disposal and in the mean time till a proper gridiron can be made might not that gridiron be borrowed which had he not forgotten it a prophet of these days was to have broiled himself upon and which cannot but remain clean as a penny not having been put to its destined or any other known use but now as to mr secretary—the lord chancellors secretary of bankrupts—i know not whether i have not his secretaryships pardon to beg somewhere before this so i cannot but suspect i spoke of him as having nothing to do it seems now to me that he has a great deal to do—he has all this money—this mass of money to an unknown amount—which he is continually to be receiving and which is by him to be paid once aweek or oftener for the learned stomach cannot stay long as the lord chancellor shall think fit to direct     to a separate account to be entitled the secretary of bankrupts account  what i have humbly proposed as above is that of all the abovementioned fees of the receiving and disposing of which the sole occupation of his secretaryship seems to consist not one should be torn from the afflicted persons interested and should this my humble proposal be acceded to this occupation of his secretaryship—this his sole occupation—would be gone before parting with his secretaryship one more curious circumstance in relation to him i cannot forbear noticing under what title is it that his £  00 ayear is thus given to him is it under the title of secretary to the court of bankrupts no but under the title of the lord chancellors secretary of bankrupts but by this same bill the court in which the lord chancellor at present takes cognizance of bankruptcy business is suppressed and the business of it transferred to that same bankruptcy court he is therefore as it should seem a sort of amphibious animal living in two media at once and in despite of a maxim of holy writ and common sense serving two masters before this topic of expense—expense by fees extorted from the already afflicted suitors—is dismissed note well one circumstance by which were it the only one the sort of feeling this measure was brought forth by and all along nursed would be instructively indicated of the stock or say fund out of which these fees are to be drawn—namely the aggregate amount of the assets got in by the assignees—what is the magnitude answer a magnitude so variable that while in some instances it has amounted to half a million or more in others it has been     so small that the fees thus destined to be extorted would absorb the whole of it behold here how by men in power their fellowmen are operated upon and worked at as if they were deal boards the money thought of—that and nothing else by men themselves without feeling without feeling for other men their fellowmen dealt with and operated upon as if they had none who shall say in how many instances if this bill of the lord chancellors passes into a law in how many instances the whole of the bankrupt debtors property instead of being divided among his creditors will be snatched from them and put into the pockets of the said lord chancellors creatures but all this about the fund for fees is but a digression it is high time to return speaking of the house of commons bill everything i said is there left to be legislated upon to be legislated upon and by whom by whom but the noble and learned author of the bill and how and where does this appear answer in the bill printed by order of the house of lords yes to that instrument which is the expression of the will of the house of lords and of the house of lords alone—to that instrument have i been obliged to resort that being the only instrument in which it is declared how it is and by whom that the money which belongs to the afflicted—to the insolvent debtors and their creditors—is to be disposed of into two parcels is divided the money to be drawn from this so preeminently scanty source parcel the first—fees     such says the bill §  0 as are provided by this act parcel the second—such it continues as are set forth in any schedule of fees to be settled and allowed from time to time by the said court of review with the approbation of the lord chancellor and to be certified by them to both houses of parliament mark well—settled and allowed by the said court of review with the approbation of the lord chancellor of this presently settled and allowed and how settled and allowed on the present occasion in this §  0 of the lords bill this is not said what is here settled is by whom by this we are sent upon the lookout to see how it is—that is to say by instruments how denominated—by these conjunct authorities other matters are settled turning to §   we find that what is there appointed to be done is to be done by rules and regulations to be made in pursuance thereof we are thus brought to these same rules and regulations on which occasion i venture to assume that the sort of instruments thus denominated are meant to be the same with those which in §    are denominated rules and orders for regulating the practice of the court of bankruptcy and in §    by the word rules though in this case without the word regulations or the word orders be they called what they may now comes the question—by what authority are they to be made answer on different occasions by two different authorities namely on the one occasion by §    by the court of review with the consent of the lord chancellor on the other occasion by §    by the chief and other judges with the consent of the lord chancellor on the first of these two occasions the subjectmatter of regulation is unlimited and allcomprehensive in the other it is limited—confined to the nomination of official assignees now for the difference between the two authorities and the final cause of that same difference the court of bankruptcy is the authority by which these same allcomprehensive rules and regulations or say rules and orders are to be made oh no but the court of review and why not by the court of bankruptcy and why by the court of review why not by all four judges—why by no more than three of them and those three the three puisnes styled by the somewhat whimsical title of other judges perfectly intelligible when once mentioned though somewhat recondite reason this—namely that by this means with the convenience and benefit of secresy of procedure of which presently the noble and learned author of this bill might be enabled to savour the sweets of arbitrary power not by the court of bankruptcy are these rules and regulations to be made but by the court of review and why not by the court of bankruptcy answer because that in the court of bankruptcy there must be four judges—namely the chief judge and the three other judges and why by the court of review answer because as per §   the said judges or any three of them shall and may form a court of review any three of them which three may therefore be the three puisnes is it then for no reason that on this occasion when rules and regulations or say rules and orders are to be made the chief judge is so carefully left out oh no it was for a very important reason it was to secure obsequiousness and under and by virtue of such obsequiousness with secresy as above for a common cloak wraprascal—absit verbo invidia—was at one time the name of a species of large cloak to secure to his own noble and learned self as above announced the delight of savouring the sweets of arbitrary power not forgetting fees the judge who is thus left out has no higher seat to look to the three judges who are taken in have each of them that same higher seat to look to they are each of them in the case of a bishop     of gloucester or oxford with canterbury and york in view not to speak of those bishoprics such as london and winchester which are also blessed with an extra portion of that mammon by which the gates of heaven are shut against the possessor to speak more particularly and plainly for i wish to be understood in the three possessors of the £ 000 ayear each he beheld so many aspirants to the situation which affords £ 000 ayear a thousand ayear though it be but in expectancy being thus part and parcel of the premium for obsequiousness for being on all material occasions according to the so constantly pronounced formulary of the same opinion subintellecto with my lord chancellor—rebus sic stantibus on any such material occasion for the purpose of any practical conclusion and operation can the existence of identity of opinion be regarded as exposed to doubts for producing this same identity on different occasions different instruments have the approbation of this our legislator in the case of twelve men who be they what they may are rendered infallible by being put into a box the instrument in addition to the box is torture in the case of the three men termed other judges who must have eaten a hundred dinners in one or other of four great halls and remained alive at least ten years after the last of those same hundred dinners the instrument is £ 000 ayear in expectancy the £ 000 ayear hanging in the air before the eyes of their respective minds as does the new jerusalem in the eyes of certain believers in this latter case the instrument is not in its nature quite so cogent as in the former case but it is sufficiently effective for all practical purposes and is to all parties a much more pleasant one nor let it be forgotten how variable are the members of the body by whom on different occasions the several sets of rules and regulations or say rules and orders may be made nor in what a degree on his lordships will and pleasure the composition of this same body has been made by him on each such occasion to depend they may be made these rules and regulations on one occasion one set of them by the said three other judges on another occasion by any such two of them as it may please his lordship to choose with the addition of the chief judge on ordinary occasions this will of course for the reasons above mentioned be the said three other judges but on this or that extraordinary occasion a case that may happen is—that of the three one having disappointed expectation and being on terms more or less rebellious with his creator may run rusty while the chief of the four creatures continues to be everything that can be desired had his lordship given to these his three puisnes the power of thus legislating by themselves he would have had no pretence for having on this allcomprehensive occasion anything to do with them had he taken the power to himself alone the disposition would have been too glaring still more revolting altogether in the teeth of precedent and completely exposed to responsibility wrapping them up in the same cloak with himself and that a cloak of secresy he metamorphosed his mace into a wand and the court of review into the den of cacus and here peradventure in addition to the £ 000 ayear patronage may be seen a reason in a certain sense for the adding the three so much worse than needless and useless and in respect of number unprecedented judges to the one needful and exclusively customary one i have said—in the teeth of precedent for not more filthy in the teeth of reason is the arrangement than in those of precedent for in what instance on the occasion of the power exercised by the making rules and orders as the phrase is have the judges of any one of the courts called superior courts found themselves under the necessity of obtaining the consent of any authority superordinate to their own and in particular to that which stands next above them the bag is now cut and the cat—has she not been let out of it now for a most curious mess of muddleheadedness to save the brains of the reader from the rack before the riddle i feel it necessary to put the solution it is this—in the draughtsmans conception the idea of the species of judge called a commissioner is confounded with the idea of the entire of this newlytobeengrafted branch of the judiciary establishment—it is confounded with the idea of the whole of which this same commissioner is a part so much for the solution now for the riddle in §    of the commons bill behold how the commissioners are spoken of as being members of the court of bankruptcy as well as the judges and be it enacted says the bill that the said judges and commissioners of the said court of bankruptcy shall in all matters within their respective jurisdictions have power to do so and so had it stood as follows that is to say the said judges of the court of bankruptcy and the said commissioners shall c the absurdity and confusion would not have had place was this a slip of the pen an oversight of the clerk or an error of the press to one or other of these causes it would of course have been to be ascribed if with no more than the ordinary degree of inaptitude the bill had been penned but in a bill in which proofs of such nevertillnowexemplified inaptitude are so abundant no absurdity     can be too gross to be ascribed to the penner or penners of it so much for the solution now for the riddle this same court of bankruptcy—who are to be the members of it the chief judge and three other judges says §   and this so far as it goes is perfectly intelligible but in the lords bill §    mention is made of a judge under the name of a division judge now then who is this same division judge—what is the court in which he is to sit—where is the bench on which he is to sit none does the lords bill by whom he is created mention air—thin air—or a vacuum—a still thinner substratum—is the seat on which his sittingpart will have to rest however as he himself is but a fictitious entity† not very severe it is hoped will be the suffering produced by the want of it when speaking of courts—that of the two halves—the subdivision courts—the bill gives us no integer no such court as a division court having been instituted or mentioned by it has been already noticed see p     in this same   d section however we have this same division judge be he who he may in his character of english judge he will be a harpy—and being so a harpy in addition to his wig and furred gown he will have wings with these wings he may keep fluttering over the court in which the chief judge and three other judges are sitting waiting to receive at the hands of his noble and learned creator his existence talking theology to the other inclusas animas superumque ad lumen ituras of whom virgil singeth one day let us hope—one day in his noble and learned creators own good time we shall know who he is—he will appear to us in the flesh—some individual composed of flesh and blood with two feet and save and except harpys feathers as above without feathers we shall see and hear answering to the name of mr division judge shall he for example be mr solicitorgeneral by whom the said bill is admired so sincerely defended so stoutly and understood so perfectly in the first edition of the commons bill his divisionjudgeship does not make his appearance but in the second edition of that bill which in so many points is so different from the first he does and in this second edition the number of this section is not as in the lords bill    but    so that on maturer thoughts this same division judge in his abovementioned state of imaginary or say potential existence the honourable and learned recommitters of the bill—who as above observed understand manufacturing a bill of twentytwo folio pages as the phrase is in no time mr attorneygeneral shall we say and mr solicitorgeneral—the chosen of the noble and learned creator—yes in their maturer thoughts this same division judge though nothing upon earth do they give him to do they are determined to have so much for the division judge in §    of the lords bill and in    of the commons bill second edition mentioned now for the commissioners in those same places mentioned the court of bankruptcy having been mentioned what is the style and title given to him answer commissioner thereof the court of bankruptcy being the last antecedent now in what sense or senses if commissioner thereof is it possible he should be so two only say i namely that of member thereof and that of person commissioned thereby which latter sense by the bye is but a strained one let any man produce to me a third sense that will bear examining—erit mihi magnus apollo lastly this same word or by which in its quality of conjunction copulative the division judge and the commissioner are coupled together in which of two senses is it to be understood that which is called the disjunctive or that which is called the subdisjunctive if the disjunctive then are there two sorts of these functionaries meant if the subdisjunctive then one only these two names being each of them a name by which that one person is denominated in this latter case instead of or i should have written or say in a word unless otherwise provided for he would die of inanition in which case peace be to his manes how then shall he be provided for he must be metamorphosed into the sort of harpy called a sinecurist now then were it not for the solution given at the outset—of everything which in the commons bill first edition is said of these same commissioners what would be the result answer that severally and collectively these same commissioners six in number are and are not members of the court of bankruptcy in such its quality and in its quality of a court of review and     that they have and have not a right to sit in it another curious operation to perform and which were there time for it should on this present occasion be performed is the determining in what cases the several commissioners six in number are authorized each of them to act singly and in what other cases one is indeed authorized to act but no otherwise than in conjunction with another fellowcommissioner or two others or others in some number greater than two for the present this operation must be dismissed but of this state of things enough is said already to constitute a ground for the following practical conclusion which in the form of a question will be deduced from it comes accordingly the question which to the noble and learned author of this bill presents itself for an answer according to a position laid down in that speech of yours made from the bench on declaring your resolution to swallow up your vicechancellor and the master of the rolls manyseatedness and in particular tripleseatedness is preferable to singleseatedness in judicature and accordingly now on the occasion of the instituting of a swarm of judicatories for taking cognizance of the bankruptcy business for no other advantage than what you expect from the superior aptitude of manyseatedness in the case of the superior court for no other advantage is it that you quadruple the expense while in the case of the court below it—in the case of the court of immediate jurisdiction in which all the business will be begun and so let us hope at least by far the greatest part of it ended you employ manyseatedness and singleseatedness promiscuously as if in regard to aptitude of judges and consequent effect upon the rights and welfare of suitors there was no difference if not promiscuously but with distinction—then of the distinction which you make—giving the jurisdiction as you do in some cases to the one in other cases to the two the three the four the five—what is the ground now for a mass of entanglement—a very plica polonica look to the court of review look at its functions what are they entangled in a most curious manner with those of every other in the cluster of five courts—with those of the court of bankruptcy its superior with those of its subordinate the division court supposing it to have existence—with those of the two subdivision courts—with those of a commissioner acting singly—with those of the commissioners acting in courts composed of any number of them not exceeding the six—with those of the lord chancellor—and with those of the house of lords this same plica polonica—what hand shall disentangle and unravel it answer this question who can one sad answer may and with but too wellgrounded confidence be made namely that by every touch of the comb will be made to flow the blood of afflicted patients in the first edition of the commons bill the sections in which this same court of review is mentioned are §          0           0                before these pages are at an end i may perhaps print one after another the several clauses in which mention of this same court of review is made meantime let it be noticed that of all these sections it is in the last—it is in the   th of the first edition of the commons bill that a finish is put to that unintelligibility by which this bill may be seen so preeminently distinguished from and above everything that ever went before it secresy—secresy in judicature to this subject and the anxiety betrayed by the noble and learned author of this bill to envelope his own proceedings and the proceedings of these his new judicatories allusion has already been made and explanation promised for this explanation the time is now come secresy—secresy—secresy in judicature and to an unlimited extent sought to be established by law established in an act of parliament now when reform of parliament is the order of the day am i awake—can this be yes here is the passage and it is in this same §   and forms a tail to it—not being of importance sufficient to form a section of itself—and the said subdivision courts may sit either in public or private as they shall see fit unless where it shall be otherwise provided by this act or by the rules to be made as hereinafter mentioned if as hereinafter proposed the two subdivision courts were blown away this abomination this practice and power copied from the holy inquisition court would therefore be blown away along with it for on no one of these same six commissioners acting singly is this power of unbridled maleficence conferred but no these are not the only hands in which this right of doing wrong is lodged so early as in the second section it is established and lodged in the hands of the four judges of the court of bankruptcy or any three of them acting under the title of a court of review which says §   shall always sit in public save and except as may be otherwise directed by this act or by the rules and regulations to be made in pursuance hereof now as to any direction to a different effect no such direction is there in the act but as to direction to this same effect an instance has as above mentioned just presented itself to my astonished eyes secresy thus endeavoured to be made to envelope in its baneful covering this part of the field of judicial procedure and this part     that in which if not above all at any rate above most others the benefit of the light spread over it by publicity is greatest by publicity it has been said the temple of justice adds to its other functions that of a school a school of the highest order where the most important branches of morality are enforced by the most impressive means a theatre in which the sports of the imagination give place to the more interesting exhibitions of real life sent thither by the selfregarding motive of curiosity men imbibe without intending it and without being aware of it a disposition to be influenced more or less by the social and tutelary motive the love of justice without effort on their own parts without effort and without merit on the part of their respective governments they learn the chief part of what little they are permitted to learn for the obligation of physical impossibility is still more irresistible than that of legal prohibition of the state of the laws on which their fate depends no other subjectmatter the observation has been made to me and it is my expectation that i shall find reason for acceding to it no other subjectmatter of judicial procedure is there from attendance at which to numbers of men in so large a proportion information and warnings so useful might be derived frauds for example of which premeditated bankruptcy has been the instrument—imprudences by which step by step in the road of prodigality men have been led to insolvency as to the sittings of commissioners under the existing practice they are public and open in appearance but for the purpose of any such information as that closed in effect such is the hubbub and confusion—the same commissioners acting in two or three commissions alternately in the same minute of all other judicial proceedings of any importance reports are published published—not only in books but in newspapers of these proceedings in which money by hundreds of thousands is disposed of scarce ever is any account visible or accessible true it is that under the existing practice at the commencement of the proceedings a meeting—that is to say of the commissioners—a meeting to which the name of private is given has place and at this stage of the proceedings meetings in the plural is the word sometimes employed but this stage passed there ends everything private whatsoever was meant by the word now of this same privacy what is the need or use to this question in no one of the works on the subject of bankruptcy have i been able to find an answer is it lest were the proceedings public from the affirmation made of the debt the reputation of a solvent trader should receive injury—is it lest an insolvent and about to be and properly declared bankrupt should withdraw his person or more or less of his property out of the reach of the power of the court into the propriety of any such alleged justification the present occasion does not call upon me to inquire sufficient is it to observe that under the existing practice at this stage of the proceedings whatsoever be the meaning or end in view of it the privacy is at an end after it come the meetings to which is given the denomination of public meetings and the one only judicatory in which by law or practice authorization is given to privacy of procedure is that of the commissioners of whom there are either three four or five—never fewer than three—whereas by this bill authorization is given to the sittings as well of the four or three bankruptcy court judges as to those of the commissioners when as per §   formed into their two subdivision courts well but this same lord brougham and vaux that now is—this henry brougham that so lately was—and who at that time was among the besttempered and besthumoured of mankind—can you lay your hand upon your heart and deliberately pronounce him determined upon the exercise of acts of secret tyranny and cruelty—the most maleficent of all the deeds of darkness oh no no deliberate plan of tyranny no hardness of heart only a little giddiness of head such as a sudden elevation is so apt to produce father forgive them for they know not what they do who has not heard of this heavenly prayer and who that has any remembrance of what henry brougham so lately was could be so hardhearted as to wish to deprive him of the benefit of it not but that it does appear that at the bottom of all this secresy in which he was thus putting it into his power to envelope the proceedings there was some sinister design and in particular some feegathering design for assuaging his hunger and thirst after—what shall we say—not righteousness but the mammon of unrighteousness either this or else that while penning these two sections in the second of which he returns to the charge and care of secresy he was thinking either of nothing at all or of something which was nothing to the purpose for example—london universities—uncommunicated or useless under the nature of useful knowledge—or hydrostatics—or some theorem or problem of pure mathematics for the instruction of the royal society or lastly that not caring to be at the trouble of so wearisome a job as that of penning a paulopost     future act of the legislature on the composition of which millions of money and the fate of tens of thousands of men women and children would every year have to depend—he shot down the load upon the back of this or that one of his dependents who was seen to be in possession of a pair of shoulders but by accident happened not to have a head upon them ah ministers ministers deep may be your regret when you come to learn what the people think of you for having at such a price as the forcing through of this job purchased the support of this one indiscriminate defender of right and wrong by the indiscriminate utterance of truth and falsehood had he been left where you took him from you would have had less amusement given you by personalities but by how much less would have been the majority against you in the house of lords some of you—i know not how many of you—have while writing this i hear felt this same regret i forgive you may the people forgive you yes but on no other condition than that of your throwing jonas overboard or making him into a scapegoat and sacrificing on the altar of justice him by whom justice herself is endeavoured to be sacrificed—sacrificed to his own sinister interest the country kept thus long in a ferment—and for what for no better a cause than the forcing through parliament this one job and you says somebody to me—and you who are thus crying out against secresy—in your proposed codes are there no instances in which you authorize it oh yes instances there are to be sure but in no instance is any such authorization given without special reasons and few and narrow indeed are those instances nor any one is there in which the secresy has not its limits in respect of time and that in such sort that in no instance can the secresy be applied to any abusive purpose but that the abuse will sooner or later be brought to light and the authors subjected to condign punishment in every judicatory of whatever by any person concerned is said or done in relation to the business minutes will be taken word for word as in select committee of the house of commons now for the proposed amendments to give them in terminis and with application made to the text would occupy more time and space than the exigency admits of for conveying a general conception of them the following short heads may serve—   strike out all the superfluous situations namely in the court of bankruptcy those of the three puisne judges—and those of the secretary with his two clerks   whatsoever be the number of the commissioners let them all on every occasion act singly   six being the number regarded as sufficient for the whole of the business taken at its maximum—appoint in the first instance some smaller number suppose three with power to each to appoint a depute sitting in the same manner as his principal by himself and during a probationary year serving thus as it were as an apprentice and as such serving without pay reason  st no man who in his own opinion is not fit will accept the office between the several deputes emulation will have place each of them being a candidate for a commissionership so many deputes so many rival candidates the commissioner principal would see it to be his interest to depute whatsoever man appeared to him to be the fittest why because the greater the fitness of the depute the greater his chance of being appointed commissioner  d by appointing a depute so fit as to be appointed commissioner he would thus and with honour exercise patronage if not so fit as another he would have no patronage if conspicuously unfit instead of patronage his lot would be—disgrace behold here the securities afforded for appropriate aptitude confront with them those constituted in §   by years of standing and in §   the nugatory formality of a vague generality oath   for each commissioner acting singly as above whether principal or depute let there be a registrar   when a commissioner deputes a commissioner depute as above let him appoint a registrar depute to act under that same commissioner depute the registrar in like manner serving his probationary year gratis   to take and keep an account of everything which is said or done in the course of the procedure—such in general conception is the business of a registrar   let the appointments of the several principals be as in the bill by the king but with special mention of its being at the recommendation of the chancellor the state of the case would not thus be different from what it is at present but by the declaration thus made of it responsibility to public opinion would be fixed upon the chancellor much more strongly than at present   no fee to be taken by any functionary high or low of either court on any pretence for every fee so received punishment as for corruption or extortion or both a fee to a subordinate is still more mischievous than     the same fee to his patron the patron has it in his power and the fee makes it his interest to maximize the number of the occasions on which the fee shall be received and this without being seen to do so every fee allowed to be taken by any subordinate functionary of whose situation the judge is patron is a premium on the manufacture of expense by the judge of expense as also of delay namely for the purpose of magnifying the number of the occasions for fresh fees and thence for increase to the expense it is by the having given this shape to the remuneration that the existing state of things in respect to the judicial establishment and system of procedure has been produced a state of things in and by which to so vast a majority of the people justice has been utterly denied and to all besides sold at an extortious price   let lot determine the order in which the business as it comes in shall be carried before the commissioners that is to say which commissioners shall be the first to appoint a depute which second and so on when each has thus appointed his depute if ulterior bankruptcies remain to be taken cognizance of let lot determine the option of appointing ulterior deputes as before and so toties quoties on this plan is there any danger of a superfluity none whatever by appointing any depute over and above the number likely to be found needful no commissioner would have anything to gain were he to do so he would discredit himself and disoblige the depute or deputes already appointed by him  0 as to official assignees let one such assignee be appointed with a salary as in the case of a commissioner with power to appoint deputes as need called for them as above or else for every commissioner principal as above establish an official assignee principal of these two arrangements the former is the most simple each such depute should be removable at any time instanter by each one of his three superiors namely his principal any commissioner under whom he had been officiating and the bankruptcy court judge without this arrangement prodigious would be the difficulty of determining what is the number of these trustees necessary and thence the aggregate amount of the pay necessary to be given to them as also of obviating abuse on the occasion of the intercourse between these functionaries chosen by the government and the assignees chosen by the individual parties as to the relation and intercourse between the official assignee and the nonofficial assignees this is a subject naturally loaded with no small difficulty if either can act without the other the tying them in any way together cannot have any use if neither can act without the other no limit can be assigned to the delay with which the getting in of the assets and the distribution of them may be clogged but by the probationary system above proposed this difficulty will at least be much lessened if not entirely excluded the natural causes of delay will be brought to view and by the view taken of them the natural and appropriate remedies will be suggested under the system established by the bill—of the official assignees of whom from the second edition of the bill it appears there are to be thirty with emoluments in relation to which not a syllable in that same second edition have i been able to find out the business the emoluments in so far as constituted by fees would of course receive every possible extension as occasions happened to present themselves under the hereproposed system not only to the several situations of commissioner and official assignee but to that of lord chancellor also would this check upon abuse apply itself more conspicuously than it would be otherwise would his reputation be at stake upon the aptitude of the choice made by him of commissioners and official assignees by the choice made by him of commissioners and by every choice made of an unapt deputy a commissioner would show that in choosing him the lord chancellor had made a bad choice and so in the case of an official assignee proportionable to the efficiency of the security against abuse afforded by this arrangement would of course be the aversion to it on the part of his lordship for it would narrow the arbitrariness of his lordships choice and operate as a check upon the appointment of unfit and worthless dependents flatterers parasites and other favourites a proposition having for its end in view the optimizing the judicial establishment with its procedure and maximizing the happiness of the people under it—a proposition which has for its end in view the abolition of the sacrifice of the interest of all besides to the sinister interest of lawyers along with that of the ruling few—at the sound of a proposition so horrible i behold learned and honourable gentlemen how little less than all that the honourable house contains all thrown into convulsions      appeal from every commissioner to the bankruptcy court judge jurisdiction to him—immediate none none but this appellate    power to the judge from time to time to establish rules and orders intimation given—that wherever on the face of it the need of the rule is not plainly obvious—reasons annexed to it are expected at his hands no   0 blockhead so stupid as not to be able to pen rules for which no reason need be given—while by the thus imposed obligation of giving reasons—by this obligation though not of the sort which by jurists is called a perfect one is established a test of aptitude for the legislative function thus exercised a test the tendency of which is—to drive from the task all who are conscious of want of aptitude for it    power to lord chancellor at any time to repeal or say disallow no matter which be the word any or all of the rules and orders so established power to him at the same time in relation to the subjectmatter of them to substitute new ones on his part likewise intimation that in both cases reasons are expected under the existing practice be the rules and orders of a judicatory ever so mischievous the mischief is without remedy without remedy applicable by any hands other than those of parliament by this means responsibility is fixed entire—in the first instance upon the bankruptcy court judge then after him upon the lord chancellor whereas were they to concur in the establishment of the several rules and orders the responsibility would be divided and by the division greatly weakened not to say destroyed    all these rules and orders as well those of the lord chancellor as above as those of the bankruptcy court judge let them be certified to the two houses and by the house of commons printed of course with the other papers for the use of the members with additional copies of the same impression to be exposed to sale the cheapest way would be to print at once under the care of the functionary by whom these same rules and orders were made the whole number of copies necessary for the use of the members of both houses and for sale one copy authenticated by the makers signature being transmitted to each house notice thereof being at the same time published gratis in the several newspapers    as to salaries let not any one of them commence till the business of the court in which they are to be earned has commenced commenced in each instance by the actual appearance of a suitor in that same court—under the bill as it stands this act it is said shall take effect from and after the passing thereof as to the appointment of the judges and other officers hereby authorized and as to all other matters and things from and after the eleventh day of january next gloria patri glory to the noble and learned father of this bill to secure the payment of the salaries nothing is there that is necessary to be done for them under this act let any man whose patience has carried him through the foregoing observations and in particular those under the head of uncertainty judge—whether the business by which the salaries are required to be earned would be able to stir a step stuck so fast as it will have been seen to be in the mire of nonsense    at any rate let the duration of the act be but temporary—say three years in the practice of parliament a provision to this effect is as everybody knows in frequent use not many surely can have been the occasions on which any stronger demand for it than on the present occasion has had place this same principle of probationership—the applications made of it being moreover followed by choice made out of the probationers—let it be considered how vast the extent is to which it is capable of being applied to the filling of official situations and in the character of a security for the maximum of appropriate aptitude and still more in the character of a security against the maximum of correspondent inaptitude—let it be considered whether the beneficence of it be not correspondent to that same extent proportioned to its efficiency in that character will of course be the horror inspired by it into the minds of all expected protégés to whom their respective consciences present a certificate of inaptitude item into the minds of all expected patrons to whom their respective consciences present a certificate of intended abuse of patronage in conclusion of this not as yet completed list of proposed amendments comes now one word on the subject of fourseatedness suppose the necessity of it to the exclusion of singleseatedness established as a principle—behold the consequence in case of singleseatedness for a system of local judicatories embracing the whole kingdom money enough suppose it agreed can be found in case of fourseatedness not on this supposition what is the consequence that by this artifice accessible justice is impossibilized factitious expense and delay eternized still as now and so for everlasting justice denied and sold—sold to the best bidder for such is always the rule and the result the largest purse is sure to carry it this is the design of which i stand forth and hereby accuse the noble and learned head of the law this is the problem of which i accuse the noble mathematician of having proposed to himself and at the end of it written q e f     as yet so general not to say universal is the preference given to what is old and bad how bad soever to what is new and good how good soever—so generally current even among wellinformed men the aphorism too good to be practicable—that the more firmly i am assured that the above proposed arrangements would if adopted be productive of the effects intended and that taking them in the mass nothing rational can be adduced in opposition to them—the more thoroughly am i assured that in the existing house of commons reformpreaching as it is all adoption of it is hopeless nor will it be less so so long as the head of the law stands upon the shoulders upon which it stands at present oh grudge him not his pension of retreat oh no anticipate it—make him a pont dor too long and too wide it cannot be—so he does but consent to pass over it and who then shall be his successor happily of his name all mention is as needless as to him it would be unpleasant to him who in nothing which on this subject has by this pen been written has had any the least participation nor perhaps at this moment knows of the existence or so much as of the design of it taught by tacitus this splendour i throw around him speaking of statues præfulgebant says the roman historian if i do not misrecollect him—præfulgebant brutus et cassius eo quod non visebantur now as to fees as to fees the lords bill said nothing the commons bill in the first edition of it as little in the second edition comes the list of fees why not till the second edition answer because at the time of its being delivered in the determination having been taken to burry the bill through both houses with a precipitation in such a case altogether without example it was seen that all examination of it would thus be rendered the more assuredly impossible obscurity here as exquisite as ever of these lawyers sweetmeats—to suitors pills so bitter—the list is divided into two schedules items in schedule i  0 in schedule ii    sources from whence the precious matter is drawn—that is to say operations and written instruments—in eight of the twelve items of the second schedule upon the face of them the same as in the first in three of those eight instances for one and the same operation the fee in the second schedule is as above different from what it is in the first of course reason never having as yet been able to find its way into an act of parliament—for no one of all these differences is any reason assigned and as to the cause for this also we are left to conjecture as to the question in which of the five courts instituted by the bill instead of two the fees are to be paid in schedule i nothing is said in schedule ii namely in item   mention is made of the court it is the court of review so likewise in item   in that instance it is a subdivision court schedule i bears for its title these words—the first schedule of fees before referred to—referred to where this is not said the title of schedule ii is—the second schedule of fees before referred to—where referred to is not said of this obscurity the cause it is true lies in parliamentary practice—in the shapeless shape given to bills—the shape in which sin appeared to milton division none object of reference accordingly none to the noble or honourable and learned draughtsman or draughtsmen all that can be justly imputed is—the advantage taken of the obscurity and the confusion produced by it in this stygian darkness one thing alone is clear and that is the determination to maximize the weight of the burthen heaped upon the afflicted now for proof of fees in the instance of which it is the interest of those to whom the power is by this bill given to give increase to the number of the occasions on which they are received or to the quantity of the matter in proportion to which the amount of the fee receives increase behold the seven examples following—   in schedule i item  —for every order on hearing £    0   in schedule ii item  —for every order pronounced by that court namely the court of review as per the last preceding item £    0 a word here as to the instrument here denominated order in these two cases is it the same thing or a different thing no bad subjectmatter for litiscontestation this—that is to say should the feegatherer of any one of the five courts other than the court of review claim a fee to this amount for an order thereof which is not an order for hearing   in schedule i item  —for every previous minute of order £0     in schedule ii item   0     note—that for every order there will of course be a previous minute thereof   in schedule ii item  —for entering every matter for hearing in a subdivision court £0   0   in schedule ii item  —for every order pronounced there £0   0 note now the fees of which they being payable on the occasion of a written instrument exhibited the amount will increase with the number of the words in each such instrument as well as with the number of the instruments which can be contrived to be elicited     contrived as above by rules and orders of the lord chancellor and his confederates the three puisnes or by the practice of the judge or judges of the several courts in or by which these instruments are respectively exhibited   in schedule i item  0—in schedule ii item   —in both schedules the description of the source of the fees is the same—namely for copies of affidavits orders and other proceedings per folio of ninety words £0 0  ½ in these three halfpence behold the premium which so many learned persons of whom one is noble and divers and sundry others honourable are giving themselves for every ninety words they can contrive to get put into these several written instruments taken by itself this sum three halfpence is no great matter but many littles says the proverb make a mickle and four of these littles constitute more than many a debtor or creditor has for a days sustenance and when taken from him will deprive him of it   in schedule ii item  —for fees on the trial of every issue to be paid by the successful party £  0 0 here presents itself a puzzle—this anxiety to place the load on the shoulders of the successful party whence comes it this party according to every natural presumption will be the party in the right and in the mind of every man this presumption will be the stronger the higher his opinion is of the aptitude of the judicatory by which this same thing called an issue is to be tried the judicatory—that is to say in this case a jury and in the opinion of the noble and learned author of this bill how much lower than the seventh heaven is the place occupied by a jury of what sort of men soever composed so there be twelve of them and the twelve put all of them into a box this penalty why thus imposed upon a man for having been by a jury pronounced to be in the right then as to pockets—the pocket or pockets into which this same £  is to find its way to find its way—in the first place immediately—in the next place ultimately where are these same pockets—whose are they to be be this as it may the court is in this case the court of review and the judge before whom the issue is to be tried is one of the judges thereof so says §   of this second edition of the commons bill now then to what purpose other than the feegathering purpose is organized the complication produced by the mention thus made of the word issue can any bounds be assigned to the amount of the property in relation to which in the ordinary course of things in every days practice questions of fact have been decided upon by the existing commissioners and will have to be decided upon by the new commissioners and without this predatory formality of sending the question to be tried by an issue if in those instances the mode employed in determining this same question of fact is a proper and sufficient one—how can it be otherwise than sufficient in any of those instances in which these learned judges are authorized to load the suitors with the burthen and their own pockets with the benefit of this tax then again—in the case in question is the established fiction to be employed—the fiction of a feigned action in a court of common law with the fees the expense and the delay attached to it for the shutting the door against this moneysnatching lie so regularly told by judges and their accomplices i see no promise in this bill nor to my recollection has the door been shut against it by any act of parliament were the practice a common one the abomination constituted by the chancery and socalled equity proceedings could not even by the somuchtoopatient people have been thus long suffered but of the twelve good men and true with the burthen imposed on them as well as on the suitors—where in this case not to speak of other cases is the need not to speak of use true it is above all price is the institution of a jury and that on two distinct and widely different accounts one is—the publicity it has been the means of securing to all proceedings in which it has place the other is—the veto with which at the price of submitting to torture and committing perjury it enables the people to so great an extent to paralyze tyrannical and liberticide laws and judicial practice but on which of these two properties will the noble and learned author of the bill lay his finger as being on the present occasion not to speak of former occasions the property by which the institution has been recommended to his favour and that with such effect as to have produced this his determination to force it into this branch of business to which it has hitherto been almost if not quite a stranger thus to force it in and thereby to put this additional instrument of evil into the hands of every malâ fide suitor—every dishonest suitor who knowing himsel to be in the wrong trusts to the relative and comparative indigence of an opponent for his success assuredly to neither of the positions by which these two properties are pronounced beneficial will he subscribe which being the case should he venture to attempt a justification of this arrangement he will find himself reduced to his old aphorism—namely that provided they be in number twelve and all twelve put into a box in a chamber called a court of justice not a box in the operahouse—men no one of whom had ever been in a court of judicature in his life will understand the business of judicature better than     a man who has passed half his life in the practice of it here follows an extract from the selfpublished speech of henry brougham esq spoken in honourable house february the  th      on moving the local judicatory bill— page   —there are two observations sir which i have to make relative to the judges generally and which i may as well state now i am upon that subject i highly approve of paying those learned persons by salaries and not by fees as a general principle but so long as it is the practice not to promote the judges which i deem essential to the independence of the bench and so long as the door is thus closed to all ambition so long must we find a tendency in them as in all men arrived at their restingplace to become less strenuous in their exertions than they would be if some little stimulus† were applied to them they have an irksome and an arduous duty to perform and if no motive be held out to them the natural consequence must be as long as men are men that they will have a disposition growing with their years to do as little as possible i therefore would hold out an inducement to them to labour vigorously by allowing them a certain moderate amount of fees i say a very moderate amount a very small addition to their fixed salary would operate as an incentive and if this were thought expedient it ought to be so ordered that such fees should not be in proportion to the length of a suit or the number of its stages but that the amount should be fixed and defined once for all in each piece of business finally disposed of‡ i am quite aware that this mode of payment is not likely to meet with general support especially with the support of the reformers of the law but i give the suggestion as the result of long reflection∥ which     has produced a leaning in my mind towards some such plan i throw out the matter for inquiry as the fruit of actual observation and not from any fancy that i have in my own head but i may also mention that some friends of the highest rank and largest experience in the profession agree with me† in this point—men who are among the soundest and most zealous supporters of reform in the courts of law   d feb      mirror of parliament p  0 —the fourth principle‡ and the last     with which i shall trouble your lordships at present is to provide where it is possible and i know not why it should not always be possible that judges should be remunerated     for their labours it relates to the remuneration of the judges and their subordinate officers and they ought to be well remunerated for if you would have men fit for the station     of judges the high and intellectual species of labour you expect from them ought to be amply but not extravagantly paid for but what i say in point of principle is that generally     speaking their remuneration ought to be by salary and not by fees so much for mr brougham come we now to lord brougham—mirror   d february      p  0 —when you remunerate a judge by fees according to the steps of procedure you expose him to the temptation of encouraging delay and expense in order to increase his own emoluments and thus in theory at least if not in effect you set interest in opposition to duty to be sure the judges in the higher courts are not apt to be swayed by such feelings from the straight line of their duty whatever be the temptation they are men standing in a high and conspicuous station—men selected for their unspotted and unimpeachable integrity† as well as for their great experience and general fitness‡ for their exalted stations they are likewise under the observation of a watchful public∥ and a jealous bar§ and many of them have seats in either house of parliament¶ where they may be called upon as responsible officers to explain any part of their conduct which may be considered objectionable nevertheless i am of opinion that public men however high their character may be ought not to be placed in circumstances in which their interest     comes in conflict with their duty but even if it were certain that his interest would succumb to his duty it is of the greatest importance to avoid placing a judge in a situation where he must be an object of jealousy and wary suspicion such are the grounds on which i contend that even the higher judges† who act under the eye of a watchful public and jealous bar and who are themselves men of learning and integrity the least likely to be swayed by interested and selfish considerations—that even they ought not to be placed in situations in which it is possible for any one to suspect that they can have any other object than that of the diligent active and impartial performance of their respective duties now if this be the principle which ought to be kept in view in reference to the higher judges it is still more important to act upon it in reference to all inferior officers of justice they do not stand upon such high and open ground—they are not so much in the view of the public—they are not so immediately responsible to parliament—and they ought to be emphatically excluded from such situations even if the judges are not there is one nicety in regard to this point which ought to be noticed a judge doing his duty under the eye of the public will be induced to perform it well and diligently since upon its due and diligent performance will depend his fame and estimation with the public and this although he should be remunerated by a salary and not by fees but it is not always the same with inferior officers and i am told that in ireland where an alteration similar to that which i propose relative to the judges has been made some inconvenience has been felt from remunerating inferior officers by salaries instead of fees for it is said   0 that the consequence has been that these officers are disposed to earn their salaries more easily than and not so well as formerly and that they do not perform their duties so actively as if their remuneration depended on fees but i think the true distinction may be made and the line drawn somewhat in this direction those officers may be made dependent on fees altogether where the multiplication of the fees shall not depend on their own discretion mirror   d february      page    —if those allowed to remain were made not dependent on fees that would be an improvement february         mirror p    —in page     immediately before the mention of     a bottom mount up to the text and therein thus you will find it written—that noble and learned lord lord eldon laid a report on the table of this house respecting the taking of fees as salaries in which on examination your lordships will find some excellent principles laid down another report was presented to the house in the year      in which the subject of fees is again taken up it is there said that no inquiry should be made whether a fee was claimed by established practice but whether it was one which ought to be continued and if it was not it should be cut off accordingly it was recommended that some of the fees then existing should be abolished and amongst others those called copyfees as unfit to be continued i might also instance the recommendation of the chancery commissioners in     —that fees as salaries in most cases should be done away with   d february      mirror pp        —bottomed on these recommendations i propose to your lordships that no fees shall in future be taken by the masters and i would     have those of the clerks so regulated as never to exceed a fixed maximum and that while all great temptation† to multiply forms and create delay and expense to the suitors are     removed enough will be left as a fair stimulus to the speedy dispatch of business   d february      mirror p    —these high incomes from fees are not confined to the masters their clerks also have incomes averaging about £  00 ayear each two have as much as £  00 there is only one who has as little as £ 000 because in his case i think very properly it was refused to allow any fees to be taken i must own i look upon those gratuities† as they are called as in every respect most objectionable if i were not disposed to adopt a circuitous mode of describing those sums as gratuities for administering what is called justice i should be tempted to call them by that brief but expressive name by which the public would call them—bribes and i shall be able satisfactorily to prove them such to your lordships these gratuities or whatever other name they deserve are not taken by the masters i wish they were as then the high character and station of the master would prevent the imputation that for such things justice was sold in one of the highest of our courts i could wish that even in that case the temptation did not exist but in practice the taking them by the master would not have the same bad effect as in the case of the clerk page    —you do not do so in other cases—in the court of kings bench for instance you pay the judges out of the consolidated fund it may be correct to take these fees from the suitors to levy on them all the expenses of the proceedings it may be proper to make chancery suitors pay the judge on the bench and pay the expenses of the chancery court it may be right that the suitors should be taxed—all this i will admit‡ but then i contend that no more     should be taken from the pocket of the suitor than goes to pay the expense of the court and judge instead of this however i recommend you to make the judges of the     court of chancery an annual ample allowance and to discontinue the present clumsy unjust method of raising from the public and from the suitor three times as much as would pay the one master and the one masters clerk which are all that are necessary while by doing which you reduce the masters to the positive necessity in these matters of increasing the expenses—not that i blame the masters—i blame the system my lords these form the bulk of the changes which i contemplate effecting and i have only shortly to refer to what i hope will prove to be the benefits to result from their operation and these are—a better decision of causes—a more full possession by the creditors of bankrupts estates—a more speedy administration of justice to such creditors and to all persons interested—a great diminution of business and delay in the court or chancery—and even eventually probably the saving of one of the judges in that court   d february      mirror p    —i beg to remind your lordships that if i have cut off seventy places from those in the dispensation of the lord chancellor i have also cut off £ 000 or £ 000† ayear from his emoluments     his emoluments arising from bankruptcy amounted to the sum of £ 000 or £ 000 ayear every farthing of which will be cut off by the bill i am about to introduce what has been seen belongs to the account of regularly received benefits now as to the sort of benefit casually received in the shape of patronage   d february      mirror p    —first of all there will be an immense reduction of official patronage the scheme will convert seventy places at present in the gift of the great seal into ten page    —but if twelve be not too many—and they have to examine evidence and perform many other important duties—and if two masters ought to be added we shall cut off seventy offices and have an increase of eleven we shall cut off seventy small offices and we shall have a remainder of eleven large ones     your lordships will not suppose that these two descriptions of offices are the same for a man who delights in patronage who wishes to indulge kindly feelings seventy small offices are much more convenient than eleven large ones he can give away the seventy small ones among his friends he can oblige† a colleague with one but he cannot he dares not make a judge of a man who is incompetent‡ be dares not go himself into a court over which he has placed an unfit person at present the persons who are made judges are not made by favour they are not obliged by the choice and god forbid that they should hold their office by any other title thus by this arrangement seventy places are lopped off from the patronage of one of the ministers of the crown great diminution will also take place in other departments of the court in addition to those which i have named but wishing to understate the advantages of the plan rather than indulge in any exaggeration i omit them for the present by my propositions delay will be abridged decisions improved in quality and their dispatch promoted and expense will be considerably lessened going even upon the bare supposition that nothing finds its way into the pockets of suitors except the saving resulting from the abolition of fees   d february      mirror p    —it is quite clear that these parties who are compelled to contribute the heavy expenses which arise out of chancery suits are the last persons whose interests as connected with the pecuniary cost of legal proceeding has been yet consulted the total saving in one branch of the bankrupt department will be £ 000 ayear the expenditure in the office of secretary of bankrupts being reduced from £ 000 to £ 000 and the whole reduction in all departments connected with bankrupt affairs after due provision for the new court amounts to £  000 ayear net saving of fees to suitors   d february      mirror p    —but it may be said—oh you are taking great pains to reform the expenditure of this court but you are taking excellent care to keep the chancellorship to yourself for nobody competent to fill the office will take it with the reductions you have made in it very well but is it to be supposed that i should have consented to give up the money arising from my professional exertions and consent to support the burthen of the peerage if i was not to take some fair chance of compensation my lords i could not afford to do it       permit me however to add my lords first and last once and for all that if i suggested any increase of the emoluments of the great seal i would rather add to the retiring pension† of the lord chancellor than i would augment his working salary       th october      mirror p  0  —the lord chancellor       i cannot help observing that i have heard with really great concern that some imputations—i will not say imputations for i hope i may consider myself above imputations—but that some cavils have been raised out of the house with respect to my motives in bringing forward this bill and i regret the more sincerely that such cavils should have been raised because they have been entertained by persons for whom i am bound to pay every respect and particularly by one person—a gentleman of great learning a personal friend of mine—a man of extraordinary learning the father of the english bar and the father of law reform and he says that the anxiety which i have evinced and which i still feel to pass this important measure looks as if i were snatching at a patronage of £  000 ayear besides the patronage of the great seal but this apprehension of my excellent friend arises i must say from a total ignorance of my nature and i will add too of the provisions of this bill† i have only substituted for a patronage of £  000 ayear one of £  000‡ in addition to this i have surrendered the patronage of two sinecure places of £  000 or £  000∥ per annum so that by the operation of this bill there is a great diminution of the patronage and advantages now belonging to the keeper of the great seal now again for a battle—a second battle—between the principle of singleseatedness and that of manyseatedness scene of action the commissioners court problem to be solved—in what cases or say on the occasion of what sorts of business is employment by this bill given to commissioners acting singly—in what other cases or on the occasion of what other sorts of business is employment given to commissioners in numbers greater than one—that is to say two to six inclusive sections on this occasion to be looked to in the first edition §     so likewise in the second edition in which they are the same word for word   look at §   the said six commissioners it says may be formed into two subdivision courts consisting of three commissioners for each court after that it says and all references or adjournments meaning probably and adjournments by a single commissioner to a subdivision court by virtue of this act shall be to the subdivision court to which he belongs unless c here if only by implication at any rate beyond doubt we have a singleseated court authorized   look now at §   in every bankruptcy prosecuted in the said court of bankruptcy it shall     be lawful it says for any one or more of the said six commissioners to do so and so provided always that no single commissioner shall have power to commit c otherwise than c here then we see authorized singleseatedness doubleseatedness trebleseatedness quadrupleseatedness quintupleseatedness     and sextupleseatedness six different courts for the more effectual exclusion of uncertainty as promised in the preamble   look now at §    every fiat prosecuted in the said court of bankruptcy shall be filed it says and entered of record in the said court and shall thenceforth be a record of the said court and it shall thereupon be lawful for any one or more of the commissioners thereof—namely of the court of bankruptcy in which are these six commissioners it seems as well as the four judges—to proceed thereon in all respects as commissioners acting in the execution of a commission of bankrupt save and except as such proceeding may be altered by virtue of this act   look to §  0 it shall be lawful says the bill for any commissioner who shall make any adjudication of bankruptcy to appoint two or more meetings instead of the three meetings directed by the said recited act† for the bankrupt to surrender and conform the last of which said meetings shall be in the fortysecond day by the said act limited for his surrender‡   look to §    in all cases says the bill in which power is by this act given to any one of the said commissioners to act such power may     be exercised by the said chief judge or by any one of the said other judges and where any such judge so acting would in case he were a commissioner make any reference or adjournment to a subdivision court such reference or adjournment shall be made by such judge to the court of review instead of to a subdivision court here again may be seen singleseatedness singleseatedness mentioned manyseatedness not   look to §    place and words the same in both editions subjectmatter official assignees here again may be seen it is true manyseatedness in all its nine degrees but not the less true is it that so also may be seen singleseatedness the proceeds in question the bill says shall     be possessed and received possessed before they are received by such official assignee alone save where it shall be otherwise directed by the said court of bankruptcy or any judge or commissioner thereof†  00   look to §  0 any one of the six commissioners may says the bill adjourn the examinations of any bankrupt or other person to be taken either before a subdivision court or the court of review or if need be before both courts in succession     and may likewise adjourn the examination of a proof of debt to be heard before a subdivision court which said court shall proceed with such lastmentioned examination after that in this same section comes a proviso that in case before the said commissioner or subdivision court both parties     consent to have the validity of any debt in dispute tried by a jury which by the bye they will not do unless they are egregiously misadvised an issue shall be prepared under the direction of the said commissioner or subdivision court and sent for trial before the chief judge or one or more of the other judges and if one party only applies for such issue the said commissioner or subdivision court shall decide whether or not such trial shall be had subject to an appeal as to such decision to the court of review† before this fruitful section is dismissed another rather singular provision in it must not be left unnoticed not content with authorizing and requiring the judge or judges in question to adjourn or say transfer the matter in question to a judicatory at his or their discretion it authorizes and requires them respectively to do this favour to two judicatories in succession one after another thus producing the effect of an appeal whether the parties or any one of them is desirous of it or no in other words although  0  it be against the desires of all parties interested—any one of the said six commissioners says the bill as we have seen may adjourn the examination of any bankrupt or other person to be taken either before a subdivision court or the court of review or if need be before both courts in succession and may likewise adjourn the examination of a proof of debt to be heard before a subdivision court   look to §    if such commissioner† or subdivision court says the bill shall determine any point of law or matter of equity or decide on the refusal or admittance of evidence in the case of any disputed debt such matter may be brought under review of the court of review by the party who thinks himself aggrieved and the proof of the debt shall be suspended until such appeal shall be disposed of and a sum not exceeding any expected dividend or dividends on the debt in dispute in such proof may be set apart in the hands of the said accountantgeneral until such decision be made and in like manner there may be an appeal on the like matter of law or equity from the court of review to the lord chancellor‡   look lastly to §    in and by this section the crown may be seen put upon the aptitude of singleseatedness and not absolutely and merely is its aptitude recognised but also the comparative superiority of its aptitude in comparison of tripleseatedness and quadrupleseatedness look on till you come to the words one commissioner and then observe the feats which his commissionership is rendered capable of performing∥  0   0 look to §  0 no—the last preceding was not—this is—the concluding article—the article by which a close is put to the list of the proofs given of the virtual recognition which by the noble and learned advocate of manyseatedness has thus been virtually made of the aptitude—not to say the superior aptitude—of singleseatedness after what has just been seen this progress it must be acknowledged is but an anticlimax but the list—the whole list—having been undertaken to be given will naturally have been expected to be seen and without production of disappointment could not be left uncompleted this section has for its subjectmatter the case where a bankruptcy being by the act found lying under the cognizance of the existing commissioners is transferred to that of the five new courts now instituted to the six commissioners each of them singlyseated are it will be seen in and by this section given the two powers following—  power the first—power to appoint says the bill some one of the aforesaid official assignees to act with the existing assignees   power the second—power to direct says the bill the existing assignees to pay and deliver over to such official assignees in the plural all monies c thus far the bill but direction is one thing compliance is another thing and suppose that in consequence of such direction compliance has not place what then is to be the result answer exactly that which for the remuneration of learned labour is to be desired motion will have to be made in the appropriate court say the singleseated commissioners court—motion to show cause why the said monies c are not so paid and delivered over which motion being there decided upon may or may not be carried upwards or upwards and downwards into the scale or pile of appeals above delineated and thus it is that to that pile which can never be too high—namely the pile of remuneration for the services and merits of noble and learned lords and gentlemen—a correspondent addition will be made as it is with hogarths prints so have i found it with this if not inimitable let us hope neverabouttobeimitated bill look as often as you will—look again—new interesting objects will you find in it till this day october the   th not more than five judicatories had i observed to have been established by the bill in lieu of the two which it found in existence on looking into a section which had escaped me—namely section  th i find by it another judicatory added namely that of a master in chancery yes that of a master in chancery and so far so good but does the matter end there oh no for from the decision of his mastership lies of course a virtual appeal—under the name of exceptions to his report—either immediately or through the medium of the vicechancellor to the lord high chancellor in his quality of supreme judge save and except the house of lords in matters of equity so that thus we have not one only  0  but three more stages of appeal all costs of suit says §   between party and party in the said court of review shall be at the discretion of the court and shall be taxed by one of the masters of the court of chancery all costs of suit and to the sum of these sweet things what limit is there that can be assigned by the blessing of god upon learned industry to thousands of pounds in any number may these same costs be made to amount and out of the stakes constituted by the bankrupts assets and played for as a pool of fish at pope joan by noble and learned lords and gentlemen—out of this fund and no other shall these costs be taken semble que non and if not then by the creditors in lieu of the so much in the pound to be received comes so much to be paid so much as to everything that has any immediate application to the particular matter here in question that is to say to the merits and demerits of the bill now passed into an act but in the course of this inquiry has unavoidably been started another question—no less than whether under the present head of the law as between melioration and deterioration of the whole mass taken together deterioration is not of these two opposite results unhappily the most probable now then important as is the principal question still more so as everybody sees—incalculably more so—is this collateral one to him so long as he continues in that highest of all high law situations—to him belongs so far at least as concerns prevention the attribute of omnipotence without his concurrence—or at least permission—for no melioration to any considerable extent can be seen any chance for no melioration worth mentioning much less for an allcomprehensive one of any beneficial effect the production so far as it depends upon him depends upon the conjunct existence of two states of mind—inclination and ability and if inclination be absent ability—all the ability imaginable—will be of no use if it be by an interest opposite to that of the community that his conduct is guided inclination will be—not on that but on the opposite side disinterestedness as the word is commonly understood is the quality not of him whose conduct is not determined by any interest for that would be a mariner whose vessel never sails but in a calm but of him who on the occasion in question is not under the guidance of any interest opposite to that of the community at large to the possession of this quality he has been and will be seen to be laying claim as the old law phrase is continual claim into the validity of this claim the inquiry now continues itself by himself—by any one for him—will this contestation be complained of he has himself to thank for it by him has the gauntlet been thrown down by this inquiry it is not thrown down but taken up so much for inclination what now if the other requisite—ability—be wanting likewise as to this some judgment the reader is prepared to form already meaning always appropriate ability for as to oratorical talent supposing inclination opposite so far from being the better law reform would be all the worse for it to return to inclination of what in the shape of patronage his lordship has given up and per contra of what he has gained mention has not in any other than general terms been thus far seen made now for particulars in the customary order profit comes before loss but in the present case the most suitable order is—loss before profit here follows the account—  0  patronage given up as follows—   commissionerships  0    average annual emolument of each £  0   average number of vacancies every year†      hence average value of the whole number of the incomes the right of appointment to or say in one word the patronage of which is given up—that is to say the value in the hands of a man who has it in perpetuity £   0   average number of years continuance of the same man in the chancellorship  ‡    years purchase which an annuity for eight years is worth between   and   for round numbers and ready calculation say∥    six and a half would be more correct but the thus assumed number   being the same on both sides the difference will not be material    hence total value of the patronage given up £ 0  0  —this being the average value of the four salaries namely the above £   0 multiplied by the number of years during which according to the abovementioned calculation the right of appointment may be expected to remain in the same hands  † as per report from individuals by whom observation has been made of the vacancies which occur from all causes whatsoever—from vacancies occasioned by changes and promotions as well as by mortality by tables of mortality it would not as i have been told be so much as   cause of the difference in the instance of the functionaries in question vacancies produced by changes and promotions ‡ taken from the list of keepers of the great seal as per beatsons political index ∥ by report of an official accountant consulted for this purpose about  editor illegible number ¶ £   00 in a tract intituled the bankrupt act with introduction notes and index—by a barrister p    the sum at which the total is set down is £  000 and no more a slip surely either of the pen or the press per contra      patronage gained as under—   new functionaries       aggregate of their salaries¶ £   00   average number of vacancies every year being as the number of new functionaries    to that of the former functionaries  0 say for round numbers    that number being  † this will be onethird of   namely  ⅓    hence average amount of the salaries placed every year at the disposal of the chancellor by the vacancies of that year £   0  —which sum to give the total value of his patronage over and above that of the appointments already made will be to be multiplied by   as below    average number of years continuance of the same man in the chancellorship as per contra say  ‡    years purchase which an annuity for eight years is worth as per contra∥     hence total present value of patronage exercisable in future  £ 0  0 hence total value of the patronage gained £    0 patronage given up  0  0 net profit after deduction of the patronage given up  £    0 thus is the value of the patronage gained more than three times that of the patronage given up so much for calculations and results now for objections to them vast says somebody—vast it must be confessed are these sums vast accordingly would be the value of the patronage in question—the patronage gained by the noble and learned author of the measure—supposing this same sum actually received by him but for the supposition of any receipt at all at any rate of any receipt approaching to the like of any such amount what ground will you find yes if he had children and grandchildren all of whom he had to make provision for and would have made provision for out of his own means had it not been for this resource but for any such supposition is there so much as the shadow of a ground not much answer i not much—i must confess but neither by this confession is  0  confessed the impropriety of placing the sum in question to the account of profit gained in the first place—the question of chief practical importance though it is but a collateral one being as above shown the one relative to disinterestedness and this question turning—not upon absolute but upon comparative values namely as between matter given up and matter of the same sort gained—the consequence is that if the subjectmatter in question were mere moonshine it would not the less be entitled to a place in this account in the next place this is one of the occasions to which the old saying about meal and malt applies if he has it not in meal he has it in malt if he has it not in money he has it in moneys worth reader before you lie now the two sides of the evidence which side ask yourself preponderates—his lordships his lordships cry aloud in chorus the vast majority of those whose eyes either gratitude or hope more especially the stronger power keeps fixed upon the contents of the rich box of bonbons which his lordship has the distribution of those members of the fourth estate not excepted whose high lot it has been said it is to behold a frequent knife and fork lying before them at the noble and learned table accordingly to no person so beatified is the question addressed and but for such patronage from whom would this incense—all or any of it—be received for topics for this same incense from which in this way the value of his lordships patronage receives increase can there be any demand still remaining no surely but for arguments sake suppose there were—a source from which it might receive completion and that in a manner the most satisfactory is a verse that may be seen i do not remember in what page of the gradus ad parnassum the assistant so well known to all manufacturers of the so highly valuable commodity called a latin hexameter verse it consists of a verse by which any man to whom it happens to have a fancy for taking an airing in greece at the top of mount parnassus may with all facility and as quickly as he could say jack robinson as the saying is give himself that gratification it consists of eight words which when thus put together constitute a panegyric on the blessed virgin and have the curious property of composing an entire poem of which any man who is curious enough may make himself the author the property to which it is indebted for this magic power is this the words are so selected that in every order which they are capable of being made to assume this sort of verse is composed of them the verse is this—tot tibi sunt virgo dotes quot sidera caelo it is thus by an arithmetical process that so curious an effect is produced—ringing the changes upon these eight words the following is a sample of the topics on which that same incense grounds itself— his admirable proficiency and exquisite skill in the art of disseminating useful knowledge—the sound discernment and sound judgment displayed by him in the choice of subjectmatters and operators—his skill in the creation of universities—that skill of which londinia† has already had and her alma soror regia is about to have the benefit—his complete mastery of the theory and practice of legislation as it ought to be as exemplified and demonstrated in and by his local courts bill and this his bankruptcy court bill now so happily and triumphantly erected into an act no great chance is there i must confess—no great chance is there of any honourable brougham—who smelling at the same nosegay with the lord erskine may with him in an unlearned state feed with thanksgiving on about five thousand ayear and with hope on about as much more—exonerating his noble and learned father of the whole of this expense profit in this shape it is true he has not but various other shapes there are in which he has it—shapes having each of them its beauty and in variety there is pleasure calculate who can the correspondent additional number of those whom like the members of one of james the firsts parliaments the additional patronage will throw upon the knees of their hearts for in those days hearts had knees calculate this and when your calculation is made ask yourself what when the means of sustenance are provided what is it that money is good for but to cause men to do the will of him who has it in his pocket and in a word look the world all over and say by how much is the appetite more canine for mammon in the shape of money than for mammon in the shape of power in general and in particular in the shape of patronage february         mirror p   0—the only motive by which i am actuated is the anxious and earnest wish to purify and amend the defects in the institutions of my country such is his lordships only motive nothing cares he about fees nothing cares he about salary nothing cares he about patronage nothing cares he about emolument in any imaginable shape by any one or all together of the objects by the love of which the conduct of ordinary men is to such a degree hard driven not a jog is capable of being given to his immoveable mind  0  so much for the shadow now for the substance so much for makebelieve disinterestedness reader have you any curiosity to see a sample of what in relation to these same arrangements real disinterestedness in conjunction with appropriate intellectual aptitude would have produced if yes take the trouble to read what follows—   as to the number of the functionaries of all sorts this number not greater than that which has been found necessary and to find what is the number necessary proceed in manner elsewhere recommended proceed upon the deputation system as above explained begin with the minimum number add other functionaries one by one as the need receives demonstration from experience in two words fiat experimentum this is what common sense when it has for its companion common honesty prescribes this is what gave immortality to lord bacon be not either ashamed or afraid to take a leaf out of the book of lord bacon   next as to remuneration in the shape of emoluments for the purpose of reducing them respectively to a minimum employ competition fear not to employ in this case that instrument the application of which has the approval of everybody in every other case this you will do unless the advice of common sense in union with common honesty be found or deemed too hard to be digestible as to emolument is that same exclusively adequate instrument so startling that blindly employed precedent is preferred to it look then to the case of the london police magistrates in that case four hundred ayear was sufficient for their emolument and therefore would be for these commissionerships as has been elsewhere demonstrated by uncontroverted and uncontrovertible reasons in addition to the demonstration afforded by the urgency of the application at all times made for these same defunct commissionerships so much for general suggestions would you wish to see them applied to particulars proceed on and read what follows—   in the immediate judicatory judge one and no more   so in the appellate judicatory   grades of jurisdiction these two and no more   appeal to the chancellor not any   appeal to the house of lords not any to this sham security exists there any person by whom an efficient and honestlymeant security would be regarded as preferable of the sort which i would venture to propose to him a model may be seen in the paper styled the parliamentary candidates declaration c purposes of it amongst others these—  to furnish to the functionary as far as it goes a distinct comprehensive view of the field to which his labours will be to be applied   to call in the aid of the popular or say moral sanction for securing appropriate moral aptitude against departure from the right path in ways to which the power of the legal sanction is not applicable   to present to the minds of locators a standard to which they may make application of what they understand to be the characters of the several persons locable whom the occasion offers to their choice locator on the present occasion the lord chancellor persons locable all persons in whose instance adequate ground has place for regarding them as endowed with sufficient intellectual and active without objection on the score of moral aptitude will it be said or thought that for the commissioners in question a more extensive portion of lawlearning is requisite than for police magistrates to any such supposition i make answer—   not more nor yet so much of these commissioners the jurisdiction is confined in the branch of law called the civil to a comparatively narrow corner of that field and with the penal branch it has nothing or next to nothing to do of the police magistrates the jurisdiction spreads in one way or other over the penal branch in its whole extent and over subbranches in great variety of the civil branch   for the possession of this so desirable an endowment on the part of his feesucking children no real provision whatsoever in and by this act does the noble and learned father of it make for the possession of this branch of appropriate aptitude no better nor other security does it provide than was provided in the police magistrates salaryraising act by the right honourable sham reformer in whose steps the noble and learned lord on this occasion at least treads blindfold eating or making believe to eat a certain number of dinners in one or other of four large apartments called halls followed by a relative fast kept holy during a certain number of years is the security with which sir robert peel in despite of all my remonstrances remained inexorably well satisfied and when in the form of a bill this same bankruptcy act was concocting all the while on the noble and learned table lay that work of mine in which the absurdity and mischievousness of that same shamsecurity stands demonstrated   on the occasion of his appointment to relevant and appropriate lawlearning no regard or next to none is ever paid it is not the fashion that which in this respect is the  0  fashion there has been occasion to hold up to view elsewhere in these pages of what is called equity what knew lord lyndhurst when the charge of dealing out that highpriced commodity in so high a grade was put into his hands what knew of it lord brougham—what knew of it lord vaux—or either of them what opportunities—what means—of such knowledge had they had—these noble and learned persons any of them no considerations styled political alias party were as everybody knows and says the cause of choice in those cases the like considerations or private and personal benefit or goodliking have of course been and will continue to be in these thus much for a staystomach until the time is arrived for application made of the allcomprehensive local judicatory system the business of this temporary and makeshift institution of a special judicatory for bankruptcy business will then be absorbed and merged into the common mass of the business of those several judicatories noble and learned eyes can you carry yourselves so far as to the other side of the tweed in scotland is there any bankruptcy court no such thing any insolvency court no such thing and the assets of insolvent debtors—are they the less effectually disposed of for the benefit of creditors no such thing in scotland had not the noble and learned father of this act if not the whole the last and finishing part of his education in his advocates shape did not—in his chancellors state have not already—those same noble and learned eyes found need to carry themselves all over that part of the island there sits moreover the lord advocate scotland—has not she a sort of attorneygeneral but with authority much more extensive than the english attorneygeneral in the person of that same lord advocate to the lord chancellor had no opportunity ever presented itself of hearing how matters stand in this respect from that same lord advocate exists there that man with whom he is in habits of closer intimacy or more constant communication than with that same lord advocate appropriate examination and for ascertaining the maximum of the pecuniary remuneration needful competition—competition among those by whom the examination has been undergone—competition that operation by which between dealers and customers prices in general are settled—these are the instruments by which according to my principles economy and official aptitude are secured and made to dwell together in perfect amity this in both departments—the administrational and the judiciary but in the judiciary in particular these form no more than a part of the securities which my code has provided for appropriate aptitude in the judiciary department for the good people at large when the fulness of time shall have been accomplished is all this information designed—all this information the object of which is—so to manage matters as to cause the interest of functionaries in all official situations to be in exact coincidence with their respective duties as to learned lords and gentlemen whose eyes are so pertinaciously closed against all such information by a compound of sinister interest interestbegotten prejudice and authoritybegotten prejudice where is the lever long enough to wrench them open to doctrines such as these when will public functionaries in general and lawlearned lords and gentlemen in particular lend a willing ear and act accordingly when the population of newgate and st giless lend a like willing ear to a sermon having for its text thou shalt not steal amend their ways and act according to those words alackaday a little more and i should have forgot to acknowledge the oath—the security afforded by that phantasmagoric cable with such care and punctuality provided for binding a functionary to his duty well then here it is not so much as one of all the whole threeandtwenty new functionaries—creatures of his lordships creation—not so much as one of them all is there by whom that same cable has not been nor of the future contingent ones by whom it will not have been swallowed in regard to qualifications and security thus then stands the matter for appropriate intellectual aptitude we have the security composed of the manducatory and the jejunial as above mentioned for appropriate moral aptitude we have the oath equivalent to which mockery and instead of noxious as that is perfectly exempt and pure from all evil would have been the loyal song of god save the king or in learned language from the grammar of the royal school at westminster the harmonious couplet—   litera si præeat vocalis pura vocatur   ceu reus impura est præeat si consona ceu rus and here in this same couplet with the word pura as a gem set in it might have been seen morality with her sister intellectuality hand in hand nonsense so far as regards contribution to the end which ought to be kept in view nonsense being the matter which that chosen formula is composed of i propose this for a substitute to it as being composed of less trashy nonsense here ends the thread of these observations and here would end the whole publication but for the demand for the reason of the change of the title from observations on the bankruptcy  0  court bill to lord brougham displayed important as is this subject there is one which is still more so and that is his continuance in the office now filled by him law reform or a sham reform—on him more than on any other man depends the solution of the momentous question which of the two shall be our lot shall it then continue or shall it cease to be filled by him this is an ulterior question a question on the answer to which it depends whether during our joint lives any fruit can with any hope of success be looked for by the labours in which my long life has the whole of it found the greatest part of its occupation and the dearest part of its hopes now then what is my situation that of a man who finds imposed upon him the painful necessity of stopping the course of those same labours for the purpose of doing what depends upon him towards conferring this benefit on his country and mankind four occurrences present themselves as the most prominent of those which have concurred in the production of this distressing persuasion—  the charity inquiry job   the advocacy of feegathering   the opposition made by him to the ballot   his education jobs   first as to the charity inquiry job for anything like a full and detailed examination of it this is not the place by a few general and leading observations the course adapted to an instructive and useful examination of it may perhaps be seen to be pointed out   so long as the judiciary system with its procedure continues to be what it is not good but evil is what the inquiry carried on as it is not according to but in contravention of the greatesthappiness principle will have for its net product   so enormous is the factitious expense of procedure in the judicatories called equity courts in which this business would have to be and is carried on—that before it had proceeded any comparatively considerable length—any length capable of contributing effectually to its professed purpose—namely the institution of a system of all comprehensive national education—parliament the nation and the treasury would naturally not to say necessarily become impatient of it and that in such sort that to prevent further effusion of the lifeblood of the treasury a bandage would be applied to it as to the patronage the persons by whom the benefit of it has been reaped are his learned brethren the profession in every branch of it to which the business has given employment in the report which on this subject has been laid before the honourable house may be seen the amount of the business with its profits for which they stand indebted to this one of his institutions on that score had anything better than power patronage and ambitionserving popularity—had in a word the happiness of the community been at the bottom of all this care of his—would he when the prospect of power and patronage had ceased have turned his back upon this same charity business and left it to deteriorate by neglect no surely now then mark well how he dealt with it   quantity of time left unemployed in the business four months out of the twelve† so says an acknowledgment made by the chairman of the board—the person whose situation rendered it his interest to make the proportion of time employed in that same business as great as possible   quantity of time professed to be employed in the journeys not more than four months out of the twelve†   quantity of time professed to be employed in digesting the documentary evidence and drawing up the reports thereupon made the remaining four months—a quantity of time equal to that professed to be employed in the journeys and the elucidation of the evidence together†   every member left at liberty to employ himself in his professional pursuits for any portion of his time at pleasure—of the time he was to be paid for at the rate of £  00 ayear at the public charge so ordains the act on the circuits not excepted actually so employed these same functionaries one or more of them one of them for and during a more or less considerable portion of his time occupied in the exercise of another office in ireland—namely that of commissioner of irish education†   by loss or destruction of documents through negligence or wilfulness charities in unknown numbers left exposed to be extinguished   no thought bestowed on the prevention of breaches of trust in this shape in time future   for the preservation of the several documents constitutive of title an act some years ago having passed the fruit of his soanxiously fostering care the object of it carried into effect in the instance of no more than a few counties and then left in the state of a dead letter three several modes there are in one or  0  more of which it is in the power of the feegatherer to make additions—and generally speaking to an indeterminate and unlimited amount—to the quantity of the depredation committed by him by means of this instrument one is—by addition made to the quantity of the written matter in proportion to which the addition is allowed to be made another is—by addition made to the number of the occasions on which the fee is allowed to be exacted and a third is—by addition made to the number of days or other portions of time at which he is occupied or supposed to be occupied in that same quantity of business be it what it may thus splitting the whole time into a number of fractions—their distance from each other determinate and limited or indeterminate and unlimited—for the purpose and with the effect of exacting a fee for each such particle of time thus giving increase to the expense imposed upon the parties interested as also to the delay in proportion not only to the number of these same particles of time but also to the distance between each of them three modes—all of them so many concealed modes—over and above the open mode by addition made to the amount of each fee so allowed to be exacted of which last the effrontery of it notwithstanding examples are not wanting by the quantityenlarging shape of the abuse is produced the maleficent lengthiness of each portion of the statutebook in the existing state of it and thence will be produced the obstruction which will of course be opposed to every proposal for the removal of it by the other the timesplitting abuse the enormity of the factitious quantity of delay with which are loaded the proposed laws termed private bills throughout the course of their passage through parliament by its quantityenlarging shape in conjunction with the utter absence of all classification and order in the disposition of the matter is produced the impossibility a man is under of coming at the knowledge of the rights of the benefit of which without such knowledge he must be deprived of the wrongs to which but for such knowledge he must without remedy remain exposed at the hands of all other individuals and the punishments which he must remain exposed to suffer by the hands of government and in short to fill up the measure of maleficence to this abuse in conjunction with the leaving the rule of action in the shape of the imaginary sort of law called unwritten law alias jurisprudential law alias common law alias judgemade law is owing the nonexistence of an allcomprehensive code on two achievements is based whatsoever can be done in the way of law reform—namely appropriate codification and appropriate judiciary establishment with its system of procedure to the last of them his lordships implacable hostility is but too indisputable it has already been held up to view to the former it is but too probable not to say certain—sinister interest interestbegotten prejudice and interestbegotten sympathy join with consistency in calling for it at his hands before him has all along lain that volume of mine in which the demand for codification and the demand for a new judiciary establishment with its procedure code are spread out in detail of the latter what use has been made by him may be seen by whosoever has the requisite curiosity and patience by all these jobs of his he has stretched out the right hand of fellowship to jobbers of all sorts whose jobs are not of a magnitude too small to be included in such an alliance giving thereby an invitation to maximize the number of the several jobs the profit from each and the quantity of the sustenance and lifeblood of the community let out by every stab thus given to the constitution in his eulogium on education—in his schoolmaster sent abroad—he may have seen and who will say of him that he did not see the schoolmaster sent abroad by him throughout all nations in the quality of collector of the customs in the shape of praise—to gather in the tribute of praise and popularity for his own behoof laying it up in store in readiness to be applied to whatsoever purpose the turnup of affairs should at any time present him with an opportunity of employing it to advantage actions are no bad interpreters of intentions yes to whatsoever purpose and already have we seen to what sort of purposes his treasure in this shape has actually been applied and by this service says some one has not great benefit been actually and already rendered—rendered certainly to this country probably even to others and for this benefit is not correspondent gratitude unquestionably his due answer not altogether so assuredly gratification yes—gratification on our part but gratification and gratitude are different things cause for gratification is in proportion to results but cause for gratitude depends upon intentions on the present occasion the question is—this allneedful benefit shall it or shall it not be received by us with gratitude and if how great soever the benefit may be the party for whose service the benefit was intended was not ourselves but himself alone what is the claim it gives him upon our gratitude ballot—what shall i say of the ballot—what of his lordships sentiments in regard to   0 it—to the question whether the opinion the wish the exercise given by man to his power as and for his own shall be the result of his own will or that of another man—of a man who acts as a tyrant over him—whether such his act and deed shall be genuine or an imposture—whether by hundreds of thousands englishmen shall remain subjected to no other option than that of each man violating his own conscience or suffering pecuniary loss to an amount to which there is no other limit than that of the whole means of his subsistence in this one feature as in a mirror behold the frame of mind of this our selfprofessed reformist after an attack made and thus made upon one of the most admirable members this country ever saw of the most highly talented profession—one of the most amiable men i can think of in private life i now take this my last departure from the subject well then this being the manner in which i deal by him what is the manner in which he deals by me and this after having seen the first part of these same observations often does it happen to him to speak of me seldom in any other terms than such as are a mixture of affection and even more than respect never in terms of the opposite description to this effect is what it has been my good fortune to hear from a variety of quarters—with what a mixture of surprise and gratitude let any one imagine had the thought of a fillip to a single individual who has thus shown how little he cared about it outweighed in my mind one of the most important ingredients in the welfare of the most extensive empire upon earth not to speak of the rest which it inhabit i should have done otherwise but considering whom it has been written by let any one judge whether anything that could be written with the view—the public and allimportant view—these pages are written with could be regarded as superfluous jeremy bentham postscript after the last word of this present work had been written a book which bears for its title the black book was put into my hands by a friend who had been witness to the writing of the pages of this work as it went on and by whom the discovery had not been made before the day of his giving the information to me it is inserted here as another piece of evidence of the nature of that adduced in the preceding note brougham henry winchelsea barrister at law the political tendencies and acquirements of this member have been so often set forth that it would be a waste of the readers time to indulge in disquisition on so trite a theme a strange fatality seems to attend every project to which mr brougham directs his efforts no one has abounded in more useful suggestions nor evinced greater and more searching powers in the exposition of abuses yet it cannot be said he has originated and carried through a single measure by which the community has been materially benefited this is a very lame and impotent conclusion after a public life of great bustle and considerable duration mr broughams exposure of the abuses of charitable foundations by which he showed the poor had been robbed of near two millions of annual revenue by bishops parsons and gormandizing corporations did him infinite honour but nothing useful has resulted from the discovery of this mine of pious plunder the learned gentleman suffered his bill on the subject to be frittered of all its usefulness     and efficiency the job got into the hands of commissioners who with enormous salaries have been perambulating the country for years under the pretext of investigation they have published thirteen folio volumes of reports and have thrown part of the property into chancery but not a shilling appears yet to have been saved from the cormorants and applied to the uses for which it was originally intended all this delay and cumbrous machinery might have been saved a single bill for a general restitution or a local inquiry by persons not interested was all that was needed i pass over the honourable members libel bill and his bill for universal education they were both so ill concocted that they pleased no party and came to nothing the last project which has fallen under his paralizing touch is the london university and even this great and salutary scheme appears either dead or struggling for life under the influence of his baneful countenance what the learned gentleman chiefly desiderates is more concentration of purpose like water spread upon a plain his great powers are lost by diffusion it is true such discursive irrigation may fertilize for a season an extensive surface but it is too weak to turn a mill or produce permanent and visible effects another cause which impedes the usefulness of this really worthy man and creates misgivings among his friends is the uncertainty of his moral and political organization he is not gay and profligate enough for a tory he is too independent for a whig partisan which doting faction never forgave him calling their late grand lama ponsonby an old woman still he is often too circumspect and personal in his pursuits for a thorough patriot or reformer and his late repulsive and snappish behaviour at appleby shows that nature never intended him for a popular leader these points are all exemplified in the honourable members wiry and sinuous career from his first introduction to mr pitt through his curvettings with the westminster reformers to his final and hopeless fixation in the whig slough of despond leaving these general touches i shall come to a subject on which mr brougham is entitled to unqualified praise i mean his efforts in favour of popular education in the promotion of this noble object his endeavours have been unceasing and invaluable and he is the more entitled to gratitude because it is a pursuit from which he can expect no personal advantage while the benefits he may confer are incalculable there is one point connected with the mechanics institutions in the success of which he takes so deep an interest to which i should wish to call his attention it is a pity i think the conductors of them should so exclusively direct their attention to the diffusion of a knowledge of the merely physical sciences without depreciating any branch of knowledge it is not conceivable how the lot of the workingclasses can be bettered by an acquaintance with mechanics acoustics electricity galvanism and other branches of natural philosophy which constitute the reiterated topics of institutional lectures the miseries of society in my opinion result much more from moral and political causes than a want of physical knowledge and power nature has given to man fertile land sun and air to produce his food and it is the waste or misappropriation of the product of these her almost spontaneous gifts that chiefly creates ignorance penury and dependence political economy is a science of general application every one as landlord merchant or workman being interested in the laws which regulate rent profit or wages it also elucidates the important relation between subsistence and population till this great problem is universally understood we cannot look forward to any permanent improvement in the condition of the people physical science may augment our productive powers new machinery may be invented railroads may be constructed and the application of steam extended still the lot of the people will not be improved wages will be no higher provisions no cheaper the hours of labour no shorter the only result being that they will be more numerous their dependent and necessitous condition remaining the same as before why too not have more frequent discourses on the medical art it is lamentable to observe how much misery results from ignorance of the human constitution—the properties of food—the regulation of air and exercise—and other means by which the health is preserved and the constitution invigorated the foundation of laws and morals might be explained and the connexion between these and individual and social happiness would open a delightful field for eloquence and elucidation history especially of our own country and more particularly that portion of it which refers to the rise of cities and towns and the emancipation of the great body of the people from a state of worse than westindian bondage would form an instructive inquiry to these might be added geology organic remains and natural history which would i think form popular themes they would liberalize and expand the mind abstract it from gross and vulgar pursuits and create an appetite for intellectual research and disquisition     i have only one more suggestion to submit to mr brougham i trust as soon as the new parliament assembles he will move for the repeal of the   geo iv c   that act which restains the sale of cheap publications by fixing the minimum of price at which they may be sold and the smallest number of square inches on which a writer may circulate his ideas this vandal law was passed during the administration of that poor illiterate and shortsighted mortal the marquis of londonderry it is nothing less than a tax on the knowledge of the poor and its injustice and iniquity can only be equalled by that which taxes the bread they eat for the support of an overgrown aristocracy such a motion is required of mr brougham for two reasons first to evince the sincerity of his wish to enlighten the popular mind secondly as an atonement for a former error when moving on one of his political tacks he launched into declamatory invectives on the seditious and blasphemous tendency of the twopenny trash it is true all the cheap publications were not conducted with absolute wisdom some of them were diabolical in their object vulgar violent and unenglish in the extreme but along with these evils considerable good resulted they generated a taste for reading inculcated a feeling of independency gave the people a glimpse of their importance in the social scale and no doubt sowed the seeds of that intellectual activity which promoted the establishment of the mechanics institution and diffused a thirst for an acquaintance with natural and mechanical truth the work from which the above has been extracted was published in october      and it can hardly have escaped observation how prominently his lordships deficiencies on the subject of the diffusion of moral and political knowledge have been subsequently developed in connexion with the society instituted for diffusion of useful knowledge and also with relation to the taxes on knowledge

stage upon stage in english and stillmore in scottish procedure stages of jurisdiction if virtual be included as well as nominal are extremely difficult to count by the appellation employed the number is very successfully disguised in respect of delay whether the removal be from a lower authority to a higher from a coordinate to a coordinate or from a higher to a lower makes no difference thus in the case of bandying as per no   each removal makes virtually a different stage by one single court so called stages may be constituted in any number in the court of session are included three distinct chambers of torture—the billchamber the innerhouse and the outerhouse so many stages exclusive of bandying in the metropolitan court all this countless number of stages after and in addition to the country stages—the sheriffdeputes substitutes court and thereafter the sheriffdeputes court with bandying perhaps as between those two courts moreover in the billchamber in vacation time sits a lord ordinary a different one in every week application for a bill of advocation or suspension being rejected by the first is presented nevertheless to the second and so on—weeks in a vacation    thus so many virtual appeals of which as not being nominal no account is taken none at least by the lawyers none unless by the feelings of the oppressed and plundered suitors see table iv c a reflection—in each individual suit and on every occasion that presents itself in the course of that suit a certain quantity of delay will for the purpose of due reflection be—in a prudential and even in a physical sense—necessary and unavoidable but to this necessary quantity—the amount of it not being susceptible of fixation by any certain rules—an indefinite quantity of unnecessary and factitious delay may come to be added by the improbity or imbecility of the judge so far as this cause of delay is concerned the boundary line between the unavoidable and avoidable quantity is plainly incapable of being drawn by any general form of words b multiplicity of judges in this may be seen a cause productive of delay as stated in letter ii in a variety of ways the most obvious of which are—the demand for such a quantity of time to be allowed for reflection as shall be sufficient for the slowest mind in the company and the demand for such ulterior quantity as may be required for discussion and debate as to this cause—that the practice of putting judges together in a multitude is not physically unavoidable is plain enough since in many instances the practice actually is avoided as to the prudentiality it is open to dispute in letter ii the negative is maintained for the reasons there assigned c appeal c of this institution the operation in the character of a cause of complication as well as delay is alike obvious and indisputable in the physical sense delay thus produced is also avoidable since in england as well as in scotland in the greater number of suits individually taken it actually is avoided as to the prudentiality here too it is open to dispute and seems to stand on different grounds in different cases as may be seen in letter v of the different modes in which a superintending authority may be exercised by a superordinate over the proceedings of a subordinate court appeal though the most generally in use is but one it may be exercised without any application ab extra as by evocation under cidevant french law on application it may be exercised before any judgment pronounced as by writ of certiorari under english or bill of advocation under scotch law exercised not only as against judgment but for want of judgment or on the ground of delay in other respects exercised viz by order to proceed and expedite a liberty property civility terms void of all apposite meaning applicable to the present subject designed by their vague generality to bewilder—by their popularity to cajole—and by the false insinuations wrapped up in them to deceive—his readers as if it were in the nature of things that either liberty or properly or civility—whatever be meant by civility probably civilization—should be served by delay which so long as it lasts and is not unavoidable is denial of justice b commerce and extent of populous territory terms almost equally void of apposite meaning if they convey any it is only in so far as it may happen to them to suggest in a vague way the idea of expatriation and that of exprovinciation as per table i causes of nonforthcomingness and thence of extra delay produced not by commerce in general but by resort to foreign states and distant dependencies expatriation may have place without commerce as in the case of irish catholics driven to seek employment in the military line in foreign countries commerce without expatriation as in the case of the quondam austrian netherlands and in the chinese empire in cidevant france the only courts which gave dispatch were the consular courts appropriated to causes considered as commercial the judges commercial men and not lawyers like the english courts of conscience and the scotch smalldebt courts they pursued the natural system of procedure but with a much more extensive range of jurisdiction—see ordonn de louis xiv avril      to a great extent among the effects of english delay is the keeping a man—and a man whose conduct has been free from blame—so much the longer in a state of imprisonment in these cases delay is as favourable to liberty as in all cases it is to commerce superabundant delay is as the tables show tables ii and iii every particle of it purely mischievous in the tables the exact shape and degree of the mischief are brought to view mischievous in all these ways to justice it is mischievous to liberty—it is mischievous to property in so far as liberty and property are dependent upon justice of the several portions of delay brought to view in table iii not one that is not in superabundance—not one that is not factitious—fabricated under the english or scottish system of procedure—not to speak of others for years together these portions of delay with the system in and by which they are generated these portions of delay in all their details those of english manufacture at least were continually presenting themselves to the eyes of blackstone with these portions of delay thus continually under his view—all of them factitious all of them therefore avoidable—he pledges his word first to his pupils then to the world at large that whatsoever delay is to be found in the english system is all of it unavoidable that the care taken of liberty property civility commerce added to the extent of populous territory are the real causes of it insinuating moreover that if any considerable defalcation were to be made from it tyranny poverty barbarism idleness and a barren desert would be the result iii     conscious of the utter falsity of this representation he calls in the authority of montesquieu and the prejudice so generally established in favour of that lively and superficial writer to gain credence for it among the young and ductile minds on which it was destined to impose montesquieu though bred a lawyer not having been a lecturer it is possible though scarcely probable that on his part the misrepresentation was not a willful one yet delays says blackstone there are meaning superabundant ones nor therefore according to him such is his candour are the complaints of delay in the practice of the law though greatly exaggerated wholly without foundation but of this quantum of superabundant delay whatsoever there may be of it where according to him are we to look for the cause of no part of it in the system itself of the whole of it in the practice of a few unworthy professors—underlings fixed upon by him for scapegoats—meaning attorneys—another gross and wilful misrepresentation of the arrangements above enumerated in the character of causes of factitious delay not one was ever the work of any attorney not one that could have been the work of any other hand but those of the authoritative planners and conductors of the system—the judges—the judges or what comes to the same thing the legislature acting under the guidance of judges or of advocates their confederates if ever in treading in the path of licensed iniquity traced out for him by these his superiors it happens to an attorney to go beyond his licence is it to those who possess no power or to those who possess all power that it is most consonant to justice and utility to impute and charge the grievance was it an attorney any more than a regard for liberty or property that created terms for instance with denial of justice for five months or circuits with ditto for six and twelve months were they attorneys that established a delayshop in which in addition to five months given gratis every mala fide suitor that chooses to pay the price buys six weeks then four weeks then three weeks time for answering a question or two that ought to have been answered instantly were they attorneys that set up or are they that keep up another delayshop in which after judgment given a years denial of justice is sold for l 0 more or less some pounds of which being received by a clerk are squeezed out of him by a judge another insinuation is for insinuation is the perpetual vehicle of his indefatigable misrepresentations that in english procedure meaning always the technical branch more time and circumspection are bestowed than under natural procedure as pursued in england and other countries time yes circumspection if by circumspection thought is meant no such thing it is the characteristic of jury trial to render not indeed the existence of thought but however the continuance of it for more than a fragment of a day impossible and of the whole number of causes determined under that system not so many as one in five receive so much as a moments thought from any one of the judges by whose authority they are disposed of so that in fact taking the whole number together not only the worst justice of peace but the worst turkish judge bestows more thought upon the causes determined by him than the best english judge speaking of commonlaw judges see letter i device   it is by time itself if the insinuation were taken for truth—by time itself—and although nothing at all were done in it by mere unemployed time that is by delay in superabundance that justice is served and her work duly executed by time according to blackstone but according to truth is it so by time employed in thought yes by time necessarily employed in the collection of evidence yes by time given along with means and notice—given to the public mind—that when importance invites it may collect its force and point it to the cause to serve as a guard to the probity of the judge here too we may answer in the affirmative but under the technical branch of the english system on all these occasions the necessary quantity of time is either denied or if allowed allowed by negligence rather than by vigilance as to the motives for the misrepresentation they are almost too obvious to bear mentioning ascribing the mischief to the system he would have had to say change the system—but in so doing he would have given offence unpardonable offence to the upholders of that system to lawyers of all descriptions whose profits springing out of the mischief rise and fall with it undermining the foundation of his own rising prosperity he would in the meantime have left himself without auditors for what is it that the bulk of mankind wish to know about the law not what it ought to be but what it is such would have been the punishment of honesty and truth now mark the reward of dishonesty and falsehood ascribing the mischief as he does to the practice of a few unworthy professors he ascribes it to the frailty of human nature an evil which so at least human nature is glad enough to have it thought lies altogether out of the reach of remedy perpetuating the mischief he thus perpetuates the foundation of his fortune and his fame accordingly here as elsewhere—not change the system not ense recidendum but esto perpetuum is at once his precept and his prayer cocceiji chancellor to frederick the great in the preface to his civil code styled projet du corps du droit frederic makes it matter of boast that under

litis contestatio predicated of every suit without exception the exploit unless by violation of the main ends of justice was physically impossible predicated of only the greater number of suits it consists in making     times as much delay as there need or ought to be in england as well as elsewhere this quackery has done knights service to the defenders of the castle of chicane the delay of a year having thus in the character of an uncommon and praiseworthy degree of dispatch been made matter of boast hence comes a triumphant defence for common law procedure under which the quantity of factitious delay is more frequently below than above that mark and the nature of things affording some suits in which by the influence of the causes exemplified in col   even that degree of pretended dispatch is notoriously impracticable—hence comes an equally triumphant defence for equity procedure under which in a suit some dozens of which might receive their termination in the compass of the same day the enormous delay of a year may at the will of any mala fide defendant be again in an enormous degree exceeded not but that so it may be and even doubled in a commonlaw suit as per table iii no    a justification to exhibit the justification—the quantity of extra delay having place in the case in question being ascertained—then if it be justifiable and if the enumeration here given of the causes of necessary delay as comprised under the ten heads set down in table i be complete—it will be found to owe its existence to some one or more of those causes conditions necessary in such case to constitute the justification are—   that on the occasion in question the matter or matters of fact referred to in the character of a cause or causes of the delay shall actually have had existence   that on that same occasion in case of necessity physical or prudential the operative force of such cause or causes shall have been considerable enough to have given birth to the necessity i e to have constituted an adequate demand for the quantity of delay actually elapsed or proposed to be allowed to elapse b causes of the evil see table iii by means of the two contrasted lists tables i and iii in so far as in any given instance the quantity of delay having place in that instance happens to be not necessary but factitious and thence avoidable its being so will be capable of being shown in two different ways—  in a direct and positive way by pointing to the factitious cause or causes to which it really owes its birth   in an indirect and negative way by reference to the list of natural causes of necessary delay accompanied with a challenge to point out amongst them all any cause or number of causes adequate to the production of the effect c registration mode of operation of this remedy the ordinary quantity see table i note c which is as much as to say the minimum quantity of delay being marked out and by reference to this standard the meaning of the term extra delay fixed and a regulation made ordaining that as often as any extra delay takes place mention of its existence shall be entered upon the register together with the cause or causes by which it was produced then supposing on this or that occasion any unnecessary and thence unjustifiable quantity to take place one of three things will have taken place viz   the mention of the existence of the delay or that of its cause or causes will in the register have been omitted—in this case the judge under whose direction the register is kept will stand exposed to inevitable censure   a fact having no existence will be entered upon the register in the character of a cause of delay in this case a false entry having thus been made the judge will stand exposed to still severer censure   a fact having existence will be entered as above—but though in the character of a cause of delay not wholly inoperative yet being inadequate to the production or at least to the justification of the whole of the quantity actually having place the judge will stand exposed to censure in respect of the deficiency n b whosoever he be at whose instance the delay is admitted to take place ex gr party professional assistant of a party or judge he will stand responsible for the truth of the matter of fact alleged by him and as to the opinion by which credence is given to the allegation and the opinion by which the matter of fact so alleged is pronounced to be adequate to the justification of the delay—for such his opinions the judge will at any rate stand responsible no quantity of unnecessary delay ever takes place without operating to the prejudice of one or other party or both thence it is that no false registration can take place or unwarrantable decision be pronounced as above but that some person will stand engaged in point of interest to remonstrate against it this of course he ought to be permitted to do and to cause his remonstrance i e the fact at least of his having made a remonstrance to be entered upon the register for further particulars concerning this proposed system of registration—the insufficiency of all direct remedies against unnecessary delay on the part of the judge under the technical and even under the natural system—and thence the necessity of this indirect remedy see letter v and the work there referred to d train of evils—see table ii and table i note c  liv dec   lib

any and if any how many went to the house of lords c as      to    of the number of appeals from the several english courts as above to that of the one scottish court on the same level with those four among the english which are courts of immediate jurisdiction the ratio must have been somewhat greater than as      to    to wit not only by reason of the intermediate stages as above but because in the above account english appeals to the lords appeals from the spiritual courts and appeals from the admiralty courts are not included the ultimately appellate jurisdiction being in these cases in the king whereas in the account of the scotch appeals to the lords appeals from the corresponding courts viz the spiritual courts called commissary courts and appeals from the admiralty courts are included causes passing from those courts to the court of session being liable to pass from thence to the house of lords  by the accounts printed by order of the house of lords—date of the order   th of march   0 —it appears that in the space of thirteen years and part of a fourteenth ending on that day of  0  appeals that had been presented only     had been disposed of viz by being heard withdrawn or for want of prosecution dismissed of which only     had been heard—that consequently the arrear that having in that time accumulated remained undisposed of amounted already to    —that the number of days employed in the hearing of those     that had been heard had in the whole number of fourteen years amounted to     making upon an average per year appeals heard about fourteen so that to hear at the same rate of dispatch the accumulated arrear alone exclusive of the growing influx would require ten years and half of another and that though by the number which when the time came for hearing would be either withdrawn or for want of prosecution dismissed a corresponding deduction would be made from the amount of those so requiring to be heard yet that that deduction would be nearly balanced by the increased length of the time employed during the last seven or eight years in the hearing of each cause—and that even if it had nothing to balance it it would not reduce to less than seven the number of years requisite—and that after all the real arrear must have been considerably greater than this amount—for in these accounts are not included such of the english appeals which are called writs of error the number of which in the three years ending in      was as per   th report of house of commons finance committee anno      p    half as great again as that of all the appeals called appeals put together in these three years the number of writs of error presented was     that of appeals scotch and english together   —that in respect of the ends of justice one consequence of this retardation was that such causes as about that time had been heard must already have been waiting for a hearing and the party in the right labouring under a denial of justice about three or four years—another that at the price of costs composed as to the greater part of fees to the officers of the house in all such cases in which the effect given to appeal is that of stopping execution viz in the case of the scotch appeal and in that of the english appeal called a writ of error every malâ fide defendant against whom as being in possession of property belonging to another judgment had been pronounced in a court below then had and still has it in his power to derive during that length of time under the protection of the house a profit from his own wrong to the amount of common interest   per cent or commercial profit       or  0 per cent according as he happens to be circumstanced—which length of time is in a course of unlimited increase  in this case in the hands of the judge the most edicient instrument of injustice may be seen in the principle and practice of nullification by which considered as applied to verdicts the effect of them is destroyed on pretences that do not so much as profess to have any relation to the merits of the cause the pretence has always been the existence of some regulation or as it is called to screen its nonexistence from notice some rule which besides that it was never fit to have existence had never—so far from having been sufficiently notified beforehand in such manner as to afford to those who were punished for not having obeyed it the possibility of obeying it—had never so much as been in existence it was on each occasion invented and set up for the purpose of the particular injustice that was to be done wrapped up in this device as in a cloak the power of english judges has under the semblance of limitation been in every part of the field of jury trial not to look at present any further little less than arbitrary and to this hour on each occasion as often as a judge is called upon to use this instrument of iniquity it is in his power to apply it accordingly or to refuse to apply it whichever course happens to be best adapted to his sinister interest if he has any if not to his humour or caprice see scotch reform letter i devices of technical procedure devices   and  0 and besides being applicable as above in repugnance to the main end of justice viz giving execution and effect to those rights which have been conferred by law it has in pursuit of sinister interest in the shape of lawyers profit been and continues to be applied throughout the whole field of law in repugnance to the collateral ends of justice viz avoidance of unnecessary delay vexation and expense  in the case of the now obsolete mode of procedure called attaint a juror could not be proceeded against but in conjunction with all the rest  attaint was indeed terrific enough involving the utter ruin of all those whose lot it was to suffer under it but to the sinister purpose here in question it was manitestly unsuitable for it could not be inflicted on the refractory twelve without the concurrence of double the number of other jurors and those rendered by their rank still more highly proof against sinister influence in every one of its three shapes † in the state trials we have a precedent of a judge a lord chiefjustice of

apostles baptized them at—with other abominations of the like stamp the juryman through the medium of whose conscience the consciences of the rest received satisfaction in this mode had made a visit

down in the books as qualified to serve as special jurymen in the county of middlesex—among them the only persons to whom so much as the shadow of suspicion can attach are those if any such there be whose names have been placed upon the select qualified list and of these the names are necessarily a secret—and that not only to the public at large but in many instances perhaps to themselves thus

there be is rotten in the state of middlesex—whatsoever human matter endowed with the requisite pecuniary qualification is in the scantiest degree provided with any such qualifications as those of

secret list if any such there be cannot but of all places be the properest place to look for it for in the character of an adequate substitute to all other requisites stands this one viz

incapacity can be seen standing out of the reach of doubt is indecision for if habitual it may in this shape stand expressed and demonstrated in figures thus suppose in a given singleseated situation three judges occupying that situation successively for the same length of time the first leaves no arrear the second leaves an arrear the third clears off the arrear that had been left by the second and himself leaves none suppose now on the part of the second the degree of indecision such that the number of litigated cases decided upon by him was not a tenth not an eighth not a sixth or suppose it were as much as a fourth or even as a third of the number despatched by his predecessor in the same length of time in such a case not only must the unfitness of such a judge for the situation be clear to everybody else to whom these propositions are known but it is impossible that it should be matter of doubt to the incapable judge himself but the judge being thus necessarily and fully conscious of his incapacity to discharge the duties of the office the result in point of mischievousness and wrongful profit is—besides the infinite and inappreciable mass of misery produced on the part of suitors—peculation to the amount of the undue profit extracted from the office the duties of which were thus left unperformed incapacity in a shape thus palpable swollen to a pitch which on the part of him who reads of it puts belief to the stretch is among the endemical diseases of the present time and not the least bitter of the bitter fruits of libel law not long ago one case of this sort came out incidentally in the house of commons see the times newspaper  th july   0  cobbetts parliamentary debates vol ix p     and in the profound indifference with which the facts were heard though exhibited in numbers to avoid ambiguity let us say in figures may be seen an argument a stronger than which can hardly be looked for by those to whom a recurrence to first principles in the constitution of that assembly is regarded as a necessary measure one instance happened thus to transpire in print from the only place from which it is possible for grievances of that sort so to transpire everywhere else libel law keeps them from the press with the degree of certainty for the securing of which libel law with its terrors was and is intended but it would be informing him of the existence of the sun at noonday were it to be said to a man of business in the profession that the one here alluded to is not the only instance in which but for the interested connivance which seals up lips within doors and the terror which chains down all pens without doors incapacity not less palpable would long ago have been brought to public light at least if not to justice  the king v

the printer of the newark herald      by daniel holt printer of the newark herald in page    i read in form of a note a piece of history which presents itself as not altogether inapposite to the present purpose to any one by whom any degree of credence is given to the statements contained in it it will serve to prove two things   that at the time in question viz anno      no guinea corps had for kings bench service received as yet any such organization as we have seen and shall see again and again a corps of that description and character to have received for exchequer service   that though in the kings bench and for kings bench service no such regular corps had been as yet put upon the establishment a strong sense of the need which the service had of such a corps was entertained and that honourable court had accordingly found extra work for one of those fictionmints without which not one of all the honourable courts in westminsterhall would hold itself competent to go through its business the note is as follows the passage which it quotes is here inserted at secondhand the original not being at present within reacha as the nature of forming special juries begins the note is not generally understood at least in the country i shall make no apology for introducing the following curious and interesting account of the manner in which they are selected to the notice of my readers it is taken from the trial of john horne tooke esq for a libel in the year     —  the special jury says mr tooke you may imagine are taken indifferently and as it may happen from a book containing all the names of those who are liable to serve i thought so when i read the act of parliament appointing the manner in which they should be taken but when i came to attend to strike the special jury a book with names was produced by the sheriffs officer i made what i thought an unexceptionable proposal i desired the master of the crown office whom i do entirely acquit and do not mean the slightest charge upon—i desired the master of the crown office that he would be pleased to take that book open it where he would begin where he would at the top or at the bottom and only take the first fortyeight names that came i said i hoped that to such a proposal the solicitor of the treasury could have nothing to object i was mistaken he had something to object he thought that not a fair way turning round to the attorneygeneral there were witnesses enough present and i should surely be ashamed to misrepresent what eight or nine people were present at he thought that not a fair way he thought and proposed as the fairest way that two should be taken out of every leaf that i objected to i called that picking and not striking the jury to what end or purpose does the law permit the parties to attend if two are to be taken by the master of the crown office out of every leaf why then need i attend two may as well be picked in my absence as in my presence i objected to that method the master of the crown office did not seem to think that i had proposed anything unreasonable he began to take the names but objected that he could not take the first fortyeight that came because they were not all special jurymen and that the names of common and special jurymen were mixed together and that it would be a hard case that the party should pay the expense of a special jury and not have one that they were expected to be persons of a superior rank to common jurymen i could have no objection to that provided they were indifferently taken i said take then the first fortyeight special jurymen that come he seemed to me as if he meant to do it he began but as i looked over the book i desired him to inform me how i should know whether he did take the first fortyeight special jurymen that came or not and what mark or description or qualification there was in the book to distinguish a special from a common juryman he told me to my great surprise and he said he supposed i should wonder at it that there was no rule by which he took them why then how can i judge you must go by some method what is your method at last the method was this that when he came to a man a woollendraper a silversmith a merchant if merchant was opposite to his name of course he was a special juryman but a woollendraper a silversmith c he said that there were persons who were working men of those trades and there were others in a situation of life fit to be taken how then did he distinguish no otherwise than this if he personally knew them to be men in reputable circumstances he said he took them if he did not know them he passed them by now gentlemen what follows from this  but this is not all the sheriffs officer stands by the solicitor of the treasury his clerk and so forth and whilst the names are taken if a name for they know their distinction if a name which they do not like occurs and turns up the sheriffs officer says o sir he is dead the defendant who does not know all the world and cannot know all the names in that book does not desire a dead man for his juryman sir that man has retired that man does not live any longer where he did sir that man is too old sir this man has failed and become a bankrupt sir this man will not attend o it is said very reasonably let us have men that will attend otherwise the purpose of a special jury is defeated it seemed very extraordinary to me i wrote down the names and two of them which the officer objected to i saved i begged him not to kill men thus without remorse as they have done in america merely because he understood them to be friends to liberty that it was very true we shall see them alive again next week and happy but let them be alive to this cause the first name i took notice of was mr sainsbury a tobacconist on ludgate hill the sheriffs officer said he had been dead seven months that struck me i am a snufftaker and buy my snuff at his shop therefore i knew mr sainsbury was not so long dead i asked him strictly if he was sure mr sainsbury was dead and how long he had beed dead six or seven months why i read his name today he must then be dead within a day or two for i saw in the newspapers that mr sainsbury was appointed by the city of london one of the committee it happened to be in the very same day to receive the toll of the thames navigation and as the city of london does not often appoint dead men for these purposes i concluded that the sheriffs officer was mistaken and mr sainsbury was permitted to be put down amongst you gentlemen appointed for this special jury  another gentleman was mr territ the book said he lived i think in puddle dock the sheriffs officer said that gentleman was retired he was gone into the country he did not live in town it is true he does as i am told frequently go into the country for i inquired his name was likewise admitted with some struggle now what followed this dead man and this retired man were both struck out by the solicitor of the treasury the very men whom the sheriffs officer had killed and sent into the country were struck out and not admitted to be of the jury now gentlemen what does that look like there were many other names of men that were dead and had retired which were left out there is something more unfortunate in the case of the special jury the special jurymen if they fail to attend that trial for which they are appointed are never censured fined nor punished by the judge in the trial of one of the printers only four of the special jury attended this is kind in the chief justice but it has a very unkind consequence to the defendant especially in a trial of this nature for i will tell you what the consequence is the best men and the worst men are sure to attend upon a special jury where the crown is concerned the best men from a nice sense of their duty the worst men from a sense of their interest the best men are known by the solicitor of the treasury such on one cannot be in above one or two verdicts he tries no more causes for the crown there is a good sort of a man who is indeed the most proper to try all this kind of causes an impartial moderate prudent man who meddles with no opinions that man will not attend for why should he get into a scrape he need not attend he is sure not to be censured why should he attend the consequence follows that frequently only four or five men attend and those such as particularly ought not to attend in a crown cause i do not say that it happens now not that i care i do not mean to coax you gentlemen i have nothing to fear you have more to fear in the verdict than i have because your consciences are at stake in the verdict i will do my duty not for the sake of the verdict now what follows this permission to special jurymen to attend or not as they like best why every man that is gaping for a contract or who has one is sure to show his eagerness and zeal  thus far the speech of mr horne tooke anno      as quoted from his trial in daniel holts pamphlet of      turning to a pamphlet bearing date the present year   0  and entitled report of the trial in an action for a libel contained in a review of the portraiture of methodism  tried at guildhall before the right honourable lord ellenborough and a special jury saturday march      0  i read in the charge of the lord chiefjustice a passage from which an inference though of itself certainly not a conclusive one may be thought to arise that in this line of service the advantage of permanence is not more fully understood and experienced in the exchequer than it is already in the kings bench—as to the measure of damages concludes his lordship it is so entirely and properly in your province and you are so in the habit of exercising your discretion upon these subjects that i shall not say a word about it thus far the lord chiefjustice the functions of special jurymen had therefore it should seem become habitual to the gentlemen to whom he was addressing himself and that to his lordships knowledge a collated with original st tr xx    —ed  that for the purpose of enforcing obedience to his own judicial orders he ever has been so and subject always to eventual check from some still higher tribunal ever ought to be is most indisputable hence the practice and propriety of attachment for contempt in lord mansfields reign under the convenient laxity of the word contempt an attempt was made to extend procedure by attachment to the case of a libel when directed against a judge the nerves of lord mansfield failed him that project was abandoned at present whatsoever other wants may be supposed of nerves at least there is none but so long as juries are what according to exchequer doctrine they not only are but ever ought to be to what use should a project so full of trouble if not of hazard be revived † that on the propriety of this climax a judgment may be formed let the following brief observations be considered—   in the whole field of government there is not an abuse which could not without any reflection on the personal conduct of the king be laid completely open and receive its correction in the particular field of judicature there are few if any abuses that could be fully brought to light without reflection in some shape or other upon the personal conduct of the judge   the king let him conduct himself as he may cannot while the constitution stands be removed or suspended at least not without the concurrence of both houses of parliament a judge if he misconducts himself may be removed on an address by either house of parliamenta canvassing the personal conduct of the king has therefore a mischievous tendency without any useful one while canvassing the personal conduct of a judge has on the other hand a useful tendency without any pernicious one to the prejudice of a judge whatever is said has even if it be false this good effect—viz that it applies to his conduct the only efficient check of which in practice it is susceptible—the attention of the public eye—two years imprisonment for a libel on the king three years imprisonment with et cæteras for a pair of libels on a pair of judges a by

the original edition of this catechism more than by anything else that the french revolution with its horrors was produced and here we see one use of a special and wellselected jury men ennobled by the esquire tacked by the constable to their names with a pedigree reaching down though it were from woden is it possible that the united force of pride and vanity should so completely have got the better of common prudence as to represent the question guilty or not guilty as turning upon the question family or no family had it been to a jury of the original the constitutional the ungarbled the uncorrupted stamp did ever man think to better his cause by violating in this or any other way the feelings of his judge  the title of it is—an account of some alterations and amendments attempted in the duty and office of sheriff of the county of middlesex and sheriffs of the city of london during the sheriffalty of sir barnard turner and thomas skinner esq—london printed by stephen clark no    brokers row moorfields      no booksellers name  for terms and years together here we see the notice given of the permanence the fact stated by the sheriff and admitted and justified as we shall see by the lord chief baron is—not merely that in the special juries serving in his lordships court there have been out of the twelve an individual or a few individuals in whose instance this permanence has had place—but that it is the whole body of special jurymen that for the indefinitely long number of years in question has been in this state of permanence in the composition given in each instance to the jury taken from this permanent body of jurors some variation though that but a little variation is admitted by the sheriff but subject to this limitation the nonvariation is admitted by the lord chief baron of the difference between the several distinguishable lists seven or thereabouts in number that have place in the case of special jurors an explanation has been given above part i ch iv §   of the little variation in question what in the language of that explanation is the result only that to make allowance for casual nonattendance and at the same time provide for general convenience the convenience to wit of all persons who belong to any of those classes whose convenience is considered as entitled to regard—i e all persons concerned but the suitors the select and secret qualified list is constantly larger than any actually serving list in a word that it contains some number above twelve or lest the arrangement should ever find itself disturbed by the intervention of casual interlopers if put upon the reduced list say fourandtwenty this select and secret qualified list is to such actually serving list what in the east india direction the list composed of the directors actually in the direction at any given point of time with the addition of all who ever have been in the direction is to the list composed of the actual directors alone with only this difference viz that the exclusion of supernumeraries which in the case of the east india direction is determined by rotation subject to a prolongation of the exclusion in the instance of this or that individual in so rare an event as a determination taken to that effect by a majority of proprietors is in the case of the guinea board determined partly perhaps by seniority upon the list but partly at any rate by chance as well as partly by choice rendering the select and secret list no larger than the serving list is an arrangement that stood prohibited by divers considerations—   it would have rendered the duty too severe it would have converted the bonus into a burthen—in the instance of every such member of the corps with whose business or amusements such regular and unremitted attendance would not have suited and it would thereby have excluded this or that useful member in whose instance the requisite obsequiousness so often as it suited him to attend might be depended upon   the imposition would in this form have been too barefaced—twelve persons under the name of jurymen sitting at all times without any variation and thus forming a board no less manifestly permanent and unchanging than that of the twelve judges could never have passed thus long under the name of a jury no not even under the habitual blindness almost universally manifested to every the most flagrant abuse which having judges for its authors is screened from scrutiny by the name of law  connivance or direction of the judges—this as already intimated turns out to be a complete misstatement though as already intimated a very pardonable one attributable—not to the direction of the judges—just possible—not to their connivance—not possible the state of things here in question is that very state of things the existence of which it has so often been observed is not only admitted but justified by the chief judge to whom that letter is addressed that it had his ingenuity and industry for its efficient cause is not certain but that its existence was known to him is certain since in declaring his approbation of it he grounds that approbation on an experience of as long a standing as his own existence in the character of a public functionary of such connivance does the existence require confirmation require surely not but confirmation if a fact so firmly established can be rendered firmer we shall find it receiving further on viz where the permanent system having at the instance of this sheriff been for the moment broken in upon by the most fully employed of the lord chief barons two master packers was restored as soon as the sheriffs back was turned † negligence or indifference in the proper officers another misstatement but alike pardonable by the chief judge to whose authority the master packer is subject the system having been according to the judges own declaration contemplated by him during a period of twentyfour years and at the end of that term openly defended whether on the part of this subordinate the acting up to this system could have been the result of negligence or altogether matter of indifference might be left to any one to pronounce but whatsoever might at the time of this letter viz  th april   0  have been the state of the official mind in question that it was not long before a state altogether opposite to that of indifference had place is demonstrated by the fact just spoken of viz the restoration of this state of things so shortly after the day when at the instance of the author of this letter it had been suspended ‡ the solicitor of the crown is permitted to interpose in relation to the incident here spoken of i suspect some want of clearness if not of correctness in the information on which this part of the statement thus made by the sheriff was grounded—   not only in this but in all the other packing offices according to the practice as stated in all the booksa the solicitor as well on this side as on the other has to one purpose a right—an acknowledged right—to interpose viz to the purpose of striking out his twelve out of the fortyeight members of the gross occasional list regularly nominated by the master packer   this interposition of his—this interposition considered by the sheriff and by him denounced to the lord chief baron as a cause of partiality in the selection at what stage of the process is it considered as taking place at the time regularly appointed for mutual defalcation if by the exclusion of twelve out of the fortyeight any apprehension entertained by this solicitor of a deficiency in the article of obsequiousness would be satisfied in such case all conversation whether to the effect here spoken of or to any other is needless or superfluous   that the whole of this gross list being at the nomination of the master packer any real danger of nonobsequiousness towards the crown side should exist except in the extraordinary case of corruption successfully applied by the individual the defendant has been over and over again shown to be a state of things altogether improbable that in that state of things any such danger should be so much as apprehended seems not very probable to what end then any such indirect and mendacious interference at what point of time antecedently to the declaration and production made of the gross occasional list—made in form and ceremony by the master packer or his clerk at the very time when by the defalcation of    viz    on each side the number on that gross occasional list has just been brought down to the    on the reduced list or not till after that time   if antecedently it would suppose between the master packer and the solicitor of the crown the solicitor of the customs for example or the solicitor of the excise a perfect and collusive understanding yet at the same time on the part of the solicitor a fraudulent sort of language such as would by that collusion have been rendered unnecessary and moreover this conversation being carried on secretly and collusively between these two at a private meeting the solicitor on the other side not being present how should it transpire and not once only by accident but as here represented habitually transpire   the time at which insinuations of the sort in question have been made suppose it now to have been the very time of the regular and tripartite meeting between the two opposite solicitors and the master packer at his office on this occasion if from such insinuations any advantage could possibly be gained to the crown side the case must be that after the selection constantly made of the    by the master packer—all    being persons who cannot but have been put in for the purpose of affording and having an actually serving list composed of persons who with little variation are in constant exercise—and therefore selected for the very purpose of producing that result which by the admission made by the chief baron is proved to be actually and constantly produced—the case i say must be that after a selection thus made the faculty of striking out twelve names—twelve names out of a list so formed—has frequently by the crown solicitor been regarded as not yet sufficient for his purpose and on this supposition and this supposition alone it is that in addition to the    duly put aside by him in the exercise of his right some number of others have required to be unduly put aside by means of the fraudulent insinuations here above supposed and mentioned this being the object how then at the time now in question viz that of the regular meeting is it to be accomplished probability seems to be already out of the question as to possibility there seems to be but one mode so much as possible and that is this—the list of    being produced by the master packer to the two solicitors the crown solicitor takes it up and says—this man speaking of a will not attend should his name remain upon the reduced and summoned list putting him on this gross list is therefore of no use out with him then and to make up the    let us have somebody else this speaking of a and so on in regard to b c d c whatever may be the number of those whom on this supposition it appears to him advisable to endeavour in this way to get rid of but while by means of this insidious language this fraudulent practice is carrying on—the defendants solicitor—what is he about all this while if this man as you think will not attend then strike him out or if you insist that the whole number to which your power of striking out extends shall remain to you undiminished let me strike him out such would naturally—and morally speaking necessarily—be the language of the defendants solicitor unless he too were in the league against his clients interests and rights it is i say before the commencement of the operation of mutual erasure that at that tripartite meeting any such conversation if at all must have been held—for after that operation the    being by the striking out of    on each side reduced to the    with what colour of reason or honesty could the crown solicitor require—and on no other pretence than that of expected nonattendance—require that a and b and so on should be struck out of this reduced list why then did you leave his name in exclaims immediately the defendants solicitor and to what purpose strike it out now suppose his name left in and therefore suppose him not to attend where is the inconvenience there remain still    others and if there were a hundred    of them are as many as can serve but if this man be now struck out another man must now be put in and if another be now put in i must have the option of striking him out just as i should have had had his name stood among the original    on this supposition then a serving list of    composed with little variation of the same persons must have been the result of a gross list of    such as though constantly formed by the master packer to whom every one of their characters and habits of acting is by long experience so perfectly known is notwithstanding so oddly constituted that by striking out of the number any twelve that he pleases the crown solicitor cannot yet without increasing the discarded number by insidious practices get such a jury as will be fit for his purpose but instead of a constant good understanding between these two servants of the crown this would suppose a constant conflict—on the part of the master packer disposition to thwart on every occasion the purposes of the crown solicitor which object after all notwithstanding the existence of a power adequate to the effect viz the power of choosing the whole    is according to all the evidence in the case never compassed on any occasion supposing therefore which i see no reason for not doing supposing such conversations to have really passed as the information given to the sheriff states to have passed i cannot but conclude them to have been perfectly innocent and that for this simple reason that no point could be expected to be gained by them were they otherwise to what circumstance then attribute the mention thus made of them by the sheriff in this letter of his to the lord chief baron evidently enough to this viz that the conception he had been led to form of the mischief fell thus far short of its real magnitude the packing which by the information he had received had been presented in the character of an irregular and thence easily corrigible abuse was in truth the result of regular and inveterate and thence unless by extraordinary measures not corrigible practice but under charges such as these the curious circumstance is the silence of the judge a judicial officer under your dependence is habitually in league says the sheriff with the solicitor on one side and being so in league with him leagued with him in a conspiracy against justice permits him to set aside jurors till he has got a jury to his mind well says the judge says i mean by his silence—well says the judge and if he does what do i care nor yet merely by his silence for with all this before him we shall see him pronouncing it in express terms and without exception or distinction to be well departure from it better than well meaning the opposite to well accordingly in the course of the letter which we shall come to presently we shall find his lordship speaking of certain results which being by his lordship regarded as beneficial reconcile him most perfectly to the means whatsoever they may be by which they are effected yes whatsoever they may be and although this collusion partiality and conspiracy against justice had thus been alleged to be of the number all this while the statement was to his lordships knowledge in many points incorrect why then bestow upon it this virtual admission because the real state of the practice was so much worse than the state thus ascribed to it the assumed root ascribed to the corruption was nothing worse than casual irregularity nor could the cause so assigned have been adequate to the production of the effect—whereas the true root was and is to be found in regular and established practice and that practice so ordered as to render the corruption sure the nomination completely as well as constantly and avowedly made by an officer in the dependence of the judge observing the hound to be upon a wrong scent the fox sat quiet while the enemy pursued his course a   for the kings bench civil office see tidd and crompton by sellon   for the kings bench crown office see hands   for the common pleas master packers the two prothonotaries   for the exchequer plea office master packer the clerk of the pleas—see edmunds   for the exchequer remembrancers office master packer the deputy remembrancer there is no book of practice as yet extant but that in the respect in question the practice of this office agrees with that of the four other offices may be well inferred by analogy and is in substance affirmed as will presently appear by the learned gentleman who dates from lincolns inn  indifferently taken and dictated by the officer of the court consistently with the result known to be produced—that result to wit the production of which is as above admitted and defended by the chief judge viz the little variation and in effect the not much less than identity of the actually serving list and thence the perfect identity of the select and secret list the correct application of any such term as indifference does not in any sense appear practicable let it even be supposed that no crown solicitor ever takes any part in the business other than what the solicitor on the other side takes here is still a package as completely effected by the master packer alone as it could be by a legion of crown solicitors—the jury—that body the only supposed use of which is to serve as a check upon the judge named on every occasion by the dependent of the judge † the inclosed letter viz the letter of the learned gentleman who dates from the temple whose observations—being as we shall see and without exception pronounced by the lord chief baron to be perfectly just—are by that confirmation adopted and rendered part and parcel of his lordships observations  mr—s observations were perfectly just these observations are those of the learned gentleman who dates from the temple as above which observations have for their basis the opinion that the clause in question—viz the clause having for its object the securing a constant change of jurymen—or at any rate the preventing the too frequent returning to serve the same juryman—applies to use his own words to special as well as to common jurymen such is the opinion with which the lord chief baron declares his concurrence here then is an act of parliament which in the opinion of the learned judge himself was meant to prevent a man from serving in middlesex as a special juryman so often as twice in the compass of three terms and this practice it is that understanding it to be prohibited by act of parliament the learned judge having all along persevered in the countenancing of it labours as we shall see in this letter to preserve and now comes upon the carpet a circumstance of so whimsical a complexion that the reader had need of some time to put his mind in order for the reception of it such is the fallibility of human learning that notwithstanding the learned templars observations and the perfect justness of them yet so it has happened that in the pains we shall see him take to run counter to the intentions of an act of parliament the learned judge was disappointed the case being that after all on the part of the penner of that act there was not in truth any such intention as that it should be construed to extend to special juries this will be shown presently but as to the contempt meant by the learned judge to be put upon the authority of parliament that being an act of his own and not at all affected by the intention of any other person or persons such as the framers of that or any other act we can do no otherwise than take his word for it in regard to falsehood a known distinction among moralists is that between a logical falsehood and an ethical one your logical falsehood is—where for example you speak of a thing which is not true as if it were true whether you think it true or not your ethical falsehood is—where you speak of a thing as true believing it not to be true whether it be really true or not the distinction thus suggested in the first instance by the particular sort of obligation which regards truth will be found applicable with equal propriety to an obligation of any other nature together with the contraventions that correspond to it and in the present instance it may on this or that occasion be of use to us to save us from the imputation of incorrectness and injustice should it happen to us in speaking of any of the laws in question to speak of them not only as contemned but as contravened in regard to the packing system what will be clear enough to any person who will take the trouble of looking into the two acts in question with this view   geo ii c      geo ii c   is—that the foundation of it having not only at the time of passing the first of these twoacts but a considerable time before been laid—laid and established by the practice and rules of court which in each court gave the nomination of special jurors to the master the dependent of the judge—the lawyers by whom or under whose direction the several acts were penned and who it will appear probable had for their principal and perhaps for their sole sincerely pursued object the giving to this system an efficient degree of extent took effectual care not to divest of that permanence which was so essential to the expected service the bodies which it had in view to organize in the character of special jurors as in any other men they saw well enough could be depended upon only in proportion as they were tried on this principle it was that the contemplation of the jobs which every now and then there might be to do produced a natural aversion to new faces a determination was accordingly taken that when the permanence which had been denounced to parliament as the cause of the mischief came to be prohibited the prohibition should if possible be prevented from extending to special juries at the same time as in the case of jurors in general corruption had been the abuse which having called the attention of the legislature to the subject had given a preamble to the first act a sentiment compounded of shame and apprehension prevented them from attempting to establish the exception in express words the course they took was a more ingenious one exception they inserted none—at the same time they so managed the act that should the time ever come for carrying it into execution it would in virtue of this or that word ingeniously slipt in for the purpose be found as in this very instance it has been found inapplicable to special juries not to overload this note a sketch of the course they took for compassing this point is posted off to a separate chapter chap v the odd thing is that so many learned persons—two others besides the preeminently learned one—should have concurred in a mistake thus unfavourable in appearance at least to the state of things he was upholding at the expense of so much pains but to find interpretation for all the wisdom displayed by so many learned persons would be too much for one unlearned one sufficient be it for him simply to point it out as forming the matter of a problem which must be left to take its chance for solution from some other hand what makes the oddity still more odd is—that of these same statutes the nonapplicability to the subject of special juries those clauses of course excepted in which special juries are expressly mentioned had been declared more than once after solemn argument by the court of kings bench—once in a comparatively recent case that took place in michaelmas term on the   th of november     —about three quarters of a year after the day which gave the benefit of the lord chief barons wisdom to the exchequer bench—once before that time in a comparatively ancient case determined by the lord chief justice raymond in the case of the king against franklin hilary term   geo ii anno     —about a twelvemonth after the passing of the first and most efficient of this string of acts—a case the report of which was on the occasion and for the purpose of the cause last decided but here first mentioned dug up by one of the judges buller out of the heap of dust in which for twoandsixty years it had lain buried—buried as usual lest the knowledge of it should become possible to those who were to be made to suffer for not knowing of it if indeed so it be that on this occasion it had become an object with his lordship to show to the people of london and middlesex through the medium of their sheriff what sort of regard english judges are in use and upon occasion disposed to pay to acts of parliament on this hypothesis the particular turn thus taken by his lordships wisdom may be accounted for by being brought within a general rule when an act of parliament is produced to an english judge and the execution of it called for at his hands the first question with him naturally is—whether it suits his taste it yes he gives it his fiat or what he calls his support it no he deals by it as the preeminently learned person here in question dealt and may be seen dealing by this law the relevancy of which it not actually believed by him was at least feigned to be believed for the purpose or showing his regard for it thus in the instance of lord chief justice raymond in the case dug up as above by mr justice buller—speaking of the act then as well as now in question—viz   geo ii c   —he viz lord raymond said—the act of parliament was a very beneficial act and ought to be supported note that being in the secret he knew that this act beneficial as it was was not on any occasion on which corruption could have been checked by it ever intended otherwise than in show to extend to special juries and consequently that it would not stand in the way of any of that corruption for the purposes of which the special jury system had been instituted and in and by this very act was by the astutia of the learned penmen spread out to an allcomprehensive extent he therefore who should take upon him to impute to english judges or to any of them any such intention as that of overthrowing all acts of parliament without distinction would utter a gross calumny as gross a one as if he were to impute to lord ellenborough any such intention as that of suppressing all publications without distinction no where as in the instance of lord raymond an act of parliament has the good fortune to be agreeable to their taste and the parliament by which it has just been enacted is still sitting in any such state of things such is their condescension they are ready to give it their support in regard to the question whether as per hypothesis in thus setting up an act of parliament his lordships object was to show how easily he could put it down some additional light may perhaps be thrown upon it by a case which there will be occasion a little farther on to bring to view see part iv chap ii—a case in which if the evidence be to be believed we shall see the judges all twelve of them concurring in the declared determination to persevere in defeating the express words as well as unmisconceivable intention of a law made for the sole purpose of putting an end to certain oppressions and extortions the profit of which had thus been vainly endeavoured to be snatched out of their hands  if you think it worth while to make any reform of the letter thus alluded to the words are—if you should think it worth while to rectify the practice which has obtained       here we see—alas—a jeofail a jeofail in the shape of a misrecital an error large enough had it been properly placed to have given impunity to a murderer or an incendiary and sent them out to commit fresh murders or light up fresh fires an error but to what cause shall it be imputed—to laches in the clerk—not it indeed—to astutia and welcome—to laches—presumptuous thought—such weaknesses the law suffers not to be imputed to such clerks—some other cause must therefore be found for it—but of this presently the light in which the two learned lawyers—the official and the professional one—the light with its different shades in which the supposed contravention is considered by them is well worth observation the rather as it affords a further specimen of the sort of consideration which the law of parliament is accustomed to be held in by the fraternity of lawyers by the professional lawyer the change proposed by the sheriff is admitted to be a rectification a substitution of right to wrong a substitution of obedience to an inveterate course of wilful and contemptuous disobedience but so rooted in the minds of the brotherhood is the habit of treating with contempt the only rule of action which is not under the usurped name of law a system of imposture that let the disobedience it has been treated with be ever so flagrant and undeniable a doubt is expressed whether it be worth while to substitute to it the contrary habit of obedience so much for the learned counsel—as to the preeminently learned judge when he comes to take up the matter thus far we see him concurring with the learned counsel at the first glance viz that it rests with them and theirs whether to pay any regard to an act of parliament or not and finding in the doubt of the learned counsel a sort of sanction i e what among lawyers passes as such for the practice—for that practice which without doubt on either part the legislature had after stigmatizing it as corrupt see part i ch iv §   prohibited he lays hold of the doubt as a sort of authority entitled to have its weight where the authority of parliament had none in the opinion thus given by the learned counsel one little expression however did not altogether quadrate with the views of the learned judge i mean the word rectify because in the idea of rectification a word so far from being suitable to his purpose is necessarily included the actual existence of something wrong on an occasion where the thing signified by it was to be discountenanced his lordship puts aside accordingly this unguarded word which does not suit his purpose and substitutes another which does suit his purpose this other is the word reform a word which to lawyers in general in concurrence with all others who have an interest in the maintenance of abuse in any shape is an object of such well known horror having for its synonymes theory speculation innovation infidelity jacobinism confusion destruction of social order et cætera and so forth judge and barrister together it is curious enough to observe what in the judgment of those learned persons is as well as what is not worth while what is worth while is—violating a fundamental principle of the constitution what is not worth while is—ceasing to violate it what is worth while is—breaking the law what is not worth while is—obeying it what is worth while is—forming this judicatory corps of gentlemen pensioners what is not worth while is—disbanding it  never seen the least inconvenience as to the practices and results in which his lordships good fortune in not seeing any the least inconvenience is thus declared they have already been brought to view † inconvenience      from     distance on the subject of inconvenience in this shape see the next chapter ‡ to obtain     attendance     expedient to summon such as live near to london expedient yes—and that on two accounts   men fit for guineamen are more plentiful near to london than at a distance   for a guinea with the chance and that not a bad one of earning several more guineas than one not to speak of a good dinner many a man would be content to come a mile or two who would not be content to come fifteen miles—the distance spoken of by his lordship immediately after as having been a subject of complaint a mile or two a gentleman may come on foot fifteen miles unless it be for a wager he will scarce ever come otherwise than with horse or carriage necessary no unless so it be—that it being found or deemed necessary or at least agreeable and convenient to have regard to the convenience of the individual where he has the good fortune to be an esquire—it is to that purpose necessary that none should be looked for but those to whom the visit will have proved convenient and agreeable in the case of the man who is not in any such high degree favoured by fortune all such necessity is out of the question what necessity there is presses all of it upon his shoulders and consists in necessity of attendance on pain of penal visitation—no matter how great the distance no matter how great the inconvenience see above part i chap iv §   ∥ otherwise     little expectation of     full special juries to the packing system this fulness on the part of special juries is rendered material and subservient by more circumstances than one—   it keeps out talesmen plebeian substitutes who being taken at random could not in point of discipline be to be depended upon and among whom in a cause of real interest such as a libel cause any one bad player might under the system of forced unanimity by possibility be sufficient to spoil the whole game   the greater the number of those who attend no one of whom ever does or ever can be made to attend unless attendance be perfectly convenient and agreeable to him the more extensive and consequently the more valuable this branch of patronage so much for convenience there we see the convenience but expedience is alleged and whence comes this expedience the answer is—that unless such were taken as live near to london a full attendance—anything like a full attendance—would be little to be expected but why so the persons on whom this obligation lies all of them in affluent circumstances—affluence in every instance the declared ground of their selection—fifteen miles the longest journey which any one of them has to take—under these circumstances out of fourandtwenty to whom on the occasion of each cause the commands of justice are signified can twelve be too great for the number of those on whose part obedience to those commands can with probability be expected of such nonexpectation or rather such despair what can be the ground in other counties the journey may be from twice to thrice as long—the persons to take it may be such as are not in possession of a fifth a tenth a fiftieth a hundredth part the opulence yet in that state of things what complaint is ever heard of a want of jurors mark well the consistency—men who can best afford it and would be well paid for it and who would not have to come so great a distance cannot be expected to come even in so much smaller numbers—while men who can ill afford it and are not paid for it come from a greater distance and in greater numbers aye but these are but common jurors—men who have nothing to do with the laws as has been well said but to obey them—and who are accordingly kept as much as possible from knowing the laws for fear they should obey them but the others you seem to forget are special jurors and do you consider who special jurors are—why sir they are all gentlemen—gentlemen every man of them and when you consider this you cannot surely be so extravagant—can you—as to expect that they shall be forced to attend whether it be convenient to them or no just as if they were so many petty farmers petty handicrafts or petty shopkeepers here then on this occasion as on every other occasion we come sooner or later to the radical and allpervading grievance one law for gentlemen—another for low people—comforts and attentions heaped together on one side—burthens and neglects on the other—such throughout is the spirit of that spurious kind of law which has the judges for its authors such is the respect of persons which in the bosom of english judges occupies the place of justice—and so rooted is this partiality that we see it thus openly avowed just as if it were a duty in which character it seems actually to have passed itself upon the religion of this our learned judge now as to the gentlemen in question to what title is it that they are indebted for the favour thus habitually shown to them by this our learned judge the representative and mouthpiece as on this occasion he may well be taken to be of the learned and reverend brotherhood of which he is so distinguished a member is it to any particular connexion in the way of interest alliance friendship or acquaintance with those learned and reverend persons any of them or any of their connexions this is partiality upon a small scale is it purely to that of their belonging to the class of gentlemen this is partiality upon the largest scale  complaints     of having been brought fifteen miles of the comparative amount of this hardship something has been said already part i chap iv §   and something more may perhaps be to be said anon at present what seems to call for notice is—the service rendered to the packing system by the sort of oppression thus complained of taking into the account the complaints that were the fruit of it the packing system having been for years past organized and a determination taken accordingly to maintain and defend it whatever was capable of being made to furnish a plea in favour of it might thus be rendered subservient to its maintenance and defence on this or that occasion on which the verdict was to the powers above a matter of indifference this or that gentleman was summoned of whom it was known that by his situation geographical domestic or political he was rendered unfit for service in the guinea corps he came accordingly served and grumbled and thus out of the grumblings of this medecin malgrè lui of the body politic was made an argument for composing the establishment of willing ones not having the honour to be in the secret it is only from appearances that i can speak—from appearances—and there they are † instructing jury after jury    exposes both parties c symptoms of somnolency begin to discover themselves and on the part of the jurors or others to whom the instruction is to be applied if of this sort be the form in which it is to be administered some danger there seems to be lest the somnolency should be found contagious and the points do as well as they can without being understood at all but this being one of the two grand arguments of which on the ground of reason and utility the pillars of the packing system are composed an attempt will be made presently to get to the bottom of it and extract whatsoever instruction may be capable of being extracted from it meantime may not this be among the points that might be found lying there i mean at the bottom of the argument or thereabouts—viz that the instruction of a jury is work for the judge and in particular that sort of work which sometimes calls for learned thought and always occupies learned time if so the reason it must be confessed is by no means a purely personal being in no small degree a public one for besides those operations of a nature purely mechanical which in the equity

feeeaters called by the greeks δωϱοφαγει that in the character of plaintiffs and defendants men were made  few verdicts from which i should have dissented had i been one c verdict and dissent dissent and on the part of a supposed juryman from a verdict strange and neverbeforeassociated ideas alas were these waking or sleeping thoughts in what region of romance were the thoughts of his lordship wandering when in idea he heard a verdict pronounced by a jury and himself a dissenting member of it by what process were two phenomena which in real life are so incompatible brought together by his learned fancy speaking with respect—but forasmuch as all this is but supposition speaking out—was it that his lordship was pleased to perjure himself joining in one of those perjuries which judge blackstone has found so well associated with piety and which the humanity of so many of his reverend brethren have so frequently so frankly and so successfully manifested—was it then that thus in vision he was pleased to perjure himself declaring assent by his lips while dissent was in his breast or was it that at the end of a certain number of days and nights of inanition having fainted under the torture he had thus by silence given opportunity to that verdict to which his assent expressed either by words or action could not by any agonies have been extorted or was it that instead of fancying himself in the jurybox he was for the moment nodding as if with his old friend good homer and occupying—not as now upon the woolsack but on some other seat more elevated and not far distant—a place in the house of lords—forasmuch as in that august assembly dissents however rare are neither unexampled nor since there happily they may be avowed without perjury unavowed on the principle of the apology made by a dr omeara of the day for pronouncing before a polite congregation so unpolite a word as hell may not an apology here be due for a word so near of kin to it as perjury an apology—yes by all means—considering that in so many a reverend company the less odious the thing the more odious the name † favourable to the defendants taking for granted which i do sincerely and without difficulty that the cases alluded to by his lordship under the description of cases in which he should have dissented from the verdict—it being as above favourable to the defendant—were cases in which it was unjustly favourable corruption by individuals has already been stated in another place part i chap iv as an operation in which the effect in question may with no slight appearance of probability have had its cause what is this then your hypothesis—is this the persuasion you are seeking to spread—viz that in the    special jury causes tried in a year in the court of exchequer phillips p     there is not one in which the verdict has not been a corrupt one corrupt on one side or other—either on the plaintiffs or on the defendants side my answer is—that in truth among a given number of verdicts i should not expect to find more wrong ones in the court of exchequer than in any other court taken at random i could even add reasons—were there in this place any use in it—reasons why i should not expect to find even so many i could go further still and add reasons why in that judicatory i should expect to find the number of wrong verdicts as well as the degree of aberration in cases admitting of degree rather diminished by the effect of the influence exercised on the guineacorps than increased but without having any other ground than as above what i should not be at all surprised at is—to find that now and then the favour shown to individuals in the character of defendants had had corruption in some shape or other for its cause at any rate supposing corruption on this side never yet produced yet if it be possible for corruption in juries to be produced produced in any other way than by open allowance of it by law i can think of no other by which so high a probability of corruption could be produced as by the permanency thus secured as to other courts i have stated already part i chap vi that the court particularly in question here—viz the court of exchequer—is not a judicatory in which notwithstanding my abhorrence of this system of corruption i should expect to find wrong verdicts the result of it and that—except such casual partialities to the harbouring of which all judicatories are more or less exposed—it is only in the kings bench—and even in the kings bench in such cases alone as are in some way or other connected with what is called politics and particularly in libel law cases—that i should expect to find wrong verdicts produced by such a cause as to the court of exchequer in that judicatory i know of no worse nor other bad effects as produced by the packing system than on the part of judges a confirmation of the habit of open contempt as towards the authority of the legislature the equally open violation of an universally acknowledged principle of the constitution and the uneasiness and by no means groundless alarm produced in the breasts of the people by the apprehension of injustice though in cases in which i myself should not expect to find it taking place now these are in my conception all of them very serious evils having a thousand pounds justly due to me suppose i were to give to a juryman a hundred pounds or the promise of a provision for some friend or dependent of his to secure my thousand pounds to me by a favourable verdict and the verdict with a thousand pounds damages is found for me in consequence here by the supposition the verdict itself is not a wrong one but supposing the transaction between me and the juryman to transpire would not the evil be a very serious one would not the feeling of insecurity under the law be much more intense and extensive than it is even at present  having seen no reason to complain for seen ought we not rather to read felt felt no for

have been your fate see part i chap ix §    wilks against eames andrews p    mich    geo ii anno      the court said that though it was not usual before the said act to grant special juries without consent yet in some instances and for special causes it was and might be done    and lord chief justice cited the king and burridge pasch geo i  0 when upon search it was found that no special jury had been granted for thirty years then last past without consent and the lord chief justice pratt was then of opinion that the court might grant a special jury without consent but the other judges differed i e were of opinion that the court could not grant a special jury without consent from this it seems that at both periods the chief justices knew what they were about and accordingly invented pretences for thus forcing in the special jury system but that in pratts time at least viz anno      the puisnes were not in the secret inasmuch as they opposed the extension thus endeavoured to be given to it from this it may be seen that a special jury in the character of a subject and instrument of package unless before this time the crown lawyers assumed and by the judge were permitted to exercise a right of commanding a special jury in crown causes as would naturally be the case as well as a source of increased lawyers profit took its rise from this act and as well in the character of an occasional source of corruption as in that of a constant source of lawyers profit it has already been seen how valuable an engine it has proved in the manufactory of abuse in the character of an instrument applicable to the purpose of corruption our estimate of its value may receive some assistance from a circumstance mentioned in the same report in the case of the corporation of bewdley the trial being at bar twenty guineas apiece it appeared had been given to each juror nor would the enormity of the sum have transpired but for an application made by the losing party for what is there called lowering it which the court did viz to five guineas i e forbore to oblige the losing party to pay any more than five guineas not obliging him to pay the twenty for as for taking out of the pocket of each juror fifteen guineas out of the twenty he had received that was altogether out of the question—that was what could not be done the money was already in their respective pockets and there was neither statute law nor judicial practice that could have furnished so much as a pretence for making them disgorge it in the same case in speaking of the quantum of the extra allowance given to these wellselected assessors an observation made by strange solicitorgeneral is—that though the practice is to pay them more than to common jurors this is mere matter of generosity and ought not to be reimbursed by the other meaning the losing party all depending on generosity and the crown i e its servants and they alone having it in their power to be generous and without bounds as well as without any expense to themselves it may be imagined what sort of a chance an individual would have under a set of jurors all named by this one party possessing and all along exercising the power of either rewarding them at the expense of others to an unlimited amount or not rewarding them at all according as they behaved the crown had it or had it not a special jury at pleasure and not depending on the consent of the party on the other side a circumstance indeed that contributes to render it probable from the first invention of special juries the king i e the servants of the crown never failed to have a special jury of this sort for asking for is—the care which at the early period above mentioned viz the beginning of the reign of king william was taken that the faculty of striking out the    out of the    should not on the part of either party be exercised without its being specially applied for and on application ordered and so lately as in the time of lord mansfield it is stated as a rule that when the solicitor omits to attend after notice the master in k b may strike the jury ex parte cowp     rex v hart hilary    geo iii b r      in such cases as were left to a common jury that is in causes theimportance of which was not sufficient to excite any interest in the bosoms of the judges or their connexions chance was the instrument they saw directed to be employed for the reducing the number on the gross list to twelve—the number adapted to the serving list had justice been the object here then was a principle and a precedent to have pursued but in cases that were deemed worth their attention these ministers of justice knew better than to trust in any degree to chance what might be secured by prudence in the case in cowper before lord mansfielda a curious enough circumstance is the carelessness real or simulated of the judge in regard to the person by whom the twentyfour should be struck out in case of a refusal on one side in the case in question it was on the side of the defendant to strike out the twelve—the right of striking out which according to the practice belonged to each side and consequently to that side what the reason of the case plainly enough required was—that the party attending for the purpose in the case in question the solicitor of the crown should exercise his right of striking out his twelve and then the defendants solicitor making default the right that belonged to him should from necessity be exercised by the supposed impartial officer the master in this case both on the part of the counsel by whom the motion is made and on the part of lord mansfield the judge by whom the prayer of the motion is refused an assumption made is—that in case of such default it belonged to the master and him alone to strike out the whole fourandtwenty that is twelve for the defendant who made default and twelve for the solicitor of the crown who made no default in this case had there been any real distinction of interest and feelings nothing could have been more palpably partial and iniquitous than to put it into the power of one party by thus wilfully making default to deprive the other party of his right yet that apparent injustice—and this too to the prejudice of the crown—was committed why because between the servants of the crown in the judicial line and the servants of the crown in the agency line the understanding was so entire and because amongst them it was so perfectly well understood that so far as concerned the interests and wishes of the servants of the crown of all descriptions whether the person by whom the striking out were performed were the master packer or the crown solicitor the effect would be just the same thus it is that to any scrutinizing eye the secret had there been any would have been betrayed but there was no secret in the case and as to any scrutinizing eye there was none such within sight a rex v hart esq cowp     friday feb        mr davenport moved for directions to the master to strike out twentyfour of the special jury ex parte in case the defendant and his agent should omit to attend the masters appointment the motion was founded on an affidavit of three appointments having been made and their declining to strike out till a day should be appointed for the trial    lord mansfield was clear the master might do it without any direction from the court and declined giving him any in particular but had no doubt he might do it now just as if he had proceeded last term      the duke of portland     informed me     that your lordship thought a change in lord castlereaghs situation in the government desirable—provided it     could be reconciled to lord castlereaghs feelings the duke of portland     told me that hopes were entertained     of

exsecretary canning to earl camden lord president of his majestys council in which the conduct of a war on which the fate of the human species depends is for near six months together viz from  d april to  0th september   0  in the minds of the minister who writes this letter—the minister to whom this letter is written—and the other ministers in general stated and shewn to have been a secondary consideration the primary and during that whole time the prevalent consideration being the feelings of a single individual that individual a minister whose unfitness for such his employment had during all that time been recognised viz either by every one or by almost every one of his colleagues—and such colleagues now in any such cabinet not to speak of contingent ones suppose a proposition brought forward for the making of any such code of laws as should be subservient to the purposes of cognoscible impartial undilatory unvexatious unexpensive justice on what circumstance would the reception given to it depend answer—on its being capable of being made consistently with or of being reconciled to the feelings of the great character whose seat is at the head of the law were it to happen to the rule of action to be cognoscible impartial and in all its other points in the highest degree or in any higher degree than at present subservient to the greatest happiness of the greatest number—were the recourse to it rendered in any degree less dilatory vexatious or expensive than it is at present—this would in all its points be a result opposite to the interest of that great character in all its points—viz money power case reputation vengeance with their et cæteras also to that of the several learned and noble and learned and other great characters his colleagues and other his friends such is the prospect which the law has of seeing itself well conducted as to the war had that been well conducted the result so far from being in any point opposite would in every point have been and in a high degree subservient to the interests of the great character by whom it would have been so conducted  applies to special     jurymen this is the clause forbidding the summoning and returning of overserved jurymen this the passage which drew as we have seen from the lord chief baron the avowed persuasion that the practice he had so long been pursuing and was then defending was a practice meant to be prohibited and prohibited accordingly by parliament but that in this persuasion as well the learned judge as the learned counsel whose observations he found so perfectly just were perfectly mistaken has in the last preceding chapter been shown at large † if inconvenient for the latter to attend     much more to the former inconvenient to a guineafed juryman to attend oftener than the act requires about as inconvenient as to this learned gentleman it is to have too many briefs when the briefs crowd in too thick upon him he returns the overplus when the summonses crowd in too thick upon the guineaman he the guineaman obeys such as he finds it agreeable and convenient to obey and neglects the rest note that of the twentyfour who for each cause are always summoned it is but twelve that in any one cause can ever serve therefore every other time of his being summoned each special juror or in other words half the number summoned might if the inconvenience were real stay at home without being missed and to a majority composed of these gentlemen suppose even a few yeomen jurors added viz in the character of talesmen who would ever care about it of the terrific fine which by the act of which the act in question is an amendment is in case of nonattendance hung over the heads of jurymen were i to add that it does not extend to special jurymen his reply would be of course—oh but this is according to the construction you put upon the act—mine was different be it so but what reason could a sheriff have for supposing that when he was sending an invitation to a gentleman to partake of a good dinner in good company after sitting to act the part of a judge and to receive moreover a guinea at the least and perhaps a number of them he was putting him to inconvenience or if in the instance of this or that particular gentleman it were an inconvenience what is there that could prompt a sheriff to be too frequent in the reiterated production of such inconvenience note that in those days a guinea was worth at least twice what it is worth at present twenty years or thereabouts after the passing of this supposed inconvenienceproducing act—take for the act either the original act of the   geo ii or the amending act of   geo ii—the topic of special juries came again upon the carpet and what was the complaint then—that in the character of special jurymen gentlemen were put to inconvenience by overattendance no—that they were oppressed—no but that they were overpampered—that great and extravagant fees were paid to them—and frequent are these complaints declared to have been by the act    geo iii c    §   ‡ inconvenient     it must be much more     on account of rank what we have just been seeing is a specimen of the sort of regard paid by the fraternity of lawyers to the convenience of gentlemen jurors—the class of jurors whose convenience is entitled to regard—let us now observe the sort of regard paid by the same learned fraternity to the convenience of common jurors—low people whose convenience is entitled to to what to any regard to this one knows not exactly what to say—either to none at all or if to any to next to none instead of convenience we might say feelings since the use made of it for crushing the liberty of the press feelings always the more sentimental is become the more legal term to a man who in the sale of his time finds the sole source of his subsistence less inconvenient to sacrifice a portion of his time for  d than to a man to whom not only subsistence but affluence is secured and that without the sale of any part of his time it is to sell on this particular occasion the same portion of his time receiving for it besides a very good dinner at the least one guinea this is the proposition with the supposed truth of which the learned gentleman was not only possessed but to such a degree captivated that under the guise of a reason introduced in form by the word for it led him astray into what we have seen to be an erroneous conception or at any rate an erroneous declaration of the meaning of an act of parliament such is the proposition which in this its character of a reason stands at the head of those observations which in the sight of the preeminently learned judge were so perfectly just and which in that of another learned barrister who dates from lincolns inn will be soon seen to be so perfectly clear and correct the information thus afforded is no light matter—inasmuch as here we see expressed in words the sort of regard which the convenience the feelings the interests—any of these words may alike be employed—the interests say of the vast majority of the people may expect to experience at the hands of lawyers of all sorts and sizes official as well as professional the same sort of regard which stands expressed by deeds in the sort of law framed by these same learned hands—for the use shall we say—no anything but the use—of that same despised portion of the people in this sketch may be seen a picture—a family picture—of the fraternity of english lawyers—a picture which cannot be charged with hostile distortion or discolourment since it is drawn by their own hands from this view of it might be formed à priori a conception of the treatment which by sad experience this portion of the people feel rather than see themselves to have met with at their hands what they have met with and for ever may justly expect to meet with so long as in blackstones sense and words every thing is as it should be not that they are altogether devoid of sympathy—for no human being was ever altogether devoid of sympathy but as is but too natural their sympathy such as it is is confined to the classes with which they associate or wish to associate and having as we have seen been so liberal of it to the distinguished few above—the men in high situations—they have none left for the undistinguished multitude beneath hence it is that in england not indeed in england only the people have come to be divided into two classes one of those to whom justice is to be sold the other of those to whom justice is to be denied—denied for the benefit of those who alone can come up to the price and who by that means are authorized and required to purchase the faculty of oppressing under the name and with the power of justice this is the authoritative comment upon magna charta—the comment written day after day by the feefed hands of the twelve judges not forgetting the one supremely learned person who sits at the head of the law in this as well as so many other senses that a poor man can better afford to work for nothing than a rich man for this though a short interpretation is a sufficiently correct one is a proposition of that sort which it seems impossible for any men to repeat who after notice given him that it will be looked into should bestow on it a second glance but how impossible soever it may be for a man seriously to think so nothing can be more easy to a man than to say so and when such is the state of his feelings that while those of the higher classes are something to him those of the lower classes are as nothing it is no less natural for him to say of the working class that they can afford to be made to work for nothing and that they dont mind being made to work for nothing than it was for the cook to say of her eels that they dont mind being skinned why did not the cooks eels mind being skinned because they were used to it why do not the lord chief barons common jurors mind being made to work for nothing because they are used to it the cook for her wages is used to see eels skinned without minding it and the lord chief baron for his fees and those of his friends is used to see the great majority of the people outlawed and stripped to the skin without minding it in both cases the construction is ambiguous but in both cases the import is clear enough perfectly just as this mode of doing justice to rich and poor is it seems at present it has not been looked upon in that light by all judges at all times wilkes against eames mich    geo ii anno      andrewss rep p   —probyn just said that he knew no reason why special jurors attending a trial in the country should have more allowed them than a common jury the other being generally more able and better qualified to serve their country than these  court     would not suffer their process to be disputed no that they would not viz if by any one it happened to be found worth while to bring the matter before them—and at any rate this was a very good advice † worth your while this is the passage which hit so exactly the taste of the lord chief baron and which accordingly in the character of an argument ad hominem he made use of in the representation made by his lordship as we have seen to the sheriff in hopes of engaging him to give up so romantic a scheme would you give execution would you pay obedience to an act of parliament—think first whether it be worth while—if it be not worth while who ever i e which of us ever thinks of paying obedience to an act of parliament ‡ to rectify the practice rectify—as applied to practice—to the practice of judges—to his own practice—this was a word which has been seen to be—and indeed might without much expense of thought have been expected to prove—not altogether to the learned judges taste accordingly as we have seen—and for what reason we have seen—he slips in the word reform instead of it for under this name though not so easily under the name of rectification the proposed and dreaded correction might without reserve be slighted and discountenanced  apprize the master or remembrancer thereof in pursuance of this advice the sheriff did apprize the master or remembrancer thereof and in chapter the  th we shall see what he got by it in giving to the sheriff this part of the advice this learned friend of his was quizzing him unless so it were that the learned gentleman how well soever deserving to be was not completely in the secret † the opinion of the court would be obtained yes—and so would the expense of obtaining it and moreover the disgrace and ridicule of presuming to endeavour to obtain it to the sheriff along with the expense might have been obtained perhaps another epigram still more pointed and quizzatorial than the italian one from any such urbane for in the application of this attributive the sheriff cannot be accused of error and polished bench—what would not indeed have been obtained is—any such attributive as that of the greatest fool or that of the weakest man that ever walked over earth without a keeper in the character of an advocate to apply such attributives belongs perhaps only to sir vickery gibbs in the character of a judge to take them up for the purpose of rendering them more bitter under the guise of sweetening them—as lord ellenborough did to this same sheriff on an occasion on which according to his lordships own declared opinion what was said by this same person in the character of witness could have no influence on the fate or merits of the cause—belongs surely only to lord ellenborough in the same common design different parts are acted as nature habit and situation serve by different characters and amongst them while no pretence for any more substantial vengeance can be found such is the retribution that ought to be expected by all such adventurous knights as think to remove though it be but a grain of the mountain of abuse accumulated by the hands and for the use of english—add or of scottish lawyers ‡ they would probably     alter the practice alter the practice indeed—uncompelled by parliament a court—an english lawcourt—or uncompelled by the people an english parliament—alter for the better its own practice yes when without compulsion the mufti turns christian or the pope protestant the court alter its own practice if for the better be meant when was it ever known to do so on the part of the learned author of this most learned advice behold still the same pleasantry or still the same simplicity and inscience ∥ excused     on producing a certificate sage advice still in the same style excused you may perhaps be from attending to receive a guinea or several guineas—excused on condition of producing a certificate the endeavour to produce which might or might not succeed and in case of success would produce without the guinea more trouble than the attendance here as might be expected we see another lawyers remedy—i dont mean a remedy proposed by another lawyer—i mean another remedy of the sort of those which lawyers are in use to make up and administer—of that sort which they have in store for their clients in the character whether of consultants or suitors bad indeed must the disease be if the remedy they have to administer be not worse and so happily as well as ingeniously have they managed as not to have left even at their own disposal any good ones ¶ this insertion of this word not seems to be a slip either of the pen or of the press j b  the three letters these must evidently have been the three letters above reprinted in so many preceding chapters viz   the letter dated from the temple   sheriff sir richard phillips to the lord chief baron   the lord chief barons answer to the said sir richard phillips † most clear that it did not originate in any jealousy c here we see the first of the evidences above alluded to by which the purity and simplicity of these learned eyes stand demonstrated not only are they as we shall see presently inaccessible to any suspicionexciting ray capable of being emitted from any other source but when the tendency of an act of parliament might be to excite any sort of suspicion capable of pointing itself towards the higher powers they are inaccessible to the very first words of the act the act i mean the earliest the most efficient and by far the longest of the four or five acts which bear upon the subject   geo ii c    states in the very first line of it as the very cause of its enactment the evil practice used in corrupting of jurors and it is with these words before him or why were they not before him that to this learned person it is most clear that it did not originate in any jealousy entertained that men so summoned and serving would fail to act uprightly between the parties no the intention the sole intention of it is stated by him as being that of mitigating the sort of vexation which the instant a perception arose that the breast of a gentleman stood exposed to it made that deep impression which we have already witnessed on the feelings of the learned judge what is possible indeed is—that the act which at that moment lay before that gentleman was—not the very act above mentioned but another of the next year viz that of   geo ii c   but this lastmentioned statute being but a patch put upon that other of the year preceding is so indented into it that to any one who had not taken the trouble to turn to the amended act any selfsatisfactory conception as the amending act would be plainly impossible by the act of the  th geo ii c   §   after reciting that by the act   geo ii c    it had been enacted that no persons shall be returned as jurors to serve on trials at nisi prius who have served within     two years before    in any     county except as excepted and that by reason of the frequent sessions of nisi prius in the     kings bench common pleas and exchequer at westminster the said provision cannot be put in execution in the county of middlesex but is found impracticable—it is after this recital enacted that the said recited clause     shall not     extend to the county of middlesex then as to that county it goes on and enacts that no person shall be returned to serve as a juror at any session of nisi prius in the county of middlesex who has been returned to serve as a juror at any such session of nisi prius in the said county in the two terms or vacations next immediately preceding—under such penalty upon the sheriff undersheriff bailiff or other officer employed or concerned in the summoning or returning of juries in     middlesex as might have been inflicted on     any of them for any offence against the said recited clauses ‡ between the parties—note of sir richard phillips to these words—it should be observed that the persons who serve on special juries rather desire the employment than to be relieved from it as they receive a guinea for every cause and it is not about causes between individuals on which there can be any ground of jealousy so far are special jurymen from seeking to be relieved that owing to the advantages derived from serving on them i have received since i have been sheriff more than a hundred applicationsfrom respectable persons who under a mistaken notion that it was in my power have wished me to place them on what they called the special jury list r p  mr     is perfectly clear and correct in his observations mr     viz the learned gentleman who dates from the temple and of whose learningwe have already made our profit viz in the last preceding chapter on that occasion at the head of those observations of his which were so perfectly just we saw the lawyers balance for weighing the value of gentlemens time against the value of low peoples time and with the correctness of these scales as well as with the several other observations from the same learned quarter the learned inhabitant of lincolnsinn is we here see no less perfectly satisfied than we have seen the preeminently learned judge like causes produce like effects he who sees one of these learned persons sees another he who sees bavius sees mævius an observation to this effect has been made already but the occasions for repeating it succeed one another without end † one circumstance     must remove all suspicion remove it—from what place not surely from any one of these learned bosoms the door of which as against all suspicions pointing upwards remains of course for ever closed—not from any such seat of imperturbable tranquillity forasmuch as what is never in a place can never be removed out of it—but from bosoms actually labouring under the greeneyed malady such as the bosom of this troublesome and meddling sheriff but let us see what this remedy is which being swallowed ought to operate as a specific against suspicion viz in a constitution actually labouring under or at least predisposed to the species of greensickness above mentioned ‡ special juries are struck under an order of court only—add the court never knowing any thing about the matter the order as we have seen a mere scrap of spoilt and wasted paper—a mere pretence for feecatching—a pretence and that a false one see part i chap vi of gold not of post is the powder by which the malady of suspicion is so regularly removed out of or rather expelled from learned bosoms and learned eyes alas how different the ideas presented by the same object to unlearned ones by the very document by which all suspicion had ever stood excluded from the learned bosom—by this very document it is that suspicion was not only planted but rooted in the unlearned one by this so oppositely working document what i do not mean is—the visibly existing though in respect of its purport falsely pretended not to say forged order of court—what i do not mean is that too visible piece of mendacious and polluted paper—what i do mean is the invisible order of the court—the neither visible nor audible nor yet the less perpetually standing and intelligible and efficient and general order continually issued by all the courts to the master packers of their six or seven respective offices requiring them to choose always proper persons and never any other viz the secret members of the no longer secret list which as we have seen stand indebted to the lord chief baron probably for existence avowedly for protection and defence look to the temple—look to lincolnsinn—look where you will—look to what part of the constitution you will—everything is consistent you will find—everything is orthodox—among learned gentlemen the use of a jury is—to serve as a check to power—to power that would otherwise be arbitrary—in the hands of a judge the use—or at least one use—of the house of commons is—to serve as a check to power—to power that would otherwise be arbitrary—in the hands of the crown in the case of the sort of jury termed a special jury symptoms of a sort of feveret were by this learned gentleman observed—observed but not confessed to have been produced by suspicions imputing to this kind of jury an habitual leaning towards the crown side in crown causes for the removal of this complaint a febrifuge of sovereign virtue and efficacy having been discovered by him in the abovementioned remedy viz an order of court let us apply it—i mean in idea—for the application of it in substance belongs to and is with perfect regularity and efficacy performed by other hands to the case of the house of commons one circumstance let us say ought to be attended to which must remove all suspicion on this subject it is this viz that members are struck chosen under an order of court viz the court at st jamess only now is not this—deny it who can—a most composing opiate—a very specific against all political ferments i mean against all such as are liable to break out within doors—and if it be good in either of the two cases can it be otherwise than good in the other and as to this our learned practitioner notwithstanding what we have seen escaping from him about the guineacorps can any doubt be at present entertained to the prejudice of his orthodoxy and if he is not already an attorneygeneral or a solicitorgeneral or a master of the rolls or at least a welsh judge is it not high time he should be ∥ fault of defendants solicitor if he does not obtain a respectable list alas what a smoke is here but can so much as a puff be necessary to dispel it respectable yes in one sense at least of any want of respectability there cannot be any fear viz of that sort of respectability which has office and guineas for its makers of that sort of respectability there is not among the candidates any absolute want even before admission into the office and this qualification the guineas if they did not find would make here then is the respectability which not only does not stand in need of any exertion on the part of the defendants solicitor to obtain it but which spite of his utmost exertions to the contrary will be sure to be obtained and constantly obtained impartiality—security against all influence—all corrupt influence—descending from above—is this the true english translation for the respectability of this so learned and yet or thence so charitably thinking and confiding gentleman eightandforty persons all named by or under the influence of the powers above and the faculty of discarding no more than twelve of them a security by which according to this learned gentlemans necessitarian theory all suspicion viz of any want of respectability—of respectability in this sense must we say must be removed patients   —and all    expected to be cured by a remedy which applies to no more than    were the learned gentleman a physician would this be his style of practice  there is one reform c reform and from a bosom from which all suspicion that points upwards—all suspicion of the possibility of any need of reform—has been sentenced to be transported for life gentle reader patience the reform is of the temperate kind—compose yourself wholly in the sheriffs power says the learned inventor and adviser of this reform wholly out of my power in the note we shall see to this same letter says the sheriff and so accordingly as we have seen and shall farther see says the act with all his dispositions to find perfectly correct whatever came from above or came recommended from above it may be suspected of this learned gentleman that he was—not completely in the secret to the permanence so decidedly approved and effectually protected by the learned judge he sees not indeed the shadow of an objection yet the sort of persons who beyond all others could be depended upon not to say who alone could be depended upon viz for constancy of attendance and for that obsequiousness without which constancy of attendance would have been of no use these are the sort of persons whom so hardheartedly as well as inconsistently we see him thus devising plans for getting rid of though to be sure if while he was thus giving the advice he knew it to be an advice that could not be pursued as he must have done had he looked at the acts on which he grounded it the case is altered and both these imputations vanish as to the question just mentioned between the sheriff and this his learned adviser it stands thus the statute   geo ii c    is the only one that has any bearing upon the subject and upon the ground of this statute the matter stands thus—   by §    where any special jury shall be ordered by rule of any of the said courts to be struck by here it is by not before the proper officer of such court     the sheriff     shall be ordered by such rule to bring     before such officer the books or lists of persons qualified to serve on juries     out of which juries ought to be returned by such sheriff     in like manner as the freeholders book hath been usually ordered to be brought in order to the striking of juries for trials at the bar     and in every such case the jury shall be taken and struck out of such books or lists respectively and in what manner on the occasion thus alluded to had the freeholders book been usually ordered to be brought for the purpose so alluded to this is among the points in relation to which the lawyers concerned in the putting together this piece of patchwork took care according to the custom among lawyers to leave us in the dark for as often as by the cry of any part of the injured people they have been forced to make a show of affording relief against this or that part of the system of judicial abuse organized by and for the benefit of the judges one of their maxims is—to leave the common alias unwritten law of their own making to form the groundwork applying to it no more than here and there a patch of statute law that thus the uncertainty which forms the essential character of the groundwork may spread itself over the patch   in §   and   of this same act directions had been given for the making up of books containing lists of persons qualified to be returned to serve on juries and this without any distinction mentioned as between common and special juries in that section §    by a reference made from it to these two former ones §   and   nothing it would seem would have been more easy than to say—that the books made up according to the direction given in these two sections §   and   are the books here meant by the books which here for the purpose of nominating persons to serve on special juries ought to be returned by such sheriff but by an understanding among the lawyers within and without both houses and the clerks within the same and the speakers to whom belongs the nomination of the said clerks matters have all along been settled in such sort that be the statute ever so long it shall be impossible otherwise than by words of vague description to make any reference from any part of any statute to any part of the same or any other statute in the printed editions it is true we see each statute divided into sections and each section numbered but this is the work of the printer only or his editor and a man who in the penning of any fresh statute should for the purpose of making a reference to any preceding statute or part of the same statute be unguarded enough to make use of any part of the numeration table in the description of such preceding statute or part of a statute would find himself overwhelmed with expressions of rage and terror excited by so feechecking an innovation—rage and terror covered by a mask of contempt as if excited by the contemplation of his ignorance for on the one hand clerks being paid for copying according to the multitude of statutes and the length of each and the confusion thus organized in each producing a perpetuallyincreasing demand for more—lawyers on the other hand being some of them paid in like proportion for the drawing of statutes and all of them having everything to gain by the confusion that pervades the substance of the several statutes and the universal and perpetuallyincreasing uncertainty in which that confusion beholds its fruit—hence this rule by which it is provided that an act of parliament let it of itself constitute ever so considerable a volume shall like the mathematicians point be a thing without parts is a rule as sacred among these several learned and official persons as any article in the    ever was to the most orthodox of the right reverend prelates that grace and sanctify the upper house and whoso should propose to abrogate it would thereby become a worse than a popish or other ipso facto excommunicated convict—a malefactor ipso facto convicted of jacobinism in regard to this article symptoms of heresy have now and then it is true been manifested in the commons in so high a quarter as the chair of the present speaker see speech of the right hon charles abbott on mr curwens purity of parliament bill in cobbetts register for june  0   0  to which former manifestations of the like complexion might upon search be added but in this heresy there is so little of contagion that the british themis seems little more in danger of being healed of her habitual vertigo by this one hand than the church of rome was of being purged of her errors by the pope who about the middle of the last century had acquired somehow or other the surname of the protestant pope the books or lists of persons qualified to serve on juries     out of which according to §    juries ought to be returned by such sheriff are they then the same books or lists the manner of making up which is prescribed by the two first sections of this same act vague and incompetent as is the mode of description it seems difficult to conceive how if called upon to give by his interpretation an answer to this question a judge could avoid answering it in the affirmative if so what the sheriff in his abovementioned and hereinafter printed note p     on this part of the advice of his learned advisers observes in relation to this matter is correct viz that it is not in the power of the sheriff—of any sheriff—to do that which by this his learned adviser this sheriff is advised to do viz to correct the freeholders list by expunging     names for if the books a description of which is given in the abovementioned two first sections—and of which it appears that they are the only sort of books to which the appellation of freeholders book employed in this   th section can apply—are really the books that under this same   th section ought to be brought before the said officer—to wit the master packer of such office in such court—to serve for the striking of special juries these are books of which in §   it is provided that they shall respectively be made by the sheriff who shall     take care that the names of the persons contained in such duplicates shall be faithfully entered alphabetically     in some book     to be kept by him     for that purpose in such duplicates says the act of which sort of instrument here called a duplicate it is to the present purpose sufficient to observe that it is an instrument of somebody elses making and not of his viz the sheriffs and whether had mr sheriff phillips in pursuance of the advice herein given to him by this his learned adviser expunged any of the names contained in such duplicates the names     contained in such duplicates would have been entered faithfully may be left to any man to pronounce a course indeed which might be taken without much difficulty—i mean physical difficulty—is after entering the names faithfully to pursue the advice given by this learned adviser and accordingly either once for all or toties quoties to expunge names but whether after any such purification or number of purifications performed the book presented to the officer of the court—viz the master packer—as and for the freeholders book could with propriety be said to be the freeholders book is another curious question which howsoever curious and to those who would be paid for playing their parts in the trial of it an agreeable one i would not be the man to advise any other man to cause to be tried at his expense it is one of those questions in respect of which it is difficult to conceive how in case of its being tried for example on an indictment a chief judge in his endeavours to persuade either a jury even though unpacked or his fellowjudges to decide—either for the king or for the defendant whichsoever happened for the moment to find most favour in his sight—could experience any difficulty and as for this our reforming sheriff supposing him in pursuance of this learned advice to have become such defendant what sort of favour he could reasonably expect at the hands of the learned judge who in that case would have the trying of him may be left for him to imagine from the excursion which in the case of carr against hood was made not long after editor illegible word that same learned judge viz if not for the editor illegible word editor illegible word effect of giving him a sample of it in the character of a witness always remembering that editor illegible word such purification if performed with any degree of consistency and steadiness the effect would be as in his instance it had been the declared object to make things better than well and in so doing to destroy not only the works but the very principle of that elegant art—that branch of the art of design—which exercises itself in the grouping of jurors—an art the planting and cultivation of which has already been affording so much occupation to the wisdom of ages the case is—that the statute in question having like most other statutes been penned as above for the express purpose of being misconceived has in pursuance of that purpose been put into such a form and method that both the learned adviser and his official client and corrector found it more easy and pleasant to speak from imagination than from the act it was the imagination of the learned adviser that presented him with the idea of its being wholly within the power of the sheriff to correct the list in question by expunging names out of it it was the imagination of the sheriff that presented him with the idea that to make any alteration in the returns is not merely forbidden but forbidden under a penalty and that a heavy one as to the omission—and let us add the expunction—of names of the description in question forbidden it may indeed be said to be though in the rather indirect way we have just been seeing viz by requiring that the names of the persons contained in such duplicates be faithfully entered but to the offence of which this indirect description is given no penalty is attached in the next section it is true viz §   comes a clause by which a penalty is appointed but the offence to which this penalty is attached is—not that which consists in the leaving out of a list of the sort in question a name which ought to be in it but the putting into it or at least acting as if there had been put into it a name which ought not to have been in it then as to the heaviness of the penalty if the real and effective weight be here in question viz the weight of it as estimated by the quantity of money which the levying of it takes out of a mans pocket—if this be what our sheriff had in view very inadequate was speaking with respect the conception entertained by him for the moment at least of the real and effective weight of statute penalties of the penalty here in question the minimum is no more than forty shillings and the maximum but £ 0 but even this £ 0 if £ 0 it be is not to be levied but upon examination in a summary way §   in the manner herein intimated in which case at the expense of £ 0 at the utmost he would have it in his power to exonerate himself of any further demand on this score whereas had the penalty been no more than is to which in this case he would hardly have given the denomination of a heavy one—this single shilling being to have been recovered in a regular way i for my part would not be the man to save him harmless for ten times the maximum of £ 0—no nor for a good deal more †what will be amusing enough—and to any man in whose bosom the interests of mankind are wont to excite any warmer sympathy than the interest of judge and co consolatory is—to observe the two traps set for the unlearned man one by each of these his two learned advisers and his unlearned good sense saving him from both to make application to the court viz in the only proper manner learned gentlemen feed and so forth but without any ground for it is the learned advice given from the temple to get himself indicted or informed against before lord ellenborough—mark well before lord ellenborough—indicted for an attempt to commit a reform viz by cutting up the most valuable branch of the packing trade—indicted and this with at least a plausible ground say rather a good ground to build a conviction upon after all this learned advice including the preeminently learned hint not to risk his reputation for discretion by any such attempt as that of making us better than well the unlearned person took a course which assuredly would not have been advised by any of the three and laid bare the whole matter to the public eye and here we see matter not only of satisfaction in respect of the escape made by the bird from the snares set for him by both fowlers but of gratitude for the instructive song in which he has sung of it † power of the sheriff note of

concerned and interested in the guineatrude imprudence—treachery—telling tales out of school—such are the reflections which by a man of more warmth and learning than candour or reflection might be apt to be cast upon the disclosure thus made by our learned adviser against a load of imputation which though to a first glance not altogether without colour will on an impartial examination be seen to be not more serious than groundless it would be ungenerous at least if not unjust to leave him altogether without defence if of the appellation guineaman and of the habits and dispositions which it imports the existence were really notorious—notorious in any such degree as that in which he understood them so to be—on this supposition to have kept them from the knowledge of a sheriff and especially so active and inquisitive a sheriff and one to whom in less than a twelvemonth the number of applications made for situations in this very corps amounted to above a hundred phillips p     would have been altogether hopeless while by the frankness of the communication all suspicion of wishing to throw a veil over the practice was in the most promising at least if not altogether effectual manner obviated between judges master packers and guineamen all suspicion of anything like an understanding was in this refined and indirect way much more effectually repelled than it could have been by any direct arguments since of any such arguments the effect would have been in the first place to bring forward an idea which could not be too carefully kept out of sight viz the idea of a state of things the existence of which would if once made matter of argument be much more likely to be confirmed by it than disproved against reform in every line it begins to be discovered that much more effectual war may sometimes be carried on by adoption than by open opposition in a very high place indeed go almost when you will you may hear the abuses of the law not only acknowledged but inveighed against—just as if anything but will were wanting to the removal of them—just as if in the whole world of law there were any one thing of which the learned orator had any tolerably clear conception except the value of those same abuses—just as if the most mischievous of those abuses were not the food on which himself and his closest connexions have grown so fat upon—just as if they were not dearer to him than the apple of his eye  likely to do wrong the faith of this learned person in the virtue of an oath is truly edifying unsanctified by this principle of sanctification the probity of these guineatraders does unquestionably not appear to have been set by him at a very high rate give them an oath to swallow every impure property is by this consecrated vehicle carried off note that the oath by which the swallower is rendered thus unlikely to do wrong is the very oath which as often as any difference of opinion has place among the elect twelve is regularly productive of perjury—of perjury on the part of some portion of the number from one to eleven inclusive i say of perjury unless it be supposed that by that terror of inevitable and insupportable torture by which the will is subdued the understanding is enlightened and converted and that of him whose power of endurance is the weakest the conviction and conversion is regularly and proportionably the most sincere an oath preservative against corruption—an oath composed of vague and unbinding generalities such as those of which such effectual care has regularly been taken that it shall be composed alas by what fatality did so simple an expedient escape the piously scrupulous and learned mind that has the royal conscience in its keeping—so cheap a defence of nations against corruption—as the advising his majesty to give to the department of the commander in chief the benefit of a pledge of purity correspondent to that by which in the judicial department the difficulty of doing wrong has been rendered thus extreme the person whom you shall nominate to an office within your department shall in every instance be in every respect the person the best qualified for the filling of that office—so help you god with such a security the child in leadingstrings might have been trusted with a commission as safely as his father and the wiles of mrs clarke would have had no more power over the virtue of the commander in chief than those of dalilah had over samson before his hair was cropt † not as matters of profit the severity of the learned gentlemans virtue has upon this occasion displayed itself in an opinion which it is somewhat easier to admire than to understand that a declaration to the effect in question should be incorporated into the puritysecuring oath—is that what he means to recommend i a b for example do declare that the guinea just received by me has been and is received only in the way of compensation for actual expenses and loss of time and not as a matter of profit so help me god or if duly construed and put into a tangible shape would the proposed security be found to amount for example to something to this effect viz that on a motion regularly made by some learned gentleman opposable or unopposable by learned gentlemen on the other side a rule should if the court think fit be with equal regularity made ordering that an account be taken by the master of the actual expenses incurred by each special juryman viz in the shape of chaise hire and subsistence upon the road as also of the compensation due to him for loss of time with a direction to allow out of the guinea being the greatest sum allowed by the act no greater sum than shall be sufficient to cover such actual expenses together with such due compensation as aforesaid—costs of the application to await the masters report the latter i give as being more particularly in unison with the general spirit and tendency of such amendments of the law as are to be found in the statute book made at the suggestion or in conformity to the advice of the gentlemen of the long robe but as to this opinion in particular whether it be in legal religion as in the first case or in legal practice as in the last case that the truest interpretation is to be sought for it must be left for the reader to determine  the court of session † the smalldebt court ‡ exactly as it stands this paragraph was written

that ever was devised for tormenting and pillaging men on pretence of justice  on a certain day to this compiler unknown unfortunately as to this point the original memoirs have left us—in the dusk at least if not in the dark that the visit of the sheriff to the remembrancers office was antecedent to the date of his abovementioned letter to the lord chief baron seems probable for though we are not expressly informed of its being so yet as the mention made of it is antecedent to that made of the letter such in default of more positive information it seems natural to conclude was the order of the facts a circumstance indeed by which the force of the inference may perhaps be thought to be somewhat lessened is—that almost immediately after comes an incident stated as subsequent to the month of july whereas it was the month of april that closed as well as opened that epistolary correspondence but the former hypothesis may perhaps be found to receive confirmation from another circumstance viz the symptoms of pliancy which it will immediately be seen were produced by and at the time of that visit—i mean the pliancy of that moment when compared with the restored rigidity of later times before the result of the epistolary application made to the superior was known the personal application would hardly have been made to the subordinate now in this interval there was ample time for the communication that would naturally be made of the matter from the superior to the subordinate and if any such communication had been made the compliance the unwillingness of which seems pretty conclusively evidenced by the subsequent rigidity would hardly have taken place  i attended says the sheriff at the office of the deputy remembrancer of the exchequer with the freeholders book and had

them on their fines upon the mere plea that they could not attend and retaining such names as he thought fit  mr whitbread as per times another practice he understood to prevail was—that special jurymen who had been summoned over and over again if ever they found a verdict against the crown it somehow or other happened they were never summoned afterwards mr marryat as per do he was frequently

and suggested from authority on the practice of choosing special juries since the work was published—by   geo iv c  0   d june      the laws as to juries in england were consolidated and the statutes enumerated in p      geo ii c      geo ii c     geo ii c       geo ii c    and    geo ii c    repealed so far as they concerned the subject by §    every man described in the jurors book as an esquire or person of higher degree or as a banker or merchant is qualified and liable to serve as a special juror all such persons are to be described in a separate alphabetical list subjoined to the jurors book called the special jurors list the names being numbered in their alphabetical order the numbers are to be written upon distinct pieces of parchment or card being all as nearly as may be of equal size and deposited in a separate drawer or box by §    when a special jury is struck in the presence of the parties or their attorneys if they choose to attend the slips containing the numbers are put into a box and atter being shaken together drawn out one after another to the number of    the name attached to the corresponding number in the special jurors list being read aloud as each number is drawn if on the reading of a name either party or his attorney object that the man is incapacitated on proof he will be set aside and another drawn in his place if the whole number of    cannot be supplied from the special jurors list the general jurors book is to be resorted to as formerly parties are supplied with a list of the    names with the respective places of abode and additions and are allowed to strike off twelve names each as formerly the remaining    being returned upon the pannel by §    parties may consent to the nomination of a jury in the manner formerly in use by the third report of the commissioners on the courts of common law ordered by the house of commons to be printed   th july      p    it is given as their opinion that the present practice with respect to special juries seems to require some improvement the expense of a special jury amounts to no less than £   an amount which proper provisions might materially reduce the difference between this expense and that of a common jury a difference of not less than £ 0 falls upon the party who applies for a special jury unless he should be successful and the judge should in that event direct it to fall upon his adversary by the former acts the certificate to be granted by the judge for this purpose is to be granted immediately after trial but by the last act he is to certify immediately after the verdict—a provision which obviously requires alteration because in case of a nonsuit it excludes the defendant from the possibility of obtaining the costs of his special jury a very unnecessary degree of inconvenience also falls on the class of persons out of whom the juries are selected thus if five or six special jury cases are appointed to be tried at the same assize as each has a separate pannel taken at hazard from the special jurors list it may happen that not less than from   0 to     persons are summoned to obviate this it is recommended that there be one specialjury pannel as well as one commonjury pannel consisting of not less than    nor more than    returned for each sittings or assize it is proposed that the fee of one guinea to each special juror should be abolished and in addition to the relief by the above arrangement it is suggested that no person should be again returned who has served within a certain period in case of such an alteration the right of peremptory challenge is recommended and in order more effectually to prevent the vexatious abuse of the privilege of trying by special jury which upon such a change of system might become of more frequent occurrence it should be provided that no cause should be so tried until an order had been made for that purpose by a judge founded on an affidavit as to the nature of the cause—ed  eightpence for example was the allowance given to a juryman as long ago as in the reign of james i see part i chap iv §   and we know not for what length of time before give him eightpence at this time of day the allowance besides being in name the same may be a more or less proper one but in effect so far from being the same it is a very widely different one and so as often as money is concerned and on whatsoever occasion and for whatsoever purpose mentioned—take for example qualifications for parliamentary electors  the line of distinction being in present as well as in all past times so extensively as well as decidedly drawn—drawn in name as well as in correspondent practice—no objection can surely be raised against it on any such ground as that of a tendency to keep alive and foment invidious distinctions in these our fortunate islands the yeoman of today being the future contingent gentleman of tomorrow no such heartburnings have place between them as in those countries in which a vast and unvarying gulph has place betwixt the two classes † halfandhalf de medictate status is the learned denomination but for my part i prefer this english one and this although it be or rather because it is so vulgar an one in every part of the field of law the interest and thence necessarily the endeavour of all lawyers has been to render the rule of action not only as uncognascible but as unintelligible as possible of every friend to mankind the endeavour it scarce need be said will be the reverse as to the science of jurisprudence and the art of legislation for teaching and learning these accomplishments the aid of this foreign and extinct language may here and there perhaps be necessary and necessity so far as it exists may but nothing short of necessity ever can justify any such use of it as to the epithet halfandhalf among publicans at least it would be difficult i imagine to find a man to whose ear it were not familiar—and therefore probably among the greater part of their guests  where the length either of journeys or of demurrage is anything considerable paying a juryman by the cause neither could then be nor ever can be anything better than a very unequal plan of payment for since it would commonly if not always happen that the same juryman would have to serve in divers causes therefore when in the instance of any such occasional judge the number of causes in which he served happened to be above the calculation viz the calculated number in the expectation of which the fixation of the sum in question took its rise he might be to a considerable amount a gainer when below that mark to a considerable amount a loser here then was a sort of lottery but in respect of the balance in point of comfort all such lotteries are disadvantageous upon the whole be this as it may till at a comparatively late period the circumstances of the times admitted of no other it was not till the reign of henry the  th viz by statute    hen viii c   that for raising supplies for public purposes any such rates as the county rates appear to have been in use if so the purse of one or other party was therefore the only fund on which the expense could before that time be imposed the year      is the earliest point of time to which on this subject the information left to us extends at that time as already observed part i chap iv §   p    eightpence a head per cause was the allowance made to jurymen and it was no greater in the country at the assizes where a juror might have  0 or  0 miles to travel than in the metropolis at nisi prius or at bar where he could not have more than a mile or two in those days eightpence was in real value as much perhaps as between three and four shillings now but we know not at what earlier point of time this sum may have been fixed nor consequently how much greater than at present the real value of it may then have been and been designed to be be this as it may paying them by the cause must at that time as at all times have been as already observed an ineligible mode of payment the amount of the allowance being to each person uncertain and therefore in point of general comfort the arrangement a disadvantageous one upon the whole  if human reason had been in use to apply itself to the subject of judicial procedure in general and to jurytrial considered as a part of it in particular the multitude of persons subjected to vexation in this shape would never have been for all causes without distinction fixed at so large a number as twelve but this is among the subjects to which as yet human reason has not been in use to apply itself among nonlawyers scarce any person in point of intellectual acquirements competent in any degree to the task having found and felt in his bosom a particular interest strong enough to call forth the application of them to the subject and as to lawyers acting all along under the impulse of a professional interest opposite in almost every point to that of the public in general the disposition to endure inconveniences in all shapes without remedy not the disposition to be on the outlook for remedies is the disposition which on all causes it has been their study to keep up and inculcate but to put an impossible supposition had any interests other than those of the allpowerful framers of the system viz the judges with their associates and dependents the professional and other official lawyers—had in a word the interests of the people either in the character of suitors or in the character of jurymen presided over the details of it the reduction would not have stopped there but having regard to the whole of this mass of vexation together would have confined the production of it to the case in which in the judgment of one or other of the parties interested it would be of use in a word every cause not of a penal nature would in the first instance have been determined in the mode so strongly insisted on in another place see scotch reform letter

law taxes on this principle so far as bonâ fide litigants alone are concerned—on this were this the only principle consulted there is not any part of the expense of litigation that ought not to be shifted off from the purses of litigants upon the public purse but if this transference were extended to the whole litigation would be converted into a game in which the expense of the stakes being borne by the public would thus be raised to an infinite quantity raised viz for the amusement of litigants and profit of lawyers where however the expense assessed on the public is incapable of being increased in so far as this is the case the mischief in question cannot by the transference in question be increased and in this case is the allowance here proposed to be made as well as that part of the emoluments of judges which is in the shape of salary  on the subject of what is called unanimity my opinions have in this very work been already too plainly and strongly expressed to need repetition here but the mention here made of so important a topic having been but incidental i have not included it in form in the list of the changes here proposed the subject being as yet far from exhausted to do complete justice would require as by its importance it would well warrant a separate publication in any leading quarter during the short time that i can have yet to live should a disposition ever manifest itself to consider the dictates of veracity and justice as fitter guides for the conduct of english judicature than blind and unreflecting prejudice it will then be soon enough to bestow upon the subject a quantity of time and space proportioned to its importance it might then be seen perhaps nearly to what age and not improbably to what parents the monster owed its birth  viz by   geo ii c    §    fifteen hundred pounds i have heard mentioned as being in one instance that happened not very long ago the sum at the expense of which a verdict was obtained according to the report it was a case of life and death the cause being an indictment for murder and the money given by the defendant the fact was mentioned to me as one that had become in a considerable degree notorious but having no means of forming any opinion concerning the truth of it i forbear mentioning any further particulars lest the story being false suspicion should by this means come to attach itself to this or that individual in whose instance it would be injurious under the principle of forced or rather sham unanimity it is easy to see what prodigious facility is given to a plan of corruption of this sort do what you will says the first corrupted juryman to the rest i am determined to stand you out stand you out till you are almost starved you will get nothing and as you will find it necessary to yield at last you will not succeed for this generous man shall and will be acquitted in spite of your teeth on the other hand join with me in a verdict of acquittal at once you shall have £ 0 apiece and no more injustice will be done than would be done if you got nothing so that this £ 0 will be yours with a clear conscience supposing then this story to have any truth in it i see not how even with the force of torture thus vested in his hands by the principle of unanimity the murderer by the assistance of his learned friend or friends could have effected his liberation without some degree of foreknowledge of some one fit person at least it must have been foreknown to him that he would have to serve upon this jury foreknown of some one person that after being himself corrupted he might be in a condition as well as in a situation to operate in the character of corrupter upon his colleagues  by   geo iv c     0th may      the persons qualified as jurymen are

the commitment in respect of the prisoner are by this act totally abolished since the said act the clerks of assize in some circuits have started a new demand upon the gaoler for the judges certificate of acquitment viz six shillings and eightpence for the first prisoner acquitted and a shilling for each of the rest or two shillings for every one i have copies of two receipts given by the clerk of the western circuit to the gaolers of exeter and salisbury one of them is as follows—received   april      of mr sherry gaoler one pound eight shillings and eightpence for his certficate entitling him to his gaol fees for the county of devon from j f     clerk of the assize the gaoler told me this was for twentythree acquitted prisoners i was informed at durham that judge gould at the assizes of      laid a fine of fifty pounds on the gaoler for detaining some acquitted prisoners for fees of the clerk of assize but upon the intercession of the bishop proprietor of the gaol the fine was remitted and the prisoners set at large the judge ordering the clerk of assize to explain to him in london the foundation for this demand one pretence for detaining acquitted prisoners is that it is possible other indictments may be laid against them before the judge leaves the town i call it a pretence as the grand jury are often dismissed some days before that time and because those who do satisfy the demands of the clerk of assize are immediately discharged another pretence is the gaoler tells you he takes them back to knock off their irons but this may be done in court in london they have an engine or block by the help of which they take off the irons with ease in a minute the machine is brought into court and the acquitted prisoner is immediately discharged if according to what i proposed prisoners were tried out of irons this pretext would be entirely removed clerks of assize and of the peace ought most certainly to have a consideration for their service to the public the thing i complain of is what i am led to by my subject that is the demand that is made directly or indirectly upon acquitted prisonersa a the clerks of assize give to the judge large sums for their

and was countenanced by the then ministry for limiting the number of the peerage  in every case except where the observance promised consists in speaking truth as in the present case in which case the oath is said to be assertory of which immediately i e in every case in which the oath is commonly spoken of in the character of a promissory one the term vow has moreover been indifferently employed in speaking of it see in crudens or any other concordance the words oath and vow † in the way in which the testimonial oath is commonly employed and administered the observation of its being included as above under the promissory will it is supposed be acceded to without difficulty since in that case the ceremony is seen at the first glance to precede the operation which it is employed to influence by a person from whom assertions or declarations of a testimonial nature are about to he extracted or received the oath—the ceremony whereby the qualities in question are supposed to be secured—is performed in the first place and thereupon comes the testimony by which the promise so made is either kept or broken and perjury accordingly abstained from or committed but suppose the testimony first given without oath and thereupon immediately or at any time afterwards an oath taken importing that the testimony so already delivered was true on consideration it will be seen that even in this case there exists a promissory oath in the first place comes the ceremony and with it comes the promise to speak true thereupon and thereafter comes the assertion to which it immediately applies viz that the testimony which had been delivered antecedently to the ceremony is true take away this subsequent assertion take away the promise to give truth to it—no assertory oath—in a word no complete oath—at all remains thus much merely for clearness of conception as to any practical purpose whether the nature of the case does or does not admit of any assertory oath which is not a promissory one is a question altogether void of importance  magic not being now in fashion of the existence and exercise of the sort of power indicated by that term the supposition would be an object of scorn and ridicule but of the existence of the ideal power so denominated the supposition is in the scale of absurdity inferior to that of the existence of the power to the belief of which the ceremony of an oath is indebted for whatever efficiency whether to a good or a bad purpose it possesses by any magical incantation it is only over this or that imaginary being of a subordinate class that the power is supposed to be exercised by the ceremony of an oath it is always over the supreme being who thereupon supreme as he is is to the extent of this power subject at the same time  if the majority of a great nation are to be kept in a state of everlasting degradation—with probable not to say just cause of eventual revolt perpetually administered to it—for what reason is it to be thus dealt with is it because independently of all oaths it is a kings duty so to govern no but because by an oath which he took he swore that he would so govern which oath taken the consequence is that should it happen to him to govern otherwise god stands engaged to punish him as for perjury if the supposed effect of an oath be any thingless than this whence comes the fear of doing after and

occasioned by the load which ever since the year      has by archbishop laud in his quality of chancellor and legislator of this university been laid upon all such consciences as it has found in that

chancellor to whom it was addressed it does not appear to have given any more disturbance than it has to that of any past or present or seems in danger of giving to that of any future successor not to speak of their respective vices  question concerning an object to the value of a shilling or a halfpenny—no trial of it without this sacred ceremony question as in the case of the orders in council between war and peace between national starvation and life—no such security employed no decision suspended for want of it what more need be said—no thought taken for it  of the aggregate mischief of the institution here in question the judicial abuse which in the work mentioned in the text has been designated under the appellation of the mendacity licence forms so material a part that unless the view there given of it were here inserted any conception that could hence be formed of it would want much of being an adequate one as the present tract though if room can be found for it designed to constitute an appendix to the abovementioned work on evidence is moreover designed to appear in the form of a separate publication it has been deemed advisable to reprint in this place that part of the work on evidence in which the abuse here in question has been more fully delineated and explained it forms the fourth section of the  th chapter intituled of the securities for trustworthiness in evidence and is in these words viz §   judge and co—false evidence rendered by them dispunishable where profitable to themselves—mendacity licence thus much as to propriety—for practice learned ingenuity has discovered and pursued a more convenient course under the english not to speak of other systems of technical procedure by means of the command so easily when indirectly exercised by power over language an expedient was found for rendering mendacity punishable or unpunishable at pleasure in the person of a party litigant or a witness when it was to be rendered punishable the allegation or statement was called evidence and to mark it as such a particular ceremony—the ceremony of an oath—was made to accompany the delivery of it when it was to be rendered dispunishable it was not to be called evidence—it was to be called pleading—pleadings—anything but evidence—and the ceremony was to be carefully kept from touching it at this time of day few tasks would naturally be more difficult than that of satisfying the english lawyer that pleadings not upon oath—that anything in a word which in legal use has been carefully and customarily distinguished from evidence can with propriety be termed evidence but though thanks to his ingenuity so it is that pleadings—all pleadings at least—are not evidence in name yet so it is that every thing that goes by the name of pleading is evidence in effect all testimonial evidence is statement—narration—assertion every thing that goes by the name of pleadings is so too of evidence the use and sole use is to command decision—by pleadings decision is commanded and that in cases to a vast extent and in continual recurrence and with a degree of certainty altogether denied to evidence to the purpose of imposing on the adverse party the obligation of going on with the suit the contents of every instrument included under the name of pleadings how replete soever with manifest falsehood are taken for true and as such without the name have the effect of evidence this effect it may be said is but provisional but definitively to the purpose of giving to the suit a termination favourable to the party by whom the instrument is exhibited—to the purpose of producing a decision—a decision as favourable to him as could be produced by anything to which the name of evidence has been left—to the purpose of producing the selfsame decision which by evidence supposing it believed would be produced—it has the effect—not simply of evidence but of conclusive evidence—the party who fails to meet the instrument in question—by some instrument which at the next step that on the otherside ought in the appointed course to follow it—loses his cause of this eventuallyconclusive evidence the power it may be said cannot be great since—by so proper and simple an operation as that of exhibiting the corresponding counterinstrument the party to whose prejudice the conclusion would operate—gets rid of it simple enough yes but instances are but too abundant in which the operation simple as it is is impracticable—foreknown to be impracticable to the performance of the operation money is necessary and on that side—money being by the other side known not to be forthcoming—what is thereby known is that the exhibition of the counterinstrument is not practicable it is accordingly because foreknown to be impracticable that the operation is thus called for for which purpose falsehood the most barefaced falsehood is admitted to serve—admitted by those judges to whom its quality is no secret—admitted with exactly the same composure as if it were known to be the strictest truth thus it is that under favour of the mendacitylicence thus established every man who being to a certain degree opulent has or desires to take for his adversary a man to a certain degree less opulent has it in his power whether on the plaintiffs side or on the defendants side to give to his juridicallydelivered allegations by what name soever denominated—pleadings or any other—the effect of evidence—the effect not only of evidence but of conclusive evidence and thus it is that by the forbearance—the astute forbearance—to give to the security afforded by punishment the extent necessary to justice mendacity is generated and cherished injustice through misdecision produced—the evils opposite to the direct ends of justice produced by means of the evils opposite to the collateral ends of justice among lawyers and mere especially among english lawyers so commodiously and thence so universally is custom accepted as an adequate substitute to reason—so unprecedented is it for a man to trouble himself with any such thought as in regard to any of the established torments out of which his comforts are extracted what in point of utility and justice may have been the ground for the establishing of them—or so much as whether they have or ever had any such ground at all—that at the first mention a question to any such effect will be apt to present itself to them as no less novel than idle and absurd but concerning judgment by default and everything that is equivalent to ita—be it in a house of commons—be it in a house of lords—be it in any other place—should any such misfortune happen to him as to feel himself under a necessity of finding something in the character of a reason to give in answer to the question—why it is that judgment by default is made to follow upon default his reason would be this or nothing viz that in this case on the defaulting side want of merits is inferred and not only so but that it is from the allegations contained in the instrument last delivered on the other side—it is from that and nothing else that the inference is deduced at the same time that which be he who he may is well known to him—or at least but for his own wilful default would be known to him—that which he has always in his hands the means of knowing—means beyond comparison more ready than any which are possessed by the vast multitude who at the instance of his tongue and by the power of his hand are so incessantly and remorselessly punished—punished for not knowing that which it has so diligently and effectually been rendered impossible they should know is—that in the case of an average individual the chances against the truth of the conclusion thus built and acted upon aremany to one to be assured of this all that a man has to do on the one side of the account is to look at the average or even at the minimum amount of the costs on both sides which on each side a party subjects himself to the eventual burthen of—or though it were at those on one part only—on the other side of the account at the annual amount of what an average individual of the labouring class beyond all comparison the most numerous class—or even though it were an average individual of the aggregate of all classes the very highest not excluded—has for the whole of his possible expenditure this comparison made then it is that any man may see whether by forbearance to go on with an existing suit at any stage on either side—whether on the plaintiffs side by forbearance to commence a suit—any preponderant probability be afforded of what is called a want of merits a equivalent to it examples—in commonlaw practice judgment as in case of a nonsuit in equity practice taking of the bill pro confesso in case of what is called contempt for—when by the ruin of his fortunes and consequent inability to pay the appointed price for a chance of justice a man has been reduced to the lowest pitch of humiliation—contempt the offspring of pride is imputed to him and it is for this pride that he is punished—punished by being excluded from that chance of two allpervading masses of instances in which throughout the whole system of technical judicature conclusions having been built are continually acted upon—acted upon by men to whom one and all the premises on which those conclusions are built and thence the conclusions themselves are—or without their own wilful default would be—known to be false this is the first for the mention of which the occasion has here happened to present itself under the head of nonobservance of formalities a failure considered as being or at least dealt with as if it were evidence—evidence conclusively probative of unfairness on the part of a contract or spuriousness on the part of an instrument of contract—under this other head mention of another instance will come to be made in the chapter on preappointed evidence nullification—to which belong conjugates and quasiconjugates much too abundant to be here collected—null void bad quash set aside and so forth—nullification is the name given to the factitious engine of iniquity by which the sort of effect here spoken of is in both instances produced instruments and operations of judicial procedure—contracts and instruments of contract—whatsoever has been the subject to which it has been applied lawyers profit is what the machinery will be found to have had exclusively for its object lawyercraft for its inventor and constructor iniquity and misery for its effects by encouragement as well as impunity thus given to mendacity—if it be on the plaintiffs side the number of suits is made to receive that addition which is brought to it by those in which the dishonesty—the mala fides as the phrase is—is on the plaintiffs side by the like boon bestowed on the defendants side the like addition is made to the number of those to which continuance is given by dishonesty on the defendants side see more to this purpose under the head of oath on all these occasions partner and accomplice in the fraud on one side of the cause in the oppression on the other the judge as well as his collaborators extracts emolument out of the mendacity thus produced under the name of pleadings—the mendacious evidence thus suborned is all in writing—and the mass of writing is a mine of feesa a to quote or refer to the instances in which profityielding mendacity is thus generated would be to quote or refer to the whole contents of the several lawbooks in which under the name of books of practice for the use and benefit of the members of the profession the course of judicial procedure is delineated  under the french system of regular procedure the range of the mendacitylicence was still more extensive than under the english those incidental or interlocutory instruments applications and other operations which under the english system require to give them effect testimony delivered upon oath viz in the shape of a readywritten affidavit were under the french system with little or no exception made and performed and effect given to them without oath in the     smalltyped pages of a quarto volume ravaut—procédure civile du palais not the least trace of an affidavit or anything that in respect of oath or punishment could have been calculated to answer the purpose could be discovered the consequence was—that for protracting litigation lies so they were but in writing were by french uttered and received for truth with still less reserve if possible than by english justice still more perhaps than here confusion was thickened and litigation lengthened by diversity of courts and appeals the pace of english common law was outlingered in the westminster halls of france by any such distinction as that between common law and equity with different though confederated sets of shops for the sale of them the understandings of mankind have

procedure in so far saved † true it is that at present—under an official custom the commencement of which might be matter of curiosity at least if not of use in furtherance as it would naturally be said of the object of this statute the three great commonlaw justice shops in westminster hall have been and continue to be generous enough fees being duly paid to lend out—a partner or a journeyman as it may happen—for the performance of this ceremony the person whose testimony is to be delivered to the arbitrators being taken by an attorney to the court or one of its offices and there sworn a judge being present viz either in fact or—what but for the imposture would be quite as well—in law but—besides that not only the officer must on this occasion have his fee but the attorney by whom this witness is ushered to the office and the solemnity conducted another and if any a much greater fee—how efficient soever the act may thus have been rendered within the limits of the metropolis and its vicinity what unless it be once or twice ayear for one or two days at an assizetown does it amount to anywhere else in pretence it was designed for the benefit of merchants—out of london are there no merchants in pretence it was designed for merchants and others—out of london are there neither merchants nor others even this driblet of relief finds more perhaps than a counterbalance in an abuse to which the same act has given if not birth increase the service i mean which at an enormous increase of expense it renders in the character of a cloak to the continuance given to the forms of jury trial in cases where the substance not only is but is acknowledged to be impossible of this abuse an exemplification may be seen in scotch reform antea p     cluster of declarations consisting of the several virtual declarations made by the several jurymen in and by their respective consents given to the verdict the habitual mendacity necessarily involved in the pretended unanimity so uselessly and wantonly necessitated seems too manifest to require or even admit of proof † hence it is that in matters of libel for example where there not being any real law there cannot be any real transgression and where there not being any real transgression conviction never has had nor till real law shall have created delinquency and defined transgression ever can have any sufficient warrant—to so happy a state of ductility has the conscience of the jurybox been moulded that unless by some rare and nevertobelookedfor casualty prosecution and conviction—would were it not for the intervening costs by which trial is rendered an additional punishment be in effect and virtue undistinguishable ‡ example—encouragement given to juries to counteract the declared intention of the legislature and dispense with the capital part of the appointed punishment by attributing upon their oaths to any number of guineas stolen a value under that of two guineas in the case of goods this undervaluation is continual and even in case of guineas—a case which admits of no possibility of unintentionality in the misstatement—examples of this mode of valuation have not been wanting  it has moreover the effect of conveying in company with the idea of the principal object as above the collateral idea of the judgment of disapprobation as passed upon such object by the person by whom it is employed this being the case in diminution of the mischief suppose it observed that on that consideration it may be supposed to be meant to confine itself in its application to the case in which the particular measure in question is of the number of those which by that person are or would be disapproved of but no assertion to this effect being directly and explicitly conveyed no such obligation as that of considering it as thus limited is imposed upon him and therefore instead of being the worse it is but so much the better adapted to the sinister purpose here in view  written march       having operated as a stumbling block when employed by the church of rome it seems to be understood that in and by the church of england the term infallibility shall not be employed in practice however the thing itself the attribute so denominated is not the less assumed it will be seen and grounded upon so that in the articles of liberty and security all that is gained to the people by the relinquishment of the term is the substitution of a circumlocution to the proper appellative while by the grammatical impropriety the political—the despotic—pretension and its supporters are screened in some measure from the reproach so justly due  ex gr at magdalen college viz by the oath there taken for the observance of the college statute see in ayliffes hist i     as per terræ filius i

question unabrogated continue to be administered like quære in regard to the several other colleges † not to speak of the absurdity of this theory upon the face of it it is not without full notice of the practical consequences of it that these reverend guardians and instructors of youth have persevered so determinately in the propagation of it to one of their own number—to that same principal of hertford hall afterwards hertford college—it had been an instrument of grievous annoyance in despite of both sanctions political and supernatural—in despite of prohibition and oath together—a scholar of his had marooned in the  0s penalty under favour of the explanation of the oath the fugitive and the ruling member of a college that received and harboured him had found instead of what it professed to be a bar what it was in effect a licence and at the price of these  0s the act of migrating from one of those seats of piety and morality to another—this act which supposing it an offence is more than ten times as bad an one so it will be seen says the penalty as that of being taken in the act of fornication without licence—had received its expiation—the faith of both sinners in the power of they know not who to absolve them from their oaths having made them whole against an abuse thus dangerous to his authority the reverend disciplinarian in a lamentation of no fewer than  0  pages gave vent to his complaints but though the root of the mischief lay in the first place in the oath in the next place in the explanation by which that same oath is explained away—so fundamental a doctrine is the doctrine of infallibility and so incompatible with it would have been the abolition of abuse in any shape however flagrant—that although in the abolition of one or other or both of these conflicting institutions he could not but see his only remedy yet—so perfectly hopeless was the prospect—that the dose of courage necessary to enable a man to come forward with a proposal for the application of this only remedy could never in all these  0  pages nor at any time afterwards be mustered up ‡ besides scattered articles in other places in tit xv de moribus conformandis to look

but when it is considered that it must be a young mans own fault if ever he is called upon to pay it and then there is the bawdyhousekeeper to pay in one case and the girl to pay in every case it will scarcely upon due consideration be pronounced excessive if prevention were an object the act really meant to be prevented would it should seem here be—not as might at first view be supposed fornication but stinginess or negligence in either case the not giving a bedmakers boy  d to keep watch or in the case of the bawdyhouse choosing one that has not a backdoor to it §   de domibus

booksellers shop—this is not the mark aimed at all that is meant is—that as in the case of the bawdyhouse a reasonable cause approved as such by his reverend superiors saves a young man harmless so might it even in the case of the booksellers shop homicide has its justifications and why not the going into a shop even though it be a booksellers—and so in the case of coffeehouses no   p     §

intention the words are here so extremely general—domo quâcunque—every house whatsoever—that if caught a man would be no better off in the bawdyhouse supposing it to have struck nine than in the

at the hands of her younger sister figure of rhetoric all this it is true but where church is concerned argument is never carried on with any other instruments in every question concerning the doctrine or discipline of an established church there are certain postulates which must be assumed and admitted in the character of first principles principles such that he who should presume to include them in the subjectmatter of inquiry would be a man not to be argued with—that a certain number of men mostly old or middleaged or an uncertain portion of that number compose together at pleasure at one time one preeminently beautiful howsoever ancient as well as pious and in every respect excellent and admirable woman who has a family of her own composed of fathers and sisters and daughters and whatsoever else is necessary—at another time a most spacious lofty magnificent ancient and venerable building—at another a collection of admirable rules and ordinances—at another time all human beings whatsoever who either believe or are supposed to believe to be true what this beautiful woman i e these old and middleaged men say is true or who are forced to pay them for saying so † inoperative to beneficial purposes operative to mischievous ones—inoperative to the purpose of securing testimonial verity for the use of justice operative to the purpose of securing fidelity to mischievous engagements—positions thus contrary how it may be asked can they be reconcilable the answer is—that when with a view to practice spoken of in the character of a security for testimonial verity and pronounced inoperative that which to the making good the position is not in that view necessary is—that the ceremony should not in any individual instance have operated in the direction and with more or less of the effect in that case intended what is sufficient is—that whatsoever beneficial effect it may in this character have been productive of over and above what might without any inconvenience have been produced without its assistance would not have been considerable enough to compensate for the evil produced in various shapes by the various mischievous applications made of it as above in particular instances individually taken whether it has or has not had any and what separate operation is a matter of fact wholly out of the reach of ascertainment why because this never is applied but in conjunction with these other forces viz that of near impending punishment and that of present shame the consequence is—that in these same instances as it cannot be proved to have had any operation so neither can it be proved to have had none  true it is that in the same chapter v    think not says jesus that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfil    c but from this passage can the oathandperjurycompelling powers think to extract a warrant for the exaction or reception of the assertory—the judicial oath can any such notion be maintainable as that—the assertory the testimonial the judicial oath having been allowed by the mosaic law—the prohibition of it by jesus would pro tanto be a destruction of that law and therefore consistently with the explanation thus given by him cannot be supposed to have been intended in the first place—although true it is that if the ordinance in question were of the positive cast commanding the thing in question to be done a posterior law prohibiting that same thing from being done would pro tanto be destructive of such prior law—yet whereas in the present case that which by the posterior law in question is prohibited was by the prior law not commanded but only left unprohibited—what is not true is—that without special words in the prior law to guard against such prohibition any such destruction would in common understanding be understood to be effected in the next place if by the prohibition of the assertory oath or vow the mosaic law would have been destroyed then so was it by the prohibition of the promissory oath or vow—for that this was in contemplation and by jesus meant if anything was meant to be included in the prohibition is put out of doubt by the word performance—but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths by these are plainly meant oaths capable of being performed i e vows promises—intelligible and serious promises—capable of being performed not that species of nonsense which under the name of profane swearing stands prohibited under  s and  s penalties by english statute law  when will the language of truth be the

the natural situation of those same wise nations with reference to all other nations which other nations in consideration of their deficiency in the article of wisdom were lumped together under the general denomination of barbarians at the same time in case of a special agreement or treaty of peace entered into for that purpose any nation in particular might stand exempted from that fate to which but for such special exception it was doomed accordingly among the greeks by two correspondent and singleworded denominations expressive of the absence and presence of this circumstance of exception barbarians were distinguished into those between which respectively and the wise nation peace meaning by peace treaty had place and those with whom no such peace had place and among the

and official remuneration in the character of a supplement to the section on official remuneration as reprinted in the extract from the constitutional code—matter under this head has for some time past been collecting but no great progress in it had been made when the observation was also made that this is but one modification of the manner of bringing into coincidence the line of conduct prescribed by private interest and that prescribed by public duty and that—to complete the problem what was requisite was the establishing the correspondent closeness of connexion between maleficence on the one part and punishment on the other part—punishment together with the several other remedies which the nature of things admits of—namely satisfactive suppressive and preventive desirable and requisite is this coincidence in the case of official men—true but not more so than in the case of all other persons whatsoever these things observed what was further observed was—on the other part that the head to which this disquisition belongs is that of nomography in general but in the collection of matter under this head considerable progress had been already made the artandscience of clothing in the best adapted form the several modes of giving expression to the dictates of the will may be considered as a hitherto unobserved branch of logic the branch of artandscience as yet designated by the name of logic being as to its subjectmatter confined to the dictates of the understanding—a faculty not exactly the same with the will though not far distant from it nomography—from a greek word which signifies law and another which signifies to write or say give expression to—is an appellation which presented itself as capable of being made to serve with most convenience for the designation of the logic of the will true it is that between the will operated upon and the will operating upon it degrees of relation in respect of power there are three namely superiority equality and inferiority and that in the case of nomography the relation borne by the operating will to the will operated upon is no other than that of superior to inferior and as in the case where the will operating is that of the superior the mode of address has its appropriate denomination namely in private life command in political life law ordinance and so forth—so has it in the case where it is that of an equal as for example proposal or proposition so likewise in the case where it is that of an inferior as for example petition not to mention other appellations of a less decided character these things notwithstanding—no sufficient cause presented itself to view for considering the matter of this branch of artandscience as distributed under those denominations corresponding to the arithmetical distinctions or for looking out for any other denomination than this of nomography why answer—  because in comparison of the occasions on which the expression of will receives the name of law those on which it receives the two other denominations are when taken together so much less important the interest at stake being so much less considerable   because the motives or say inducements by which compliance the effect aimed at is produced are not in those cases at bottom so different as to a first glance they will be apt to appear to be   because in respect of the rules having for their object and effect the securing the coincidence between the mode of conduct which it is the desire of the operating will to produce on the part of him whose will is operated upon and the conception thereby entertained of that same will the difference in the several cases is comparatively inconsiderable supposing the assortment of rules for this purpose correct and complete as applied to law—nothing or next to nothing will require to be done in the view of providing rules for those two other cases should the papers thus denominated arrive at a state in which they will have been deemed fit to see the light—it will then be seen—in what a variety of ways the effects of imperation in its two shapes—positive command or say jussion on the one hand and prohibition or say inhibition on the other—are producible consequence of this variety difference—in some cases between the effect intended and the effect produced in other cases between the effect appearing to be intended and the effect in reality intended—cause of the difference in the first case want of discernment in the other case discernment applied to a sinister purpose here then in the political melodrama are so many dramatis personæ who enter upon the stage in masquerade prohibition disguised under the cloak of positive command positive command or permission under the cloak of prohibition permission remuneration

following extracts are made is contained in pages from    to    inclusive † page     this was in march    0 † after all it was not by the excellent lord somers that this profundity of policy was or considering the side taken by him could consistently have been displayed it was to another excellent lawlord though not noble lord viz the lord chiefjustice holt that the glory of it should have been ascribed rewards and punishments says he are the supporters of all governments—and for that reason it is that there ought to be a power in all governments to reward persons that deserve wella—proof sufficient to the excellent lord chiefjustice that it was no more than right and fitting that it should always be and so long as anything was left remain in the kings power to give away to anybody he pleased whatsoever part of the peoples money he could contrive to lay his hands on but it is to be objected says the excellent lord chiefjustice that the power in the king of alienating his revenues may be a prejudice to his people to whom he must recur continually for supplies but to this objection the excellent chiefjustice had his answer ready—i answer says he that the law has not such dishonourable thoughts of the king as to imagine he will do anything amiss to his people in those things in which he has power so to do reason sufficient with the excellent chiefjustice to trust the king thus in the lump with the arbitrary and uncontrouled disposal of mens properties—reason not less sufficient might it have been for trusting the same royal person on the same terms with their liberties and their lives this was whig common law what more could a king have had or wished for from tory common law this theory then which to the views of our orator being so convenient was in the judgment of the orator so excellent—this theory was the theory—not of the excellent lord keeper but of the excellent lord chiefjustice not that by this mistake of john for thomas any very material injustice was done to the excellent lord keeper for in this instance if anything was wanting in theory not that any such deficiency appears it was made up in practice to the profits of the office—those profits for an eventual supplement to which even lord eldon required or at least obtained not more than a floating £ 000 ayear—these profits not being sufficient for making reward the origin of that family for affording to it a sufficiently broad foundation of wealth as well as of honours—a pension for life of £ 000 ayear was added £ 000 ayear then equal at least to £  000 ayear now this as not being in fee being still insufficient an estateb which was and is in fee was added an estate which according to his own admission and valuation made for the purpose was producing at that time no more than a poor £  00 ayear if the statement thus given in general terms by the learned and noble grantee for the purpose of his defence against an impeachment is to be taken for correct how much at present is best known to some noble or not noble proprietor or other related or not related into whose hands it has passed but this £ 000 ayear and this £  00 ayear and this £  000 ayear more or less these et cæteras were they any of them ever begged for by the excellent lord oh no so he himself expressly assures us—begged for no more than the tellership was begged for by mr yorke these are of the number of those gracious designs which till the very moment of their taking effect are never known of while the eyes of the right honourable person are as usual fixed on heaven the grant is slipped into his pocket and when putting in his hand by accident he feels it there his astonishment is not inferior to his gratitudea note that for no such expense as this in so rare an article as wisdom was there any the smallest need in the time of charles the second the bank of england not as yet born or thought of money to the amount of above a million a vast sum in those days part their own part that of their customers having been lent to the king by a set of bankers was by him the said king converted to his own use in court english the exchequer was shut up in a succeeding reign viz that of king william the question was whether there was power in the crown sufficient for applying a particular branch of its revenues in part restitution of the profit of this robbery yes says this lord chiefjustice for the branch in question a new one—a portion of the excise was given to the king in exchange for an old branch viz the branch called wards and liveries whoever has an estate in fee may alienate it in the wards and liveries the king had an estate in fee—the excise was by act of parliament given to him in lieu of those wards and liveries and what is more by the express words of the act he was and is empowered to alienate it this supposing the construction put upon the act not inconsistent with the words of it might one should have thought have sufficed for argument but this would not have sufficed to show the learned lords acquaintance as above with the depths of policy nor yet the honourable thoughts entertained of the king by the law—and so ex abundantiâ the sage reasons that have been seen were added whatsoever money the king could contrive to lay his hands upon that the virtuous whig chiefjustice was content to see him waste why for this plain reason because the law has not—i e he his predecessors and colleagues had not any such dishonourable thoughts of the king as to imagine he will do anything amiss to his people in those things in which he has power so to do and what was the incident that called forth their effusion of faith and confidence it was that of a king having robbed his subjects robbed them of so much money—and for what to hire men with for robbing in conjunction with their enemiesa—for robbing and murdering their alliesb now therefore in my humble conception of the matter—whosoever it was that went thus far whether it was the excellent lordkeeper whether it was the virtuous and intrepid whig chiefjustice went so far it is no very easy matter to imagine how the learned colleagues of the chiefjustice or any of them should as edmund burke says they did go further and that for any imaginable set of existing circumstances for any imaginable purpose of accommodation convenience reward of merit reward of eminent services and so forth—not to speak of reasonable useful and honest purposes—it went far enough of all conscience of these honourable thoughts one effect was to reduce to such a state of debility the learned thinkers learned imagination as to disable it from representing to him as possible a state of things which his memory if consulted upon the occasion could not but have represented to him as realized and that no more than seven years before that state of things expressed—the half of it by the lawyers word abdication the whole of it by the peoples word revolution but for which i mean the revolution his master could not have been a king nor himself a lord chiefjustice this master of his was now king and now whatsoever power the king has is become incapable of being used amiss misuse being in such hands either the same thing as use or what comes to the same thing converted into use this is the way the sort of a thing called common law is made not content with exercising the power which he has nothing will serve a man but he must display the wisdom which he has not he bewilders himself and raves and his ravings as often as it happens to them to suit the interest or the humour of those that come after him these ravings of his become law principles and practice together nothing could be better matched practice found by the excellent lordkeeper—principles by the excellent lord chiefjustice note that while lawyers as well as favourites were thus fattening for the reign of william though a reign of salvation for england and for europe was a reign of waste and favouritism the state for want of common necessaries was continually on the brink of ruin expense unprecedented ways and means scanty deficiencies abundant losses distressing credit at deaths door a modern reports vol v pp         will iii the bankers case b the manor or manors of rygate and howleigh which according to the tory house of commons were at that time worth upwards of £  000 but according to the noble and excellent defendant far short of that value though how far short he was not pleased to say also divers other good gifts the amount of which became the matter of so many disputes which the impeachment of the excellent lord not having come to a trial was never settled—vide state trials vol v pp   0         a of the relative quantity of the

b the dutch  burke p    in the paragraph immediately preceding the one above quoted—i know too that it will be demanded of me how it comes that since i admit these offices sinecures to be no better than pensions i chose after the principle of law had been satisfied meaning the principle with how little propriety soever it can be termed a principle of law the principle of policy and humanity that forbids the abolition of them though it be by the legislature to the prejudice of existing rights of property i e without adequate compensation i chose to retain them at all this being the question now reader whether you have or have not read part i of this tract chapter iii on sinecuresa be pleased to observe the answer—to this sir i answer that conceiving it to be a fundamental part of the constitution of this country and of the reason of state in every country that there must be means of rewarding public service these means will be incomplete and indeed wholly insufficient for that purpose if there should be no further reward for that service than the daily wages it receives during the pleasure of the crown thus far edmund burke and thus far and without inverted commas or any other token of adoption the existing committee on finance  d report p     substituting only for the words—to this sir i answer that conceiving the words at the same time regarding here we see what according to the logic of the rhetorician constitutesa sufficient reason why the quantity of annual emolument in question should not be put into the shape of pension but be continued in the shape of sinecure and this is the flourish which with the question between sinecures and pensions before their eyes the committee copy and though like the orator in the way of concession exhibit not the less in the character of a fundamental part of the constitution of this country this principle consists in the habit which under common law is the same thing as the power of creating offices with fees annexed to the same and receivable by the officers successively invested with the same of creating these feegathering offices or what comes to the same thing annexing more and more fees to offices of this sort already created fees that as taxes are exacted by the sole authority of some official person or persons without allowance special or general from the representatives of the people in parliament this principle may be seen flourishing to this day and with unabated vigour for so long as the word tax is not mentioned and instead of a contribution to a tax the money levied is called a fee and instead of the pocket of the public the pocket it goes into is that of the imposer and the assembly in the composition of which the people have some share have no share in the imposition of it nothing can exceed the acquiescence and complacency with which the good people of this country as well as its parliament are content to view it especially when the tax thus imposed is imposed upon that class of the community which is composed of the distressed members of all the other classes and by so fast a friend to the rights of the people and to liberty and to juries and to the laws which forbid the levying money upon the people without consent of parliament and to the magna charta which forbids the delaying of justice and to the magna charta which forbids the sale of justice and to the magna charta which forbids the denial of justice whether by putting a price upon it beyond what they have to give or otherwise as the noble exchancellor then chancellor legislating with the advice and consent of his right honourable subordinate whose experience in equity business found such a contrast to that of the commonlawlearned novice†—see note † next page thus from this table it appears that of the four great westminsterhall courts there is not one in which the principle of taking the property of the distressed to make fortunes for court favourites or in the orators language to make it the origin of families and the foundation of wealth and honours was not applied—not one in which the application of it is not to this very day continued a natural question here is—how in so great a length of time it comes to have made so small a progress the answer is—that in the hands of the king this mine having soon after its discovery been worked too openly and too rapidly the consequence was that the thus working of it received the check we hear so much of and care so little about and that from that time it was given up to those useful servants of his whose professional dexterity was now become necessary to enable a man when working under the rose to make a living profit out of it the earliest instance of which any effect or memory is now remaining is as the table shows of as early a date as the reign of henry the second soon after him came king john whom besides his magna charta so many details that have come down to us on record prove to have kept an open shop for the sale of the commodity which went by the name of justice and in which the prices were not then in any sort as at present they are in some sort fixed in king johns reign comes this magna charta and thenceforward so far as concerned the sort of public service rendered by the gavestons the spencers and the mortimers this source of permanent reward to public service was nearly dried up and for what few drops have here and there been collected by the successors of those accomplished gentlemen they have been forced to enter into a sort of partnership with the gentlemen of the long robe had it not been for the obstruction just mentioned the present amount of that part of the produce of the stamp duties which is levied upon those who are distressed whether by or for want of the commodity sold under the name of justice would have composed but a part and that a small one of that part of public money which would have followed the fate of the crown lands under and by virtue of the principle thus maintained by holt and fattened upon by somers— i say but a small part for had the mine continued in individual hands with the power and capital of the king openly employed as under king john in backing them it would have continued to be worked with that zeal and consequent success by which labour in private is so much to its advantage distinguished from labour on public account and supposing any remnants of it as of the crown lands to be still remaining the percevals of the present day instead of being occupied in the augmentation of those taxes on distress for the benefit of rich and poor together defending inch by inch and not always without loss those parts of the produce which stand appropriated to the enrichment of the rich would have been exclusively employed in the more agreeable occupation of giving additional breadth to the foundation of wealth as well as honours upon the plan here sketched out by edmund burke and with as little reserve or mystery as was found necessary by king john in the halcyon part of his days in the court of chancery there exists a set of men called from their number the sixty clerks whose situation is something compounded of or intermediate between that of an officer of the court and that of an attorney they are officers of the court inasmuch as through an intermediate nomination they are nominated by a subordinate judge of the court the master of the rolls and inasmuch as in every cause the parties on each side are obliged to employ one or other of them they are attorneys inasmuch as they are agents of the parties and on each side of a cause the party or parties through the medium of their respective attorneys called here solicitors have their choice which of them to employ in the same court there exists another set of men called the six clerks whose situation seems to be purely that of an officer of the court to each of these six clerks belongs the nomination of ten out of the sixty clerks which nominations he either sells or gives whichever mode of disposition happens in each instance to be most for his advantagea of these six clerks the nomination belongs to the master of the rolls for the time being which nomination like the lord chancellor and chief justices of the kings bench and common pleas he in like manner either sells or gives according to the mode of disposition that happens to be most to his advantage the greater the annual value of a sixty clerks place the greater the value of the place of a six clerk who has the gift or sale of it the greater the value of a six clerks place the greater the emolument of the place of the master of the rolls who has the gift or sale of it by order of the court of chancery dated   th february   0  signed by the lord chancellor lord erskine and by the master of the rolls sir william grant by whose advice and assistance he states himself as acting therein a new schedule of fees is established and authorized to be taken by each one of those sixty clerks—fees described in so many articles    in number and the amount avowedly increased in the instance of each article a prior instance had been found in which in like manner viz by a law enacted in the same way by the joint authority of the two judges bearing the same offices money had in this way about the middle of last century been levied upon those children of distress called suitors without consent of parliament coupled with power sinister interest begets precedent and precedent begets or rather precedent is law of the two modes in which without consent or privity of parliament law is made by the sole authority of the kings nominees in the character of judges this it must however be confessed is beyond comparison the least mischievous it not involving as the other

follows the whole passage— sir i think myself bound to give you my reasons as clearly and as fully for stopping in the course of reformation as for proceeding in it my limits are the rules of law the rules of policy and the service of the state this is the reason why i am not able to intermeddle with another article which seems to be a specific object in several of the petitions i mean the reduction of exorbitant emoluments to efficient offices if i knew of any real efficient office which did possess exorbitant emoluments—continues he and then comes the profession of the hypothetical and hypocritical wish to reduce them as above rules of law—rules of policy—service of the state—all these quiddities may here be seen held up to view as so many distinct limits serving as bars to reformation let down on this occasion for the particular purpose of stopping the reduction of exorbitant emoluments precious bars composed of rhetorical jargon void of meaning rules of law—no attempt to bring forward any such rule nor could any such attempt have been other than an absurd one rules of law yes to a judicatory but to the legislator what sort of a bar can that be which is removed or broken through of course at every step he takes—rules of policy and the service of the state—the same idea as in a strolling company the same performer brought on upon the stage twice over in two different dresses  this rule continues he p    this rule like every other may admit its exceptions when a great man has some one great object in view to be achieved in a given time it may be absolutely necessary for him to walk out of all the common roads and if his fortune permits it to hold himself out as a splendid example i am told continues he that something of this kind is now doing in a country near us but this is for a short race—the training for a heat or two and not the proper preparation for the regular stages of a methodical journey i am speaking of establishments and not of men as to the splendid example he was here alluding to it was that of necker and here as the sequel showed the orator was completely in the wrong what he could not make himself believe or at least could not bear that others should believe was that this training of neckers meaning the serving in the office of finance minister without salary could last for more than a heat or two it lasted however during the whole of journey nor that an unmethodical one he did more than serve the public without being paid for it he trusted the public that child of his own adoption with his own money—with the greatest part of his own money and that public—that base and profligate though in a pecuniary sense not in general corrupt trustee of his betrayed its trust † viz in the instances of

the author of these observations thinks that all practice which is contrary to an act of parliament or to the terms of a standing order of court originates in corruption and ought to be abolished in the particular instance complained of or when or however a practice at variance with law or order is first made known to the court  mr mansfield sent for the author of these observations to his chambers and there told him that the lord chancellor had expressed displeasure at something said in a letter to his secretary and advised an apology to be made in reply the author of these observations told his counsel that he was prepared to maintain what he had written and that he would not make an apology and having read to mr mansfield the draft of the letter mr mansfield said that he recollected when lord thurlow was made lord chancellor his lordship had mentioned to him in conversation that he had been told that he was entitled to receive some fees which he doubted his right to take and mr mansfield added that such fees must have been those alluded to in the letter † the letter to lord erskine was delivered to the late mr lowton who had a conversation with the author of

meaning of agent to a sixclerk which i see there what is his business—mr harts client stated that the agent was a person who manages the business for a sixclerk—lord chancellor and what does the sixclerk himself—solicitor attends the master—lord chancellor then he is entirely out of the business of his own office he does nothing in it—solicitor nothing my lord—the lord chancellor after a pause when i came into this court the sixclerks were the most efficient solicitors in the court of chancery some of the most eminent solicitors were clerks of that class and used to transact their business and draw up minutes with such ability that we had few or no motions to vary minutes but now the sixclerk abandons his business to a person who knows nothing at all about it tis no wonder then that delays have crept into the practice which we formerly knew nothing of however before it proceeds further ill take care that solicitors in this court shall be obliged to transact their business in

every other and whether while this one man is where he is deliverance from evil in that shape any more than in any other be possible henceforward in honourable house or in right honourable house—on the one side or on the other—should any man have the hardihood to stand up and declare that on either side there is any more real regard for justice there than in the hulks—or in mens breasts any more

with all the property of the kingdom at his disposal and in the cabinet to act as chief organizer of intrigues and moderator of squabbles about power money and patronage the cabinet situation being the paramount one—the most transcendent aptitude for the judicial situation cannot keep him in it—the most completely demonstrated inaptitude remove him out of it this under matchless constitution under which the most loudly trumpeted tune is—the independence of the judges practical lesson—never by any other means than the making the ruling few uneasy can the oppressed many obtain a particle of relief never out of mind should be the parable of the unjust judge as to lord redesdale digression upon digression as it is candour and sympathy compel the mention—he like mr peel has committed one

castlereagh  of this broadcast dissemination of uncertainty one obvious cause may naturally be found in the profit made in the two great shops—the private act of parliament shop and the charter shop in which the right of associating for mutually beneficial purposes is sold at so enormous a price—for the benefit of men by whom nothing but obstruction in this and other shapes is contributed wheresoever in the case of a public functionary remuneration wears the shape of fees there abuse in every shape is sure to have place not only in judicial offices so called but in all offices

he who does not believe answers that he does—thus answering falsely he is received if his answer be that he does not believe—speaking thus truly he is rejected of course it is by exploits such as this that rise has been given to this appalling question which in the capacity of a proposed witness is most trustworthy—the christian priest or layman who for a series of years has never passed a day without the commission of perjury—or the atheist who—when at the instance of lord eldon or any one of his creatures in the situation of judge interrogated as to what he believes—submits to public ignominy rather than defile himself with that abomination in so much as a single instance christians such of you as dare think of this and tremble question as to this virtual statute the source and seat of which is in the breast of lord eldon—if this is not a subornation of perjury what is or can be lord eldon—is his minds eye really so weak as throughout the whole field of legislation to be kept by words from seeing things as they area decide who can and give to head or heart—sometimes to the one perhaps sometimes to the other—the credit of this blindness a as to the constant and allpervading habit of perjury see swear not at all for cleansing judicature of this abomination a not unpromising course is in the power of individuals any suitor who sees a witness of whose testimony

of these statutes and whether in the breach of this or that article he did not constantly live on denial he will be indictable for perjury on admission it will be a question whether he can be heard lord eldon did you never take that oath lord eldon did you never violate it think of this lord eldon—mr peel did you never take that oath mr peel did you never violate it think of this mr peel  but parliament—contempts of its authority all the while thus continually repeated—what does it say to them say to them why nothing at all to be sure cabinet by which the wires of parliament are moved desires no better sport chancellor—by whom the wires of cabinet are moved and by whom the acts of contempt are committed or procured—looks on and laughs in his sleeve contempt of parliament indeed parliament desires no better than to be thus contemned and to be assured of this observe whether of the indications given in these pages it will suffer any and what use to be made contempt of parliament why all this is the work of parliament itself that which with its own forms it could not do without a world of trouble—what it might even be afraid to do—for where guilt abounds so does cowardice—it does by simple connivance without a particle of trouble but why talk of fear on each occasion whatever is to be done the object with all concerned is to have it done with least trouble to themselves by the hand of a judge those by whom parliament is governed do without any trouble that which without trouble in abundance could not be done by the hand of parliament in flash language common law—in honest english judgemade law—is an instrument that is to say judges are instruments—for doing the dirty work of parliament for doing in an oblique and clandestine way that which parliament would at least be ashamed to do in its own open way nor for the allotment of these parts is any such labour as that of concert or direction necessary nothing does the purpose require that an english judge should do more than what in his situation human nature and habit effectually insure his doing giving on every occasion to his own arbitrary power every possible extent by all imaginable means while this is going on so long as what he does suits the purposes of his superiors it is regarded of course with that approbation of which their silence is such perfectly conclusive evidence on the other hand to suppose for arguments sake an effect without a cause should he ever in any the smallest degree obstruct their purposes any the least hint would suffice to stop him what

topics   the quantity of interest disposed of   the absence or presence of an equivalent only in so far as regards the quantity of interest does this topic coincide with that to which reference is made by the words purchase of the absolute property as per note b—benefit of transmission to successors determined by the choice of parties included as to what concerns equivalents—the transfer may be as here with and for an equivalent or without one if with and for the equivalent may be either as here of money call it in this case pecuniary—or of moneys worth in any other shape call it in this case quasipecuniary if without equivalent—the transfer is gratuitous the transaction may be termed a gift the instrument a deed of gift grantor is a term which—where the transfer is not gratuitous but for money—our learned draughtsman i observe employs on several occasions it has however the inconvenience of presenting to view the idea of gratuitousness disposer a term having for its conjugates the verb to dispose and the substantive disposition—a term in familiar use—would have the convenience of including the three transactions sale mortgage and marriagesettlement for a correlative to it an obvious term is disposee and this same termination ee is indeed used in the same sense in the word mortgagee and in many other words but it has the disadvantage of presenting to view the subjectmatter disposed of in which case no person is unless he has the misfortune of being a slave accordingly if it depended on me to choose a word—a word i would rather employ is receptor receiver—the word already in use—having the disadvantage of presenting exclusively the idea of a person whose interest in the subjectmatter is only that of a trustee in the case of an immoveable subjectmatter of property as here—gratuitous transmission as everybody sees is not by a great deal so frequent as in the case of a moveable obvious cause of the difference the difference in respect of value nor yet as everybody knows is gift of an estate—absolutely without example this therefore is a mode of transfer or say transmission for which also provision will require to be made in the arrangements proper to be made in the code for the two cases—one difference there is which is highly important and not unobvious in the case where an equivalent is received—the eventual obligation designated by the word warranty presents itself as being prescribed by established principles not so in the case where no equivalent is received in both cases this word warranty presents itself as an obligation of which—either in the draught or in the code with reference to it from the draught—express mention should be made and of which it should accordingly be said either that it is or that it is not intended to have place  gift—to obviate ambiguity the use made of this word in the technical sense should in the code be abolished f all that as to the insufficiency and consequent inutility and redundancy of the necessarily incomplete particularization of which these words form the commencement—see above in the observations as to all those deeds considered together g appurtenances appurtenances no not i if i were mr benedict butler no such things would i have needless useless and unless inoperative mischievous—would be this word look at the books the only definition of it you will find warranted is—anything and everything which in virtue of some other word in the deed would pass without being mentioned in it but if so then to what use mention it not to miss campbell not to mr butler no not even to squire allen—would information in any shape be presented by it nothing better than appalment and perplexity not that imagination could present them with anything like the uncertainty and consequent mischief it is pregnant with look for it in the books though it were no further than jacobs dictionary you will find that outhouses are appurtenances to messuages messuages to messuages not orchards and gardens are appurtenant to messuages lands not whereby you will learn that orchards and gardens are not lands see now one effect of it in these same formulæ in this same deed of sale mention is made of it in the mortgage deed in the family settlement not a tyro conveyancer—what might not his sagacity infer from this that in the case of a sale appurtenances whatever they were would not pass without express mention made of them in the two other cases yes a tolerably good sample this of the effects of surplusage if to any mind this word presents any idea more definite than the above it must be that for giving expression to which our author employs the romebred lawword servitude—mention of which may require to be made further on h annext this word is here inserted as having obviously by error of the press been or the equivalent of it omitted out of the letter press   mortgage mortgage is the denomination by which for the present purpose i designate this sort of deed this being the most important and obvious species of the genus for the designation of which our learned author has employed the word charge preferable however to mortgage—preferable in every point of view and to a most important effect—would be landpledge mortgage is understood by nobody landpledge would be understood by everybody by everybody male and female who has ever seen or heard what passes at a pawnbrokers so much for name behold now how much may depend upon a right name behold the instruction that may be afforded by it give validity and currency to either of these forms—the authors or the reviewers—and there will be no more need of equity suits nor any more need of delay where land is the pledge than where a pair of earrings worth the same money or a tablespoon is the pledge and the present licensed depredation—in some circumstances on the part of the lender in others on the part of the borrower—is at an end what is it that should make the difference is not a sheet of paper as easily passed from hand to hand as a pair of earrings as to difference if any there be it is all of it in favour of the immoveable pledge for the jewels may be run off with the land can not secresy—in regard to rents—is that an object for example on the borrowers account lest the state of his finances should be made known more effectually can that be provided for in the case of the land than in the case of the diamonds the receiver of the rents whoever he is being supposed an object of confidence on both sides the transfer is made to him made to him in trust in case of payment on the appointed day to deliver the money or the land to the one party in case of nonpayment to the other here too as far as regards the principal all danger vanishes trustee can no more run away with the land than borrower or lender could and as to the interest it is no more than what every man who employs a steward by so doing trusts him with indulgence to debtors—is that an object how much better could it not be afforded how much likelier would it not be to be afforded—by a creditor who had no lawcharges to apprehend than by one who has lawcharges to apprehend—especially such as those which hang over his head at present behold now the extent of the benefit which this theory simple as it is may be made productive of if carried into practice benefit to landlords in general benefit to tenants in general benefit to everybody but to those who are among everybodys worst enemies and who will be sufficiently known by that name where recovery of rents is the object in so far as there is property enough of the tenants or anybody elses upon the premises—landlords—nor yet altogether without good reason—are by themselves trusted with the power of being themselves judges in their own cause well then—where recovery of possession is the object—pledges on the spot being wanting or insufficient—with how much less danger might they not be trusted with the power of being to the effect in question judges in the cause of others—meaning of course by others those with whom they have no connexion on this plan in case of appeal—and in that case only—might those judicatories have cognizance which at present have it in the first instance of the essentially and incurably corrupt and in every respect unapt judicatory in question my opinion is the same as that of the morning chronicle but so long as the people continue oppressed with it i see much less danger from this power in its hand than from most of that which is at present exercised by it as to the species of conveyances to which this system would be applicable—the same principles which would give simplicity to deeds of sale mortgage and settlement would give correspondent simplicity to leases turn now to the gamingtable on a visit to it—why in that case should not a noble lord or honourable gentleman put into his pocket a few papers of sales mortgages or leases as well as the correspondent number of rouleaus this is not a mere jest for if ruined why might he not be so—for the benefit of a set of companions of his own choice with whom he was living on convivial terms and in regard to whom in conjunction with the chance of being ruined by them he possessed an equal chance of enriching himself by their ruin and from whom he might receive more or less of indulgence why not as well for their benefit alone as partly for their benefit partly for the benefit of a set of lawyers whom he knows nothing of—from whom nothing is to be got—and from whom on his part nothing but ruin or a more or less near approach towards it can be expected lawyers by whom comparatively speaking such facility has been left to transfer in the case of moveables—whence happens it that they have dealt on so opposite a footing by it in the case of immoveables answer altogether simple society could not have held together and the matter of legal plunderage would either never have come into existence or as fast as it had come would have been swallowed up—had they thus loaded it in the case of moveables but in the case of immoveables the magnitude of the masses is such as renders it possible for them to bear the load sweet accordingly is the savour of the realty to learned noses   another half years interest but what if that happens which most commonly does happen what if the loan is continued as it sometimes is for years by dozens beyond the twelvemonth for this case no provision is here made see notes on the reviewers draught in any case on failure of payment prompt is the remedy needed and next to instantaneous is the remedy which as above the nature of the case affords yes and which would be afforded in fact if those judicatories which are law and equity courts in name were not iniquity courts if not in purpose in effect   proposed code matter which for reasons above mentioned namely in the observations on the three draughts taken together is regarded as superfluous—is for distinctions sake here printed in blackletter owing however to the want of correspondency between the plan of the authors and that of the reviewers draught—a considerable quantity of matter regarded as superfluous is left undistinguished as not being without explanation capable of being disentangled from needful matter this however may by any person to whomthe restriction presents itself as being worth the trouble be seen by a comparison between the two draughts   except as aforesaid three times the same exception—each all three times imbedded in the same sentence and a different set of words employed each time for the expression of it in the reviewers draught this and every other instance of involvement is avoided in his form of locution an article out of which an exception is taken opens with the words exceptions excepted and in the next article next to the words exceptions are as follow or exceptions are the following come the exceptions one after another each for distinction preceded by a numerical figure see official

with that surname which in the order of the alphabet stands first b sellers condition in case of dignity insert the title of titles more than one the highest in the case of a lord if a peer the peers name with that of the peerage in the case of a bishop his name with that of the bishoprick in case of a professional man his profession in case of a commercial man his business as manufacturer naming the subjectmatter of manufacture merchant shopkeeper tailor shoemaker carpenter smith c in case of a man not following any profitseeking occupation say esquire or gentleman in the case of a female—if never married say in the old accustomed form spinster adding the dignity if any or the profitseeking occupation if any single woman will not serve as not including females under age and as not distinguishing married females from widows in case of a married woman—concurring for example with her husband in the sale—mention her maiden name then her husbands as directed in note a and his condition as to occupation as per note b c sellers habitation if there be no fixed habitation write the word none if there be a habitation express it as in letters brought from the general postoffice if the habitation be not in a town insert the name of the county and that of the parish if in a town insert between the name of the county and the name of the parish the name of the town if there be fixed habitations in places more than one insert them all add in every case either householder or inmate d subjectmatter     its species for instance where integral and uncompounded say a piece of land cultivated or not cultivated or a dwellinghouse or another building as the case may be when integral and compounded of a dwellinghouse with or without outhouse and garden respectively with cultivated land say house with land annexed or farm as the case may be if the subjectmatter be a fractional right as a right of mineworking under land which belongs to a different proprietor—or right of fishing or right of drawing water from a mass current or stagnate—or share in the tolls of a road or canal—mention it accordingly if subjectmatters more than one are included in this deed mention them accordingly e purchase money for certainty write the sum at full length in words adding it for facility of conception in figures if in whole or in part the equivalent transferred consists of specific subjectmatters of property moveable or unmoveable one or more—a ship for instance a piece of jewellery or another piece of land—mention them f in his handwriting if able to write the person writes it as above directed if not he makes with his pen and ink the mark of a cross  after and close to it some other person writes the name adding the word witness with his own name written as directed in note a in the case of a person of the female sex a line is to be drawn through the word his and the word her written over it g day the year month and day of the month first in words then in figures properest writer in each case the seller or purchaser himself for greater certainty the day of the week may be added if as may happen by mistake the day of the month and that of the week do not agree the day of the week will be most likely to be rightly supposed the days in a week being in comparison of those in a month so much fewer h place designate the place as directed in note c i agreement this accordingly will in general in respect of the payment of the money be also the day and the place the place of performance and on this account to avoid carrying the form of the draught to an inconvenient length the circumstances which here follow are not inserted in the list of topics but in possibility they are susceptible of diversification without limit and in practice they are accordingly diversified to prevent misstatement with the falsehood involved in it—the attention is therefore in the proposed additional nos drawn to them that appropriate provision may be made in the code in the present practice falsehood is an instrument ever at hand for the solution of all difficulties by the practitioner employment is given to it by the judge the desired effect here follow the numbers   no    day or days in which the purchase money was made over      place or places at which the money was at the respective times made over      person or persons by whose hands respectively the money was made over      day or days on which the purchase money was received    0 place or places at which the money was at the respective times received      person or persons by whose hands respectively the money was received      form or forms in which the money was made over an additional topic this last under which as a preservative against fraud particularization may have its use in case of paper money at a discount as in the instance of currency in a distant dependency—without this particularization in conjunction with that of the time of payment the real value of the alleged equivalent will not be discernible as to the word sterling if there be any need of it or use in it it will be for the purpose of distinguishing metallic money from currency as above as for pounds scots there being no such money either in metal or paper no actual payment can be made in it note that on every occasion on which the money is sent by a public conveyance the times of receipt may be different from the times of payment so when sent by a private hand   pinmoney this word and the succeeding word jointure are in the same case being the words in common use and sure of being familiar to every person who is likely to become a party in a conveyance of the sort in question—here in a deed of which it so highly imports them to possess on every occasion an adequate conception—here is a perfectly good reason why these terms should be employed nor is there any why they should not as to pinmoney—nobody at the sight of this word is in any danger of supposing that the whole £ 00 ayear is to be laid out in pins any more than at the sight of the word spinster anybody would suppose that the whole life of the lady had been occupied in spinning   a rent charge on this occasion a question or two the reviewer cannot avoid putting in behalf of the future mrs allen   this same rent charge—from what day is it to be computed—from the day of her unhappy loss—from the quarterday next before it or from the quarterday next after it   by whose hands is it to be paid—on failure of payment what is it that to save herself from starving at the end of a few days she is to do at the end of a few years or so eldon and co are ready in the way that everybody knows to supply her necessities provided always that she has—what by the supposition she has not—money enough to satisfy their cravings as per note on the mortgagedeed here then comes another demand for prompt judicature for prompt judicature even though it were not to end in justice to some of these questions answer is given in the authors code p     reference to which is made for the present purpose in a note to the settlement deed p     not however to all nor in and from the deed is reference made to the document to wit the code in which an answer to them may be found in the reviewers draught a supply for this deficiency in the deed is provided to wit by reference made to the code   inalienable what does it mean what ought it to mean inalienable to all purposes whatsoever or with the exception of certain purposes if with exceptions—  inalienable for joint benefit by joint consent   inalienable for husbands benefit with wifes consent   inalienable for wifes own benefit at wifes desire   inalienable for childrens benefit on joint desire at   husbands desire at   wifes desire as above   inalienable at suit of creditors for payment of debts contracted by husband or by wife—matters all these presenting the same demand for discussion and decision somewhere but against all which the authors draught shuts the door by the allcomprehensive word inalienable in the code by article    under the security for freedom afforded by the wifes secret examination he allows the alienation of the whole of the subsistence provided for her by general law during widowhood also of any property derived by her during marriage from the bounty of a third person but is not the danger to her from fraud or improvident alienation incomparably less in the case of pinmoney than in the case of jointure—in the case where superfluities alone are at stake with her husbands property as a resource for necessaries than in the case where necessaries are at stake and that resource is at an end supposing for any purpose alienation with her free consent allowed—in that case for giving the allowance the words without her free consent would suffice but for particulars in that case as in so many others reference should be made from the deed to the code rendering this pinmoney—rendering the estate itself alienable for any one or every one of these purposes—would this render the provision ineffectual altogether not it indeed any more than establishing a general course of succession by law failing ditto by deed or will renders the power of transfer by deed or will ineffectual now as to alienation for payment of debts render the property inalienable altogether you leave exposed to the risk of disappointment by loss one set of persons render it alienable to this or that purpose you leave in like manner exposed to the risk of disappointment by loss another set of persons query in which case is the evil greatest answer render it inalienable altogether to the number of persons thus exposed there is no limit for all persons who in the capacity of workmen for example or petty traders have dealings with the parties are included in it and among them there may be those in whose instance owing to difference in respect of income the same nominal loss may be productive of a dozen a score a hundred a thousand times the suffering produced in the instance of the parties to the marriage render it alienable for the benefit of creditors—the suffering is confined to the sometimes indeed blameless and merely unfortunate but most commonly imprudent and thence culpable parties with the eventual addition of their children whom as well as themselves they had it in such case in their power by ordinary prudence to have secured against such loss for other landed property of the same kind—for other landed property of a different kind—for property in any other shape—government annuities for example or lifeassurance company annuities—it may happen that to the benefit of the parties to an unlimited amount an exchange might be made under a rational system of procedure with a correspondent judiciary establishment—all parties interested whether on selfregarding account or on account of sympathy towards the parties being allowed to intervene—exchanges of all sorts might for these purposes be made by any sets of persons with little or no expense even at present they are not unfrequently made yes but by what authority—in what way instead of judicial authority in the appropriate and apt way by legislative authority in an anomalous and unapt way and at an expense which not one person out of several thousands is able to defray and why thus made only that a set of placemen and lawyers may on each occasion share among them so many hundreds of pounds but the beings who have as yet no existence—the childrens children one set after another down to the worlds end—these are the dear possible creatures by whom to the exclusion of so many existing and suffering ones whatever sympathy has place in an aristocratical bosom is engrossed nor yet the whole number but that half of it alone whose merit and title will have consisted in the having received from the hand of positive and ungrounded law the name of their supposed male in preference to that of their female and thence more certain progenitors and it is for these same possible that actually existing human beings in unlimited number are to be cheated and to an unlimited amount made sufferers if during the existence of a form of government by which the interest of all besides is sacrificed to the assumed conjunct interest of the one and the few—it be on any account advisable to provide leadingstrings to check aristocrats in their individual capacity in their propensity to run into ruin the recent french institution of majorats would perhaps be the best adapted to the purpose always understood that in england it be confined to peerages in this case for the preservation—not indeed of the spendthrifts themselves from ruining themselves but of their relatives from suffering disappointments from them—inalienability would be the sole and tolerably efficient remedy but for preservation of all persons besides from being cheated and made sufferers by them—registration of which presently would be an indispensable and the sole remedy though unhappily as will be seen never more than an imperfect one   without impeachment of waste an odious locution this—relic of antique barbarism altogether unfit for any honest purpose in respect of morality what a lesson mischief under its own name expressly authorized by law by this expression when made use of what is it that is really intended that the estate should be wasted no only that in a particular shape a fair profit adapted to the nature of that shape should be reaped from it the profit thus intended—what is it—profit from the sale of timber growing on the estate this then is what should be said—more demand here for reference to an appropriate section in the appropriate code a section having for its object the confining within limits beneficial to all interests concerned the profit derivable from this source is any other fractional right intended to be reserved out of the aggregate right of ownership if so in conjunction with the right of cutting and selling timber it should be designated by some adequatelycomprehensive locution such for instance as lifeholders profit in the shape of capital with reference for explanation to the codes in the equity books to the head of waste under the subhead permissive waste for contradistinction from positive is referred omission to keep in repair under its ordinary and specific name in speaking of the correspondent obligation mention should be made of it in the code and referred to in the deed under both heads matter proper for the code will be found in those same books   gives up more demand for reference to the appropriate code the arrangement which mr humphreys and with incontestible reason proposes is—that in the code—to dower with its uncertainties be substituted—a provision as clear as may be of uncertainties this supposed done—thereupon will come a clause giving legality to whatever arrangement may in relation to this provision be made in a marriagesettlement for it is not for the legislator to whom all individuals are alike unknown—it is not for him on any such occasion to take upon himself to force upon them an arrangement which does not suit the purpose of the only individuals interested so far as their interests are alone concerned and laying out of the question whatever interest the public at large may have in the matter—what belongs to him is neither more nor less than to provide against fraud accident and on their part inadvertence and for these purpose alone to establish such allcomprehensive arrangement as presents a prospect of being well adapted in a greater number of instances than any other allcomprehensive arrangement that the case admits of but this supposed done—here in the tenor of the code would come the necessity of a subsidiary arrangement having for its object the securing to the widow at all events and at every point of time one or other of the two alternative provisions to wit that under the general rule and that under the particular rule agreed upon and laid down in the settlement employ the summary plan as per the note to the mortgage deed this security is established deny it you deny justice and leave the afflicted female in the condition expressed by the proverb of the two stools  how many hundred thousand pounds spent in miserymaking litigation for the benefit of judge and co would not a law to this effect if enacted in time have saved calculate from the cases alluded to by mr humphreys   fathers decease when arrived at this point not inconsiderable it cannot but be acknowledged would of course be the perplexity of miss campbell if she regarded herself as being under the obligation of obtaining any particular as well as clear conception of the contents but to no such painful obligation will the lady regard herself as subjected—so small will be the probability—and at any rate so great the distance—of such a state of things to an imagination occupied by the idea of nearapproaching happiness and should the desire ever come upon her of seeing—in what way in any proposed state of things the division may come to be made—a desire not likely to arise till she has marriageable children there in one of her drawers lie the means of satisfying it miss campbell throughout—miss campbell is the chief object of my care and why even because—whatsoever is either not understood or misunderstood is in proportion mischievous mischievous in the joint proportion of the importance of the matter and the number of persons interested from whose minds the true import is in either way excluded for from nonunderstoodness or misunderstoodness comes oppositeness to expectation from oppositeness to expectation disappointment from disappointment suffering in proportion to the importance of the consequences   heirs heirs coheiresses included inserted here of necessity and in want of a better is this word which none but lawyers can understand better a word such as successors which those whose property is at their disposal may understand that which for this and all other occasions is wanted is—a term which shall apply to property at large whichsoever be the subjectmatter—to wit immoveable or moveable—or what in lawjargon comes nearest to that expression say real or personal to which will require to be added incorporeal so whichsoever be the mode of derivation from such its source to wit whether simple and immediate as in the case of genealogical succession or unimmediate and with the intervention of individual will as in the case of transfer whether by deed or last will a desideratum this which may and should be provided for us instead of our being sent for a meaning to the obscure history of a barbarous state of society altogether different from the present this desirable term is presented by the word successors this then if found apt for the purpose is the word that will naturally be employed should ever a rule of action be provided which it is intended that those whose actions are to be determined by it should have the possibility of understanding on the present occasion the distinction might in that case be expressed by some such words as landtaking successors and moneytaking successors heirs should in that case be in all its applications eliminated out of the code and abandoned to the society of antiquaries as to lawyers—as in respect of honour as well as profit it is their interest so of course is it their desire and endeavour that the rule of action more especially in matters of property be understood by as few and to that end be as unintelligible as possible as for what the rest of the community suffer from this state of things this is what scarce one in a thousand ever thinks about as it is with wolves so is it with lawyers what sympathy they have if any it is sympathy for their own kind all of it for their prey none of it thence comes in the arrangements themselves that complicatedness by which so much complicatedness in the expression given to them is necessitated complicated is the description of those persons who separately or collectively are to be in the possession of the estate correspondently complicated accordingly is the description of those who are not to have any part in the estate what simplicity of description there is in the case is confined to this namely that whoever has the whole of or any part in the estate has not any part in the money and that whoever has the whole of or any part in the money has not at that same time the whole of or any part in the estate unless by the death of some anterior taker of it   weston shropshire between wordiness and sufficiency some difference it is hoped will now have been seen exemplified—every superfluous word is an additional cloud of wordiness in the degree in which it is exemplified by english law practice so far from sufficiency deficiency is the result for when on this or that occasion such is the quantity of the heap of particulars inserted that the draughtsman is not able to bear the whole list continually in mind the consequence is—that on this or that other occasion though exactly parallel to it and calling for exactly the same list—some of them are omitted or other added or substituted whereupon in argument the difference in legislative or professional expression is of course made use of as a ground for difference in justicial decision of this sort of style—expensiveness and uncertainty with the profit from both were the manifest final causes and never were ends more abundantly accomplished now as to registration uses as applied to instruments of conveyance and contract relating to property in immoveables these—   preservation of these documentary evidences from loss and destruction   preservation of them from falsification   exclusion of corresponding counterfeit documents   in so far as the document is proof of incumbrance applying to the property of the possessor of the estate in relation to which the document registered operates as evidence of title—affording to all persons disposed to give him credit for money or moneys worth the means of guarding themselves against loss by insolvency on his part   affording by means of the aggregate of the evidence thus preserved and rendered susceptible of appropriate publication—information of the statistical kind capable of being turned to account by government for the benefit of the public in a variety of ways of these five good effects—the first gives security to the owner of the estate against accident the second and third against fraud and depredation at his expense on the part of the rest of mankind the fourth to the rest of mankind against fraud on his part the fifth contributes to form a basis for the exercise of the legislative and administrative functions alive to the importance of this means of security—mr humphreys taking it up upon its present footing affords for the improvement of it a quantity of highly valuable matter as to which i must content myself with referring the reader to his work i promised him a treat i now fulfil that promise such if it be to him such will the invention i have to present to view be to every reader in proportion as in his eyes security to a degree beyond everything that as yet has been experienced or can have been so much as anticipated is an object of regard by it if narrow and sinister interest in powerful breasts can but be induced to permit the employment of it—by it will preservation and appropriate publication be given to documentary evidence to whatever purpose needed preservation and what is of correspondent importance equally unexampled cheapness it is an invention of which i can speak my admiration the more freely as not having in my own person any part in it for the description of it and in a more particular manner of its uses—i have but to transcribe a passage of an abouttobe published proposed constitutional code ch viii prime minister §  0 registration system art   for the more commodious correct prompt uniform and allcomprehensive performance of the process and function of registration in all the several departments and subdepartments—as likewise on the part of the prime minister for the correspondent receipt by him of all documents the receipt and as occasion calls the perusal of which may be necessary to the most apt exercise of the several functions belonging to his own office—he will as soon as may be cause to be established and employed in practice in the several offices of the several departments and their subdepartments the sublegislative included the mode of writing styled the manifold mode art   particular uses of the manifold mode of writing are as follows— by the multitude of exemplars produced at an expense which with the exception of that of the paper is less than the expense of two in the ordinary mode it affords means for furnishing at that small expense to parties on both sides for themselves and assistants all such documents as they can stand in need of art   every exemplar being to an iota exactly and necessarily the same as every other the expense of revision by skilled labour is thereby saved as well as unintentional aberration rendered impossible art   an exemplar kept in the registrars office will serve as a standard whereby a security will be afforded against all intentional falsification on the part of the possessor of any other exemplar art   by the reduction thus effected in the expense of all judicial writings emanating from the judicatory—the protection afforded by judication in its best form—to wit that which has for its ground orally elicited and immediately minuted evidence—will be brought within the reach of a vast proportion of the whole number of the people to whom it could not otherwise be afforded art   a collateral benefit—a degree of security hitherto unexampled against destruction of judicial documents by calamity or delinquency—may thus be afforded by the lodging of exemplars in divers offices in which they would be requisite for other purposes exemplars of documents from the immediate judicatories being at the appellate judicatory requisite for the exercise of its judicial functions and in the office of justiceminister for the exercise of his inspective and meliorationsuggestive functions art   to save the expense of custody and prevent the useful from being drowned in the mass of useless matter—the legislature will make arrangements for the periodical destruction or elimination of such as shall appear useless care being at all times taken for the preservation of all such as can continue to be of use either eventually for a judicial purpose or for the exercise of the statistic and meliorationsuggestive functions as

such conveyance—without any addition to the expense the trifling expense of the paper excepted—we have no fewer than eight copies and upon occasion as far as twelve no one differing in a single tittle from any other and this identity effected without a particle of that skilled labour the purchase of which on the present plan can never fail to be so seriously expensive on this plan unless it were for concealment of particulars no need would there be for any such inadequate representative of the original as that which under the name of a memorial is employed in present practice to each one of the parties how numerous soever an exemplar would be given of course to obviate the case—at present so pregnant not only with delay vexation and expense but even with loss of estate for want of a producible title—as many exemplars might be had by one party as there were distinguishable parcels which he might anticipate an occasion for making disposition of so when it happens that one estate disposed of the whole of it by one and the same instrument is situated in the territories of registration offices more than one—so many of these offices as there are so many exemplars may there be and finally if whether for ulterior security against accidents or for allcomprehensive government purposes it were found desirable that for the whole territory of the state there should be one general office in which an aggregate of the documents received into the several local offices should be kept—here is an additional accommodation that might be afforded with a comparatively inconsiderable addition to the expense for the documents being thus distributed every syllable of each would thus be made secure—not only against deperition by accidents but against all possibility of falsification for suppose for example one of the parties dishonest and disposed to commit this crime what possibility of a successful issue could he contemplate in his own exemplar he makes the requisite alteration but what can it avail him when in case of the slightest degree of suspicion there lie in the custody of a public functionary as well as in that of each of the several parties so many exemplars to which for any such purpose as falsification all access on his part is perfectly hopeless for the application of the registration system to the case of dispositions made of property the appropriate course might be this adequatelyregistered estates all of them to the extent allowed by law secured against eventual as well as against actual alienation secured against it no estates not so registered a charge is an efficient cause of eventual alienation considered in respect of the subjectmatter it applies to a charge may be termed general or say generallyapplying or allcomprehensively applying when it applies to the whole of the property belonging to the charger as in the case of a judgment or a recognisance speciallyapplying when it is only to one particular parcel of his property are that expressly mentioned in it that it applies as in the case of a mortgage or a marriage settlement the misfortune is that be the registration and publication system ever so perfect no lender of a comparatively small sum—no person supplying goods or labour to a comparatively small value—can have in his mind at all times a sufficiently correct conception of the solvency of the landholder whom he serves the consequence is—that every estate nonalienable for debt is a ready source—and at the pleasure of the owner an instrument of fraud but so long as the fraud is protected and encouraged by law the impossibility of doing every thing that ought to be done affords not any reason why as much as can be done should not be done but on the contrary it affords a reason why as much as can be done should be done true it is that against loss in comparatively small masses—or against loss out of income—small as above will be the security thus afforded but against loss in large masses against loss out of capital against the too frequently happening total losses of capital—it would in a tolerable degree be effectual under matchless constitution it is true no regard for the bulk of the community can rationally be expected but for the class to which the rulers themselves belong more or less regard may be expected on the part of each and the greater the number to which to whatever classes belonging the benefit can be made to extend the more fully will the wishes of a wellwisher to all alike be accomplished my learned master i observe makes much and good use of french law but he seems not to be aware of the pattern of good management afforded by that law in this part of the field under matchless constitution interest being throughout the whole at daggers drawn with duty—in this case in particular the same individual being concerned in conveyances and in suits the right hand adds to its other occupations that of making business for the left thus under englishbred law not so under romebred law in particular in france there the class of notaries is a class altogether distinct from that of other lawyers in that country the other professional classes cannot indeed but be more or less deeply tinged with the vices inherent in the profession howsoever less deeply than here where in every part of it the whole chaos—substantive law procedure law and judicial establishment—has with such matchless skill and success been adapted to the purpose of unpunishable depredation but in the notary class on the contrary to such a degree of intimacy is brought in that instance the connexion between interest and duty—in the notary class may be seen an example of a degree of integrity scarcely to be matched in any other profitseeking occupation whatsoever accordingly in that above all others may be seen an object of universal confidence hands altogether pure from the waters of strife the notary adds to the trust of the conveyancer that of the banker but with this difference—that it is only during short intervals that the money remains in his hands those intervals to wit in which such custody is requisite for the purpose of the negotiation and that during those same intervals he keeps the money without lending it out of this state of things sprung just now an individual occurrence more forcibly probative than can commonly be afforded of the truth of a general allegation in france the notaries form a sort of body corporate in paris an individual of this profession went off tother day with the value of about two or three thousand pounds sterling destined for a purchase scarcely had any such act of delinquency been remembered a commotion like an electric shock went through the whole body on recovery they made up a common purse and replaced the loss in england ireland scotland for in scotland this institution of romebred law has not to any considerable extent if at all been adopted—in these countries diogenes with his lantern might trudge on till the last drop of his oil was spent ere he found the object of his search in france where they exist by thousands he would save his oil and the labour of laying a trap for his joke apropos of notaries i will take the liberty of suggesting to my learned master the adding to his frenchlaw library the standard book on the subject le parfait notaire c par a j massé   volumes  to paris      cinquième edition the precedents in it he would find of a very different complexion from those which have given him so much trouble much superior in aptitude to those in the scotch lawbook intituled the office of a notarypublic in my copy  th edition      notaries being on the carpet a word i must put in in favour of an humble class of late years brought into notice poor mans notaries they may be styled or poor notaries or pure notaries pure notaries in contradistinction to attorney notaries as pure surgeons as by some styled in contradistinction to apothecary surgeons but pure my notaries may be styled in an additional sense—in the moral sense pure from the sinister interest which the attorney notary and the barrister notary have in making with the instruments in question work for themselves in the field of litigation they are for the most part it is said country schoolmasters these the attorney notaries have as is natural been for some time labouring to put out of their way petitions for this purpose have for years been coming in alleged grounds—of course relative inaptitude of these intruders alleged consequences—immediate inaptitude in all imaginable forms on the part of their instruments ultimately increase of litigation on the part of their employers but if these same alleged were the real ultimate consequence—with no such petitions would honourable table he encumbered so says evidentia rei now as to evidence ab extrà that of the alleged inaptitude by due search the country over a body of evidence larger than could be wished might be found—the present state of the law is of itself sufficient to render but too probable evidence of the satisfactoriness of which to an appropriate committee under the guidance of learned gentlemen no great doubt need be entertained but as in other cases so in this—from positive inaptitude no conclusion can be drawn capable of affording a sufficient warrant for the desired practical result unless it be also comparative unfortunately for the unlearned clients of the unlearned advocate—on this ground likewise learned gentlemen are prepared to ride triumphant of lawlearnedness in this and the higher grade together tests over and over again established approved and incontestably and exclusively probative two—the financial and the convivial or say manducatory financial clerkship articles duty £  0 admission duty £   total on capital £    add on income £  tests preferred by mr chancellor of the exchequer presumably the financial by mr secretary peel declaredly the convivial by their humble servant the examinational be this as it may for clearing away every shadow of objection on the ground of want of intellectual aptitude—nothing is wanting but the proposed appropriate code with an appendix composed of the proposed authorized instruments adapted to the purpose by the brevity and intelligibility above exemplified this boon granted better qualified for the business would be the least learned country schoolmaster than under the reign of the present chaos the most learned of learned gentlemen can be in this comparatively halcyon state of things—in matters of small concern the instruments of sale and mortgage together with ordinary leases wills of personal property and the most ordinary species of contract such as apprenticeship articles hiringsc would remain to the humble class of notaries family settlements and wills of land to the elevated class even thus the business of the unlearned class would naturally be mostly confined within the field marked out by the ready prepared and authorized blank forms while for anything special recourse would be had by those who could afford it to the learned class as to examination—plans applicable to this as well as higher purposes will before the meeting of parliament be at every bodys command title of the work official aptitude maximized expense minimized before registration is done with one word as to the means of enforcement speaking of the instrument—in case of nonobservance of enactments utterly void says page     nor is this it is feared the only page observe now the effects in every case client sinned against lawyer the sinner client punished lawyer unpunished in the present case note the situation in which the client is placed under the name of a memorial an instrument containing matter under no fewer than eight specified heads is required to be drawn up in the form or to the effect of a certain article art  0      but with any alterations or additions which the nature of the case may require otherwise that is to say if by the draughtsman in respect of any one of these particulars anything is done which by an equity judge may be pronounced not to be to that same effect—every such deed it is said shall be utterly void now then as to the effects frequently in the shape of capital is the whole property of the purchaser of an estate embarked in the purchase not to speak of the cases where the purchase money being more than his all a part of it remains charged on the estate after the estate has passed into his hands think what with a trap of this sort set for him the hapless nonlawyer has to do to save himself from it at his peril he must turn lawyer do what by the supposition he is unable to do for if able no need would he have for the professional assistance but in this case an indemnity is provided for him return of his money indemnity oh yes source of it a few years of equity suit against the perhaps ruined man by whose indigence most commonly the sale was produced lawyer ruins client loses not a sixpence and perhaps gets for himself a new suit for everywhere so it is—as in procedure so in conveyancing making flaw in draught makes more business for draughtsman but reputation oh as to this small here is the risk known uncertainty of the law offers its ready cover to all learned sins thus while in the shape of pain of nullity punishment is in appearance employed in the prevention of the mischief reward is in reality employed in the augmentation of it punishment yes and what punishment punishment the evil of which rivalizes with those which are inflicted for the most mischievous crimes not unfrequently sooner than subject himself to any such forfeiture the defendant—simple debtor or criminal—has been known to embrace imprisonment for life then as to time thirty days fixed inexorably for all cases but who shall reckon up all the accidents by any of which without a particle of blame to the purchaser performance of what is required within that time may be prevented day reckoned from the date of the deed—a day hereby supposed to be in all cases one and the same for all parties but how often the act in question is of necessity the work of different days has been seen above one instance more page     transgression misapplication of any one of the three obscurified terms—trust use and confidence penalty here too expressed by the words utterly void applied to the assurances whatever they may be sin here in every case exclusively the lawyers client altogether incapable of ever committing it authors design in this case as in all others meritorious but mode of execution how unfortunate conveyances and contracts which it is the intention of the law should not take effect—yes to these it is true the effect indicated by the words void and nullity and their conjugates and quasiconjugates cannot but be attached but then these cases ought to be as without difficulty they might be made known to all clients known by being particularized in the code and every lawyer participating in the formation of such forbidden arrangements might and should be made punitionally and compensationally responsible as to our reformist—in extenuation with but too much truth may he plead on this occasion universal practice but the dereliction of it is one which he will see the necessity of adding to the list of his so highlyneeded innovations great indeed is the progress he has made in the shaking off the shackles of habit—result of interestbegotten and authoritybegotten prejudice one effort more however the present case demands at his hands but what reasonable expectation can you have it may be asked of seeing the force of law given to a means of security so galling to the feelings of those on whom the giving that force to it depends especially if there be any approach to truth in what is said of the proportionable number of those the nakedness of whose property would by such an instrument of exposure be uncovered answer in the very modesty alluded to as a certain cause of defeat i descry a source of success in nothing but the fear of such exposure could any man find any motive for opposition on the bringing in the bill it might without difficulty be sufficiently made known that the noes will all of them be carefully noted down and rendered universally notorious in the instance of each opponent that which would in this way be made universally known is—that by a difference the amount of which was matter of shame or uneasiness to him his actual property wanted more or less of being equal to his supposed property all that would remain concealed would be—the exact amount but to any man—to what purpose can such concealment be desirable two distinguishable ones alone have any application to the case obtaining money on a false pretence of solvency or obtaining respect on a false appearance of opulence cheating creditors alone or cheating them and everybody else now as to machinery in his haste to arrive at the essentials of his plan our reformist seems on this occasion to have taken up for his support without sufficient examination a broken reed of authority and the consequence is—a choice such as will be seen no objection however does this oversight make to the essentials forother machinery it will also be seen the case furnishes—machinery also in use—machinery simple well constructed and adequate sets of

is not a single judicatory that is in any tolerable degree fit for any other purpose than those for which under matchless constitution all judicatories with but here and there an exception have been invented—putting power into the hands and other peoples money into the pockets of the inventors a machinery adapted to his purposes—a judiciary establishment with a correspondent procedure code—each of them the first that every really had for its sole object the giving execution and effect with the minimum of daily vexation and expense to the enactments of the substantive branch of the law—is in progress and the judiciary establishment plan will be in the printers hands within a few weeks after the present pages are out of them before concluding i will take the liberty of suggesting for his consideration as briefly as possible a few supposed improvements of which his plan presents itself to me as susceptible to do whatsoever else may be in my power towards lightening his labour and promoting his generous designs would be a sincere pleasure to me if for the most part these same suggestions should be found to apply to every other part of the field of law as well as to the part on which his beneficent labours have been more particularly employed—they will not on that account be the less excusable distinguishable shapes which the matter of a proposed code may throughout the whole texture of it have occasion to assume five the enactive the expositive the ratiocinative the instructional the exemplificative of the exemplifications of them exhibited in this work of our learned author presently in english statute law sole shape exemplified—the enactive as to this same enactive shape with an exclusion put upon all the others—nothing with a view to rulers purposes could or can be more convenient expression of will this nothing more talent necessary none beyond what is manifested by every child as soon as it can speak not so any of the four other sorts of matter not to speak of russian italian and spanish translations—of the expositive and the ratiocinative the french work in which samples of them are exhibited has been before the public ever since   0  and another there has just been occasion to bring to view grades of functionaries to either or both of which the instructional portion of the matter may be virtually addressed—subordinates with a view to execution and effect future legislators for the better explanation of the designs with a view to fulfilment case to which the exemplificational more particularly applies that of an as yet only proposed code legal systems from which the matter two may be derived two the home and the aggregate of the most approved foreign ones the home system for the purpose of exhibiting in detail the disorder for which the code is the proposed remedy and examples of particular arrangements in themselves of a beneficial nature but in respect of which the system taken in the aggregate is chargeable—on account of the narrowness of the application made of them and throughout the remainder of the field the employment of flagrantlyunapt arrangements to the exclusion of them the foreign for the purpose of furnishing under this other head in support of what is proposed the instruction afforded by experience note that this same exemplificational matter must not be confounded with the matter composed of those examples which there may be found occasion to give as an inseparable part of the enactive though they may be considered as belonging also to the expositive next to the expositive matter purpose of it exclusion of the several imperfections which on every part of the field and on this in particular discourse is liable to labour under these are on the part of hearers and readers nonconception and misconception on the part of the discourse itself unintelligibility obscurity indeterminateness ambiguity against some of them howsoever well framed the instrument in other respects appropriate exposition will be an indispensable preventive remedy but to none of them without the aid of another remedy of the purely negative cast namely avoidance of lengthiness can it be a sufficient one as to lengthiness—it applies not only to the entire discourse but also and with different and still worse effect to its component parts called sentences and it is in this latter case that it is in a more particular degree productive of these several imperfections efficient causes of lengthiness in sentences—surplusage and involvedness of imperfection in both these shapes in conveyancing instruments examples have been seen above causes of imperfection in all these shapes more particularly in that of ambiguity—not only misselection and lengthiness as above but miscollocation likewise miscollocation whether applied to words or to phrases for the avoidance of it a set of rules will ere long be it is hoped at my learned masters service for the exemplification of imperfection in all manner of shapes in laws matter in rich harvest may be found in the english statute book the most conspicuous repository of every imperfection of which legislative language is susceptible towards remediation a disposition has of late been expressed by those on whom it depends but before that is done which the proper end in view requires to be done—before the form in which they are presented is the same with that in use in ordinary discourse with no other difference than what is necessary to the exclusion of the abovementioned imperfections—not inconsiderable is the quantity of matter which in the form of directive rules will require to be framed borne in mind and for that purpose consigned to black and white collocation—is it a light matter is it without effect on practice read this one line and judge parliament says the statute   ed iii c    shall be holden every year once and more often if need be miscollocation that proper collocation this parliament shall be holden every year once—and if need be more often not that there can be any adequate assurance that by this or any other form of words the wouldbe despot in whose face this bridle was afterwards held up would have held himself bound but if he had been—think of the effect that might have been produced in the destiny of england and through england of the habitable globe for general application take this rule imbedas above your limitative clause in that one of two principal clauses to which alone it is designed to be applied imbed it in that one instead of putting it at the end of the two in one of which it is not intended to be applied of expositionrequiring terms—groupes which it may be of use to distinguish these i terms of universal jurisprudence examples   obligation

propertylaw   feoffment   lien   trusts   uses   springing uses   executory devises   tenures   mortmain in regard to these—in a code on the new plan only in respect of the use made of them in such parts of the existing law as remains unabrogated—will exposition be the proper course from the enactive part of the new code these and all those words which nobody but a lawyer understands should be carefully excluded—those alone employed which with or without exposition therein given will be understood—not by lawyers alone but by everybody else iii terms belonging to the common stock of the language but to which by distortion lawyers have given an import intelligible to none but themselves examples   applied to the subjectmatter of property—real instead of the appropriate and romebred denomination immoveable   personal instead of moveable   applied to a conveyance voluntary instead of gratuitous   servitude instead of partial ownership rights with the correspondent obligations wanted for this idea a more expressive singleworded denomination servitude a word unknown to english law instead of a particular interest in a thing immoveable the idea it presents to a nonlawyer is—the condition of a person—a condition bordering upon slavery here i have to turn informer smuggled in by this reformist of ours has been this same word servitude introduced without notice from continental into our insular language iv terms belonging to the common stock of the language—but by reason of their ambiguity coupled with frequency of occurrence and importance with reference to practice—their import needing distinction and fixation—terms universally intelligible but by reason of their ambiguousness not the less needing to be thus fitted for use examples   land

words there are which notwithstanding the allcomprehensiveness of their extent and the need there will be of them in an allcomprehensive code need not any express definition their import being on each occasion rendered sufficiently determinate to this head belong divers names of genera generalissima besides the jurisprudential terms brought to view above examples of these terms   subjectmatters of

brought together and applied on the occasion of the employment given to them in the abovementioned constitutional code chap ix ministers collectively §   statistic function in the case of all those more especially influential terms—an accompaniment in no small degree beneficial might be—a list of synonyms synonyms to single words equivalents to short phrases not very numerous comparatively speaking are perhaps the pairs of words which on every possible occasion may be used interconvertibly each with as much propriety as the other but on each occasion where any difference has place the context will suffice for security against the endeavour on the part of litigants to produce on the ground of the attached synonym a wrong interpretation of the word employed in the text by a characteristic feature of the proposed system—the ratiocinative part—an additional and hitherto unexampled security will be afforded as to our learned reformists code—short as it is candidates in it for the honour of receiving exposition i have made out a list of not fewer than     belonging to one or other of the above divisions these however in no inconsiderable number apply not to this alone but to every other portion of the pannomion—the allcomprehensive code of the whole stock belonging to that aggregate the number of course cannot be small but the field they belong to is proportionably extensive the time for each of them to receive its exposition is the time when the subject it belongs to is for the first time brought upon the carpet problems for solution   how to distinguish terms needing from terms not needing exposition   how to distinguish terms needing to receive exposition from terms fit to be employed in giving it scarcely even for statement can room be found here for solution none purpose of the statement showing that they have not been and saying that they ought not to be neglected now as to the ratiocinative matter for arrangements and correspondent enactments in that part of the field of law to which the work in question more especially applies—standard of aptitude say the disappointment preventive or disappointment prevention principle—or more specifically the unexpectedlosspreventing principle—a branch this of the greatest happiness principle with a special denomination adapted to the matter belonging to this part of the field—prevent disappointment why answer from disappointment as everybody knows and feels springs a pain magnitude proportioned to the value set by the individual on the benefit that had been expected in this pain will be found the only reason why any subjectmatter of ownership should be given to the owner rather than to an usurper to an usurper by what denomination soever distinguished intruder diffusor embezzler thief robber and so on the only reason why to interests termed vested more regard should be paid than to interests not so denominated the only reason why for loss—on any occasion or from any source—indemnity should be provided from the nonpossession of the millions of watches existing in other pockets—you who read this do you suffer anything not you and why not because not expecting to possess any one of them—no pain of disappointment do you suffer from the nonpossession of it but if by any hand other than your own—a thiefs an unjust claimants or a judges it were taken from you—yes in any one of these cases a sufferer you would be—quantum of suffering in a ratio compounded of the marketable value of the watch with the indigency of your pecuniary circumstances to the purpose of replacing it and the relative sensibility of your frame here then is an intelligible standard and the only one behold now the effects produced by the hitherto universal want of it succedaneums in number infinite but not one of them expressive of anything besides the ungrounded sentiment or say mental sensation entertained on the occasion by him who speaks—a sentiment of approbation or disapprobation expressed under the expectation of finding or producing the like on the part of hearers but not suggestive of any ground whatever for the sentiment so entertained examples deduced from this work of our authors are the following—  natural justice p           equity       natural equity p       justice pp           natural feeling p  0    harsh law     cries feelingly for correction

so much as that given in romebred law in the quasihibernian style to the species of contract denominated the undenominated yet for it to have a name—and highly urgent is its need of one—somebody must stand godfather well then this is done as to the thing itself gratifying it is to me to see my learned master already recognising it and applying it witness two passages §     one claimant ought not to disappoint another p     the lords gain is far from commensurate to his tenants loss compare this with what by the courtesy of england is called reasoning in judgemade law the honest and excellent

his code distinguished from the rest of the work by being printed in italics of the ratiocinative instructional and exemplificational indistinguishably blended the rest of the work rest residue and remainder in the language of learned gentlemen at the head of each article a notice—affording by means of one or more of these five denominations intimation of the nature and design of the articles—is a document that has presented itself as having its use with the exception of the exemplificational which had not as yet occurred to me they accordingly exhibit themselves throughout the whole texture of the so often mentioned constitutional code unfortunately so to order matters as that under no one of the four first of the abovementioned five heads shall any matter be inserted that can be referable to any or others of them—has not been found practicable on the contrary all the changes of which the number of heads prefixt to the same article is susceptible will perhaps be found rung

to avoid it instead of being imbedded between the two ff the numeral may have a single f in a fine stroke drawn through it by these little arrangements simple as they are order might for the first time be substituted to the as yet universally existing chaos and to an inconveniently inadequate an adequate stock of denominations substituted part book chapter section article title scarcely beyond

the order in which they here follow these   part   title   chapter   section   no at this last stage his stock of denominations is exhausted the consequence is—that for the results of the division made of the aggregate to which he has given the name of no are employed the words firstly secondly thirdly fourthly fifthly all in a state of anarchy without any common head for keeping them in a state of society of all these denominations section from seco to cut is the only one completely characteristic reason for employing it—its having as above an appropriate sign belonging to it article followed by no there may be a convenience in employing—for the last whatsoever may be the number of the intervening divisional operations these being the two denominations most commonly so employed alike applicable to whatever languages are in use in any nation—this mode of designation might form part and parcel of an universal language in the abovementioned proposed constitutional code i regret to think it will not be found applied it had not occurred time enough two other little tasks at parting for our hercules i for the instruction of testators and their draughtsmen—a paper exhibiting a picture of the most commonlyexemplified diversifications which the state of a persons family connexions admits of with a view to the provisions desirable and likely to be desired to be made for them

much justice been rendered a name of reproach here if i mistake not he will feel the convenience of taking the disappointmentpreventing principle for his guide—and doing so will find in it an adequate

inserted if yes when sternes accusing angel goes up with the passage the recording angel shall have my consent for dropping his obliterating tear on it to preserve myself from the consciousness as well as the imputation of injustice—one last word more bringing to view supposed imperfections and deficiencies has all along been the chief occupation of this review—imperfections for correction deficiencies for supply of the mass of useful information for which we are indebted to our philanthropic reformist—of the ability as well as honest zeal displayed in the exposure of the peccant matter of which the existing system is almost exclusively composed—of the ingenuity manifested in so large a proportion of the remedies suggested—no mention has been made but in the most general terms but to have conveyed any thing like an adequate idea of the merits of the work would have required what in classical editors language is called a perpetual comment on it including a reprint of the greatest part of it as to myself never but for my learned master should i have obtained any tolerable insight into this chaos no probable further prolongation of my life would have sufficed for enabling me to look into it without the lantern with which he has furnished me—lucerna pedibus meis—to look into it—i mean for the only purpose—the remedial—for which i could have brought myself to look into it —hoping that such rare talent coupled with such still more rare virtue may not be lost to the world or wait long ere it be employed by those in whom alone is the power of giving effect to it—i conclude  manifold writing—  mode of execution in the manifold way the mode of writing is as follows— instead of a pen a style of the hardest and strongest metal without ink is employed under the style as under a pen are laid one under another in number the same as that of the exemplars required sheets of appropriate thin paper alternating with the correspondent number of thin sheets of silk into each of which has been worked all over some of the black matter used in printing and called printers ink in this way by one and the same course taken at one and the same time by the style may exemplars be produced in any number not exceeding twelve with not much more expense of time and labour than is commonly employed in the production of a single exemplar by pen and ink eight exemplars at once all of them perfectly legible have thus been habitually produced in london this mode of writing has for about twenty years been regularly applied to the purpose of conveying simultaneous information to a number of newspapers to other purposes it has also been employed under the eye of the author of this work for the performance of the operation the stronger the hand the better to perform in perfection requires some practice in addition to that which has been applied to the art of writing with pen and ink if there be a difference in the exemplars that which is furthest from the style not that which is the nearest gives the most perfect and clearest impression silk when a good deal worn answers much better than when new supposing this mode of writing employed to any considerable extent the silk would require to be smoothed by some appropriate means for example by being passed through rollers the thinner the silk the better that which has been mostly employed is that which in english is called sarsenet as to the paper that which is at present employed is called fine single crown tissue paper price   s  d per bundle containing two reams in strength by reason of its thinness it cannot be expected to be altogether equal to what is most commonly in use in england nor in whiteness nor thence in respect of beauty and legibility are all the exemplars by reason of the oil which is an indispensable ingredient they are nevertheless perfectly apt for these its intended purposes no more than half of the number wanted need be or ought to be taken on the oiled paper to wit every other one the paper of the others will remain in primitive whiteness except a slight extravasation of the oil of the ink round the edges of the letters the effect might even be produced by a single oiled paper to wit the one to which the style is immediately applied but in this case the labour necessary to produce the effect will be greater  counties in england wales

characters essentially and indispensably concerned—trustor trustee and intended benefitee distinguishable characters on every occasion these three though on some occasions two of them as if by mr matthews are played by the same person on some occasions trustor being at the same time intended benefitee or one of a number of intended benefitees so on other occasions trustee but be this as it may without an intended benefitee a trust can no more have existence than without a trustor or a trustee in the code art   p     mention is indeed made of the beneficial owner as a person for whom a nominee is supposed to be in trust but this same beneficial owner—no where is he mentioned as being like trustor one of the company and as often as and in proportion as a breach of trust has place the intended benefitee fails of being beneficial owner add to this that under a trust a benefit may be intended and received where there is nothing that it would be easy to fix upon as being owned

patronage stimulus indeed of those same subordinates of his be they who they may—even of these men how is it that to any exertions of theirs by these same fees any stimulus can possibly be applied for in their instance as well as in his—exertion or no exertion—exactly the same is the profit neither more nor less this same exertion—how is it to come what is there to call it forth one man puts his name to a paper and for so doing receives a fee for the motion thus given to his hand what are the exertions necessary—what the degrees of stimulatedness they are susceptible of another man takes the

fee to act as a stimulus—to produce exertions and those strenuous—and made to act and with effect with but too much effect—shall not be disputed purpose the producing occasions for the demand and gathering in of fees occasion every occasion on which a cause or a pretence for such demand can be manufactured yes to this stimulative power of fees—to the stimulative power of fees when thus applied—to this it is that the whole technical system of procedure—every part of it—that productive system of which his lordship has done so much towards augmenting the efficiency—to this it is that the people are indebted for that system of factitious expense and delay by which justice or what goes by the name of it is denied to the vast majority of them and at so exorbitant a price sold to all

    when he was plain henry brougham—plain barristeratlaw—how famed soever in the same two years have elapsed he is now lord high chancellor—he is now omnipotent—he is now invested with the power the magnitude of which cannot be more appositely or impressively displayed or testified than by the circumstance of its giving existence to a measure such as this in this it is that we have the only shadow of a use which his imagination—powerful and fruitful as it is—is able to frame for putting it to in idea and now what does he he has taken in hand the instrument—he has studied it—he has pronounced it a good one and fit for use yes—fit for this use and after all the only use which he can find hardihood enough to speak of with approbation—this use he does not put it to all the uses on which on this occasion he has passed condemnation—condemnation which though but implied is not the less manifest—and on other occasions as will be seen such vehement condemnation—all these uses he now not only approves but in numbers of instances altogether countless will be seen putting them to oh no not fees alone but salary eke also—salary so it be added not substituted to them he has no objection to  actual observation actual observation quere of what—of the moon or of the satellites of jupiter or of any of those conjunctions by which days are pronounced lucky or unlucky and fortunes

fee was to be understood to flow of this same stimulant what shall be the dose shall it be the same in every sort of bankruptcy case—shall it be the same in every individual bankruptcy case in equity an instance may be seen of a suit in which the value of the property in question did not exceed some such matter as £ 0 others in which it has not been less than some such matter as a million of pounds i speak thus loosely because on an occasion such as this trifling errors are not worth guarding against nor in bankruptcy matters is the case much different in all these cases is this fee call it the clenching fee or the quietus fee to be the same or different if different—the magnitude of it bearing a certain proportion to the value of the subjectmatter of the suit this same value—quere how to be ascertained what shall be that proportion here then would be to be made a scale of fees here would be to be made matter for a schedule thus then would learned gentlemen have matter for doubts—matter for great doubts matter for swarms of suits each of them pregnant with swarms of doubts suits out of any one of which with the assistance of a lord eldon a malâ fide suitor having for his object the ruin of a man marked out by him for his victim—destruction of his property with or without the acquisition of it—might be able to drag it on to five ten or fifteen years length at the expense more or less of as many thousand pounds no the question as to the disposition of those same men who being in the profession are among those of the highest rank and largest experience in the same—the question as to their agreement on this subject with his then barristership now lordship is a question out of which no such nor any other doubts can be generated nor in regard to these same

ought to be well physicked       the disease ought to be amply but not extravagantly physicked for what should we say of a medical practitioner whose prescription should run thus a genus of discourse there is which goes by the name of twaddle may not this be stated as being a species of it yes if you are a man of craft exquisite is the subserviency of this apparently silly matter to your purposes—to any of them that will not bear the light talking all along in vague generalities composed of words of indeterminate signification—no line drawn anywhere between the quantity that is and the quantity that is not eligible—talking thus let but your language run smoothly everybody as he thinks understands you—understands you in his own sense—in the sense most pleasing to himself—in the sense which accordingly renders him most pleased with you talk thus—and so far as depends on him your point is gained yes—everybody not merely those who having a sinister interest to serve are determined to be satisfied with whatever it is that you say—not only these but even the few who if they knew how and if it did not require too great a sacrifice nor give them too much trouble would rather do and be thought to do right than wrong and who are in the house either to oblige a friend or for a lounge instead of brookess almacks the athenæum the opera or a private party advice descriptive of this policy with recommendation to employ it—advice to this effect would make a most appropriate match with hamiltons parliamentary logic and if not already there should in the next edition be inserted in it so much as to persons at large now as to his noble and learned lordship well then—this same twaddle when he was thus talking it was it with him as with monsieur jourdan who had been talking prose all his life without knowing it o no perfectly well what he was about knew he exoteric and esoteric—what was that school was it not pythagorass in which men are all along taught how in and by the same set of words to deliver two different and even opposite doctrines—one of them designated by the one the other by the other of these two words—exoteric for the deception and satisfaction of the people without doors for that is the meaning of the word—profanum vulgus as horace calls them—the esoteric for the use purpose and information of people within doors—the choice few—the noble lords honourable gentlemen and select vestrymen of those days of the doctrine thus preached by their noble and learned professor the obvious sense was the twaddlic—the exoteric—sense but besides this had it not an esoteric sense o yes that it had a man who for a particular purpose puts on a character different from upon occasion even directly opposite to his own is no novelty in this wicked world of ours for the purpose of slaying tyrant tarquin did not one of the brutuses wrap himself up in the garb of insanity for a similar purpose did not hamlet wrap himself up in the like garb in former days monarchs for their amusement—were they not wont to have wits under the garb and name of fools look then at our noble and learned twaddlist—look at him a little closely—look at him in his robes—and ask yourself whether on this occasion you do not see him covering them with the garb of a simpleton and why in a character so opposite to his own oh only for the purpose of putting a little bit of deceit upon us simple folks—upon us the people without doors and why thus deceive us oh no harm to us all for our own good the purpose it may be seen divides itself into two parts part   engaging houses right honourable and honourable to concur in the giving in addition to salary the dear delightful fees here we have the esoteric doctrine—the doctrine for the reception of which they were and are by habit as well as disposition so well prepared part   engaging us whose place is without doors to bestow our acquiescence in this same so agreeable an arrangement o yes when you see the noble and learned preacher with the robes of judge bridoison over his own delivering this same twaddle doctrine call it if you please by that name but when you have done so mark well the ingenuity with which in the prosecution of this same purpose it is employed—employed in raising clouds—clouds of dust for the purpose of blinding such eyes as the purpose required to be blinded—those of the people who are standing and staring without doors and those of such of the noble lords if any such there be who are not in the secret and who were their eyes open might be shy of giving their concurrence behold him accordingly taking in hand the abovementioned three nothings and holding them up to view in the guise of so many somethings behold him taking them in hand and making them into a wedge—a wedge for insinuating the job and when once in driving it on into adoption so admirably well adapted to its purpose is this same wedge that it unites with it the properties of an arrow—an arrow with barbs to it—an arrow too firmly fixed to be ever drawn out especially out of bosoms—noble and honourable bosoms—so little disposed to part with it judges should be remunerated for their labour here we have the wedge in the place into which it has been introduced—simple insertion into the prepared fissure they ought to be well remunerated here we see it in the place made for it by the first stroke given to it their labours ought to be amply but not extravagantly paid for here we see it in the place made for it by the second stroke which some may think is rather a bold one look once more at this same principle with the propositions it consists of do but see what nice sweet innocent unobjectionable things they are judges should be remunerated for their labours well then—where is the labourer that ought not to be remunerated for his labour so much for the first of these his three commandments look now at the second and the second may we not see is like unto it—judges ought to be well remunerated see here too be he ever so perverse—be he perversity itself exists there that man that can be perverse enough so much as to wish to say or if he be with all his ingenuity ingenious enough to find anything to say against this put it to him to find if he can a thing which if done at all ought not to be well done so much for the second of these same propositions now for the third and last—judges ought to be amply but not extravagantly remunerated so here again be the men who they may especially men whose labour is so high and intellectual so as it be not extravagantly can there be any harm in its being amply remunerated so much for quantity now as to shape for receiving justification and thus completing the operation nothing now remains but shape not less triumphant will this justification be seen to be than that other—judges we have seen already ought to be well remunerated but if they are well remunerated how can their remuneration be otherwise than good and good how can it be unless it be so for all purposes it is required for well then in the present case of these same purposes there are two for one of them salary is required for the other fees now then these same judges learned as they are pure and disinterested as they are—still are they after all—still are they alas but men accordingly not an inch will they budge without the stimulus—without some little gentle touch of it well then as to the expense of this same necessary tickletoby is it for the public to be made to bear the whole burthen of it the individuals bearing no part of it—the individuals by whom is reaped the whole of the benefit of the high services the interest of the whole public is it to be made a complete sacrifice of to the interest of a handful of individuals forbid it justice let it not pass unobserved that that which under the name of a principle—one principle namely the fourth principle—the last in the train of principles we have been seeing is as the reader may have observed a sort of a principle with three heads to it a sort of a cerberus employed to guard from spoliation the soingeniouslydiscovered and abouttobesowellworked mine with its treasures composed of salary and fees be that as it may by hook or by crook everything is now settled now have we in the words of an old toast an old oxford toast all we wish and all we want and all our wanton wishes here have we completed this same delicious compound composed of salary with fees now may we write q e f for now is the problem solved solved and by what but by the twaddle before we have done with it view it in a still more enlarged point of view and mark well how admirably well suited to this its purpose is this same twaddle admire the stretchingleather it is composed of extendible or contractible as the occasion whatever it be may require constructed upon the most approved models you will see this implement to be have you an abuse to establish or defend you cast your eye on it of course to see whether this same implement is applicable to it to be applicable it must present to view a scale divisible into two parts which have no determinate bounds for example in physics the scale commencing at the most splendid light and terminating in utter darkness in morals and politics you have a correspondent scale commencing with perfect liberty and terminating at consummate licentiousness look at the example you will see in it the very sort of thing you want you take it in hand and proceed thus liberty you say is a good thing and ought always to be allowed no man can be more sensible of this than i am but licentiousness is a bad thing and ought always to be punished is there anywhere a liberty taken that you dont like to see taken you lay hold of it accordingly stamp upon it the word licentiousness and punish for it in thus doing who is there that can prove you have been doing wrong—who is there that can prove that what you have thus been punishing for is not licentiousness—is nothing but liberty to make this proof he must show the bounds by which the licentiousness and the liberty are divided he must exhibit that which has no existence viewed upon this more enlarged scale liberty it will be seen should be amply but not extravagantly allowed licentiousness amply but not extravagantly punished thus will it be with judges so long as they are taken from the order of advocates—the indiscriminate defenders of right and wrong on the outside you see the robe of the judge but underneath it and for a lining remains still the silk gown of the advocate look at it through the glass here presented to you the judges robe will be gauze the gown scarlet satin underneath it little boys in their cricket have every now and then a functionary whose style and title is jackonbothsides not on both sides at once that being impossible but on both sides successively and alternately so it is with a barrister on one and the same point if not in one and the same suit he will be for plaintiff at one time for defendant at another whichever he is for that one will be everything that is good the adversary everything that is bad when understandings are to be confounded and made dizzy a party man writer or speaker may be on one side and the other not only on the same occasion but as we have been seeing at the same time talking backwards and forwards in the same breath not less easily may he be of the one party and the other at different times as to chancellors true it is that they have not often if ever been seen thus vibrating or even migrating but whence is this is it that they would not accept no but that they were never chosen but for this today his lordship would be for earl grey because he loves liberty tomorrow for the duke of wellington because he hates licentiousness would not this be the case reader look at what goes before this—look at what follows after it—and then judge meaning to hold up to view an accommodating standard lord bacon typifies it somewhere by the name of the regula lesbia when lying on the shelf it is strait as rules should be taken in hand and employed the right line if wanted so to do bends and is transformed into any sort of curve put together liberty and licentiousness make a regula lesbia so likewise amply not extravagantly as to how this sort of implement came to be made at lesbos let any one who feels so disposed go and inquire i have not time think not that your attention—think not that all the attention you can bestow upon this subject—can be illbestowed for this even this is the language in which all the depredation that has brought on the reform measure has its support aptitude says this doctrine is as opulence be the situation what it will a mans aptitude for it will be exactly as the quantity of money you cram his pocket with do but as his learned lordship bids you—make but his remuneration ample enough—and as it is written all other things needful shall be added unto you yes when the new parliament meets then by its order as by a former parliament in a case within my memory was done by a booka should this same maxim—aptitude is as opulence—be burnt by the hands of the common hangman which by the bye is the only employment i would give him one of these days may perhaps be seen in honourable house written up in letters of gold—aptitude is inversely as opulence—one of these days when the inventor and demonstrator of it is no longer in existence to behold itb to the operation of cramming fuller and fuller the pockets of functionaries on pretence of securing aptitude what shall be substituted the answer has been already given—competition that is to say on the part of all candidates in whose instance appropriate aptitude in all its branches has been made manifest by the test of examination as above spoken of under the head of proposed amendments so much for the principles of the noble and learned lord have you a curiosity to see a set of a different sort turn then to some of those books which have for their author a person who when by whig nurses radical principles were to be overlaid at their birth and honourable noses were to be turned up against them was spoken of as being a man who knew more of books than of men turn to those books and there you may see for example the two aboveexemplified principles—the greatesthappiness principle—the nondisappointment or say the disappointmentminimizing principle is your curiosity strong enough to carry you any further go then to the principle which prescribes the conjunction of interest with duty—say the interestanddutyconjoining principlea thence on to the principle by which official aptitude is asserted to be augmented not in proportion as official emolument is augmented but in proportion as it is reduced—these with any number of others you please from the same mint but by any one of these were his lordship to take it in hand for for the purpose of argument even the impossible may be supposed existing by any one of them were his lordship to take it in hand and make application of it from the woolsack—such a scene of nausea might be produced by it—such a scene as delicacy forbids the mention of in order to its answering its purpose in what state should a principle be answer it should be in the highest state of condensation comprised in the compass of two or three words consisting for example of a substantive with its attached adjective or as some say attributive though the adjective may be a substantive used adjectively and either the one or the other or both may be composed of words two or even any greater number so as there be not a verb the words strung together in the manner of the name given to a parliamentary bill in the votes and the name given to anything in the german language now then say here for examples greatest happiness principle—nondisappointment principle in this way the principle with its two or three words exhibits the substance and performs the office of a rule—of a rule which if expressed at length would occupy perhaps more than as many lines now then why employ the matter in this form rather than in that of a rule answer because when thus reduced in bulk it is in every instance capable of being made to enter and accordingly always does enter into the composition of a sentence whereas a rule and in particular the rule of which the principle is a sort of abridgment can seldom find expression in a number of words small enough to admit of its performing this office in the instance here in question not very exceptionable it is true on account of its length how much soever on other accounts is the form of words by which expression might have been given to a rule suited to the purpose of conveying the advice which it was his lordships purpose to give and see taken and this advice was of the number of those which on no occasion find established in noble breasts any more than in honourable ones any violent aversion to them—any very obdurate reluctance either to the receiving or to the acting upon them—make the remuneration of all offices as large as the people will endure to see it made in these words may be seen the rule—that noble and honourable younger sons and eldest sons during the lives of their respective noble fathers not to speak of said fathers themselves may be provided for as nobly as possible here may be seen the reason of the rule now for the conclusion of this same principle—what i say in point of principle is that generally speaking their remuneration ought to be by salary and not by fees and not by fees—see here profession—for performance see his lordships schedule the second with its eleven sources out of which fees are made to spring all this talking backwards and forwards we have had and here we have the result of it and thus we have before us and in senses more than one his said lordships principles if in the exposition above given of these same sostyled principles any errors should be found the cause of them may perhaps be—it may at any rate be thought to be—in the authors being in that case in which in days of yore he was by the noble lord looked upon as being—namely that of one knowing more of books than of men assuredly whatsoever in this particular may be the case with other men to myself it has not happened for so many days in the year as it has to his lordship to be in the midst of and have for the object of knowledge the noble brotherhood of those high and mighty lords who on every occasion as they never cease to bear witness have for the sole objects of their care church king and people church first then king then people with only now and then a small scrap of care for their respective families and even this never otherwise than in due subordination to that care paramount which has for its objects the said church king and people too noble each one of them to take any thought for himself had he not his noble friends for flappers their motives accordingly on each occasion diamonds—diamonds of the very first water—water of the purest kind scorning the use of filteringstones their breasts having for composition and covering instead of flesh and blood plate glass having that is to say either having already or at least as was the case with a certain noble lord in former days when he with all the rest of the talents were in power wishing that they had let me not here be accused of exaggeration in all this no more is there of exaggeration than had place in the language of the noble and learned lord when anno      on the  th of february in his character of law reformist he came forward with that glorious undertaking of his by which all exaggeration expressly denied perfection was virtually promised to the judiciary establishment with its system of procedure—all by so simple an operation as that of taking in hand any twelve men so they were but called good and true putting them into a boxa and thus as in an omnibus travelling them over the whole field of judicial procedure to return to purity in this same state of purity his lordship will not deny them to be—noble lords—noble and most noble right reverend and above all most reverend—all of them together no assuredly for in it lest it should escape the memories of this manner of men never is he tired of reminding them that they are as to those judges who will have to bow down to him and hail him as their creator—those to wit whom we shall see him alluding to under the name of higher judges—they are not it appears regarded by him as being in that state of absolute purity after the manner of pure gold rendered so by having passed through the refiners fires some little alloy of a less noble metal we shall find his discernment recognising in them encompassed as they are with temptation they may be conceived at least if not absolutely believed to be capable of yielding to it for their being brought into that same desirable state there needs however but one simple and obvious recipe which is their being placed in that same exalted and purifying situation of theirs in which all men and all things are pure to these judges the said creator of course considers himself as aggregating his said creatures—his chief and other judges and by that same simple operation enduing them with the requisite portion of purity in which glorious state we shall for the moment leave them thus much for the entire foundation of the noble and learned lords magnificent edifice the foundation composed as it is of principles four in number of which principles the third when it comes to be laid down is styled not a principle but a proposition and the fourth which is styled a principle is not a principle but a composition composed of three propositions—namely the three propositions which the reader has been seeing and with which in a degree best known to himself he cannot fail to have been edified a droit le roy author a man whose name began with a b wasnt it broderick an attorney member of lincolns inn in ireland he was hanged for murder object of droit le roy—and that object very decently accomplished—showing that all the doctrines which the most determined ultra tories could preach and wish to act upon had for their support and were fully borne out by those delivered from time to time by learned judges from the time whereof memory runneth not to the contrary down to the time then present or not far distant whether bespoken or no the dose was deemed too strong to go down even in the estimate of george the third

motion for a law reform commission p    temptation behold here—and not here only but in page     also—the noble and learned eyes wide open to the temptation and at the same time the noble and learned mouth saying its prayers to the lords and beseeching them to deliver him from that same evil into which at that same moment he was doing what depended upon him—he was putting his rhetorical powers to the stretch—for the purpose of leading and plunging over head and ears himself and the whole train of the creatures he was occupying himself in the creation of witness schedule the first of the bill in question in the last edition of it witness the act into which in due course it was predestinated to be transfigured with its schedule the second and the several fees contained in it † unspotted and

impunity for every profitable and every agreeable malpractice  ought not yes of opinion that they ought not and this at the close of a string of arguments for which the noble and learned brains have been put to rack for the purpose of making us believe that that which in consideration of the danger ought not to be done may under and in spite of that same danger be nevertheless done and which he accordingly proceeds to do  suspicion whereupon having strained every nerve and squeezed out what is above for the purpose of satisfying us that fees may be allowed without the production of preponderant evil he says they ought not to be allowed and thereupon proceeds to allow them to the judges of whose benefices he is patron and whose profits are accordingly his profits and for whom for the multiplication of those profits he provides the occasions twelve in number which form the matter of the second of the two schedules † higher judges higher judges indeed—as if in those same higher judges the appetite for fees were less rabid than in the criers of their respective courts as if the existing system with all its atrocities by which the cry for law reform has been called forth has

of his air balloons and in its way to the moon touching at the planet utopia and in the person of one of the judges of that region thus sketching out the portrait of a westminsterhall judge now then—these vagaries were they mere flights of poetry in prose flights taken for mere selfamusement or a forgetmenot no notice would on this occasion have been taken of them had they been the production of a westminster schoolboy a silver groat would have been given as an appropriate reward for them but no all this is acted upon—acted upon as if it were literally correct and true and accordingly the means of selfpayment ad libitum—the means of gorging themselves with the plunder of the afflicted—secured in so far as words from this quarter can go secured in and to the hands of these same judges men the most distinguished for their success in the indiscriminate defence of right and wrong by the indiscriminate utterance of truth and falsehood—men the most distinguished for their success in the most mischievously and shamelessly mercenary of all professions presumed thus to be above all others most disinterested and cui bono for what all this laudation for what but for valuable consideration by successful laudation of a prosecuted murderer or swindler nothing more was to be got than the fee—the five guineas once paid whereas from the laudation thus bestowed upon every man on whom a judgeship shall have been bestowed that profit was in contemplation which has accordingly come into possession—namely the profit composed of the difference between a bounded mass of emolument in the shape of salary and an unbounded ditto in the shape of fees oh the ingenuity—the exquisite ingenuity of this contrivance a time there had been when the purpose being thought to require it condemnation was passed by him on that pestilence and reasons on that side being in existence—reasons and those unanswerable ones—those same reasons or some of them were accordingly adduced now the plague being now to be inoculated what was there that for this purpose after what had been done could be done what was there that the nature of the case furnished and admitted of to answer this question and do what it was possible to do towards undoing his former untoward doings—behold him taking in hand this same infection—and to put it in good odour infusing into it the only semblance—faint as it is—the only semblance of a reason that the nature of things allowed the power of ingenuity to find for it this is a use which it would be capable of being put to—but in what case in a case which can never happen having thus taken the benefit of the only chance of success which he saw the nature of things furnishing then it is that he turns round—takes in hand this bit of a reason such as it is and employs it in the propagation of the profitable pestilence and thus repairing the antecedently false steps  improvement o yes a capital improvement dependent—independent—capital delightful tools to work with—to work well with—this same pair—this loving pair—not the less loving by being opposites yes here we have again our old acquaintance—aptitude is as opulence on the former occasion it was the intellectual branch that was to be provided for provided for but in joint tenantcy with the two other branches—the moral and the active the provision now made has the moral branch all to itself aptitude is as independence—this is the maxim now and can independence be too complete no surely there we have the maxim now behold the application be the man who he may either he is already rich or he is not if yes in that case be he ever so rich he cannot be made too independent if he is not rich already—in that case the reason is the same but the need is more urgent and the quantity needed is the greater the further he is from being rich already everything cannot be done at once stinginess—just now stinginess is the order of the day stinginess being so much in fashion his lordship feels it prudent to content himself with his fifteen hundreds ayear his two thousands ayear and no more than one three thousand ayear and so for some time things must perhaps continue wait awhile and there sits sir robert peel who has a book a leaf out of which his lordship has at command and may borrow with advantage sir robert is a great admirer of lord bacon he is brimful of the noble philosopher and chancellor he has him at his fingers ends the great departed statesman is prayed in aid as we lawyers say by the great living one when any of his great things are to be done fiat experimentum was the characteristic motto on the strength of which the fame of bacon has soared to a height so much above that of all other men fiat experimentum was the motto of lord bacon fiat experimentum is the motto of sir robert he is for doing all good things gradually he is for consolidation to the exclusion of codification he is for going on giving to every man the possibility of knowing what he is to be punished for not knowing going on—but at such a pace that after some hundred years employed in doing it the business would be still to do and at this rate of travelling his lordship may at any time without prejudice to his own plans be in full accordance now then for one of sir roberts practical comments on lord bacon behold it in the stipendiary magistrates salaryraising act at the first institution in      it was £ 00 ayear in the eyes of the magistrates themselves this £ 00 ayear was sufficient plain proof—if not they would not have accepted it to them it was satisfactory patrick colquhoun whose activity was greater than that of all the others put together and who in all other respects was fully equal to the best of them—patrick colquhoun who was known to everybody and the only one of them who was known to anybody—said as much to the author of these pages but though in the eyes of the incumbents there was enough of it not so was there in those of the noble or right honourable patron whoever he was and so it was made half as much again it was made £ 00 ayear well what followed when they had got it—this same £ 00 ayear—still they were not everything that could he wished thereupon came sir robert and gave them a couple of hundreds ayear more the £ 00 he made £ 00 now then what was to be done with this £ 00 as to future men there was no difficulty but then there were the then present ones what to do in regard to them what oh they were entitled to it on a double account so indifferently had they behaved themselves that for this reason it had been found necessary to give them the £ 00 ayear more to make them behave better at the same time so well had they behaved themselves that gratitude joined with equality and consistency in requiring that these known and tried men by whom such merit had been displayed should not be left unrewarded when the resolution was taken that men unknown and untried should be thus advanced still this was but a sort of degeneration for at the first augmentation they got half as much again as they had before and at this second they got no more than one third as much but sir robert was fainthearted his lordship is made of better metal and he will act accordingly let but occasion call and casting off all disguise he will stand up and say speaking of his batch of judges with their followers—yes the worse they behave the more they shall have the only man he can be afraid of is—sir robert peel and on this ground sir robert will feel his mouth stopt stopt by a precedent of his own making stopt—or as we lawyers say estopped—prevented by an estoppel in regard to objects one man has one sort of object another man another sort of object then in regard to experiments—experiments in pursuit of the object—one man is for one sort of experiment another man for another sort my object is a double one to secure official aptitude and to save money for securing the aptitude i have the securities hereinabove referred to and hereinafter exhibited for saving the money and at the same time and by the same operation providing those same securities i employ an already approved instrument—yes the very instrument which in all other cases everybody is for employing and employs accordingly good but this instrument—whats the name of it—the name of it why competition now for an exhibition—scene right honourable house at the sound of the word competition out pours a deafening scream in grand chorus—competition o horrid horrible and horridest horror the cry subsided and the faculty of speech and something in the guise of argumentation retained comes thereupon something to this effect—competition yes good in every other case good as applied to furnishers of goods of all sorts good as applied to furnishers of personal services of all sorts—yes good in those cases but in this case what can be more absurd absurd what are not official services personal services yes but these must be excepted excepted and for what reason for what reason o dont talk of reason no—not on this occasion occasions there are on which there is nothing for reason to do matters there are which reason has nothing to do with nor they with reason matters if applied to which reason is out of place yes that there are and this is one of them so much for right honourable house and to save trouble the same scene may serve for honourable house mark with what refinement and astutia it is worded—this socalled improvement of his lordships is it that there shall be no fees oh no only that how much soever there is of them the learned persons are not to be left dependent on them accordingly in the first place there are to be fees at any rate this for the sake of the stimulus and as to what fees see section the second as above but whatever may turn out to be the amount of those fees what a sad thing would it not be if men were left dependent on them—and so uncertain is that amount would not this be the case if something certain were not added thereupon comes the necessity of a salary which as independence cannot be too complete cannot so you have seen already be too ample  done away with a delicate matter this—a truly delicate matter and each time what is it that has been done answer just what was intended to be done anno      was made one report and what was done that which had been intended anno      another and what was done that which had been intended anno      was made this speech this speech made and in pursuance of it a bill brought in and that bill passed into an act and now what was intended to be done answer that which has been done accordingly here is a malady—a most excruciating malady compare the operators and note their several performances the former operators confirmed it but they did not exasperate it this last operator has confirmed it and he has exasperated it immediately in his schedules will this be seen by readers and in process of time as the act comes into operation felt by suitors fee as salaries no—et sic vide diversitatem as lord coke says take them not as salaries no take them as something else take them as anything else for example as constituting a stimulus and by the first opportunity let men behold how good and joyful it is—call it a fair stimulus capital indeed is this distinction—choice the discernment exemplified in the making of it behold the stress laid upon it figure to yourself learned lords and learned gentlemen one after another mounted upon it a cockhorse and riding off upon it excellent principles yes excellent principles doubtless but what were they says a reader what were they answer i this is more than i know and i will spare to myself the labour of looking out for them and commenting on them and to you the labour of reading them what he has now before him may surely and without injustice be taken for a fair sample of them and the result of them—what is it it is this be the fee what it may—if it ought not to be continued it ought not to be continued if it ought to be cut off it ought to be cut off but even after taking the benefit of this reservation—of this distinction in virtue of which they might be taken in so far as they were not taken as salaries—not taken quâ salaries—even they—all of them—all the ingredients in this sweet paste—are they to be done away with oh no that would be carrying things too far some of them yes but only some of them thus far anno      but anno      with the benefit of a course of consideration carried on during the interval of eightandtwentyyears learned lords and gentlemen had stretched their legs in such sort as to have got a step farther the recommendation as we see then was—that fees as salaries should in most cases be done away with what not in all cases not without the benefit of this distinction oh no what and not even with the benefit of this distinction no not even in this case that would still be going too far only in some cases whereupon in all the other cases in every one of which the same sort of mischief is produced they remain established beholdthe problem solved quod erat facicudum est factum and x  y are found to be  0 hang half and save half says a familiar adage this adage learned lords and gentlemen have taken in hand made it into a maxim and improved upon it say hang half and save the whole—saying this you have it in its improved state look at the fees called copyfees on them may be seen a mark set they are marked out to serve as a scapegoat to be sacrificed to be sacrificed and why that the rest may remain unsacrificed and be saved but this scapegoat was he thereupon sacrificed has he since been sacrificed quære ceo is he intended to be sacrificed wait and see directions to public servants such as legislators and reporting chairmen of committees taken from dean swifts directions to servants—when you have anything to report upon what honest men wish to see done away with and you do not like to part with recommend that it shall be done away with but take care that the quantity so recommended to be done away with shall be an indeterminate quantity some for example or in case of pressure you may even say most in the tout ensemble of this recommendation people will see your good disposition your good intention in the qualifying adjunct some or most they will see your caution—your prudence seeing all this how can they be so unreasonable these same people as not to be satisfied well then if they are satisfied then everything is as it should be and there the matter rests and what if they had been intended to be abolished what if they had been abolished accordingly—that is to say in so far as it was and is in the power of parliament to abolish them what then ask lord tenterden the table of these fees hung up or not hung up—hung up and in the sight of everybody—the fee in question being of the number—will it be thus kept from being exacted oh no not it indeed it will not the less continue to be exacted at any rate if it be under and in virtue of a situation the patronage of which belongs to his lordship well but suppose a table of fees established—a table stating the several occasions on which fees may be taken and the fees that may be taken on those several occasions and on this or that occasion a fee taken to an amount greater than that which is so allowed—suppose this done and the extortion brought before his lordship will not the extorter as such be punished for it oh no what then why restitution will perhaps be ordered suppose for example six shillings the amount of the fee allowed and tenandsixpence the money taken you have but to make application to the court and so it be not in the way of a criminal prosecution but in a quiet civil way it will cost you not more than some number of times as many pounds as the shillings you sue for and restitution of the whole tenandsixpence or of the fourandsixpence difference will or will not be ordereda and so toties quoties as often as you please there you see the power of parliament—there you see the effect of it when applied with the purpose entertained or pretended of preventing extortion by or in any way direct or indirect to the profit of learned judges  a fixed maximum each fee a sum determinate and unincreasable yes if indeed that be the meaning so far so good but of those same unincreasable sums suppose the number left increasable ad infinitum—increasable at the pleasure of those whose profit rises in proportion to the aggregate amount of them increasable by means to the existence of which the noble and learned eyes were open in the manner and to the degree that we have seen and these sums accordingly by those same noble and learned hands put into the preeminently learned though not ennobled pockets between which and the noble one there is a communication suppose this and you will see in what way it is that upon his lordships plan all temptation to multiply forms and create delay and expense to the suitors is to be removed moreover here again comes the stimulus for whether by or notwithstanding such removal enough their lordships are assured will be left as a fair stimulus to the speedy dispatch of business for refreshment preparatorily to this part of the speech instead of an orange presents himself here to my imagination his lordship taking out of the learned pocket a bottle and out of the bottle a good swig of lethe water to enable him to forget that in the case of an office sweetened with emolument as the office has so has the patronage of it a determinate value and that this value rises and that in a determinate proportion with the value of the office fixed or unfixed—in one or other of these two cases must be the amount of this same maximum of this same muriate of gold if fixed off flies the stimulus if unfixed then flows in the temptation—that temptation which by men in the situation in question always has been yielded to—that temptation which so long as man is man will continue to be yielded to—that temptation which seeing all this and seeing it so absolutely irremoveable his lordship is so determined to remove  a fixed maximum each fee a sum determinate and unincreasable yes if indeed that be the meaning so far so good but of those same unincreasable sums suppose the number left increasable ad infinitum—increasable at the pleasure of those whose profit rises in proportion to the aggregate amount of them increasable by means to the existence of which the noble and learned eyes were open in the manner and to the degree that we have seen and these sums accordingly by those same noble and learned hands put into the preeminently learned though not ennobled pockets between which and the noble one there is a communication suppose this and you will see in what way it is that upon his lordships plan all temptation to multiply forms and create delay and expense to the suitors is to be removed moreover here again comes the stimulus for whether by or notwithstanding such removal enough their lordships are assured will be left as a fair stimulus to the speedy dispatch of business for refreshment preparatorily to this part of the speech instead of an orange presents himself here to my imagination his lordship taking out of the learned pocket a bottle and out of the bottle a good swig of lethe water to enable him to forget that in the case of an office sweetened with emolument as the office has so has the patronage of it a determinate value and that this value rises and that in a determinate proportion with the value of the office fixed or unfixed—in one or other of these two cases must be the amount of this same maximum of this same muriate of gold if fixed off flies the stimulus if unfixed then flows in the temptation—that temptation which by men in the situation in question always has been yielded to—that temptation which so long as man is man will continue to be yielded to—that temptation which seeing all this and seeing it so absolutely irremoveable his lordship is so determined to remove † temptation yes here we have temptation again already we have seen him stating what the temptation is—showing demonstrating and by uncontrovertible reasons that it is one which no judge nor any officer in an office subordinate to that of judge ought to be exposed to and thereupon eyes wide open to the irresistibleness of it and the mischievousness of it comes the determination to expose them to it—to expose them to it all of them judges and their subordinates together which said determination we have seen accordingly in his bill now passed into an act carried into practice yea verily—here have we this same temptation again in this same speech taken into consideration a second time—laid before their lordships and the public a second time and the consequences of it a second time full in view the determination a second time formed—the determination to expose his judges to it—his judges and their subordinates—and thus to bring upon the whole country the evils so fully in his view—the evils of factitious expense delay and vexation with their accompaniments denial and sale of justice—sale of it to the comparatively few—denial of it to all besides that is to say to the vast majority of the thus oppressed and plundered people but for all this evil a compensation—a per contra—is now and in the same breath spoken of as provided and by this same per contra we are to understand the evil to be overbalanced and this same per contra—what is it it is neither more nor less than a stimulus namely the old stimulus which we have seen already and which for the present purpose is on the present occasion again brought forward—and in that its former character reexhibited  fair stimulus yes sure enough here we have another old acquaintance—a very old acquaintance it has now however received a considerable improvement in the former instance on the former occasion it was a little one that was the best and the most that could then be ventured to be said of it the time being it seems to have been thought come the epithet fair is applied to it and with this polish put upon it it is presented to us for acceptance and such it seems is its virtue and so ample the service it always has rendered and never will fail to render to justice that the good effects of it are regarded as overbalancing as just mentioned all the evil ones apprehended from the temptation in conjunction with which it is now mentioned the case as we have seen is—that for the measure in question—namely the establishment of the mode of remuneration thus as we have seen exposed by his lordship—for this measure composed of the real evil and the imaginary good by which that same evil is supposed to be overbalanced he has now you see if you will believe him found a bottom by this bottom it must be presumed what is meant is a justification the justification being thus pleaded it would be injustice not to exhibit it here accordingly it may have been seen exhibited and of the breadth of this bottom if such it be we have as above been taking measure good heavens says somebody what a pother is all this—all about a word—a single word true a single word but once more think of what importance it is—this same word before you you see a man to whom in eloquence and deceptive language scarcely does the whole country contain any known rival—this man you see calling forth his matchless powers—whatsoever of them he can muster—and employing them in support of this inexhaustible source of human misery—the practice of denying and selling justice—selling it to the tens of thousands denying it to the millions and thus devoting the millions to wrong without remedy and in this one word is contained the whole of what the vast arsenal of his resources can furnish for the defence or so much as the palliation of the enormity this considered a few lines or even pages can they be grudged or justly taxed with superfluity † gratuities confounded in a manner with fees are these same gratuities—we see how after speaking of fees he immediately after without having noticed any distinction says these gratuities things in themselves so different how came they here to be thus confounded foul as is the abuse of fees so extorted as has been seen—still fouler is the abomination to which the name of gratuities has been attached in the case of a fee the quantum is fixed in the case of a gratuity it is unlimited predeterminate limit it has none limit it has none but that which is determined in each individual instance determined and by what by the need which the suitor has of the services of the functionary that is to say by the evil which it may happen to him to be afflicted with if at the time in question those same services fail of being performed by the amount of this evil coupled with the tempers of the two parties—namely on the one part the degree of hardihood on the other part the degree of timidity from one and the same solicitor a bold functionary will exact any number of times the amount that a timid functionary would from a timid solicitor one and the same functionary will exact any number of times the amount of what he could from a resolute one the solicitor i say rather than the suitor the case being—that throughout the whole field of regular procedure matters are in such sort arranged that for the suitor to see to his own business—to look after and take care of and make provision for his own interest—is impossible the hands in which the care of it is lodged being those of a set of other men in confederated swarms of each individual of which the interest is on each occasion in relation to that of the boná fide suitor in a state of diametrical and constant opposition ‡ admit somewhat wide admissions these however if given no otherwise than hypothetically and for the purpose of the argument—not categorically and absolutely—let them pass let them not however pass unheeded—these grievances thus lightly dealt with look at them a little more attentively   grievance the first—taxes on justice or say law taxes in the shape of stampduties for receiving on their shoulders a portion whatever it be of the burthen laid on the people for the aggregate of the expenses of government—selection made of the individuals already suffering under a particular affliction in preference to those who are not suffering under any such affliction the amount of this burthen varying in unknown quantities upon a scale of such length that in an unascertainable proportion the victims even sink under it and are completely crushed would you be consistent to these same objects of your oppression add then the lame the blind the maimed—and those afflicted with the rheumatism the gout and the stone and for further consistency if these be not enough the orphan the widower and the widow for and during the first year of mourning all this for the purpose of keeping off the burthen from the members of the community at large on whom when distributed among them it would lie but as an impalpable powder the pressure of which would be altogether imperceptiblea   grievance the second—an abuse—taxes on justice in the shape of law fees persons selected for the being subjected to the burthen the same the produce carried to the particular account of the expense employed in the remuneration of judicial functionaries some rendering more or less service some rendering none distinguished from and above the before mentioned is this second tax by its capacity of being augmented—we have seen how—augmented to the utmost—by those whose interest it is so to augment it and who accordingly to the power add constantly and on each occasion the inclination the determination and the endeavour so to do to the burthen imposed as above by the legislature in the shape of stamp duties augmentation cannot be made by any other hands than those of the legislature to the burthen imposed as above by judges for their own benefit augmentation can be made—made to an unlimited amount and accordingly has been made—by the hands of those same judges and of course unless and until the power of so doing is taken out of those same learned hands by the legislature will continue to be made not uninstructive is the mutual relation and difference between the two grievances nor should we here forget a vulgar error—an error which has been laid hold of and converted into a fallacy by those who profit by it according to them taxes upon justice not that this is the denomination employed by them—taxes upon justice operate say they as all taxes do in the way of prohibition and thence in that of prevention litigation is a bad thing they operate and in proportion to their amount as preventives to it they are as bridles in the mouths of the litigious so says error what says truth that these bridles supposed to be put into their mouths are arms put into their hands that is to say if and in so far as under the appellative of litigious you include him who in the burthen beholds a means of obtaining for himself an undue benefit by giving effect to an unjust demand or by depriving of effect a just one not that they are not bridles too true bridles they are—but on whom on whom but the poor man who by the rich man has been fixed upon as his victim on him they are not merely bridles retarding his motions they are ropes by which his hands are tied behind him his feet tied together and all possibility of defending himself wrenched from him taxes upon justice—checks upon litigation such being the doctrine—read mark and learn who the doctors are by whom it is propagated they are the dishonest nonlawyer and his everready accomplice the feefed lawyer the nonlawyer who beholds in them and finds in them an instrument applicable and with certainty of effect to the purpose of cheating his creditors or on pretence of debt wrenching property out of the hands of men who are not his debtors—the lawyer to whom every nonlawyer is what a sheep is to a wolf and every brotherlawyer what a wolf is to a wolf of the same herd by the lawyer however a distinction is of course noted—the distinction between the lawtaxes imposed in the shape of stampduties and the lawtaxes imposed in the shape of fees the stampduties he will probably not be averse to the abrogation of on the contrary he will rather be desirous of it for the greater the defalcation from the aggregate of those which are expenses from which he does not derive profit the more is left in the pocket of the suitor to be employed in that same suit and in any other suits from which he will profit in so far as he contributes to the removal of these bars to justice he will exhibit an apparently good title to the praise of disinterestedness he will wear the face of a law reformist and in that character he may look for more or less of that public confidence by which he will be enabled with more or less effect to act in the character of an adversary to law reform so likewise even in regard to those taxes the produce of which flows into the common pocket of the profession so many divisions as that receptacle contains so many groups of profitseekers from each of whom law reform may receive support at the expense of the others and without loss to himself by the barrister class for example may be advocated reforms by which defalcation will be made from the profits of the solicitor class by the commonlaw barrister from those of the equity class and vice versâ so again as between speaking barristers and the various sorts of mutes called chamber counsel in the power of any of these it may be without any considerable real sacrifice not only to profess themselves reformists but even to act as such and thus exhibit the appearance of disinterestedness to the author of these pages at various times advances have been made by learned gentlemen with whom he had not the honour to be personally acquainted and of the truth of the above observations he finds in every such civility exemplification and demonstration frequently is the observation made that already even among lawyers there are and in increasing numbers law reformists but if true—as beyond doubt it is—small indeed should be the extent in which it is expected so to be otherwise than subject to limitations and exceptions such as the above an example—everybody sees how illustrative as well as illustrious an one—may be seen even in the instance of his noble and learned lordship exemplary has been his devotion to that one of the infernal deities whose name is common law strenuous his exertions to garnish the pockets of her votaries with prog picked out of those of her sister equity witness speech of      witness again the local courts bill with plan and speech touching and concerning the same for this phenomenon would you find an explanation forget not to consider that at neither of these epochs were the seals in immediate view and that the learned labours continued still employed moulding into the bespoken shape the contents of the wonderworking box so long as he is man thus will man comport himself to be angry with him for so doing is to be angry with him for existing but where and so far as a mans endeavours are in opposition to the welfare of the community will any one say that by his not being a proper subject for anger the need of a defensive force for its protection as against them is in any degree diminished right     to make the suitors pay the judge on the bench and pay the expenses of the chancery court yes those suitors who have wherewithal to pay though it be their uttermost farthing well but those of them who have no farthing at all whether the suit found them thus destitute or took it from them these men how are they to be made to pay it no to them justice is denied to them imprisonment is given in its stead while to those who have wherewithal to pay for it what is called justice to use his lordships so apt expression—that same drug is sold and continues to be sold so long as they continue to have wherewithal to buy it—sold by and for the benefit of the judges and the swarms of other lawyers a of the abovementioned arrangement the mischievousness and blindness were demonstrated sixandthirty years ago—demonstrated anno     —in protest against law taxes by the author of these pages and taken off in pursuance of it was a considerable part of that portion the produce of which under the name of stamp duties goes to the public revenue for all purposes and could not be increasable by judges this taken off while the whole of the portion here in question—namely that which has for its purpose the paying the judges and which is increasable by those same judges and to an unlimited amount to and for their own benefit was left on  the system just twenty years ago—namely anno      in the work intituled theoric des récompenses by the author of these pages this same system was blamed if exposure of turpitude is blame the system yes and the said masters into the bargain—if calling men and proving them to be extortioners and swindlers is blaming them—blamed by him were system and men together and thus freely his eyes not being sharp enough to descry any such necessity as that which to the noble and learned eyes is thus manifest could they even have prevailed upon themselves to abstain from this mode of swindling there would still have remained to them the faculty of increasing their emoluments ad infinitum as above there would have still remained to them for example the faculty of effecting the extortion of the sum of £  0 in payment of a mans name put by him to a paper without looking at it an extortion the fruit of which is continued to be fed upon in full security swindling yes swindling that is to say obtaining money as the statute words it by false pretences pretence here that of having done this or that piece of business which in fact had not been done attendance for example averred to have been paid at a time when no such attendance was paid—no such business nor any business at all on the occasion of or in relation to the suit in question was by the functionary in question done before the public ever since the year   0 —before the public now for these twenty years has been a work in which this abomination is painted in its appropriate colours desert is a term in relation to which i have on several occasions observed that though it is with propriety coupled with reward it is not with propriety coupled with punishment if however it be assumed to be properly coupled with punishment punishment has been still more richly deserved by every man by whom that office has been occupied than by any other sort of man to whom in speaking of him the appellative of swindler was ever applied the swindler—a malefactor to whom by the sooftenreferredto statute punishment by fine imprisonment pillory whipping or transportation was applied—those several punishments one or more of them at the option and discretion of the judge thus then stands the matter disease a complicated case—extortion coupled with swindling remedy as prescribed by the noble and learned doctor powderofpost well no longer suppose by the clerk are they taken those same fees—no longer by the clerk but according to prescription prescription by the noble and learned doctor by the master good and what then why—that in the course in question they will keep going on—these same masters these same masters with their high character and in their high station going on as they did in      and have done ever since unless by any very recent arrangement unknown to me it has happened to them to be stopped † £ 000 ayear whence this same sum of £ 000 or £ 000 ayear is to come is what i am utterly at a loss to conceive among the house of commons papers of the last session is one numbered    —date of the order for printing  th october     —intituled bankruptcy fees no   an account of all sums of money paid by the clerk of the hanaper to the lord high chancellor in each of the three last years the lord high chancellor it goes on to say receives from the hanaper office certain payments and allowance under his lordships patents which amount in each year to the unvarying sum of £ 0      0 deduct hanaper fees  0      net sum paid to the chancellor £ 0        lost am i here in astonishment this same sum of £ 0         —is it not the whole amount of the emolument which in a return called for by the house of commons is stated as being derived from the source in question—the bankruptcy business this the amount really given up by his lordship and by his said lordship l 000 or at the least £ 000 ayear asserted to be the amount given up by him an error on such an occasion to such an amount and in such a proportion and this in a matter to which his attention had thus pointedly been called for and directed can it have been of anything less than the whole of the emolument derived from that source that this order calls for and accordingly the return obtained by it contains the statement true it is that the hanaper office is the only source from which the information is called for but had there been any other such sources would not they have been all of them included in the order and consequently in the returns of any such order what could be the object—what other than the ascertaining and bringing to light the whole of what the office filled by this high functionary was deriving from this part of the business of it this—is it a sort of matter that could either have escaped his notice or his memory for the sake of round numbers or from the hurry of debate an error of a few per cent yes but an error of   or   hundred per cent an error of such magnitude in the conception entertained by a man of his own income not less distinguished for the liveliness of his imagination than for so many other brilliant accomplishments is the noble and learned lord but an imagination that could carry a man thus far above the truth—is it not strong enough to carry him aloft upon the wings of it till as horace in a certain case looked to do he ran bump against the starry firmamenta a apprehensive of the guilt of misrepresentation and injustice i have hunted out a report made in a former year—a report having for its subjectmatter the aggregate of the emoluments received by the lord chancellor in the chancellorship of lord eldon in it i find what follows date of order for printing   th april      no     general title bankrupt fees returns and account of receipt and appropriation of fees in bankruptcy particular account pp    to    both inclusive—  an account of all fees received by the lord chancellors pursebearer from the different branches of bankruptcy business in each year from      to      distinguishing the specific appropriation thereof in page    at the end of the account of the first of these years namely the year from april      to april      comes a statement in these words and figures—  £ s d total received for the lord chancellor subject to the deductions of a proportion of the salary allowed by his lordship to his pursebearer which according to the amount of other business in the pursebearers account is             0 0 0          in page   —in these same annual accounts the year in which the mass of emolument is at its minimum is the year intituled april      to april      and in that year it stands thus— £    0   deductions as before stated   0 0 0  £ 0  0   in page   —in these same accounts the year in which the mass of emolument is at its maximum is the year intituled april      to april      and in that year it stands thus— £   0    0 deductions as before stated   0 0 0  £   0    0 n b the substitution of this £  0 to the preceding £  0 wears the appearance of a clerical error    amount of this emolument upon an average of the two years £     0   whether by this last account my astonishment can have been lessened the reader will judge for on adverting to it the amount declared in proof of disinterestedness turns out to be instead of the   or   times about  0 times as great as the real amount at the time of this speech of his lordships at the making of which the magnifying glass through which he looked at the sum had swollen it to the £ 000 or £ 000 ayear the average was no more than this same £     0    as to the £ 0          which was the amount of it in the year      he could not at that time have known anything of it unless he had himself caused it to be taken and had it before him in manuscript  two masters this bears reference to another job which seems to have been abandoned  convenient a convenient word this same word convenient where the purpose is deception proportioned to its obscurity or ambiguity is the convenience of the diction employed in speaking of it pride on this occasion—the pride of the candidate—speaks more plainly where the emolument attached to the situation bears so small a proportion to the value of the time and labour necessary to the performance of the duties of it and at the same time affording the minimum of the provision capable of enabling a man to keep up an appearance suitable to his station in society without affording wherewithal to support a family in such sort that the gift of it would scarcely be regarded as a favour it will not sell for anything where it rises to a certain elevation it will fetch as much as an annuity clear of all burthen in the shape of service of a living the income of which is not greater than that of a curacy the advowson will not sell for anything while of a living which is rich to a certain amount the advowson has been known to sell for as much as    years purchase in military offices moreover the like proportion has place an ensigncy of foot pay  s  d aday sells for no more than £  0 while of a lieutenantcolonelcy pay   s aday no more than about three times as much as that of the ensign the regulation price is £  00—ten times as much the increment added by this circumstance to what his lordship with his disinterestedness gains by the change might be proved and expressed in figures were it worth while source of these statements information obtained from an official accountant † oblige by his commissionerships of £  00 ayear his judgeships of £ 000 ayear and his chief judgeships of £ 000 ayear his lordship can oblige persons so high in rank influence and capacity of obliging him that they would not have accepted of any of the abolished commissionerships with their three or four hundred ayear ‡ incompetent howsoever in this respect the case may be with a hypothetical lord chancellor in regard to an actual one if in what i have heard from various quarters there be anything in any degree well grounded the case is in no inconsiderable degree different of the four judges against one in particular the outcry on the score of inaptitude is if i am not egregiously misinformed loud and extensive  £   000 as to this sum evidence other than as above none and of the new fees established unbounded and ever increasable as is the amount of them nothing said for the real amount see below † retiring pension the more rapidly the lord high jobber drives on his course with his learned jobhorses the nearer will be the thus contemplated fall of this modern phæton upon his bed of down—the retiring pension—and the greater the importance of any addition made to it when the service of fighting and subduing their opposition lordships has been accomplished the unpopularity which by that time will have thickened round him will have impressed his colleagues in the cabinet with the necessity of giving him his quietus and consigning him to his thus anticipated retirement the sense entertained of the retardation opposed to parliamentary reform by the job here in question can scarcely have failed to hold up to the view of the public in the proper colours the expediency of such a measure  cavils by cavils seems to be commonly understood ungrounded and groundless censure how far it is in the present case applicable the reader will already have been in some measure enabled to judge † ignorance of this bill if for the provisions of this bill anything like an apology be to be found the reader will judge whether an ignorance of the substance qualities and probable effects of it on the part of all concerned in the drawing of it but more especially of the noble and learned draughtsman at the head of them will not constitute the least bad apology that can be found for it another point on which the reader is hereby requested to pronounce judgment is—whether to the removal of that same ignorance some contribution has not been made by him to whom this total ignorance is thus imputed in this same request may also be included the article of motives by a man who is not in the habit of looking into his own mind the motives from which his conduct derives its direction are frequently not so correctly or comprehensively understood as by bystanders in these observations if his lordship will be pleased to continue his researches in this view he may perhaps find a sort of microscope by which that operation will be more or less facilitated ‡ £  000—£  000 whether in these figures there be not some considerable errors of the press or of the pen is another point on which the reader will presently be in a condition to pass judgment ∥ £  000—£  000 magnificent indeed is the show made by these figures but this large cobnut has been cracked and the kernel has been found wanting i could not but suspect as much and by a publication which has made its appearance while these pages were writing this suspicion has been pretty well confirmeda from which the true value appears to be  0 to which perhaps may be substituted x if x be taken for a very small number as to the above acknowledgments the candour and good feeling displayed by them is such as would be matter of astonishment from any person but the best goodtempered and goodhumoured man that was ever seen in that high office not to speak of any other but intimation has been already given that somehow or other so it happens in such sort is my stomach constituted that not even in this shape of such trebly refined sugar can anything in which the taste of a bribe is perceptible be swallowed by it a legal observer october         p      this act yes according to this act at one and the same time in relation to one and the same supposed act of bankruptcy in two different justicechambers by two different sets of judges the one subordinate to the other one and the same set of proceedings is thus to be carried on and these same proceedings are it seems to be filed c in the office belonging to one of those same sets of judges—namely the four judges of the court of bankruptcy—in that office alone and thereupon any one or more of the commissioners thereof namely of the said court of bankruptcy of and in which in one sense of the words court of bankruptcy there are four judges and no one commissioner in another sense of those same words there are also at the same time commissioners in any number not exceeding six as also in the several numbers two three four five and six who are to proceed thereon says the bill and the act and so forth as above could any exercise be better imagined for the purpose of being translated into latin verse for the instruction of westminster schoolboys in the art of poetry as above proposed this however is an episode be this as it may here again we have it is true manyseatedness in all its five forms the said commissioners whatsoever be the number of them sitting in the laps of the four judges of the said four judges the three puisnes saying they are of the same opinion with the chief and all four singing to the commissioner or commissioners lullaby baby † note that in neither edition of this bill is there any such or any other act recited ‡ in the second edition also this same section stands twentieth and is without variation in the same words here then we have a commissioner acting under the direction of an act which has no existence much good may it do him not to speak of the suitors here and without doubt we have singleseatedness yes—and here in all its simplicity and purity  question here for argument judge either the judge whose proceedings in the imagined case are to be guessed at or some other and what judge or judges question what the said judge would do were he a commissioner not that in this imagined case there is anything of inconsistency or impossibility for though as above every commissioner is a judge it is not true that every judge is a commissioner be this as it may here we have a most ample recognition of the principle of singleseatedness not only six justicechambers do we see with a commissioner in each but four other justicechambers with a judge in each † now suppose a different direction given by each of any two or by every one of all these ten members of the court of bankruptcy—namely the four judges who are not commissioners and the six commissioners who are and are not judges what is to be the consequence the unhappy wight—the official assignee—should he be as he may be pulled at the same time ten different ways what is to become of him still greater would be his embarrassment than that of garrick between tragedy and comedy or hercules in the print between venus and minerva more nearly resembling would his condition be to that of a french traitor under the ancien régime when pulled four opposite ways by so many wild horses after this in this same section comes a clause speaking of such rule and regulation     as the lord chancellor orthe said court of review or any judge of the said court of bankruptcy if authorized so to do by any general order of the same court as to this same if is it to both the subjectmatters immediately preceding—namely the court of review or any judge of the said court of bankruptcy—or to the last of them alone that it is to be understood to bear reference here likewise we have a recited act a said recited act which is not anywhere recited so much the better for the official assignee who if it were recited might have to be charged with interest with which as the matter stands he cannot be charged and which accordingly the fault will be his if he does not pocket note moreover that on this occasion the words are not as elsewhere rules and regulations in the plural but rule and regulation in the singular and thus it stands not only in the first edition but in the second also and that after revision made now then as to this one rule and regulation suppose it made by a single judge of the court of review what rule and regulation is there power for the making of which is left either to the court of review in its integrality integrality not integrity or the lord chancellor and suppose that by every one or even any one of these functionaries the one rule and regulation thus authorized has been made what power is there left for the eventual amendment of it—for the amendment of it whether in the way of subtraction addition or substitution by the first exercise given to it will not this same power be exhausted moreover as to these rules and regulations when they are in the plural what is to be done with them according to §   they are to be established according to §    they are to be made according to §    rules are to be made doing as well as they can without either regulations or orders according to §    rules and orders are to be made and directed and thus it stands in both editions they are to be made that is to say in this section rules and orders by which it seems but fair to presume is meant the same thing with what as above is in other places meant by rules and regulations whatever thing it is you mean how many times soever in the same portion of discourse you have occasion to mention it be sure never to employ the same locution in the designation of it a rule to this effect though the observance of it has never yet been made obligatory by the positive enactment of a law of parliament has of late days been made little less effectually obligatory by a law of fashion in a speech spoken or a paragraph in a periodical it serves not any more important purpose than that of ornament but when conformed to in and by an act of parliament it is of more substantial use for whatsoever be the number of times at which this decoration is employed the same is the number of grounds on each of which a lawsuit may be erected and appropriate remuneration for learned industry and ingenuity administered as to rules regulations and directions rules and regulations are in use to be made as also to be established nor are they altogether unaccustomed to direct and in this way to be active but as to the being directed and accordingly passive facts says the common aphorism are stubborn things and it seems questionable whether the like stubbornness may not be apprehended at the hands of rules and regulations  here again the alreadymentioned difficulty reexhibits itself this same operation whatsoever it be any one of these five commissioners all of them at the same time members of the court of bankruptcy may perform—whatever may be done by the two three four or five others to prevent it as to adjournment by adjourn the learned draughtsman means it may be presumed transfer the occasion on which adjourn is the term commonly employed is when the body being the same the transference is of that same body to a meeting at another time and at the same place or another place but for aught i know precedents of employment given in this sense to the verb to adjourn may have met the learned draughtsmans eye † thus far the bill so that inter alia should the question such as it is be decided upon in the first instance by the said three other judges the appeal against such decision of these same other judges may be heard by these same other judges sitting under the name of the court of review the appeal will be from themselves to themselves and will accordingly be heard by themselves in the law of procedure in this provision a new improvement à la brougham is exhibited an appeal from the lord chancellor to the house of lords has long been understood to be accident excepted an appeal from his noble and learned lordship in one place to his said noble and learned lordship in another palce but how effectually soever produced this mode of obviating uncertainty though not without some relatively beneficial addition to expense and delay has it is believed been authorized and established by act of parliament it may accordingly be considered as an addition made to the list of the improvements made or meditated by the noble and learned author of this bill in the fabric of the law  thus far the bill a curious enough document would be the formula by which this appeal without the name of an appeal—this appeal in disguise—this quasiappeal as it may be termed—is ordered to be made its place would be among the rules and regulations or say rules and orders so often spoken of thus it is that here again we have singleseatedness and of the six commissioners each one is if he think fit so to do issuing a different decree making on one and the same occasion on one and the same point in any number as far as six different decrees each of them contradictory to every other on the supposition that to this act and to this clause in it the execution called for by it is given accordingly so that should the money say £ 0 be by commissioner a adjudged to thomas noakes by commissioner b to john stiles by commissioner c to john doe by commissioner d to richard roe and so forth then and in such case the said noakes stiles doe and roe c will receive each of them the said sum of £ 0 to his own proper use to the quantity of the mass of argumentation capable of being extracted from this one section—to the quantity of time the said argumentation may be made to occupy—to the quantity of money it may be made to pump up out of the fund lodged in the hands of the assignees official and nonofficial—to the profit capable of being extracted out of the said money in the shape of remuneration for the services of learned judges learned commissioners and learned gentlemen—who shall assign any limits other than those of the said fund itself—all for the more effectual minimization of expense delay and uncertainty in fulfilment of the promise made in the preamble note moreover that by the words of this clause when the learned persons in question be they who they may adjourn the examination of any bankrupt or other person he or they are to proceed—not with that same examination but with the examination of a different matter namely a proof of debt—such is the mode of proceeding for the carrying on of which the learned draughtsman has made provision and with an anxiety the tokens of which are upon the face of the passage so conspicuous † here again may be seen singleseatedness witness such commissioner ‡ note how in this section which follows immediately upon the lastmentioned one lest the quantity of this preeminently necessary remuneration should not yet be sufficient provision is made for two appeals two appeals one above another—ossa upon pelion namely one from any or all of the six judicatories just indicated appeal to the court of review the other from the court of review to the lord chancellor but rich indeed must be the fund if after having been drawn upon by these drains which we have been seeing there remain any very considerable pickings for his said lordship and his immediate subordinates in his court of chancery ∥ appeals may moreover here be seen mounted one upon another in a pile by which the tower of babel will naturally be made to present itself to the mind of any person who has ever seen the elevation of it upon a dutch tile if the court of review says the bill shall determine in any appeal touching any decision in matter of law upon the whole merits of any proof of debt then the order of the said court shall finally determine the question as to the said proof having gone thus far a debtor or creditor by whom the bill were perusing would naturally expect and hope to find the course of plunderage at an end vain alas the expectation for now comes in the pile of appeals introduced by an unless unless continues the bill unless an appeal to the lord chancellor be lodged within one month from such determination this month being interposed for the more effectual fulfilment of the promised minimization of delay and uncertainty but alas once more this is but the beginning of sorrows for and in case of such appeal continues the bill the determination of the lord chancellor thereupon shall in like manner be final touching such proof but if the appeal either to the court of review or the lord chancellor shall relate only to the admission or refusal of evidence then and in that case the proof of the debt shall be again heard by the commissioners or subdivision court and the said evidence shall be then admitted or rejected according to the determination of the court of review or the lord chancellor here the section ends here then in the character of a security an additional security against misdecision is assumed the propriety of an appeal from the lord chancellor yea even from the lord chancellor to a commission to any one of the six commissioners at the choice and pleasure of the party or of chance as it may happen but if expense delay and uncertainty be put out of consideration and more completely put out of consideration they can scarcely be than they are in and by the whole tenor of this bill security it must be admitted can never be too secure here then is this same scale or pile of appeals at the pleasure of any one of the parties and in particular of any one of them whose plan it was to gain his point by exhausting the matter of fees from the pockets of the rest reproduced and this not once only but toties quoties till the exhaustion is completed and thus may the original repetend be improved into a circulate and for the benefit of the learned useful application thus made of mathematics to jurisprudence and the tower of babel turned toties quoties topsyturvy and then set right again as in the case of an hourglass with sand in it—an hourglass that formerly useful implement so much prized by the wisdom of our ancestors now so extensively supplanted by clocks and watches with incontestible propriety may these same appeals in disguise alias quasiappeals be thus put upon a level with appeals commonly so called why so for this plain reason because in point of expense and delay no difference is there between the one case and the other and so long as the quantity of money taken out of the pockets of suitors is the same and the quantity of time wasted is the same what matters it what the name is which is given to the legal operation or instrument by which the evil is produced the effect being the same what matters it what the name is which is given to the cause now then for the scale or say pile of appeals—these same appeals so called and appeals not so called put together for shortness let the name of appeal be given to each one of them   appeal the first we have had already namely by section   —appeal from such commissioner or subdivision court to the court of review   appeal the second by sections    and   —from the court of review to the lord chancellor   appeal the third an appeal in disguise—appeal from the lord chancellor to the commissioner the singleseated commissioner or subdivision court by whom or which the proof of the debt says the bill shall be again heard   appeal the fourth another disguised appeal—appeal from the commissioner or the court of review to that same court of review appeal ab eodem ad eundem as above noticed   appeal the fifth another disguised appeal disguised under the same cloak as appeal the fourth—from the court of review to the lord chancellor   as yet we have but five appeals declared or say appeals patent but a sixth disguised appeal or say an appeal latent if not a seventh may be discovered in the words commissioner or subdivision court for in a former section namely the sixth may be seen established an appeal from every singleseated commissioner to a subdivision court and in another namely section the third from every subdivision court to the court of review from whence as above lies the appeal to the lord chancellor  on the per contra side in the correspondent parts the words are as far as may be the same the figures alone different of this identity the use and consequence are—that to the purpose here in question any error that may happen to be found may be seen to be the less material  see westminster review for april      † for his
