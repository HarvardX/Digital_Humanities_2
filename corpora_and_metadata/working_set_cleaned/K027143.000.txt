two sermons  the first on comparing spiritual things with spiritual preached at the primary visitation of the lord bishop of winchester at southampton july         and printed at the request of the bishop and clergy the second on the simplicity of the gospel preached likewise at southampton at the visitation of the chancellor of the diocese september       0 and now printed at his request  by william gilpin m a prebendary of salisbury and vicar of boldre in newforest near lymington  london printed for r blamire strand       to the honorable and right reverend the lord bishop of winchester this sermon is inscribed by his lordships most obedient and most respectful humble servant  william gilpin  sermon i on comparing spiritual things with spiritual    cor ii    which things we speak not in the words which mans wisdom teaches but which the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual when st paul planted the gospel at corinth he found his designs chiefly opposed by two kinds of people  the first were men of pleasure corinth lay commodiously for trade and trade produces riches and it had been early observed that it was difficult for rich men to enter into the kingdom of heaven they were more disposed to the pleasures which riches furnish than to the comforts which religion administers and even they who had embraced christianity found much work for the apostle in keeping them pure from the contagion that was spread abroad  besides the gay and thoughtless the apostle had another kind of people to contend with these were philosophers and tho they were a more respectable set of men than the other they were at the same time perhaps more intractable a state of learning is in itself no doubt favorable to religion at least in a certain degree and has ever been found so but the philosopher himself has sometimes too much wisdom to be taught the corinthian philosophers certainly had and were in general rather inclined to add something of their own to amend the gospel than to accept it in that simplicity in which paul preached it  to the latter the text alludes these philosophizing christians many of whom were probably teachers also the apostle endeavors to recall to the simplicity of the gospel he sets before them his own example he came not he tells them with the excellency of speech or the enticing words of mans wisdom he knew nothing among them but jesus christ and him crucified adding that he had never preached the words which mans wisdom teaches but which the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual  in this passage the apostle gives us the only true rule of interpreting scripture which rule i shall endeavor to illustrate by showing how the apostles were directed by it and how it seems applicable to us the text has i know been applied by some interpreters to persons rather than things but i think the whole context favors the sense in which i take it  in the first place the apostle tells us he avoided the words which mans wisdom teaches  in the apostles days indeed mans wisdom had made only a little progress in the affairs of religion we read of hymeneus philetus and a few others who seemed desirous of being teachers before they understood what they affirmed but their number was small  mans wisdom however was a kind of leaven which made a rapid progress we need only cursorily examine ecclesiastical history to see it is mischievous effects there we find men running such lengths of folly extravagance wildness and i may add of wickedness that we may well suppose it was in the spirit of foresight that the apostle puts us somuch on our guard against mans wisdom mans wisdom has filled innumerable volumes the purity of the gospel is comprised in one  in this ungrateful field we might wander long the history of mans wisdom is the history of his opinions and of these there is no end zeal and indiscretion pride and vanity bad meanings and good meanings have all contributed to interpret what the holy ghost teaches by the words of mans wisdom instead therefore of wandering in this wide wilderness let us fix our eyes on those great landmarks which the apostle has set up to lead us safely through it  the apostles were immediately inspired they taught as the holy ghost instructed immediate inspiration brought all things to their remembrance whatever their blessed lord had taught them  at the same time it should seem that the inspiration of the apostles was restricted to what was new in the religion they taught  or if not wholly new yet so obscurely shadowed out in prophecies and prophetic types that it needed certainly a full explanation the great truths with regard to the redemption of the world  the intercession of christ  the conditions of acceptance  the universality of the christian religion  the motives it holds out  the purity it has introduced into morals  the certainty of a future state  and of a last judgment  were all no doubt strongly impressed on the minds of the apostles and properly opened by immediate inspiration in any of these great truths mistakes were dangerous  memory was frail  and there were yet no written records  at the same time such notices as were already on the records of inspiration  those divine truths contained in the books of the old testament  wanted no farther illustration from the holy ghost here nothing more seems to have been necessary than the use of reason and common sense and thus the apostle distinguishes between the things which god had revealed by the spirit and the act of comparing spiritual things with spiritual the one he calls declaring the testimony of god the other was plainly the exertion only of reason nothing more than the exertion of reason was necessary to prove the connection between the old testament and the new  or to point out the completion of prophecies  or to show how the types of the law were fulfilled of this mode of reasoning we find abundant instances among the sacred writers  in the epistle to the hebrews especially  thus then inspiration seems to have been necessary to direct the apostles in what was hitherto unknown but human reason seemed sufficient to enable them to apply what had been already inspired  let us then now see how this rule which guided the apostles appears applicable to us  or in what way we are to speak what the holy ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual  in the first place i think it plainly appears that we have no reason to expect immediate direction from what the holy ghost teaches to wait for desultory illapses of the spirit to lead us into truth seems to have little countenance from scripture unless indeed we apply to ourselves such passages as by the fairest rules of interpretation can apply only to the apostles and surely the greatest caution is necessary in settling a point which if it be an error tends to confirm all other errors when a man reasons himself into a mistake he may reason himself out of it again but when a man discards reason and substitutes in it is room a divine instructor every enthusiastic notion becomes then immediately stamped with the character of divine truth the strange effects of such wildness we have often seen and are sufficiently guarded against it by the apostles rule  as far indeed as a holy life is concerned we are assured every where in scripture that unless the endeavors of man are assisted by the holy spirit of god which dwells within him and to whose divine admonitions he ought ever to listen he can do nothing here the divine aid is necessary man as a moral agent with all the mischiefs of the fall about him wanted support  but the investigation of truth is a different affair it was not so much his understanding that was disturbed as his will and affections that were perverted wretched man that he was he knew what was right but he could not practice it to rectify his knowledge enough had been done inspired truth was on record and he had a rule given him to understand it farther aid would have rendered that rule unnecessary and the expectation of any such aid enthusiastic  it is true indeed the pious christian will read his bible with the best effect and in this sense no doubt the holy spirit may be said to assist him in understanding the truth of scripture for he who does the will of god will know of the doctrine whether it be of god but this is still only the application of scripture to the rectifying of his affections to understand it as a system of truth the rule given us to compare spiritual things with spiritual seems abundantly sufficient the new testament is to us precisely in the state in which the old testament was to the apostles it is inspiration recorded if farther inspiration be necessary a written record is more than is necessary if god gave the greater why should he give the less  it seems therefore fully sufficient for the understanding of scripture to take it into our hands and in the spirit of sincerity and piety to compare one part with another or with a general view of the whole this seems in the apostles idea the only key to the scriptures  but now it must be confessed that a variety of causes have introduced difficulties into these sacred records ancient customs not well understood  ancient modes of speaking not conformable to our own  ancient errors generated in times of ignorance  modern prejudices and opinions grafted on texts of scripture misapplied  have united with other causes in disfiguring the plain and simple truths of the gospel  why god suffered this blot as some may call it in the sacred record of his truth we know not yet humbly tracing the reason of it in the analogy of his other works we may refer it to the general law of a state of trial every thing here bears the marks of the fall in our moral pursuits we are exercised with various difficulties why not in the pursuit of religious truth in both we may be assisted if we apply the proper means in one the spirit of god will direct our endeavors in the other the great scriptural rule of comparing spiritual things with spiritual  the honest application of this rule without doubt would remove all the material difficulties of scripture but instead of solving them in this way we too often endeavor to adjust them by the words of mans wisdom hence arise all the disputes that have divided the church  the opinions which have occasioned them however varied run commonly in two great channels  that of enthusiasm and that of libertinism the enthusiast reads his bible too literally the libertine i use the word in it is less offensive sense too laxly the one utterly discards reason the other thinks nonothing but reason worth attending to the enthusiast loves a mystery because he does not understand it the libertine allows nothing to be a mystery what he does not understand he rejects  let us in an instance or two apply our great scriptural rule to them both  with regard to the jarring doctrine of faith and works it can never surely be settled by the literal application of a few scattered passages of st paul but one should imagine it might easily be settled by comparing such passages with other parts of scripture and still more by an appeal to the whole scheme of christianity the very first book of the bible shows us that the gospel was meant to restore us to that purity of life which we had originally lost this indeed seems to be the leading point of christianity the word of god every where exhorting us to cleanse our hearts  to purify our affections  and to transform ourselves into new creatures  now it is certain all this must be done by faith whoever comes to god through christ must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him so that in this sense we may be said to be justified by faith because without says and it is accompanying virtues no man can attain that righteousness which the gospel requires as a proper qualification for our receiving the merits of christs death all christians therefore lay a stress on faith the great difference is the partial view makes it in itself an end  the comparative view makes it the means only of a purified heart and a good life  with regard again to an awful doctrine which we have lately heard disputed with so much freedom one should think that a comparison of spiritual things with spiritual might lead us here also to one point the whole bible old testament and new prophecies and completion seem so full both of the humanity and divinity of christ that one should wonder how any one who believes the scriptures could separate the two ideas if only human how inconsistent here is a human being who engages in the arduous task of redeeming his fellow creatures from sin we must either therefore give up all idea of redemption of which the scripture is every where so full  or we must acknowledge the total disproportion of the work  the idea of redemption indeed is sometimes given up but still what difficulties remain unless we give up the scriptures also this human being showed every sign of a divine nature he knew the thoughts of man which is always considered as one of the prerogatives of the almighty he could forgive sin tho we all know that none can forgive sin but god alone this human being also had the power  not only of working miracles himself which many have possessed  but of commissioning others also to work them which no one ever attempted before this human being tho cautious in the early part of his ministry yet as he approached the end of it spoke so freely that those around him declared he made himself equal with god which was in fact the case this human being also was endowed with the strange and wonderful power of raising not only others  but himself also from the dead and not only professed in his lifetime that he would send  but after his ascension to heaven he actually did send the holy ghost upon his faithful followers communicating to them powers unheard of before for the propagation of his religion in a word when we take a comprehensive view of the scriptures and draw together the innumerable passages in which this great truth seems so plainly to be contained it is a difficult matter to conceive how a denial of it is consistent with a belief in what we read nor is this a matter to be reasoned upon like a point of mathematics or natural philosophy nor indeed does there seem a necessity to adduce the opinions of this or that father of the church the honest application of the rule before us is all that seems really necessary  that we do not understand this great mystery is certain how indeed should we but we understand as much of it as we do of many other things  of the union of our souls and bodies particularly in which we all believe  there are some passages of scripture again which have been thought more refractory  with regard for instance to the foreknowledge of god and such doctrines as are supposed to be involved in it for myself i own i find little difficulty in bringing all these passages to the apostles test of comparison but if any of them should be thought more unyielding instead of reasoning upon them we might still content ourselves with comparing spiritual things with spiritual tho we may not be able to obtain complete satisfaction from a comparison with particular passages we may surely obtain it from a comparison with the whole scheme of the gospel the gospel was intended for the general good of man and gods arbitrary will can never run counter to his revealed will  we act thus in common life suppose we look into a medical book for the remedy of some particular disorder and should there find it prescribed that we should mix a certain quantity of some drug a quantity which we know would prove fatal with other ingredients  how should we receive such a prescription we know well that the book is intended to administer to our health but here is a prescription which would infallibly destroy us we should take it for granted therefore  either that the drug in question was put by mistake for some other drug  or if the book were foreign that it was wrongly translated  or that there was some mistake in the quantity perhaps  or perhaps that we might not clearly understand the prescription  at any rate we should certainly never swallow the potion because it was very plain that the intention of the book and the prescription must agree  thus the apostles rule of comparing spiritual things with spiritual will in all cases direct us right one part will generally explain another but if any part happen to be more unyielding we cannot be far wrong if we compare the difficulty whatever it is with the general scheme and intention of the gospel  but there is one difficulty still behind which is the greatest of all  and that is to bring our minds honestly to the application of this rule the mind when we examine a difficulty of scripture should be blank paper alas how often is it already scribbled over with the words of mans wisdom each of us has his favorite system  the pride of all his studious hours  and in nothing does selfdeceit triumph more than in giving these favorite systems the gloss of scripture it is the most difficult thing in the world to take the eye from some favorite point and give it a general cast and yet without this no judgment can be formed  in examining the works of man as well as of god we must judge from the whole or our judgment will be erroneous in architecture for instance should a man stand close to a column and pronounce boldly that it was too large or too small we see at once how absurd a judgment he might pass whereas if he should step back a little  take a proper stand and view the whole in one comprehensive view he might perhaps find that the part objected to was in exact proportion and the defect not in the object but in himself  it is often thus in our scriptural inquiries we take a doctrine from a text  and here i cannot help lamenting the singular illusage which the scriptures have met with in being frittered into chapter and verse with so little attention to the sense it is astonishing that the unauthorised barbarism of a printer robert stephens who was printing a concordance and a bible at the same time and took this method of adapting the one to the other i cannot give it a softer name tho he was certainly an able and a learned man should be received so universally through christendom the only advantage which this strange interruption of the sense of scripture can have might just have been answered as well by marginal references in the mean time the mischief is glaring the narrative or the argument instead of running on like other compositions in a continued discourse is broken into aphorisms in other books the paragraph ends where the sense makes a pause in the bible whatever the sense is it ends at every third or fourth line passages thus insulated receive an independent form the sense in each little paragraph seems drawn to a point and the unlettered reader at least is apt to pause whereas if he went on and took all together he would find he must often affix a very different meaning to the words  i have frequently heard for instance a verse at the beginning of the  st epistle of st peter elect according to the foreknowledge of god alleged as an irrefragable argument in favor of predestination but if this verse were added to the preceding one from which it is violently separated it would appear that the whole people of pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia are all the elect according to the foreknowledge of god now it is absurd in the last degree to suppose that the whole bulk of these several nations were in a state of salvation at the same time it is perfectly evangelical to conceive them all invited to partake of the privileges of the gospel according to the foreknowledge of god  that is according to the predictions of the prophets that this is the sense to be affixed to the foreknowledge of god is evident from the tenth verse in which we are told that the prophets prophesied of the grace that should come unto the gentiles and if after so many breaks we may be allowed to bring the seventeenth verse into the argument we are there told plainly that god without respect of persons judges according to every mans work   few judicious churchmen i suppose would wish for a new translation of the bible it could not soon acquire that general reverence which is paid to the old one but many perhaps would desire to see the errors of the old one corrected tho with as little alteration as possible the several late collations of mss would render this i should think no very difficult work if however the wisdom of our superiors see any insuperable obstacle in going so far one should suppose at least there could be none in detaching chapters and verses into the margin they are certainly unauthorised intruders  having thus considered the passage of scripture i undertook to discourse on and touched tho very slightly a very important subject  so important and so often transgressed that frequent hints upon it can never be out of season  i shall just add a few remarks on the difference between holding an error and teaching one  error is inseparable from the mind of man humanum est errare was the honest confession of nature and a state of grace points out the melancholy truth with still greater force we humbly hope therefore that as man and error are so closely united god will pardon our innocent errors  i mean such errors as have no connection with guilt  but yet our errors tho innocent as far as we ourselves are concerned may to others be the source of great mischief while they continue our own thoughts they affect nobody but when we suffer them to get abroad they become clothed in words  and perhaps in such words as the text calls the words of mans wisdom  thus many excellent men i doubt not may have carried the doctrine of faith too high them it injured not every christian virtue perhaps flowing from it in their minds therefore however erroneous the opinion it may still be innocent  but they may fall into a very egregious mistake if they suppose from their own pious feelings that this doctrine has always the same effect on others it may create selfdelusion i should fear it might have a tendency to it and may make men satisfied with themselves faith is an easy substitute for a good life faith they are sure they have and as to works they hear them always spoken of as of no value which it is possible they may be too apt to apply in their own way so all is well it is certainly a very dangerous thing to speak slightly of works lest we should give a handle to the natural pravity of human nature  thus again with regard to the other important subject on which i touched as there are many passages of scripture relating to the humanity of christ as well as his divinity i cannot persuade myself as some pious people have done that an exact faith on this head is necessary to salvation numbers i have no doubt will be saved through the merits of christ who conceive him only as their lawgiver and conscientiously obey his laws tho they may not have those exalted ideas of his divine nature to which our scriptural rule i think so directly leads if their holy lives have attained the principal end of a better faith they ought not surely to be branded with hard names and considered among those who deny christ before men  we are sometimes told they ought because without this exalted faith in the divine nature of a savior the mind cannot attain those elevated heights of love which the gospel prescribes  one should think so indeed but before we pass these harsh censures on others let any of us who do hold that doctrine ask our own carnal hearts whether it purify them in this exalted manner  at the same time i think we have good ground to censure those who publicly raise scruples why cannot they be satisfied with keeping their opinions at home  when a man holds a religious opinion with such conscientious firmness that he gives up his temporal interests for it is sake tho the opinion may be erroneous the man is virtuous his character respectable  but if instead of suffering manfully for his opinion he should set it up as a banner and call people together under it he should then i think look well to his motives there may be a touch of latent vanity  there may be an overweening of himself  the pride of being at the head of a sect  an oblique view to selfinterest perhaps  or some other undue motive which may insinuate itself without well looking after into his religious views to propagate any error is dangerous  but on disputable motives it is doubly so a man is no way put upon it of course he is answerable for the consequence on a question of philosophy indeed where an airpump or a crucible is concerned it matters little but where religion is the subject it becomes a point of moment to be silent is at least safe there can be no harm  and i think no great share of modesty  in keeping an opinion to yourself which has always been opposed by a great majority and some of the wisest and best men both laymen and churchmen that ever lived  but it is said the examination of truth can do no harm  none in the world to the truth itself none to the candid and able examiner of it but to the undistinguishing many it may often do great harm indeed i know nothing of a more delicate nature than the management of a polemical controversy to answer a bold charge seems necessary but to keep up the spirit of a dispute by continually replying to an opponent who is determined never to yield seems more than is necessary it may unsettle the minds of wellmeaning people it may lead them from things of more consequence it may be offensive to see churchmen continually wrangling about points of religion and tho these points may often be of little moment in themselves yet they who know less may think essentials concerned and the gospel itself of an unstable nature  besides i should always fear that what was gained in argument would be lost in piety  in charity most undoubtedly holy wars have ever been the worst of wars and scriptural debates the most intemperate  and what end is gained they rarely convince people generally hold their own opinions and the matter ends as it began dr priestley very justly observes that there is but little reason to expect that any man who has given the public his opinion on any subject of importance will ever retract it see his disquisitions page  0   and as to any concern for the souls of men in pure charity one should think they will not allege this if we allow salvation to their faith they may surely be as condescending to ours  after all the world has had enough on these subjects there is not one of them which has not been over and over debated we have only the old argument dressed up anew the skeptical inquirer cannot possibly mistake his way the road is tracked by many wheels and needful guideposts are every where set up from the knowledge abroad in the world he may easily find abundance to satisfy all his enquiries  the great conclusion from the whole is that the ministers of religion cannot be too cautious in avoiding the words which mans wisdom teaches nor too careful in comparing spiritual things with spiritual polemical divinity no doubt has a tendency to lead us aside the great point before us is very different instead of employing our time on the difficult topics of the gospel which concern few it would serve the cause of the gospel better to endeavor by every means as we are best able to inculcate the important truths of religion which so much concern us all  the intention and necessity of it  it is graces and high offers  it is means of purifying our nature  it is conditions and awful sanctions these are truths which tho well known require daily inculcating and placing in various lights on examining therefore the whole intention and tenor of the gospel  on comparing spiritual things with spiritual we must be convinced that the greatest service we can do to religion  and the best obedience we can show to the gospel consists in our uniting in a conscientious endeavor to draw a corrupt age to the practice of godliness  keeping that which is committed to our trust and avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so called which too often spoil men through philosophy and vain deceit after the rudiments of the world and not after christ  end of the first sermon sermon ii  on the simplicity of the gospel  to the reverend dr sturges chancellor of the diocese of winchester this sermon is inscribed by his most obedient and very humble servant william gilpin    cor xi   i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ one of the first great objects of apostolical fear in the matter of religious corruption was judaism the earliest converts were jews and they could not at once be brought to acknowledge the simplicity that is in christ deep prejudices had taken root the authority of moses  their peculiar privileges  the grandeur of their temple  and splendour of it is worship had gotten possession of their earliest conceptions and had filled their minds with ideas which were not easily erased by the simplicity of the gospel  but tho judaism was the primary object of the apostles fear the passage before us leads us to suppose his apprehensions had here taken another turn and were rather directed to the temptations of the world  we may consider it indeed if we please as prophecy it has certainly the most genuine mark of prophecy  it has been exactly fulfilled the simplicity of the gospel in it is first age could not be more corrupted by judaism than it has been since by a concurrence of other mischievous causes  in the following discourse i shall just touch upon a few of those causes pointed out by the apostle which have corrupted the simplicity that is in christ and i shall then inquire what part the ministers of the gospel should take in this matter it is a subject neither new nor curious but if it be a common subject it is at least a very interesting one and can neither be too often reviewed nor too deeply impressed  in order to see how the simplicity that is in christ has been corrupted it may be necessary to inquire first in what it consists but the apostle has not defined it and therefore we may suppose we are to gather a definition of it for ourselves  whoever reads the holy scriptures with the meek spirit of a learner will feel the meaning of the expression better than any logical distinctions can explain it to him he will feel the simplicity that is in christ growing upon him more and more as he becomes more intimately acquainted with the scriptures and by degrees taking possession of his understanding and affections  he will feel a disposition forming itself in his mind free from the prejudices of any sect  yet indulgent to the opinions of all  open to conviction  and above disingenuous cavil  zealous in searching for the truth  but gentle in maintaining it  equally ready to correct an error and to acknowledge it he will feel that the simplicity which is in christ will form his heart as well as his faith and opinions he will not allow the precepts of religion to be refined by the glosses of the world  nor accommodated to it is fashions  nor considered as speculative points his faith will be a directing principle which raises him above the world  above it is hopes  above it is fears  and forms him into a cheerful passenger through this state of trial animated only by those holy hopes which the gospel inspires  that there are now and have been in all ages many individuals who may in a certain degree be thus characterized we have no doubt but where shall we find the national character of a people under this description in early days when christians were of one heart and one soul we may suppose that heart and soul were truly christian but it was at a time when we read they had all things in common when the necessary distinctions of society began to take place then began also among christians an opposition between the spirit of the world and the simplicity that is in christ this simplicity was in a degree tainted even before the miraculous powers of the church ceased and we may be assured the mischievous spirit which then appeared has not been idle through so long a tract of time but has continued extending it is influence in some countries more in others less according to the various circumstances of each the new testament is the record of the simplicity of the gospel and modern history but above all ecclesiastical history is the record of it is corruption  the apostle of the text is writing to the converts of a trading and opulent town not barbarous and uninformed but enlightened by all the philosophy and worldly wisdom at that time in esteem he foresaw what temptations their peculiar circumstances would draw them into worldly ideas of various kinds  vanity pride and ambition  avarice profusion and sensuality in a word all the arts of raising a fortune and all the arts of consuming one he knew would be continually operating before their eyes and how the simplicity of the gospel might be able to oppose these fascinating delusions was the object of his fear  again it might be in equal danger from the refinements of philosophy and the acute reasonings of learned men who trying it is simple principles by canons of human invention and rules of logical exactness would from these pronounce boldly on it is inconsistences and defects  the simplicity of the gospel might be powerfully opposed too by the ridicule of men of wit who taking their topics of comparison from the fashions and practices of the world might display the folly and absurdity of such doctrines as they were inclined to discountenance  all this was perfectly easy for as christianity and the world were at variance arguments drawn from the world and addressed to the world were sure of being favorably heard  that these were the motives of the apostles apprehension is very plain for he tells his converts he fears they should be corrupted as the serpent had beguiled eve to know therefore how that matter stood we need only turn to the record of the fatal deed when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eye and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat  short as this account is we find in it a combination of interest pleasure vanity and a false taste for knowledge all cooperating through the wiles of the devil to impose upon our first parent with these delusions she was corrupted and with these delusions we conclude the apostle feared his corinthian converts might be corrupted also  how far our case may be similar to that of the corinthian converts i should rather leave as matter of inference all i wish to establish on this head is that we are assured on the authority of an apostle that the simplicity which is in christ may be corrupted by such temptations as certainly do abound amongst us  in our manners  in our amusements  in our literary pursuits and in our general modes of intercourse with each other  some theorists may amuse themselves with an opinion that religion is in a progressive state it is at least a pleasing theory  and in one sense no doubt a very just one if we believe in prophecy we must believe that the gospel will not only spread over the face of the earth but that it is present state is a kind of preparation for that glorious state of which we obtain a general conception from the apocalypse of st john tho the lofty figures employed in that description leave the detail obscure  but notwithstanding this general progress of the gospel we may suppose it is light to be sometimes obscured in particular countries  or in the apostles language it is simplicity corrupted on this head i fear the general prevailing manners of our own country will not stand a scriptural test  as the ministers of the gospel make a part of this tainted mass we must not flatter ourselves that we are not in a degree corrupted also we read in early days of deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ and we cannot conceive that these deceitful workers are more uncommon now or these transformations more rare i mean not however at present to pursue so ungrateful a theme i should rather wish to inquire how far we have it in our power to counteract such corruption  even to oppose this torrent with any success no doubt may be difficult enough to restore the simplicity of the gospel is a vain thought for that great event we must wait devoutly for those times to which i have just alluded when all offense shall be done away  some things may be wrong which the legislature only can rectify and tho we acknowledge the difficulty of moving these sacred foundations yet favorable opportunities may perhaps arise in future time when a few things which are now rather offensive may be brought nearer the simplicity of the gospel many of our ablest churchmen have freely expressed their wishes on this head and as these wishes become more general they will of course obtain more weight establishments however after all necessary as they are must necessarily bring on their attendant evils which serious men may bemoan  and in part may rectify but on the whole they will ever have cause to lament that the nature of things in this corrupt state is mixed with evil  and that the nature of man will turn even his blessings into mischief  we have also greatly to lament that the manners of the great are in general so far removed from the simplicity of the gospel because the manners of the great will ever be the principal source of national manners it is a happiness however that in general these vitiated scenes are removed from the eyes of the people and yet enough sometimes gets abroad to astonish those who happily live at a distance from them there is one day particularly on which the great and little world are in some degree on a level and one place in which they meet on an equal footing we have it ever to lament that so pleasing a harmony  an institution so delightfully calculated to insure benevolence by united devotion through the whole mass of the people should be so generally disregarded even the very political use of this sacred institution if it had no other were sufficient to enforce a general observance of it on all who have a love for public order but the great should consider farther that if they have no need of instruction  their inferiors at least have who are always ready on this and every occasion to show their betters how much they approve and value the bad examples they set them  let things however be wrong in what degree they will  let the great and little world unite in treating the simplicity that is in christ with what contempt they please it is still our part to do our best to preserve it and to keep the remains of religion as far as we can and as long as we can subsisting amongst us tho the whole head is sick and the heart faint and the physicians best skill can only palliate it is always something to go so far  our blessed savior calls the ministers of the gospel the salt of the earth it is a most expressive figure it shows not only that there will be great corruption in the earth but it shows farther that the ministers of the gospel are the means which god has appointed to oppose this corruption tho our influence cannot preserve the whole yet still it may preserve a part tho we may have no effect on the general bulk of mankind yet there may be many an individual whose honest heart we may retain in the simplicity of the gospel  we are not legislators and things would not go on better if we were the only means which we have to employ in this matter lie in two easy words our doctrine and our manners in both of which it should be our utmost endeavor to attain as far as we can and to impress upon others the simplicity that is in christ the former we must endeavor to preserve from the corruptions of worldly wisdom the latter from the corruptions of worldly fashions  to explain the word of god is certainly the most arduous business in which the reason of man can engage every explanation of the sacred text is in fact putting our own sense upon the words of scripture and when we consider the very supine ignorance of the generality of the common people who take their ideas of religion from what we tell them it is certainly a very awful thought and should make us endeavor to keep as close as possible to the simplicity that is in christ  it is in vain to attempt this without a thorough acquaintance with scripture which will always suggest such passages to the memory as on a comparison with the subject we are upon may direct us to the true scriptural sense  the lawyer is obliged to study with attention a number of books and to examine a variety of parallel cases before he can be qualified to act in his profession the physician is under the same necessity and is it not a mortifying consideration that because the common people are obliged to take our prescriptions just as we please to prescribe we should for that reason prescribe carelessly and without sufficiently consulting that book which alone will enable us to do it properly  some think the simplicity that is in christ consists in clothing their sentiments always in scripture phrase i see no more reason for this than for going about as the apostles did in sandals with a scrip and a staff modes of speech are just as much the fashion of times and countries as modes of dress and need be as little observed the scriptural mode of speech is highly figurative  very different from any mode now in use and requires translation as much as the original greek it is the scriptural idea not the scriptural mode of expression for which i am contending and this may be lost in many ways it may be narrowed to speak the opinions of a sect  or it may be widened to speak the opinions of the world  or it may be lost in morals when instead of preaching plainly and simply on gospelsubjects our discourses with scriptural mottoes affixed are short immethodical essays in which the beginning can hardly be distinguished from the end  nor indeed what is aimed at till the book is closed just as the audience may suppose the subject will open  there is another thing also which often occasions our erring from the simplicity which is in christ as the gospel is a covenant between god and man it touches of course on such things as relate to both as far as it relates to god it is no doubt a deep mysterious subject but as far as it relates to man nothing can be more simple and easy hence it is that our religion without any contradiction of terms peace be to all skeptical cavils is sometimes called the mystery of godliness and sometimes the simplicity of the gospel it is the mystery of godliness as it relates to gods part in this gracious plan and the simplicity of the gospel as it relates to us to the want of sufficient attention to this easy distinction perhaps arise not only many of the disputes and misconceptions and infusions of worldly wisdom which have so often disgraced the gospel but also much of that strange unaccountable confusion of ideas that perplexes and confounds the understanding of the lower people if the lost condition of man  his restoration and redemption by christ  the necessity of a holy life  the tendency of the gospel to make him happy both here and hereafter  and other plain points had generally been the subjects of popular discourses we should not have had now that gross ignorance in matters of religion and that variety of strange notions and prejudices to combat which we find amongst the common people on all religious subjects but especially on the sacrament of the lords supper as nothing is more difficult than to eradicate old prejudices nothing would have been more easy than to have prevented their getting ground at first the plain truths of the gospel might have descended just as easily as misconception and error  it should be our care then to accommodate our doctrine as much as we can to the simplicity that is in christ  not to dwell upon it is mysterious parts  not to enter into the inquiries how and why  nor to clog it with difficult or refined questions against which the apostle to timothy long ago took abundant pains to guard us but to preach it as we are directed with plainness  to lay the stress on it is obvious truths  and when we have occasion to mention a mysterious point one of those great points which relate to gods part in the covenant of grace rather than to mans to be very careful of going too far  to keep as close as possible to scripture lest we make a difficulty more difficult by endeavoring to explain what cannot be explained the less in general that is said on such points the better  one thing we should always remember and that is to adapt our discourses to the lower rather than the higher parts of our audience that we may like good ministers dispense that gospel whose peculiar characteristic it was to be preached to the poor  i shall close this head with the account which an ancient heathen of the fourth century gives of the mode of preaching the gospel in his day the christian philosophy says he is very simple it is principal concern is to regulate the manners of men and to infuse worthy notions of the deity obscure questions and nice arguments it avoids nor does it enter into the nature and foundation of virtue but exhorts in a general way to the practice of it which experience shows us is more effectual among the vulgar see lardners testimonies from alexander of lycopolis vol iv p      tho this honest heathen had not a complete idea of christianity he seems however to have had so good a notion of it that many christian pastors might take a lesson from him  our manners should be as simple as our doctrine  but you ask what is simplicity of manners it is a phrase of ambiguous meaning  let us not here again puzzle ourselves with definitions they who seek for close definitions on these subjects i should fear seek rather for evasion than information the scriptures have little to do with definitions on these subjects they speak to the heart more than to the head whoever reads with a desire to learn the instructions which our savior and his apostles give to the ministers of the gospel will soon feel  unless indeed it be a point which he wishes to overlook  not only in what the simplicity of our manners should consist  but also that it should be our first and most indispensible care  and the reason of the thing as we are preachers of the gospel is plain because the simplicity of our manners must give force to what we say it is not every body with his best endeavor who can get hold of the properest method of communicating his ideas or can practice that mode of application in his discourses either publicly or privately which may have the best effect upon the people but simplicity of manners is a mode of preaching which makes up many defects  it is adapted to every capacity  every body understands it and it adds a dignity and consequence even to a discourse of less weight tho the common people are no good reasoners there is however one mode of reasoning at which they are very ready  that of inferring doctrine from manners and they will not only make the latter a test of the former but they will in general pay more attention to it likewise  when the city of antioch was disposed to receive the gospel and the apostle barnabas was sent from jerusalem to promote the good work which was there carrying on the people seem to have been particularly influenced by his holy life for he was a good man says the apostolical historian and full of the holy ghost and of faith  and much people was added unto the lord  on the other hand the purest doctrine will lose it is effect among the common people at least in proportion as they see their minister pay less attention to it himself that apostolical apostrophe thou that preachest to others teach thou not thyself will ever be the language of popular contempt  there is another kind of contempt also which every consistent man would particularly wish to avoid  and that is his own contempt of himself what must that mans feelings be whose life is spent in a continued variance with those truths which he is obliged to preach who must tell his hearers of governing their undue affections and yet lets his own loose in all the vanities of a dissipated age who must talk of the world as a pilgrimage while every action of his life shows it to be his carnal home who is obliged to preach the glories of a future state and the joys of heaven while his own happiness is plainly centered in worldly ambition and worldly attentions  contempt abroad may be borne if a man feel from the uprightness of his own heart that he does not deserve it but there is no refuge from contempt within  unless a man is past feeling and sets at defiance the remonstrances even of common decency  how far the minister of the gospel should keep at a distance from the world  from it is ambitious views  it is interests  and it is partycontentions  how far he should stand aloof from it is pleasures and abstain from many amusements which tho perhaps innocent in themselves may at least when countenanced by him have a tendency to break down the fences of religion are questions  not proper indeed for me to determine but very proper for every churchman to examine seriously in his own conscience it is becoming surely that the ministers of a religion which so entirely disclaims the world should endeavor at least not to be much entangled in it a morose character is not the alternative cheerfulness is the natural companion of religion sourness is an alien intruder amusements too are necessary but i am not singular in thinking those amusements should rather be of the retired kind than sought for amidst the noise and bustle of the world riot and excess generally attend the amusements of a number of people assembled with a purpose of being joyous and what none would do alone is not scrupled perhaps where the impropriety which by the way deserves often a severer name is divided among a multitude in scenes like these the clerical habit is a blot the clerical character a still greater i would not be thought harsh i would not be thought uncomplying the world i know is often shocked at hearing the precepts of the gospel opposed in all their plainness to the elegant fashions which it adopts and we are sometimes almost afraid in our popular discourses of opening gospel truths so fully as we might lest by saying more than the times will bear we should injure a cause which we wish to advance our blessed lord himself was often obliged to speak in parables but let the world if it please be the deaf adder which stops it is ears there need be no apology surely for recommending gospel truths in the plainest manner to the ministers of the gospel  but the clerical character may be a check upon improprieties  i should fear not much as we have the example however of our blessed lord who kept company with publicans and sinners with a view to reform them nothing farther can be said if this be the real motive tho to me it appears risking more than the probability of advantage will insure  after all my brethren it may be an easy matter in an age of license to satisfy ourselves  if we make the comparison only with others but i hope this is a kind of satisfaction and a kind of comparison in which none of us would willingly acquiesce we talk of sectaries and novel teachers and cry the people have itching ears would to god no blame in this matter may rest upon ourselves to speak with truth and candor there does not seem in general to be so much simplicity and propriety of manners amongst us as there appears to be amongst several of our dissenting brethren  but propriety of manners is the dissenters chief support it is his worldly engine and therefore his motives may be as worldly as ours  they may or may not be for any thing we know we have nothing to do with any motives but our own it concerns us more to consider whether certain truths lie not nearer home whether the established churchman declines the heat of the day because his wages are double whether he spend his superfluity on the vanities of life because those wages are abundant  or whether his manners are more lax because those wages are more certain  the harvest truly is plenteous but the laborers are few was a complaint of great authority in very early days  things are not mended i should suppose now it is inconceivable how wrong the spiritual affairs of a parish get in a little time habits of vice and inattention to every thing serious make a quick progress a few careless pastors succeeding each other leave a parish in a state of heathenism and it must be a work of time and labor  of length of time of accumulated labor to recover it from it is supineness a generation may be lost and no hope left but in a rising one  whereas if the care of one minister succeeded to that of another each uniting simplicity of doctrine with simplicity of manners in a few years a great change might be wrought  thus my brethren i have given you my thoughts on a subject  not very recondite indeed but very interesting it is a serious business  a business too in which we have all voluntarily engaged we have all put our hands to the plough  and we know the consequence of looking back let us then cheerfully proceed evermore uniting our prayers with our endeavors that god would of his infinite mercy grant we may both by our preaching and living set forth his holy word and show it accordingly  finis errata end of page    instead of but himself also read but even himself  end of page    tho the first epistle of st peter
