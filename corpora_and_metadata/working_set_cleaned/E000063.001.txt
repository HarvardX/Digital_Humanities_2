an essay on the first principles of government and on the nature of political civil and religious liberty including remarks on dr browns code of education and on dr balguys sermon on church authority the second edition corrected and enlarged by joseph priestley lld frs london printed for j johnson no    in st pauls churchyard mdcc lxxi iv to the right honourable david earl of buchan this essay c is with the greatest respect inscribed by his lordships most obedient humble servant joseph priestley v the preface this publication owes its rise to the remarks i wrote on dr browns proposal for a code of education several persons who were pleased to think favourably of that performance in which i was led to mention the subject of civil and religious liberty were desirous that i should treat of it more at large and without any immediate view to the doctors work it appeared to them that some of the views i had given of this important but difficult subject were new and showed it in a clearer light than any in which they had seen it represented before and they thought i had placed the foundation of some of the most valuable interests of mankind on a broader and firmer basis than mr locke and others who had formerly written upon this subject i have endeavoured to answer the wishes of my friends in vi the best manner i am able and at the same time i have retained the substance of the former treatise having distributed the several parts of it into the body of this in this second edition i have also introduced what i had written on churchauthority in answer to dr balguys sermon on that subject preached at lambeth chapel and published by order of the archbishop as i do not mean to republish either the remarks on dr brown on these on dr balguy separately and the subjects of both those pieces have a near relation to the general one on civil and religious liberty i thought there would be a propriety in throwing them into one treatise i had no thoughts of animadverting upon dr warburton in this work till i was informed by some intelligent and worthy clergymen of my acquaintance that his alliance is generally considered as the best defence of the present system vii of churchauthority and that most other writers took their arguments from it in a postscript to this work he informs us p     that in it the reader will see confuted at large what he calls a puritanical principle and also an absurd assertion of hookers by which he entangled himself and his cause in inextricable difficulties viz that civil and ecclesiastical power are things separated by nature and more especially by divine institution and so independent of one another that they must always continue independent whatever success this writer may have had in pulling up other foundations i think he had better have left those of the church as he found them for the difficulties in which the scheme of the alliance is entangled appear to me to be far more inextricable than those of any other scheme of churchauthority that i have yet seen all that can be said in its favour is that having less of the simplicity of truth and consequently being supported with more art and sophistry the absurdity of it is not so obvious at first sight though it be viii ten times more glaring after it has been sufficiently attended to sorry i am to be under the necessity of troubling my reader with the repetition of any thing that has been said before on this subject in my remarks on those writers but when the same arguments are urged again and again it is impossible always to find new or better answers i flatter myself however that several of the observations in this treatise will appear to be new at least that some things will appear to be set in a new or clearer point of light but whenever the interests of truth and liberty are attacked it is to be wished that some would stand up in their defence whether they acquit themselves better than their predecessors in the same good old cause or not new books in defence of any principles whatever will be read by many persons who will not look into old books for the proper answers to them considerable advantage cannot but accrue to the cause of religious as well as ix civil liberty from keeping the important subject continually in view we are under great obligation therefore to all the advocates for churchauthority whenever they are pleased to write in its defence every attempt that has hitherto been made to shake or undermine the foundations of the christian faith hath ended in the firmer establishment of it also every attempt to support the unjust claims of churchmen over their fellow christians hath been equally impotent and hath recoiled upon themselves and i make no doubt that this will be the issue of all the future efforts of interested or misguided men in so weak and unworthy a cause it will be seen that i have taken no notice of any thing that has been written in the controversy about the confessional i would only observe and i cannot help observing that the violent opposition that has been made to the modest attempts both of the candid disquisitors x and those of the author of the confessional and his respectable friends to procure a redress of only a few of the more intolerable grievances the clergy labour under and a removal of some of the most obvious and capital defects in the established church has more weight than a hundred arguments drawn from theory only in demonstrating the folly of erecting such complicated and unwieldly systems of policy and in showing the mischiefs that attend them little did the founders of church establishments consider of what unspeakable importance it is to the interests of religion that the ambition of christian ministers be circumscribed within narrow limits when they left them such unbounded scope for courting preferment but the interests of religion have been very little considered by the founders of church establishments indeed if they had considered them how little were they qualified to make provision for them i need not say what i feel when i find so much in the writings xi of ingenious men concerning the wisdom of these constitutions it always brings to my mind what st paul says of the wisdom of this world in other respects such however is the virtue of some men that it is proof against all the bad influence of the constitution of which they are members without flattering or tormenting themselves with a vain ambition many excellent clergymen worthy of a better situation contentedly sit down to the proper duty of their station their only object is to do good to the souls of men and their only hope of reward is in that world where they who have been wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they who have turned many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever such characters as these i truly revere and it is chiefly for the sake of forming more such that i wish the establishment of the church of england might be reformed in some essential points the powers of reason and conscience plead for such a reformation but alas the powers of this world are against xii it this unnatural ally of religion or rather her imperious master without whose permission nothing can be done will not admit of it but at the same time that from a love of truth and a just regard for the purity of a divine religion we bear a public testimony against those abuses which men have introduced into it let us as becomes christians have the candour to make proper allowances for the prejudices and prepossessions even of the founders promoters and abettors of these antichristian systems and still farther let us be from indulging a thought to the prejudice of those who have been educated in a reverence for these modes of religion and have not strength of mind to separate their ideas of these forms from those of the power of it in this case let us be particularly careful how we give offence to any serious and welldisposed minds and patiently bear with the wheat and the tares growing together till the harvest xiii such is my belief in the doctrine of an overruling providence that i have no doubt but that every thing in the whole system of nature how noxious soever it may be in some respects has real though unknown uses and also that every thing even the grossest abuses in the civil or ecclesiastical constitutions of particular states is subservient to the wise and gracious designs of him who notwithstanding these appearances still rules in the kingdoms of men i make no apology for the freedom with which i have written the subject is in the highest degree interesting to humanity it is open to philosophical discussion and i have taken no greater liberties than becomes a philosopher a man and an englishman having no other views than to promote a thorough knowledge of this important subject not being sensible of any biass to mislead me in my inquiries and conscious of the uprightness of my intentions i freely submit my thoughts to the examination of all impartial judges and the xiv friends of their country and of mankind they who know the fervour of generous feelings will be sensible that i have expressed myself with no more warmth than the importance of the subject necessarily prompted in a breast not naturally the coldest and that to have appeared more indifferent i could not have been sincere besides the freedom with which i have made this defence of civil and religious liberty is sufficiently justified by the freedom with which they have been attacked and though the advocates for church power are very ready to accuse the dissenters of indecency when in defending themselves they reflect upon the established church yet i do not see why in a judgment of equity the same civility and decency should not be observed on both sides or why insolence on one side should not be answered by contempt on the other notwithstanding the ardour of mind with which it will be evident some parts of the following treatise were xv written the warmth with which i have espoused the cause of liberty and the severity with which i have animadverted upon whatever i apprehend to be unfavourable to it i think i cannot be justly accused of party zeal because it will be found that i have treated all parties with equal freedom indeed such is the usual violence of human passions when any thing interesting to them is contended for that the best cause in the world is not sufficient to prevent intemperance and excess so that it is easy to see too much to blame in all parties and it by no means follows that because a man disapproves of the conduct of one that he must therefore approve of that of its opposite the greatest enemy of popery may see something he dislikes in the conduct of the first reformers the warmest zeal against episcopacy is consistent with the just sense of the faults of the puritans and much more may an enemy of charles the first be an enemy of cromwell also xvi n b let it be observed that in this treatise i propose no more than to consider the first principles of civil and religious liberty and to explain some leading ideas upon the subject for a more extensive view of it as affecting a greater variety of particulars in the system of government i refer to the course of lectures on history and civil policy a syllabus of which is printed in the essay on a course of liberal education for civil and active life and the whole of which with enlargements i propose to publish in due time   section i of the first principles of government and the different kinds of liberty man derives two capital advantages from the superiority of his intellectual powers the first is that as an individual he possesses a certain comprehension of mind whereby he contemplates and enjoys the past and the future as well as the present this comprehension is enlarged with the experience of every day and by this means the happiness of man as he advances in intellect is continually less dependent on temporary circumstances and sensations the next advantage resulting from the same principle and which is in many respects both the cause and effect of the   former is that the human species itself is capable of a similar and unbounded improvement whereby mankind in a later age are greatly superior to mankind in a former age the individuals being taken at the same time of life of this progress of the species brute animals are more incapable than they are of that relating to individuals no horse of this age seems to have any advantage over other horses of former ages and if there be any improvement in the species it is owing to our manner of breeding and training them but a man at this time who has been tolerably well educated in an improved christian country is a being possessed of much greater power to be and to make happy than a person of the same age in the same or any other country some centuries ago and for this reason i make no doubt that a person some centuries hence will at the same age be as much superior to us the great instrument in the hand of divine providence of this progress of the   species towards perfection is society and consequently government in a state of nature the powers of any individual are dissipated by an attention to a multiplicity of objects the employments of all are similar from generation to generation every man does the same that every other does or has done and no person begins where another ends at least general improvements are exceedingly slow and uncertain this we see exemplified in all barbarous nations and especially in countries thinly inhabited where the connections of the people are slight and consequently society and government very imperfect and it may be seen more particularly in north america and greenland whereas a state of more perfect society admits of a proper distribution and division of the objects of human attention in such a state men are connected with and subservient to one another so that while one man confines himself to one single object another may give the same undivided attention to another object   thus the powers of all have their full effect and hence arise improvements in all the conveniences of life and in every branch of knowledge in this state of things it requires but a few years to comprehend the whole preceding progress of any one art or science and the rest of a mans life in which his faculties are the most perfect may be given to the extension of it if by this means one art or science should grow too large for an easy comprehension in a moderate space of time a commodious subdivision will be made thus all knowledge will be subdivided and extended and knowledge as lord bacon observes being power the human powers will in fact be enlarged nature including both its materials and its laws will be more at our command men will make their situation in this world abundantly more easy and comfortable they will probably prolong their existence in it and will grow daily more happy each in himself and more able and i believe more disposed to communicate happiness to others thus whatever was the beginning   of this world the end will be glorious and paradisaical beyond what our imaginations can now conceive extravagant as some may suppose these views to be i think i could show them to be fairly suggested by the true theory of human nature and to arise from the natural course of human affairs but for the present i wave this subject the contemplation of which always makes me happy government being the great instrument of this progress of the human species towards this glorious state that form of government will have a just claim to our approbation which favours this progress and that must be condemned in which it is retarded let us then my fellow citizens consider the business of government with these enlarged views and trace some of the fundamental principles of it by an attention to what is most conducive to the happiness of mankind at present and most favourable to the increase of this happiness in futurity and perhaps we may understand this intricate subject with   some of its most important circumstances better than we have done at least we may see some of them in a clearer and stronger point of light to begin with first principles we must for the sake of gaining clear ideas on the subject do what almost all political writers have done before us that is we must suppose a number of people existing who experience the inconvenience of living independent and unconnected who are exposed without redress to insults and wrongs of every kind and are too weak to procure themselves many of the advantages which they are sensible might easily be compassed by united strength these people if they would engage the protection of the whole body and join their force in enterprizes and undertakings calculated for their common good must voluntarily resign some part of their natural liberty and submit their conduct to the direction of the community for without these concessions such an alliance attended with such advantages could not be formed   were these people few in number and living within a small distance of one another it might be easy for them to assemble upon every occasion in which the whole body was concerned and every thing might be determined by the votes of the majority provided they had previously agreed that the votes of a majority should be decisive but were the society numerous their habitations remote and the occasions on which the whole body must interpose frequent it would be absolutely impossible that all the members of the state should assemble or give their attention to public business in this case though with rousseau it be a giving up of their liberty there must be deputies or public officers appointed to act in the name of the whole body and in a state of very great extent where all the people could never be assembled the whole power of the community must necessarily and almost irreversibly be lodged in the hands of these deputies in england the king the hereditary lords and the electors of the house of commons are these standing deputies and   the members of the house of commons are again the temporary deputies of this last order of the state in all states great or small the sentiments of that body of men in whose hands the supreme power of the society is lodged must be understood to be the sentiments of the whole body if there be no other method in which the sentiments of the whole body can be expressed these deputies or representatives of the people will make a wrong judgment and pursue wrong measures if they consult not the good of the whole society whose representatives they are just as the people themselves would make a wrong judgment and pursue wrong measures if they did not consult their own good provided they could be assembled for that purpose no maxims or rules of policy can be binding upon them but such as they themselves shall judge to be conducive to the public good their own reason and conscience are their only guide and the people in whose name they act their only judge   in these circumstances if i be asked what i mean by liberty i should chuse for the sake of greater clearness to divide it into two kinds political and civil and the importance of having clear ideas on this subject will be my apology for the innovation political liberty i would say consists in the power which the members of the state reserve to themselves of arriving at the public offices or at least of having votes in the nomination of those who fill them and i would chuse to call civil liberty that power over their own actions which the members of the state reserve to themselves and which their officers must not infringe political liberty therefore is equivalent to the right of magistracy being the claim that any member of the state hath to have his private opinion or judgment become that of the public and thereby control the actions of others whereas civil liberty extends no farther than to a mans own conduct and signifies the right he has to be exempt from the control of the society or its agents that  0 is the power he has of providing for his own advantage and happiness it is a mans civil liberty which is originally in its full force and part of which he sacrifices when he enters into a state of society and political liberty is that which he may or may not acquire in the compensation he receives for it for he may either stipulate to have a voice in the public determinations or as far as the public determination doth take place he may submit to be governed wholly by others of these two kinds of liberty which it is of the greatest importance to distinguish i shall treat in the order in which i have mentioned them    section ii of political liberty in countries where every member of the society enjoys an equal power of arriving at the supreme offices and consequently of directing the strength and the sentiments of the whole community there is a state of the most perfect political liberty on the other hand in countries where a man is by his birth or fortune excluded from these offices or from a power of voting for proper persons to fill them that man whatever be the form of the government or whatever civil liberty or power over his own actions he may have has no power over those of another he has no share in the government and therefore has no political liberty at all    nay his own conduct as far as the society does interfere is in all cases directed by others it may be said that no society on earth was ever formed in the manner represented above i answer it is true because all governments whatever have been in some measure compulsory tyrannical and oppressive in their origin but the method i have described must be allowed to be the only equitable and fair method of forming a society and since every man retains and can never be deprived of his natural right founded on a regard to the general good of relieving himself from all oppression that is from every thing that has been imposed upon him without his own consent this must be the only true and proper foundation of all the governments subsisting in the world and that to which the people who compose them have an unalienable right to bring them back it must necessarily be understood therefore whether it be expressed or    not that all people live in society for their mutual advantage so that the good and happiness of the members that is the majority of the members of any state is the great standard by which every thing relating to that state must finally be determined and though it may be supposed that a body of people may be bound by a voluntary resignation of all their interests to a single person or to a few it can never be supposed that the resignation is obligatory on their posterity because it is manifestly contrary to the good of the whole that it should be so i own it is rather matter of surprise to me that this great object of all government should have been so little insisted on by our great writers who have treated of this subject and that more use hath not been made of it in treating of particular regulations in states this principle necessarily obtruded itself all arguments in favour of any law being always drawn from a consideration of its tendency to promote the public good    and yet it has often escaped the notice of writers in discoursing on the first principles of society and the subject of civil and religious liberty this one general idea properly pursued throws the greatest light upon the whole system of policy morals and i may add theology too to a mind not warped by theological and metaphysical subtilties the divine being appears to be actuated by no other views than the noblest we can conceive the happiness of his creatures virtue and right conduct consist in those affections and actions which terminate in the public good justice and veracity for instance having nothing intrinsically excellent in them separate from their relation to the happiness of mankind and the whole system of right to power property and every thing else in society must be regulated by the same consideration the decisive question when any of these subjects are examined being what is it that the good of the community requires    let it be observed in this place that i by no means assert that the good of mankind requires a state of the most perfect political liberty this indeed is not possible except in exceeding small states in none perhaps that are so large as even the republics of ancient greece or as genoa or geneva in modern times such small republics as these if they were desirable would be impracticable because a state of perfect equality in communities or individuals can never be preserved while some are more powerful more enterprising and more successful in their attempts than others and an ambitious nation could not wish for a fairer opportunity of arriving at extensive empire than to find the neighbouring countries cantoned out into a number of small governments which could have no power to withstand it singly and which could never form sufficiently extensive confederacies or act with sufficient unanimity and expedition to oppose it with success    supposing therefore that in order to prevent the greatest of all inconveniences very extensive and consequently absolute monarchies it may be expedient to have such states as england france and spain political liberty must in some measure be restrained but in what manner a restraint should be put upon it or how far it should extend is not easy to be ascertained in general it should seem that none but persons of considerable fortune should be capable of arriving at the highest offices in the government not only because all other circumstances being equal such persons will generally have had the best education and consequently be the best qualified to act for the public good but because also they will necessarily have the most property at stake and will therefore be most interested in the fate of their country let it be observed however that what may be called a moderate fortune though a thing of so variable a nature cannot be defined should be considered as equivalent    in this respect to the most affluent one persons who are born to a moderate fortune are indeed generally better educated have consequently more enlarged minds and are in all respects more truly independent than those who are born to great opulence for the same reason it may perhaps be more eligible that those who are extremely dependent should not be allowed to have votes in the nomination of the chief magistrates because this might in some instances be only throwing more votes into the hands of those persons on whom they depend but if in every state of considerable extent we suppose a gradation of elective offices and if we likewise suppose the lowest classes of the people to have votes in the nomination of the lowest officers and as they increase in wealth and importance to have a share in the choice of persons to fill the higher posts till they themselves be admitted candidates for places of public trust we shall perhaps form an idea of as much political liberty    as is consistent with the state of mankind and i think experience shews that the highest offices of all equivalent to that of king ought to be in some measure hereditary as in england elective monarchies having generally been the theatres of cabal confusion and misery it must be acknowledged however to be exceedingly hazardous to the liberties of a people to have any office of importance frequently filled by the same persons or their descendants the boundaries of very great power can never be so exactly defined but that when it becomes the interest of men to extend them and when so flattering an object is kept a long time in view opportunities will be found for the purpose what nation would not have been enslaved by the uncontroverted succession of only three such princes as henry iv of france henry vii of england or the present king of prussia the more accomplished and glorious they were as warriors or statesmen the more dangerous would they    be as princes in free states it is nothing but the continual fear of a revolt in favour of some rival that could keep such princes within any bounds i e that could make it their interest to court the favour of the people hereditary nobles stand in the same predicament with hereditary princes the long continuance of the same parliaments have also the same tendency and had not these things together with an independent ecclesiastical power been wonderfully balanced in our constitution it could never have stood so long the more complex any machine is and the more nicely it is fitted to answer its purpose the more liable it is to disorder the more avenues there are to arbitrary power the more attention it requires to guard them and with all the vigilance of the people of these nations they have more than once been obliged to have recourse to the sword the liberties we now enjoy precarious as they are have not been purchased without blood though it be very evident that no office  0 of great trust and power should be suffered to continue a long time in the same hands the succession might be so rapid that the remedy would be worse than the disease with respect to this nation it seems to be agreed that septennial parliaments have brought our liberties into very eminent hazard and that triennial if not annual parliaments would be better indeed septennial parliaments were at first a direct usurpation of the rights of the people for by the same authority that one parliament prolonged their own power to seven years they might have continued it to twice seven or like the parliament in      have made it perpetual the bulk of the people never see the most obvious tendencies of things or so flagrant a violation of the constitution would never have been suffered but whereas a general clamour might have prevented the evil it may require something more to redress it but though the exact medium of political liberty with respect either to the    property of men in offices of trust or to their continuance in power be not easily fixed it is not of much consequence to do it since a considerable degree of perfection in government will admit of great varieties in this respect and the extreme of political slavery which excludes all persons except one or a very few from having access to the chief magistracy or from having votes in the choice of magistrates and which keeps all the power of the state in the same hands or the same families is easily marked out and the fatal effects of it are very striking for such is the state of mankind that persons possessed of unbounded power will generally act as if they forgot the proper nature and design of their station and pursue their own interest though it be opposite to that of the community at large provided those who make laws submit to them themselves and with respect to taxes in particular so long as those who impose them bear an equal share with the rest of the community there    will be no complaint but in all cases when those who lay the tax upon others exempt themselves there is tyranny and the man who submits to a tax of a penny levied in this manner is liable to have the last penny he has extorted from him men of equal rank and fortune with those who usually compose the english house of commons have nothing to fear from the imposition of taxes so long as there is any thing like rotation in that office because those who impose them are liable to pay them themselves and are no better able to bear the burden but persons of lower rank and especially those who have no votes in the election of members may have reason to fear because an unequal part of the burden may be laid upon them they are necessarily a distinct order in the community and have no direct method of controling the measures of the legislature our increasing gamelaws have all the appearance of the haughty decrees of a tyrant who sacrifices every thing to his own pleasure and caprice    upon these principles it is evident that there must have been a gross inattention to the very first principles of liberty to say nothing worse in the first scheme of taxing the inhabitants of america in the british parliament but if there be any truth in the principles above laid down it must be a fundamental maxim in all governments that if any man hold what is called a high rank or enjoy privileges and prerogatives in a state it is because the good of the state requires that he should hold that rank or enjoy those privileges and such persons whether they be called kings senators or nobles or by whatever names or titles they be distinguished are to all intents and purposes the servants of the public and accountable to the people for the discharge of their respective offices if such magistrates abuse their trust in the people therefore lies the right of deposing and consequently of punishing them and the only reason why abuses    which have crept into offices have been connived at is that the correcting of them by having recourse to first principles and the people taking into their own hands their right to appoint or change their officers and to ascertain the bounds of their authority is far from being easy except in small states so that the remedy would often be worse than the disease but in the largest states if the abuses of government should at any time be great and manifest if the servants of the people forgetting their masters and their masters interest should pursue a separate one of their own if instead of considering that they are made for the people they should consider the people as made for them if the oppressions and violations of right should be great flagrant and universally resented if the tyrannical governors should have no friends but a few sycophants who had long preyed upon the vitals of their fellow citizens and who might be expected to desert a government    whenever their interests should be detached from it if in consequence of these circumstances it should become manifest that the risque which would be run in attempting a revolution would be trifling and the evils which might be apprehended from it were far less than those which were actually suffered and which were daily increasing in the name of god i ask what principles are those which ought to restrain an injured and insulted people from asserting their natural rights and from changing or even punishing their governors that is their servants who had abused their trust or from altering the whole form of their government if it appeared to be of a structure so liable to abuse to say that these forms of government have been long established and that these oppressions have been long suffered without any complaint is to supply the strongest argument for their abolition lawyers who are governed by rules and precedents are very apt to    fall into mistakes in determining what is right and lawful in cases which are in their own nature prior to any fixed laws or precedents the only reason for the authority of precedents and general rules in matters of law and government is that all persons may know what is law which they could not do if the administration of it was not uniform and the same in similar cases but if the precedents and general rules themselves be a greater grievance than the violation of them and the establishment of better precedents and better general rules what becomes of their obligation the necessity of the thing in the changing course of human affairs obliges all governments to alter their general rules and to set up new precedents in affairs of less importance and why may not a proportionably greater necessity plead as strongly for the alteration of the most general rules and for setting up new precedents in matters of the greatest consequence affecting the most fundamental principles of any government and the distribution of power among its several members    nothing can more justly excite the indignation of an honest and oppressed citizen than to hear a prelate who enjoys a considerable benefice under a corrupt government pleading for its support by those abominable perversions of scripture which have been too common on this occasion as by urging in its favour that passage of st paul the powers which be are ordained of god and others of a similar import it is a sufficient answer to such an absurd quotation as this that for the same reason the powers which will be will be ordained of god also something indeed might have been said in favour of the doctrines of passive obedience and nonresistance at the time when they were first started but a man must be infatuated who will not renounce them now the jesuits about two centuries ago in order to vindicate their kingkilling principles happened among other arguments to make use of this great and just principle that all civil power is    ultimately derived from the people and their adversaries in england and elsewhere instead of shewing how they abused and perverted that fundamental principle of all government in the case in question did what disputants warmed with controversy are very apt to do they denied the principle itself and maintained that all civil power is derived from god as if the jewish theocracy had been established throughout the whole world from this maxim it was a clear consequence that the governments which at any time subsist being the ordinance of god and the kings which are at any time upon the throne being the vicegerents of god must not be opposed so long as there were recent examples of good kings deposed and some of them massacred by wild enthusiasts some indulgence might be allowed to those warm but weak friends of society who would lay hold of any principle which however ill founded would supply an argument for more effectually preserving the public peace but to maintain the    same absurd principles at this day when the danger from which they served to shelter us is over and the heat of controversy is abated shews the strongest and most blameable prepossession writers in defence of them do not deserve a seririous answer and to alledge those principles in favour of a corrupt government which nothing can excuse but their being brought in favour of a good one is unpardonable the history of this controversy about the doctrine of passive obedience and nonresistance affords a striking example of the danger of having recourse to false principles in controversy they may serve a particular turn but in other cases may be capable of the most dangerous application whereas universal truth will in all possible cases have the best consequences and be ever favourable to the true interests of mankind it will be said that it is opening a door to rebellion to assert that magistrates abusing their power may be set aside by  0 the people who are of course their own judges when that power is abused may not the people it is said abuse their power as well as their governors i answer it is very possible they may abuse their power it is possible they may imagine themselves oppressed when they are not it is possible that their animosity may be artfully and unreasonably inflamed by ambitious and enterprising men whose views are often best answered by popular tumults and insurrections and the people may suffer in consequence of their folly and precipitancy but what man is there or what body of men whose right to direct their own conduct was never called in question but are liable to be imposed upon and to suffer in consequence of their mistaken apprehensions and precipitate conduct with respect to large societies it is very improbable that the people should be too soon alarmed so as to be driven to these extremities in such cases the power of the government that is of the governors must be very extensive    and arbitrary and the power of the people scattered and difficult to be united so that if a man have common sense he will see it to be madness to propose or to lay any measures for a general insurrection against the government except in case of very general and great oppression even patriots in such circumstances will consider that present evils always appear greater in consequence of their being present but that the future evils of a revolt and a temporary anarchy may be much greater than are apprehended at a distance they will also consider that unless their measures be perfectly well laid and their success decisive ending in a change not of men but of things not of governors but of the rules and administration of government they will only rivet their chains the faster and bring upon themselves and their country tenfold ruin so obvious are these difficulties that lie in the way of procuring redress of grievances by force of arms that i think we may say without exception that in    all cases of hostile opposition to government the people must have been in the right and that nothing but very great oppression could drive them to such desperate measures the bulk of a people seldom so much as complain without reason because they never think of complaining till they feel so that in all cases of dissatisfaction with government it is most probable that the people are injured the case i own may be otherwise in states of small extent where the power of the governors is comparatively small and the power of the people great and soon united these fears therefore may be prudent in venice in genoa or in the small cantons of switzerland but it were to the last degree absurd to extend them to greatbritain the english history will inform us that the people of this country have always borne extreme oppression for a long time before there has appeared any danger of a general insurrection against    the government what a series of encroachments upon their rights did even the feudal barons whose number was not very considerable and whose power was great bear from william the conqueror and his successors before they broke out into actual rebellion on that account as in the reigns of king john and henry the third and how much were the lowest orders of the poor commons trampled upon with impunity by both till a much later period when all the while they were so far from attempting any resistance or even complaining of the gross infringements of their rights that they had not so much as the idea of their having any rights to be trampled upon after the people had begun to acquire property independence and an idea of their natural rights how long did they bear a load of old and new oppressions under the tudors but more especially under the stuarts before they broke out into what the friends of arbitrary power affect to call the grand rebellion and how great did that obstinate civil war show the power of the    king to be notwithstanding the most intolerable and wanton abuse of it at the close of the year      it was more probable that the king would have prevailed than the parliament and his success would have been certain if his conduct had not been as weak as it was wicked so great was the power of the crown that after the restoration charles the second was tempted to act the same part with his father and actually did it in a great measure with impunity till at last he was even able to reign without parliaments and if he had lived much longer he would in all probability have been as arbitrary as the king of france his brother james the second had almost subverted both the civil and religious liberties of his country in the short space of four years and might have done it completely if he could have been content to have proceeded with more caution nay he might have succeeded notwithstanding his precipitancy if the divine being had not at    that critical time raised up william the third of glorious memory for our deliverance but god be thanked the government of this country is now fixed upon so good and firm a basis and is so generally acquiesced in that they are only the mere tools of a court party or the narrow minded bigots among the inferior clergy who to serve their own low purposes do now and then promote the cry that the church or the state is in danger as to what is called the crime of rebellion we have nothing to do either with the name or the thing in the case before us that term if it admit of any definition is an attempt to subvert a lawful government but the question is whether an oppressive government though it have been ever so long established can be a lawful one or to cut off all dispute about words if lawful legal and constitutional be maintained to be the same thing whether the lawful legal and constitutional government be a good government or one in    which sufficient provision is made for the happiness of the subjects of it if it fail in this essential character respecting the true end and object of all civil government no other property or title with which it may be dignified ought to shelter it from the generous attack of the noble and daring patriot if the bold attempt be precipitate and unsuccessful the tyrannical government will be sure to term it rebellion but that censure cannot make the thing itself less glorious the memory of such brave though unsuccessful and unfortunate friends of liberty and of the rights of mankind as that of harmodius and aristogiton among the athenians and russel and sidney in our own country will be had in everlasting honour by their grateful fellow citizens and history will speak another language than laws if it be asked how far a people may lawfully go in punishing their chief magistrates i answer that if the enormity of the offence which is of the same extent as the injury done to the public    be considered any punishment is justifiable that a man can incur in human society it may be said there are no laws to punish those governors and we must not condemn persons by laws made ex post facto for this conduct will vindicate the most obnoxious measures of the most tyrannical administration but i answer that this is a case in its own nature prior to the establishment of any laws whatever as it affects the very being of society and defeats the principal ends for which recourse was originally had to it there may be no fixed law against an open invader who should attempt to seize upon a country with a view to enslave all its inhabitants but must not the invader be apprehended and even put to death though he have broken no express law then in being or none of which he was properly apprized and why should a man who takes the advantage of his being king or governor to subvert the laws and liberties of his country be considered in any other light than that of a foreign invader nay his crime is much more atrocious    as he was appointed the guardian of the laws and liberties which he subverts and which he was therefore under the strongest obligation to maintain in a case therefore of this highly criminal nature salus populi suprema est lex that must be done which the good of the whole requires and generally kings deposed banished or imprisoned are highly dangerous to a nation because let them have governed ever so ill it will be the interest of some to be their partisans and to attach themselves to their cause it will be supposed that these observations have a reference to what passed in england in the year      let it be supposed surely a man and an englishman may be at liberty to give his opinion freely and without disguise concerning a transaction of so old a date charles the first whatever he was in his private character which is out of the question here was certainly a very bad king of england during a course of    many years and notwithstanding repeated remonstrances he governed by maxims utterly subversive of the fundamental and free constitution of this country and therefore he deserved the severest punishment if he was misled by his education or his friends he was like any other criminal in the same circumstances to be pitied but by no means to be spared on that account from the nature of things it was necessary that the opposition should begin from a few who may therefore be stiled a faction but after the civil war which necessarily ensued from the kings obstinacy and in which he had given repeated instances of dissimulation and treachery there was evidently no safety either for the faction or the nation short of his death it is to be regretted that the situation of things was such that the sentence could not be passed by the whole nation or their representatives solemnly assembled for that purpose i am sensible indeed that the generality of the nation  0 at that time would not have voted the death of their sovereign but this was not owing to any want of a just sense of the wrongs he had done them but to an opinion of the sacredness of kingly power from which very few of the friends of liberty in those times especially among the presbyterians who were the majority could intirely divest themselves such a transaction would have been an immortal honour to this country whenever that superstitious notion shall be obliterated a notion which has been extremely useful in the infant state of societies but which like other superstitions subsists long after it hath ceased to be of use the sum of what hath been advanced upon this head is a maxim than which nothing is more true that every government in its original principles and antecedent to its present form is an equal republic and consequently that every man when he comes to be sensible of his natural rights and to feel his own importance will consider himself as fully equal    to any other person whatever the consideration of riches and power however acquired must be entirely set aside when we come to these first principles the very idea of property or right of any kind is founded upon a regard to the general good of the society under whose protection it is enjoyed and nothing is properly a mans own but what general rules which have for their object the good of the whole give to him to whomsoever the society delegates its power it is delegated to them for the more easy management of public affairs and in order to make the more effectual provision for the happiness of the whole whoever enjoys property or riches in the state enjoys them for the good of the state as well as for himself and whenever those powers riches or rights of any kind are abused to the injury of the whole that awful and ultimate tribunal in which every citizen hath an equal voice may demand the resignation of them and in circumstances where regular commissions from this abused public cannot be had every man who    has power and who is actuated with the sentiments of the public may assume a public character and bravely redress public wrongs in such dismal and critical circumstances the stifled voice of an oppressed country is a loud call upon every man possessed with a spirit of patriotism to exert himself and whenever that voice shall be at liberty it will ratify and applaud the action which it could not formally authorize in large states this ultimate seat of power this tribunal to which lies an appeal from every other and from which no appeal can even be imagined is too much hid and kept out of sight by the present complex forms of government which derive their authority from it hence hath arisen a want of clearness and consistency in the language of the friends of liberty hence the preposterous and slavish maxim that whatever is enacted by that body of men in whom the supreme power of the state is vested must in all cases be implicitly obeyed and that no attempt    to repeal an unjust law can be vindicated beyond a simple remonstrance addressed to the legislators a case which is very intelligible but which can never happen will demonstrate the absurdity of such a maxim suppose the king of england and the two houses of parliament should make a law in all the usual forms to exempt the members of either house from paying taxes to the government or to take to themselves the property of their fellow citizens a law like this would open the eyes of the whole nation and show them the true principles of government and the power of governors the nation would see that the most regular governments may become tyrannical and their governors oppressive by separating their interest from that of the people whom they govern such a law would show them to be but servants and servants who had shamefully abused their trust in such a case every man for himself would lay his hand upon his sword and the authority    of the supreme power of the state would be annihilated so plain are these first principles of all government and political liberty that i will take upon me to say it is impossible a man should not be convinced of them who brings to the subject a mind free from the grossest and meanest prejudices whatever be the form of any government whoever be the supreme magistrates or whatever be their number that is to whomsoever the power of the society is delegated their authority is in its own nature reversible no man can be supposed to resign his natural liberty but on conditions these conditions whether they be expressed or not must be violated whenever the plain and obvious ends of government are not answered and a delegated power perverted from the intention for which it was bestowed expires of course magistrates therefore who consult not the good of the public and who employ their power to oppress the people are a public nuisance and their power is abrogated ipso facto    this however can only be the case in extreme oppression when the blessings of society and civil government great and important as they are are bought too dear when it is better not to be governed at all than to be governed in such a manner or at least when the hazard of a change of government would be apparently the less evil of the two and therefore these occasions rarely occur in the course of human affairs it may be asked what should a people do in case of less general oppression and only particular grievances when the deputies of the people make laws which evidently favour themselves and bear hard upon the body of the people they represent and such as they would certainly disapprove could they be assembled for that purpose i answer that when this appears to be very clearly the case as it ought by all means to do since in many cases if the government have not power to enforce a bad law it will not have power to enforce a good one the first    step which a wise and moderate people will take is to make a remonstrance to the legislature and if that be not practicable or be not heard still if the complaints be general and loud a wise prince and ministry will pay regard to them or they will at length be weary of enforcing a penal law which is generally abhorred and disregarded when they see the people will run the risque of the punishment if it cannot be evaded rather than quietly submit to the injunction and a regard to the good of society will certainly justify this conduct of the people if an over scrupulous conscience should prevent the people from expressing their sentiments in this manner there is no method left until an opportunity offers of chusing honester deputies in which the voice of the lowest classes can be heard in order to obtain the repeal of an oppressive law governors will never be awed by the voice of the people so long as it is a    mere voice without overtacts the consequence of these seemingly moderate maxims is that a door will be left open to all kinds of oppression without any resource or redress till the public wrongs be accumulated to the degree above mentioned when all the world would justify the utter subversion of the government these maxims therefore admit of no remedy but the last and most hazardous of all but is not even a mob a less evil than a rebellion and ought the former to be so severely blamed by writers on this subject when it may prevent the latter of two evils of any kind political as well as others it is the dictate of common sense to chuse the less besides according to common notions avowed by writers upon morals on less general principles and by lawyers too all penal laws give a man an alternative either to abstain from the action prohibited or to take the penalty    section iii of civil liberty sect i of the nature of civil liberty in general it is a matter of the greatest importance that we carefully distinguish between the form and the extent of power in a government for many maxims in politics depend upon the one which are too generally ascribed to the other it is comparatively of small consequence who or how many be our governors    or how long their office continues provided their power be the same while they are in office and the administration be uniform and certain all the difference which can arise to states from diversities in the number or continuance of governors can only flow from the motives and opportunities which those different circumstances may give their deputies of extending or making a bad use of their power but whether a people enjoy more or fewer of their natural rights under any form of government is a matter of the last importance and upon this depends what i should chuse to call the civil liberty of the state as distinct from its political liberty if the power of government be very extensive and the subjects of it have consequently little power over their own actions that government is tyrannical and oppressive whether with respect to its form it be a monarchy an aristocracy or even a republic for the government of the temporary magistrates of a democracy or even the laws  0 themselves may be as tyrannical as the maxims of the most despotic monarchy and the administration of the government may be as destructive of private happiness the only consolation that a democracy suggests in those circumstances is that every member of the state has a chance of arriving at a share in the chief magistracy and consequently of playing the tyrant in his turn and as there is no government in the world so perfectly democratical as that every member of the state without exception has a right of being admitted into the administration great numbers will be in the same condition as if they had lived under the most absolute monarchy and this is in fact almost universally the case with the poor in all governments for the same reason if there were no fixed laws but every thing was decided according to the will of the persons in power who is there that would think it of much consequence whether his life his liberty or his property were at the mercy of one of a few or of a    great number of people that is of a mob liable to the worst of influences so far therefore we may safely say with mr pope that those governments which are best administered are best—that is provided the power of government be moderate and leave a man the most valuable of his private rights provided the laws be certainly known to every one and the administration of them be uniform it is of no consequence how many or how few persons are employed in the administration but it must be allowed that there is not the same chance for the continuance of such laws and of such an administration whether the power be lodged in few or in more hands the governments now subsisting in europe differ widely in their forms but it is certain that the present happiness of the subjects of them can by no means be estimated by a regard to that circumstance only it depends chiefly upon the power the extent and the maxims of government respecting personal security private property c and on the    certainty and uniformity of the administration civil liberty has been greatly impaired by an abuse of the maxim that the joint understanding of all the members of a state properly collected must be preferable to that of individuals and consequently that the more the cases are in which mankind are governed by this united reason of the whole community so much the better whereas in truth the greater part of human actions are of such a nature that more inconvenience would follow from their being fixed by laws than from their being left to every mans arbitrary will we may be assisted in conceiving the nature of this species of liberty by considering what it is that men propose to gain by entering into society now it is evident that we are not led to wish for a state of society by the want of any thing that we can conveniently procure for ourselves as a man and a member of civil society i am desirous to receive    such assistance as numbers can give to individuals but by no means that assistance which numbers as such cannot give to individuals and least of all such as individuals are better qualified to impart to numbers there are many things respecting human happiness that properly fall under the two last mentioned classes and the great difficulty concerning the due extent of civil government lies in distinguishing the objects that belong to these classes little difficulty however has in fact arisen from the nature of the things in comparison of the difficulties that have been occasioned by its being the interest of men to combine confound and perplex them as far as mere strength can go it is evident that numbers may assist an individual and this seems to have been the first if not the only reason for having recourse to society if i be injured and not able to redress my own wrongs i ask help of my neighbours and acquaintance and occasions may arise in which the more assistance i can procure the    better but i can seldom want the assistance of numbers in managing my domestic affairs which require nothing but my own constant inspection and the immediate application of my own faculties in this case therefore any attempt of numbers to assist me would only occasion embarrassment and distress for the purpose of finding out truth individuals are always employed to assist multitudes for notwithstanding it be probable that more discoveries will be made by a number of persons than by one person and though one person may assist another in suggesting and perfecting any improvements in science yet still they all act as independent individuals giving voluntary information and advice for whenever numbers have truth or knowledge for their object and act as a collective body i e authoritatively so that no single person can have power to determine any thing till the majority have been brought to agree to it the interests of knowledge will certainly suffer there is so little prospect    of the prejudices of the many giving way to the better judgment of an individual here there is a case in which society must always be benefited by individuals as such and not by numbers in a collective capacity it is least of all therefore for the advancement of knowledge that i should be induced to wish for the authoritative interposition of society in this manner it might not be a very difficult thing for candid and impartial persons to fix reasonable bounds for the interposition of laws and government they are defective when they leave an individual destitute of that assistance which they could procure for him and they are burdensome and oppressive i e injurious to the natural rights and civil liberties of mankind when they lay a man under unnecessary restrictions by controling his conduct and preventing him from serving himself with respect to those things in which they can yield him no real assistance and in providing for which he is in no danger of injuring others    this question may be farther illustrated by two pretty just comparisons magistrates are the servants of the public and therefore the use of them may be illustrated by that of servants now let a mans fortune or his incapacity be such that his dependence on servants is ever so great there must be many things that he will be obliged to do for himself and in which any attempt to assist him would only embarrass and distress him and in many cases in which persons do make use of servants they would be much more at their ease if their situation would allow them to do without their assistance if magistrates be considered in the more respectable light of representatives and deputies of the people it should likewise be considered that there are many cases in which it is more convenient for a man to act in person than by any deputation whatever in some respects however it must be acknowledged that the proper extent of civil government is not easily circumscribed    within exact limits that the happiness of the whole community is the ultimate end of government can never be doubted and all claims of individuals inconsistent with the public good are absolutely null and void but there is a real difficulty in determining what general rules respecting the extent of the power of government or of governors are most conducive to the public good some may think it best that the legislature should make express provision for every thing which can even indirectly remotely and consequentially affect the public good while others may think it best that every thing which is not properly of a civil nature should be entirely overlooked by the civil magistrate that it is for the advantage of the society upon the whole that all those things be left to take their own natural course and that the legislature cannot interfere in them without defeating its own great object the public good    we are so little capable of arguing a priori in matters of government that it should seem experiments only can determine how far this power of the legislature ought to extend and it should likewise seem that till a sufficient number of experiments have been made it becomes the wisdom of the civil magistracy to take as little upon its hands as possible and never to interfere without the greatest caution in things that do not immediately affect the lives liberty or property of the members of the community that civil magistrates should hardly ever be moved to exert themselves by the mere tendencies of things those tendencies are generally so vague and often so imaginary and that nothing but a manifest and urgent necessity of which however themselves are to be sure the only judges can justify them in extending their authority to whatever has no more than a tendency though the strongest possible to disturb the tranquility and happiness of the state    there can be no doubt but that any people forming themselves into a society may subject themselves to whatever restrictions they please and consequently that the supreme civil magistrates on whom the whole power of the society is devolved may make what laws they please but the question is what restrictions and laws are wise and calculated to promote the public good for such only are just right and properly speaking lawful political and civil liberty as before explained though very different have however a very near and manifest connection and the former is the chief guard of the latter and on that account principally it is valuable and worth contending for if all the political power of this country were lodged in the hands of one person and the government thereby changed into an absolute monarchy the people would find no difference provided the same laws and the same administration which now subsist  0 were continued but then the people having no political liberty would have no security for the continuance of the same laws and the same administration they would have no guard for their civil liberty the monarch having it in his option might not chuse to continue the same laws and the same administration he might fancy it to be for his own interest to alter them and to abridge his subjects in their private rights and in general it may be depended upon that governors will not consult the interest of the people except it be their own interest too because governors are but men but while a number of the people have a share in the legislature so as to be able to control the supreme magistrate there is a great probability that things will continue in a good state for the more political liberty the people have the safer is their civil liberty there may however be some kind of guard for civil liberty independent of that which is properly called political    for the supreme magistrate though nominally he have all the power of the state in his hands and without violating any of the forms of the constitution may enact and execute what laws he pleases yet his circumstances may be such as shall lay him under what is equivalent to a natural impossibility of doing what he would chuse and i do not here mean that kind of restraint which all arbitrary princes are under from the fear of a revolt of their subjects which is often the consequence of great oppression but from what may be called the spirit of the times magistrates being men cannot but have in some measure the feelings of other men they could not therefore be happy themselves if they were conscious that their conduct exposed them to universal hatred and contempt neither can they be altogether indifferent to the light in which their characters and conduct will appear to posterity for their own sakes therefore they will generally pay some regard to the sentiments of their people    the more civilized any country is the more effectual will this kind of guard to political liberty prove because in those circumstances a sense of justice and honour have got firmer hold of the minds of men so that a violation of them would be more sensibly felt and more generally and strongly resented for this reason a gentleman of fashion and fortune has much less to dread in france or in denmark than in turkey the confiscation of an overgrown rich mans effects without any cause assigned would make no great noise in the latter whereas in those countries in which the forms of law and liberty have been long established they necessarily carry with them more or less of the substance also there is not i believe any country in europe in which a man could be condemned and his effects confiscated but a crime must be alledged and a process of law be gone through the confirmed habit of thinking in these countries is such that no prince could dispense    with these formalities he would be deemed insane if he should attempt to do otherwise the succession would be set aside in favour of the next heir by the general consent of the people and the revolution would take place without blood shed no person standing near any european prince would hesitate what to do if his sovereign should attempt to cut off a mans head out of mere wantonness and sport a thing that would only strike the beholders with awe in some foreign courts should the english government become arbitrary and the people disgusted with the conduct of their parliaments do what the people of denmark have done chuse their sovereign for their perpetual representative and surrender into his hands all the power of state the forms of a free government have been so long established that the most artful tyrant would be a long time before he could render life and property as precarious as it is even in france the trial by juries in ordinary cases would stand    a long time the habeas corpus would generally at least continue in force and all executions would be in public it may be questioned whether the progress to absolute slavery and insecurity would be more rapid if the king were nominally arbitrary or only virtually so by uniformly influencing the house of commons in some respects so large a body of men would venture upon things which no single person would chuse to do of his own authority and so long as they had little intercourse but with one another they would not be much affected with the sense of fear or shame one may safely say that no single member of the house would have had the assurance to decide as the majority have often done in cases of controverted elections but on the other hand as the members of the house of commons necessarily spend a great part of the summer    months with their friends in the country they could not shew their faces after passing an act by which gentlemen like themselves or even their electors should be much aggrieved though they may now and then oppress the poor by unreasonable game acts c because they never converse with any of the poor except their immediate dependants who would not chuse to remonstrate on the subject besides so long as the members of parliament are elected though only once in seven years those of them that are really chosen by the people can have no chance of being reelected but by pleasing the people and many of them would not chuse to reduce themselves and their posterity out of the house to a worse condition than they originally were let them be ever so obsequious to a court they will hardly chuse to deprive themselves of all power of giving any thing for the future independent therefore of all conviction of mind there must be a minority    in the house whose clamour and opposition will impede the progress of tyranny whereas a king surrounded by his guards and a cringing nobility has no check if however he be a man of sense and read history he may comprehend the various causes of the extreme insecurity of despotic princes many of whom have appeared in all the pomp of power in the morning and have been in prison without eyes or massacred and dragged about the streets before night at all adventures i should think it more wise to bear with a tyrannical parliament though a more expensive mode of servitude for the present than an arbitrary prince so long as there is a power that can nominally put a negative upon the proceedings of the court there is some chance that circumstances may arise in which the prince may not be able to influence them they may see the necessity if not the wisdom of complying with the just desires of the people and by passing a few fundamentally    good laws true freedom may be established for ages whereas were the old forms of constitutional liberty once abolished as in france there would be little hope of their revival whenever the house of commons shall be so abandonedly corrupt as to join with the court in abolishing any of the essential forms of the constitution or effectually defeating the great purposes of it let every englishman before it be too late reperuse the history of his country and do what englishmen are renowned for having formerly done in the same circumstances where civil liberty is intirely divested of its natural guard political liberty i should not hesitate to prefer the government of one to that of a number because a sense of shame would have less influence upon them and they would keep one another in countenance in cases in which any single person would yield to the sense of the majority    political and civil liberty have many things in common which indeed is the reason why they have been so often confounded a sense both of political and civil slavery makes a man think meanly of himself the feeling of his insignificance debases his mind checks every great and enterprising sentiment and in fact renders him that poor abject creature which he fancies himself to be having always some unknown evil to fear though it should never come he has no perfect enjoyment of himself or of any of the blessings of life and thus his sentiments and his enjoyments being of a lower kind the man sinks nearer to the state of the brute creation on the other hand a sense of political and civil liberty though there should be no great occasion to exert it in the course of a mans life gives him a constant feeling of his own power and importance and is the foundation of his indulging a free bold and manly turn of thinking unrestrained by the most distant idea of control being free from    all fear he has the most perfect enjoyment of himself and of all the blessings of life and his sentiments and enjoyments being raised his very being is exalted and the man makes nearer approaches to superior natures without a spirit of liberty and a feeling of security and independence no great improvements in agriculture or any thing else will ever be made by men a man has but poor encouragement to bestow labour and expence upon a piece of ground in which he has no secure property and when neither himself nor his posterity will probably ever derive any permanent advantage from it in confirmation of this i cannot help quoting a few instructive passages from mr du poivres travels of a philosopher it is his general observation that a country poorly cultivated is always inhabited by men barbarous or oppressed p   in a terrestrial paradise the siamese  0 are perhaps the most wretched people in the world the government is despotic the sovereign alone enjoys the true liberty which is natural to all mankind his subjects are all slaves every one of them is annually taxed at six months personal service without wages and even without food p    on the other hand the chinese enjoy undisturbed their private possessions as well as those which being by their nature indivisible belong to all and he who buys a field or receives it by inheritance from his ancestors is of course the sole lord or master the lands are free as the people without feudal services or fines of alienation a tenth part of the produce of the earth is the only tax or tribute in the chinese empire since the origin of the monarchy and such is the happy respect which the chinese have for their antient customs that no emperor of china ever entertains the most distant thought of augmenting it nor his subjects the least apprehension of such augmentation p       in arbitrary governments the poor are certainly the most safe as their condition exhibits nothing that can attract the notice or tempt the violence of a tyrant if therefore a man aspire to nothing more than to get his bread by the labour of his hands in some customary employment he has little to fear let him live where he will like the ass in the fable he can but bear his burden no governments can do without labourers and artisans it is their interest to protect them and especially those who are dexterous in the more elegant arts that are subservient to luxury but the poorest can hardly be without some degree of ambition except when that generous principle has been long repressed and in a manner eradicated by a continual habit of slavery and the moment that a man thinks of rendering himself in any respect conspicuous for his wealth knowledge or influence of any kind he begins to be in danger if he have but a very handsome wife he must not live near a despotic    court or in the neighbourhood of any great man who is countenanced by it if he have wealth he must hide it and enjoy it in secret with fear and trembling and if he have sense and think differently from his neighbours he must do the same or risque the fate of galileo i shall close this section with a few extracts from

having considered the nature of civil liberty in general i shall treat of two capital branches of which it consists these are the rights of education and religion on these two articles much of the happiness of human life is acknowledged to depend but they appear to me to be of such a nature that the advantage we derive from them will be more effectually secured when they are conducted by individuals than by the state and if this can be demonstrated nothing more is necessary to prove that the civil magistrate    has no business to interfere with them this i cannot help thinking to be the shortest and the best issue upon which we can put every thing in which the civil magistrate pretends to a right of interference if it be probable that the business whatever it be will be conducted better that is more to the advantage of society in his hands than in those of individuals the right will be allowed in those circumstances it is evident that no friend to society can deny his claim but if the nature of the thing be such that the attention of individuals with respect to it can be applied to more advantage than that of the magistrate the claim of the former must be admitted in preference to that of the latter no doubt there are examples of both kinds the avenging of injuries or redressing of private wrongs is certainly better trusted in the hands of the magistrate than in those of private persons    but with what advantage could a magistrate interfere in a thousand particulars relating to private families and private friendships now i think it is clear that education must be ranked in the latter class or among those things in which the civil magistrate has no right to interfere because he cannot do it to any good purpose but since dr brown has lately maintained the contrary in a treatise intitled thoughts on civil liberty licentiousness and faction and in an appendix relative to a proposed code of education subjoined to a sermon on the female character and education i shall in this section reply to what he has advanced on this subject and offer what has occurred to me with relation to it lest it should be apprehended that i mistake the views of this writer i shall subjoin a few extracts from the work which contain the substance of what he has advanced on the subject of education he asserts that the first and best security of civil liberty consists in impressing the infant mind with such habits    of thought and action as may correspond with and promote the appointments of public law in his appendix he says that by a code of education he means a system of principles religious moral and political whose tendency may be the preservation of the blessings of society as they are enjoyed in a free state to be instilled effectually into the infant and growing minds of the community for this great end of public happiness in what manner the security of civil liberty is to be effected by means of this code of education may be seen in the following description he gives of the institutions of sparta no father had a right to educate his children according to the caprice of his own fancy they were delivered to public officers who initiated them early in the manners the maxims the exercises the toils in a word in all the mental and bodily acquirements and habits which corresponded with the genius of the state family connections had no  0 place the first and leading object of their affection was the general welfare this tuition was carefully continued till they were enrolled in the list of men with respect to the athenian government he says page    the first and ruling defect in the institution of this republic seems to have been the total want of an established education suitable to the genius of the state there appears not to have been any public regular or prescribed appointment of this kind beyond what custom had accidentally introduced he says page  0 there were three fatal circumstances admitted into the very essence of the roman republic which contained the seeds of certain ruin the first of which was the neglect of instituting public laws by which the education of their children might have been ascertained he complains page    that the    british system of policy and religion is not upheld in its native power like that of sparta by correspondent and effectual rules of education that it is in the power of every private man to educate his child not only without a reverence for these but in absolute contempt of them that at the revolution p  0 the education of youth was still left in an imperfect state this great revolution having confined itself to the reform of public institutions without ascending to the great fountain of political security the private and effectual formation of the infant mind and p  0  that education was afterwards left still more and more imperfect lastly he asserts p     that the chief and essential remedy of licentiousness and faction the fundamental means of the lasting and secure establishment of civil liberty can only be in a general and prescribed improvement of the laws of education to which all the members of the community should    legally submit and that for want of a prescribed code of education the manners and principles on which alone the state can rest are ineffectually instilled are vague fluctuating and self contradictory nothing he says is more evident than that some reform in this great point is necessary for the security of public freedom and that though it is an incurable defect of our political state that it has not a correspondent and adequate code of education inwrought into its first essence we may yet hope that in a secondary and inferior degree something of this kind may still be inlaid that though it cannot have that perfect efficacy as if it had been originally of the piece yet if well conducted it may strengthen the weak parts and alleviate defects if not completely remove them in conducting my examination of these sentiments i shall make no remarks upon any particular passages in the book but consider only the authors general scheme    and the proper and professed object of it and as the doctor has proposed no particular plan of public education i shall be as general as he has been and only shew the inconvenience of establishing by law any plan of education whatever this writer pleads for a plan of education established by the legislature as the only effectual method of preventing faction in the state and securing the perpetuity of our excellent constitution ecclesiastical and civil i agree with him in acknowledging the importance of education as influencing the manners and the conduct of men i also acknowledge that an uniform plan of education agreeable to the principles of any particular form of government civil or ecclesiastical would tend to establish and perpetuate that form of government and prevent civil dissentions and factions in the state but i should object to the interference of the legislature in this business of education as prejudicial to the proper design of education and also to the great ends of civil    societies with respect to their present utility i shall moreover show that it would be absolutely inconsistent with the true principles of the english government and could not be carried into execution to any purpose without the ruin of our present constitution i beg the candour of the public while i endeavour to explain in as few words as possible in what manner i apprehend this interference of the civil magistrate would operate to obstruct these great ends and i shall consider these articles separately i observed in the first place that a legal code of education might interfere with the proper design of it i do not mean what this writer seems to consider as the only object of education the tranquility of the state but the forming of wise and virtuous men which is certainly an object of the greatest importance in every state if the constitution of a state be a good one such men will be the greatest bulwarks of it if it be a bad one they will be the most able and ready to contribute to its reformation    in either of which cases they will render it the greatest service education is as much an art founded as all arts are upon science as husbandry as architecture or as shipbuilding in all these cases we have a practical problem proposed to us which must be performed by the help of data with which experience and observation furnish us the end of shipbuilding is to make the best ships of architecture the best houses and of education the best men now of all arts those stand the fairest chance of being brought to perfection in which there is opportunity of making the most experiments and trials and in which there are the greatest number and variety of persons employed in making them history and experience show that cæteris paribus those arts have always in fact been brought the soonest or the nearest to perfection which have been placed in those favourable circumstances the reason is that the operations of the human mind are slow a number of false hypotheses and conclusions always    precede the right one and in every art manual or liberal a number of awkward attempts are made before we are able to execute any thing which will bear to be shown as a masterpiece in its kind so that to establish the methods and processes of any art before it have arrived to a state of perfection of which no man can be a judge is to fix it in its infancy to perpetuate every thing that is inconvenient and awkward in it and to cut off its future growth and improvement and to establish the methods and processes of any art when it has arrived to perfection is superfluous it will then recommend and establish itself now i appeal to any person whether any plan of education which has yet been put in execution in this kingdom be so perfect as that the establishing of it by authority would not obstruct the great ends of education or even whether the united genius of man could at present form so perfect a plan every man who is experienced in the business of education well knows that the art is in its infancy    but advancing it is hoped apace to a state of manhood in this condition it requires the aid of every circumstance favourable to its natural growth and dreads nothing so much as being confined and cramped by the unseasonable hand of power to put it in its present imperfect state into the hands of the civil magistrate in order to fix the mode of it would be like fixing the dress of a child and forbidding its cloaths ever to be made wider or larger manufacturers and artists of several kinds already complain of the obstruction which is thrown in the way of their arts by the injudicious acts of former parliaments and it is the object of our wisest statesmen to get these obstructions removed by the repeal of those acts i wish it could not be said that the business of education is already under too many legal restraints let these be removed and a few more fair experiments made of the different methods of conducting it before the legislature think proper to interfere any more with it    and by that time it is hoped they will see no reason to interfere at all the business would be conducted to much better purpose even in favour of their own views if those views were just and honourable than it would be under any arbitrary regulations whatever to shew this scheme of an established method of education in a clearer point of light let us imagine that what is now proposed had been carried into execution some centuries before this time for no reason can be assigned for fixing any mode of education at present which might not have been made use of with the same appearance of reason for fixing another approved method a thousand years ago suppose alfred when he founded the university of oxford had made it impossible that the method of instruction used in his time should ever have been altered excellent as that method might have been for the time in which it was instituted it would now have been the worst method that is practised in the world suppose the number of the arts and sciences    with the manner of teaching them had been fixed in this kingdom before the revival of letters and of the arts it is plain they could never have arrived at their present advanced state among us we should not have had the honour to lead the way in the most noble discoveries in the mathematics philosophy astronomy and i may add divinity too and for the same reason were such an establishment to take place in the present age it would prevent all great improvements in futurity i may add in this place that if we argue from the analogy of education to other arts which are most similar to it we can never expect to see human nature about which it is employed brought to perfection but in consequence of indulging unbounded liberty and even caprice in conducting it the power of nature in producing plants cannot be shown to advantage but in all possible circumstances of culture the richest colours the most fragrant scents and the most exquisite flavours which our present gardens  0 and orchards exhibit would never have been known if florists and gardeners had been confined in the processes of cultivation nay if they had not been allowed the utmost licentiousness of fancy in the exercise of their arts many of the finest productions of modern gardening have been the result of casual experiment perhaps of undesigned deviation from established rules observations of a similar nature may be made on the methods of breeding cattle and training animals of all kinds and why should the rational part of the creation be deprived of that opportunity of diversifying and improving itself which the vegetable and animal world enjoy from new and seemingly irregular methods of education perhaps something extraordinary and uncommonly great may spring at least there would be a fair chance for such productions and if something odd and excentric should now and then arise from this unbounded liberty of education the various business of human life may afford proper spheres for such excentric geniuses    education taken in its most extensive sense is properly that which makes the man one method of education therefore would only produce one kind of men but the great excellence of human nature consists in the variety of which it is capable instead then of endeavouring by uniform and fixed systems of education to keep mankind always the same let us give free scope to every thing which may bid fair for introducing more variety among us the various character of the athenians was certainly preferable to the uniform character of the spartans or to any uniform national character whatever is it not universally considered as an advantage to england that it contains so great a variety of original characters and is it not on this account preferred to france spain or italy uniformity is the characteristic of the brute creation among them every species of birds build their nests with the same materials and in the same form the genius and disposition of one individual    is that of all and it is only the education which men give them that raises any of them much above others but it is the glory of human nature that the operations of reason though variable and by no means infallible are capable of infinite improvement we come into the world worse provided than any of the brutes and for a year or two of our lives many of them go far beyond us in intellectual accomplishments but when their faculties are at a full stand and their enjoyments incapable of variety or increase our intellectual powers are growing apace we are perpetually deriving happiness from new sources and even before we leave this world are capable of tasting the felicity of angels have we then so little sense of the proper excellence of our natures and of the views of divine providence in our formation as to catch at a poor advantage adapted to the lower nature of brutes rather let us hold on in the course in which the divine being himself has put us by giving reason its full play and    throwing off the fetters which shortsighted and illjudging men have hung upon it though in this course we be liable to more extravagancies than brutes governed by blind but unerring instinct or than men whom mistaken systems of policy have made as uniform in their sentiments and conduct as the brutes we shall be in the way to attain a degree of perfection and happiness of which they can have no idea however as men are first animals before they can be properly termed rational creatures and the analogies of individuals extend to societies a principle something resembling the instinct of animals may perhaps suit mankind in their insant state but then as we advance in the arts of life let us as far as we are able assert the native freedom of our souls and after having been servilely governed like brutes aspire to the noble privilege of governing ourselves like men if it may have been necessary to establish    something by law concerning education that necessity grows less every day and encourages us to relax the bonds of authority rather than bind them faster secondly this scheme of an established mode of education would be prejudicial to the great ends of civil society the great object of civil society is the happiness of the members of it in the perfect and undisturbed enjoyment of the more important of our natural rights for the sake of which we voluntarily give up others of less consequence to us but whatever be the blessings of civil society they may be bought too dear it is certainly possible to sacrifice too much at least more than is necessary to be sacrified for them in order to produce the greatest sum of happiness in the community else why do we complain of tyrannical and oppressive governments is it not the meaning of all complaints of this kind that in such governments the subjects are deprived of their most important natural rights without an    equivalent recompense that all the valuable ends of civil government might be effectually secured and the members of particular states be much happier upon the whole if they did not lie under those restrictions now of all the sources of happiness and enjoyment in human life the domestic relations are the most constant and copious with our wives and children we necessarily pass the greatest part of our lives the connections of friendship are slight in comparison of this intimate domestic union views of interest or ambition may divide the nearest friends but our wives and children are in general inseparably connected with us and attached to us with them all our joys are doubled and in their affection and assiduity we find consolation under all the troubles and disquietudes of life for the enjoyments which result from this most delightful intercourse all mankind in all ages have been ready to sacrifice every thing and for the interruption of this intercourse no compensation    whatever can be made by man what then can be more justly alarming to a man who has a true taste for happiness than either that the choice of his wife or the education of his children should be under the direction of persons who have no particular knowledge of him or particular affection for him and whose views and maxims he might utterly dislike what prospect of happiness could a man have with such a wife or such children it is possible indeed that the preservation of some civil societies such as that of sparta may require this sacrifice but those civil societies must be wretchedly constituted to stand in need of it and had better be utterly dissolved were i a member of such a state thankful should i be to its governors if they would permit me peaceably to retire to any other country where so great a sacrifice was not required indeed it is hardly possible that a state should require any sacrifice which i should think of so much importance and i doubt not so many    others would be of the same mind that there would soon be very little reason to complain of the too great increase of commerce in such a country this however would render very necessary another part of our authors scheme viz putting a restraint upon travelling abroad lest too many persons should be willing to leave such a country and have no inclination to return if there be any natural rights which ought not to be sacrificed to the ends of civil society and no politicians or moralists deny but that there are some the obligations of religion for instance being certainly of a superior nature it is even more natural to look for these rights among those which respect a mans children than among those which respect himself because nature has generally made them dearer to him than himself if any trust can be said to be of god and such as ought not to be relinquished at the command of man it is that which    we have of the education of our children whom the divine being seems to have put under our immediate care that we may instruct them in such principles form them to such manners and give them such habits of thinking and acting as we shall judge to be of the greatest importance to their present and future well being i believe there is no father in the world who to a sense of religion joins a strong sense of parental affection who would think his own liberty above half indulged to him when abridged in so tender a point as that of providing to his own satisfaction for the good conduct and happiness of his offspring nature seems to have established such a strong connexion between a parent and his children at least during the first period of their lives that to drag them from the asylum of their natural guardians to force them to public places of education and to instil into them religious sentiments contrary to the judgment and choice of their parents would be as cruel    as obliging a man to make the greatest personal sacrifice even that of his conscience to the civil magistrate what part of the persecution which the protestants in france underwent did they complain of more feelingly and with more justice than that of their children being forced from them and carried to be educated in public monasteries god forbid that the parental affections of free born britons should ever be put to so severe a trial or to that which the poor jews in portugal suffered many of whom cut the throats of their children or threw them into wells and down precipices rather than suffer them to be dragged away to be educated under the direction of a popish inquisition thinking the lives of their children a less sacrifice than that of their principles it was a measure similar to that which dr brown recommends at which the whole christian world took the greatest alarm that was ever given to it in the reign of that great man but inveterate  00 enemy of christianity the emperor julian who would have shut up the schools of christians and have forbidden them to teach rhetoric and philosophy similar to this scheme in its nature and tendency was the most odious measure of the most odious ministry that ever sat at the helm of the british government and which was providentially defeated the very day that it was to have been carried into execution i mean the schism bill patronized by the tory ministers in the latter end of the reign of queen ann should these measures be resumed and pursued farewel a long farewel to englands greatness nor would this be said in a hasty fit of unreasonable despair for besides that such a measure as this could not but have many extensive consequences it is not to be doubted but that whoever they be who do thus much they both can and will do more such a scheme as this will never be pushed for its own sake only in examining the present operation and utility of any scheme of policy we  0  ought to take into consideration the ease or the difficulty of carrying it into execution for if the disturbance which would be occasioned by bringing it into execution would be so great an inconvenience as to overbalance the good to be effected by it it were better never to attempt it now though the doctor hath laid down no particular scheme of public and established education and therefore we cannot judge of the particular difficulties which would attend the establishing of it yet if it be such as would answer the end proposed by him this difficulty would appear to me absolutely insuperable in such a country as england whatever be the religious moral and political principles which are thought conducive to the good of the society if they must be effectually instilled into the infant and growing minds of the community it can never be done without taking the children very early from their parents and cutting off all communication with them till they be arrived to maturity  0  and their judgments be absolutely fixed and if this author judged that the reason why a scheme of this nature did not take place in athens was the difficulty of establishing it after the people were tolerably civilized he must certainly judge it to be infinitely more difficult among a people so much farther advanced in the arts of life than the athenians he well observes p    that to give children a public education where no education had taken place was natural and practicable but he seems to be aware that an attempt to carry any such plan into execution in the most flourishing period of a free and civilized state would be highly unnatural without the least probable hope of success and dangerous to such as took it in hand for he says p    that to effect a change of government only is a work sufficient for the abilities of the greatest legislator but to overturn all the preestablished habits of the head and heart to destroy or reverse all the fixed associations maxims manners  0  and principles were a labour which might well be ranked among the most extravagant legends of fabulous greece what might be expected from the business of education being lodged by the state in the hands of any one set of men may be imagined from the alarm which the newtonian system gave to all philosophers at the time of its first publication and from what passed at oxford with respect to lockes essay on the human understanding which hath done so much honour to the english nation in the eyes of all the learned world we are told by the authors of biographia britannica in the life of mr locke that there was a meeting of the heads of houses at oxford where it was proposed to censure and discourage the reading of this essay and that after various debates it was concluded that without any public censure each head of a house shall endeavour to prevent its being read in his own college this passed but a little before mr lockes  0  death and about fourteen years after the first publication of the essay hitherto i have argued against established modes of education upon general principles shewing how unfavourable they are to the great ends of civil society with only occasional references to the english constitution and in these arguments i have likewise supposed these methods of education whatever they be actually established and to have operated to their full extent i shall now add that before these methods can be established and produce their full effect they must occasion a very considerable alteration in the english constitution and almost inevitably destroy the freedom of it so that the thing which would in fact be perpetuated would not be the present constitution of england but something very different from it and more despotic an alteration of so great importance which tends to defeat one of the principal objects of this government cannot but give just cause of alarm to every friend of the present  0  happy constitution and liberties of this country in support of this assertion i desire no other argument than that with which dr brown himself furnishes me from the influence he allows to education operating likewise in the very manner which he describes and to the very end for which he advises the establishing of its mode education is considered by the doctor only in a political view as useful to instil into the minds of youth particular maxims of policy and to give them an attachment to particular forms of it or as tending to superinduce such habits of mind and to give such a general turn of thinking as would correspond with the genius of a particular state this education he would have to be universal and uniform and indeed if it were not so it could not possibly answer the end proposed it must therefore be conducted by one set of men but it is impossible to find any set of men who shall have an equal regard to all the parts of our constitution and whatever part is neglected  0  in such a system of education it cannot fail to be a sufferer the english government is a mixture of regal aristocratical and democratical power and if the public education should be more favourable to any one of these than to another or more than its present importance in the constitution requires the balance of the whole would necessarily be lost too much weight would be thrown into some of the scales and the constitution be overturned if the commons representing the body of the people had the choice of these public instructors which is almost impossible we should see a republic rise out of the ruins of our present government if the lords which is highly improbable we should in the end have an aristocracy and if the court had this nomination which it may be taken for granted would be the case as all the executive power of the state is already lodged in the hands of the sovereign it could not but occasion a very dangerous accession of power to the crown and we  0  might justly expect a system of education principles and manners favourable to despotism every man would be educated with principles which would lead him to concur with the views of the court all that opposition from the country which is so salutary in this nation and so essential to the liberties of england would be at an end and when once the spirit of despotism was thus established and had triumphed over all opposition we might soon expect to see the forms of it established too and thereby the very doors shut against old english liberty and effectually guarded against the possibility of its return except by violence which would then be the only method of its reentrance it is evident to common understanding that the true spirit and maxims of a mixed government can no otherwise be continued than by every mans educating his children in his own way and that if any one part provided for the education of the whole that part would soon gain the ascendancy and  0  if it were capable of it would become the whole were a state for instance to consist of papists and protestants and the papists to have the sole power of education protestantism would expire with that generation whereas if the papists and protestants educated each their own children the same proportion would continue to subsist between them and the balance of power would remain the same for the same reason the only method of preserving the balance which at present subsists among the several political and religious parties in greatbritain is for each to provide for the education of their own children in this way there will be a fair prospect of things continuing nearly upon their present footing for a considerable time but subject to those gradual alterations which it may be hoped will prove favourable to the best interests of the society upon the whole whereas were the direction of the whole business of education thrown into the hands of the court it would be such an accession of  0  power to the regal part of our constitution as could not fail to alarm all the friends of civil liberty as all the friends of religious liberty would be justly alarmed if it should devolve upon the established clergy and it were the greatest injustice to the good sense of free born britons to suppose the noble spirit of religious liberty and a zeal for the rights of free inquiry confined within the narrow circle of protestant dissenters considering the whole of what hath been advanced in this section i think it sufficiently appears that education is a branch of civil liberty which ought by no means to be surrendered into the hands of the magistrate and that the best interests of society require that the right of conducting it should be inviolably preserved to individuals   0 section v of religious liberty and toleration in general the most important question concerning the extent of civil government is whether the civil magistrate ought to extend his authority to matters of religion and the only method of deciding this important question as it appears to me is to have recourse at once to first principles and the ultimate rule concerning every thing that respects a society viz whether such interference of the civil magistrate appear to be for the public good and as all arguments a priori in matters of policy are apt to be fallacious fact and experience seem to be our only safe guides now these as far as our knowledge of history extends declare clearly for no interference in this case at all or at least for as little as is possible those societies have ever enjoyed     the most happiness and have been ceteris paribus in the most flourishing state where the civil magistrates have meddled the least with religion and where they have the most closely confined their attention to what immediately affects the civil interests of their fellow citizens civil and religious matters taking the words in their usual acceptation seem to be so distinct that it can only be in very uncommon emergencies where for instance religious quarrels among the members of the state rise very high that the civil magistrate can have any call or pretence for interfering with religion it is indeed impossible to name any two things about which men are concerned so remote in their nature but that they have some connections and mutual influences but were i asked what two things i should think to be in the least danger of being confounded and which even the ingenuity of man could     find the least pretence for involving together i should say the things that relate to this life and those that relate to the life to come defining the object of civil government in the most extensive sense to be the making provision for the secure and comfortable enjoyment of this life by preventing one man from injuring another in his person or property i should think the office of the civil magistrate to be in no great danger of being incroached upon by the methods that men might think proper to take to provide for their happiness after death all the civil societies we enter into in this life will be dissolved by death when this life is over i shall not be able to claim any of the privileges of an englishman i shall not be bound by any of the laws of england nor shall i owe any allegiance to its sovereign when therefore my situation in a future life shall have no connection with my privileges or obligations as an englishman why should those persons who make laws for englishmen interfere with     my conduct with respect to a state to which their power does not extend besides we know that infinite mischiefs have arisen from this interference of government in the business of religion and we have yet seen no inconvenience to have arisen from the want or the relaxation of it the fine country of flanders the most flourishing and opulent then in europe was absolutely ruined past recovery by the mad attempt of philip the second to introduce the popish inquisition into that country france was greatly hurt by the revocation of the edict of nantz whereas england was a great gainer on both occasions by granting an asylum for those persecuted industrious people who repaid us for our kindness by the introduction of many useful arts and manufactures which were the foundation of our present commerce riches and power pensylvania flourished much more than new england or than any other of     the english settlements in north america evidently in consequence of giving more liberty in matters of religion at its first establishment holland has found its advantage in the indulgence she gives to a great variety of religious persuasions england has also been much more flourishing and happy since the establishment as it may properly enough be stiled of the dissenting method of worship by what is commonly called the act of toleration and all the sensible part of europe concur in thinking both that the polish dissidents have a right to all the privileges of other polish citizens and that it would be much happier for that country if their claims were quietly admitted and none but interested bigots opposed their demands if we look a little farther off from home let it be said what inconvenience did jenghis khan tamerlane and other eastern conquerors ever find from leaving religion to its natural course in the countries they subdued and from having christians mahometans and a variety of     pagans under the same form of civil government are not both christianity and mohammedanism in fact established the former at least fully tolerated in turkey and what inconvenience worth mentioning has ever arisen from it pity it is then that more and fairer experiments are not made when judging from what is past the consequences of unbounded liberty in matters of religion promise to be so very favourable to the best interests of mankind i am aware that the connexion between civil and religious affairs will be urged for the necessity of some interference of the legislature with religion and as i observed before i do not deny the connection but as this connection has always been found to be the greatest in barbarous nations and imperfect governments to which it lends an useful aid it may be presumed that it is gradually growing less necessary and that in the present advanced state of human society there is very little occasion for     it for my own part i have no apprehension but that at this day the laws might be obeyed very well without any ecclesiastical sanctions enforced by the civil magistrate not that i think religion will ever be a matter of indifference in civil society that is impossible if the word be understood in its greatest latitude and by religion we mean that principle whereby men are influenced by the dread of evil or the hope of reward from any unknown and invisible causes whether the good or evil be expected to take place in this world or another comprehending enthusiasm superstition and every species of false religion as well as the true nor is such an event at all desirable nay the more just motives men have to the same good actions the better but religious motives may still operate in favour of the civil laws without such a connection as has been formed between them in ecclesiastical establishments and i think this end would be answered even better without that connection     in all the modes of religion which subsist among mankind however subversive of virtue they may be in theory there is some salvo for good morals so that in fact they enforce the more essential parts at least of that conduct which the good order of society requires besides it might be expected that if all the modes of religion were equally protected by the civil magistrate they would all vie with one another which should best deserve that protection this however is in fact all the alliance that can take place between religion and civil policy each enforcing the same conduct by different motives any other alliance between church and state is only the alliance of different sorts of worldly minded men for their temporal emolument if i be urged with the horrid excesses of the anabaptists in germany about the time of the reformation of the levellers in england during the civil wars and the shocking practices of that people in asia from whom we borrow the     term assassin i answer that besides its being absolutely chimerical to apprehend any such extravagances at present and that they can never subsist long such outrages as these against the peace of society may be restrained by the civil magistrate without his troubling himself about religious opinions if a man commit murder let him be punished as a murderer and let no regard be paid to his plea of conscience for committing the action but let not the opinions which led to the action be meddled with for then it is probable that more harm will be done than good and that for a small evident advantage risque will be run of endless and unknown evils or if the civil magistrate never interfere in religion but in such cases as those before mentioned the friends of liberty will have no great reason to complain considering what great encroachments have been made upon their rights in several countries of europe they will be satisfied if part of the load be removed they will support themselves with the hope that as the state will certainly     find a solid advantage in every relaxation of its claim upon mens consciences it will relax more and more of its pretended rights till at last religious opinions and religious actions be as free as the air we breathe or the light of the common sun i acknowledge with the statesman that the proper object of the civil magistrate is the peace and well being of society and that whatever tends to disturb that peace and well being properly comes under his cognisance i acknowledge several religious and moral as well as political principles have a near connection with the well being of society but as was more fully explained before there are many cases in which the happiness of society is nearly concerned in which it would nevertheless be the greatest impropriety for the civil magistrate to interfere as in many of the duties of private life the obligations of gratitude c in all such cases where the well being of society is most nearly concerned the civil magistrate has no right to interfere unless he   0 can do it to good purpose there is no difference i apprehend to be made in this case between the right and the wisdom of interference if the interference would be for the good of the society upon the whole it is wise and right if it would do more harm than good it is foolish and wrong let the sagacious statesman therefore consider whether the interference of the civil magistrate be in its own nature calculated to prevent the violation of the religious and moral principles he may wish to enforce i think it is clear that when they are in danger of being violated his presence is so far from tending to remedy the evil that it must necessarily inflame it and make it worse it is universally understood that reason and authority are two things and that they have generally been opposed to one another the hand of power therefore on the side of any set of principles cannot but be a suspicious circumstance and though the injunction of the magistrate may silence voices it multiplies     whispers and those whispers are the things at which he has the most reason to be alarmed besides it is universally true that where the civil magistrate has the greatest pretence for interfering in religious and moral principles his interference supposing there were no impropriety in it is the least necessary if the opinions and principles in question be evidently subversive of all religion and all civil society they must be evidently false and easy to refute so that there can be no danger of their spreading and the patrons of them may safely be suffered to maintain them in the most open manner they chuse to mention those religious and moral principles which dr brown produces as the most destructive to the well being of society namely that there is no god and that there is no faith to be kept with heretics so far am i from being of his opinion that it is necessary to guard against these principles by severe penalties     and not to tolerate those who maintain them that i think of all opinions surely such as these have nothing formidable or alarming in them they can have no terrors but what the magistrate himself by his illjudged opposition may give them persecution may procure friends to any cause and possibly to this but hardly any thing else can do it it is unquestionable that there are more atheists and infidels of all kinds in spain and italy where religion is so well guarded than in england and it is perhaps principally owing to the laws in favour of christianity that there are so many deists in this country for my own part i cannot help thinking the principles of dr brown very dangerous in a free state and therefore cannot but wish they were exterminated but i should not think that silencing him would be the best method of doing it no let him by all means be encouraged in making his sentiments public both that their dangerous tendency and their futility may more clearly appear     had i the direction of the press he should be welcome to my imprimatur for any thing he should please to favour the world with and ready if i know myself should i be to furnish him with every convenience in my power for that purpose it is for the interest of truth that every thing be viewed in fair and open day light and it can only be some sinister purpose that is favoured by darkness or concealment of any kind my sentiments may be fallacious but if no body were allowed to write against me how could that fallacy be made to appear be the prayer of the magnanimous ajax ever mine   ποιησον δ αιϑϱην δος δ οφϑαλμοισιν ιδεσϑαι   εν δε φαει ϰαι ολεσσον   homer lib    v       this writer artfully mentions only three opinions or principles one under each class of religion morals and politics as necessary to be guarded by civil penalties and not to be tolerated and no doubt he has chosen those principles which a friend to his country would most wish to have suppressed and with     regard to which he would least scrupulously examine the means that might be used to suppress them this britons is the method in which arbitrary power has ever been introduced and is well known to have been the method used by the thirty tyrants of athens they first cut off persons the most generally obnoxious and such as the standing laws could not reach and even that intelligent people were so far duped by their resentment that they were not aware that the very same methods might be employed to take off the worthiest men in the city and if ever arbitrary power should gain ground in england it will be by means of the seeming necessity of having recourse to illegal methods in order to come at opinions or persons generally obnoxious but when these illegal practices have once been authorized and have passed into precedents all persons and all opinions will lie at the mercy of the prime minister who will animadvert upon whatever gives him umbrage     happy would it be for the unsuspecting sons of liberty if their enemies would say at first how far they meant to proceed against them to say as dr brown does that there are many opinions and principles which ought not to be tolerated and to instance only in three is very suspicious and alarming let him say in the name of all the friends of liberty i challenge him or any of his friends to say how many more he has thought proper not to mention and what they are that we may not admit the foot of arbitrary power before we see what size of a body the monster has to follow it such is the connection and gradation of opinions that if once we admit there are some which ought to be guarded by civil penalties it will ever be impossible to distinguish to general satisfaction between those which may be tolerated and those which may not no two men living were they questioned strictly would give the same list of such fundamentals far easier were it to distinguish     the exact boundaries of the animal vegetable and mineral kingdoms in nature which yet naturalists find to be impossible but a happy circumstance it is for human society that in religion and morals there is no necessity to distinguish them at all the more important will guard themselves by their own evidence and the less important do not deserve to be guarded political principles indeed may require penal sanctions but then it is for the very same reason that religious and moral principles require none it is because they do not carry their own evidence along with them governments actually established must guard themselves by penalties and intolerance because forms of government and persons presiding in them being nearly arbitrary it may not be very evident that a different government or different governors would not be better for a state laws relating to treason are to be considered as arising from the principle of selfpreservation but even with respect     to civil government it is better not to guard every thing so strongly as that no alteration can ever be made in it nay alterations are daily proposed and daily take place in our civil government in things both of great and small consequence they are improvements in religion only that receive no countenance from the state a fate singular and hard besides so many are the subtle distinctions relating to religion and morals that no magistrate or body of magistrates could be supposed to enter into them and yet without entering into them no laws they could make would be effectual to instance in the first of dr browns principles and the most essential of them viz the being of a god the magistrate must define strictly what he means by the term god for otherwise epicureans and spinozists might be no atheists or arians or athanasians might be obnoxious to the law the magistrate must likewise punish not only those who directly maintain the     principles of atheism for evasions are so easy to find that such laws would hurt no body but he must punish those who do it indirectly and what opinions are there not in religion morals and even natural philosophy which might not be said to lead to atheism the doctrine of equivocal generation for instance might certainly be thought of this kind as well as many others which have been very harmlessly maintained by many good christians i am sensible that in the few particulars which dr brown has thought proper to mention his intolerant principles are countenanced by mr locke but as far as i can recollect these are all the opinions which he would not tolerate whereas this writer asserts there are many so that he must provide himself with some other authority for the rest besides i make no doubt the great mr locke would without the least reluctance have given up any of his assertions upon finding so bad an use made of them and     that the consequences of them were so very unfavourable to his own great object and contradictory to his leading principles and that he would with indignation have given up any adherents to arbitrary power who from such a pretence as this should have claimed his protection from the generous pursuit of the friends of liberty of reason and of mankind after all the controversy is not about men but principles and so great an enemy as mr locke to all authority in matters of opinion would not have been so inconsistent as to have excepted his own it will be said that a regard to liberty itself must plead for one exception to the principles of toleration the papists it is alledged are such determined enemies to liberty civil and ecclesiastical and so effectually alienated from the interests of a protestant country and government that protestants who have a regard for their own safety and the great cause in which they are engaged cannot tolerate them if they do it it is at their own   0 peril so that the persecution of papists is in fact nothing more than a dictate of selfpreservation this plea i own is plausible and two centuries ago it is no wonder it had considerable weight but persecution by protestants in this enlightened age appears so utterly repugnant to the great principle of their cause that i wish they would view it in every point of light before they seriously adopt any such measure and i cannot help thinking that the result of a more mature consideration of this subject will not be to render evil for evil to our old mother church but rather a more indulgent treatment than we have as yet vouchsafed to afford her in the first place i cannot imagine that the increase of popery in these kingdoms will ever be so considerable as to give any just alarm to the friends of liberty all the address and assiduity of man cannot certainly recommend so absurd a system of faith and practice to     any but the lowest and most illiterate of our common people who can never have any degree of influence in the state the number of popish gentry must grow less partly through the influence of fashion and partly through the conviction of those who have a liberal education which will necessarily throw protestant books into their hands the french translator of warburtons alliance in an address to cardinal fleury in which he recommends such a system of church establishment and toleration as this of the bishop of gloucester observes that the number of roman catholicks in england diminishes every day and that the only reason why they are not so good subjects in this country as they are in holland is that they are under more restraints here if the popish priests and missionaries have the success which it is pretended they have i am almost persuaded that the most effectual arguments they have employed for this purpose have been     drawn from the rigour of our present laws respecting the papists they tell the people that conscious of the weakness of our cause we dare not give them full liberty to teach and exercise their religion knowing that the excellency of it is such that if it were publicly exhibited it would attract universal admiration and that what we are not able to silence by argument we suppress by force besides the traces and remains of popery are so striking in the book of common prayer and in the whole of our ecclesiastical establishment that the derivation of it from the popish system cannot be concealed and hence it may not be difficult for an artful papist to persuade many of the common people to quit the shadow and have recourse to the substance to abandon the interests of an apostate child and adopt that of its ancient and venerable parent let the church of england then before it be too late make a farther reformation     from popery and leave fewer of the symbols of the romish church about her and the ideas of her members being more remote from every thing that has any connection with popery the popish missionaries will have much more difficulty in making them comprehend and relish it a convert to popery from any of the sects of protestant dissenters who are farther removed from the popish system than the church of england is very rarely heard of and this effect is not owing to any particular care of their ministers to guard their hearers against popery but because the whole system of their faith and practice is so contrary to it that even the common people among them would as soon turn mahometans or pagans as become papists instead then of using more rigour with the papists let us allow them a full toleration we should at least by this means be better judges of their number and increase and i also think they would be much less formidable in     these circumstances than they are at present if they be enemies an open enemy is less dangerous than a secret one and if our ecclesiastical establishment must not be reformed and removed farther from popery let the clergy as the best succedaneum for such an effectual antidote against their poison show more zeal in the discharge of their parochial duties and give more attention to their flocks half the zeal which the papists employ to make converts would be more than sufficient to prevent any from being made whose business is it to counteract the endeavours of the popish emissaries but those whom the state has appointed the guardians of the people in spiritual matters and what is their calling in the aid of the civil power but an acknowledgement of a neglect of their proper duty it may be said that the particular situation of this country should be a motive with all the friends of our happy constitution to keep a watchful eye over the papists since a popish religion may     at length fix a popish pretender upon the throne of these kingdoms seriously as this argument for persecution might have been urged formerly i cannot help thinking that ever since the last rebellion the apprehension on which it is grounded is become absolutely chimerical and therefore that it does not deserve a serious answer after the pope himself has refused to acknowledge the heir of the stuart family to be king of england what can a papist as such have to plead for him and for my own part i make no doubt there are men of good sense among the popish gentry at least and persons of property of that persuasion as well as among persons of other religious professions and therefore that if they lay under fewer civil disadvantages they would not only chearfully acquiesce in but would become zealously attached to our excellent form of free government and that upon any emergency they would bravely stand up for it protestant as it is in opposition to any popish system of arbitrary power whatever     besides when a popish country is at this very time showing us an example of a toleration more perfect in several respects than any which the church of england allows to those who dissent from her is it not time to advance a little farther political considerations may justly be allowed to have some weight in this case france may reasonably be expected to follow and improve upon the example of poland and if we do not make some speedy improvement of liberty that great and indefatigable rival power by one master stroke of policy may almost depopulate this great and flourshing kingdom we often hear it said that if france grows wise and admits of toleration england is undone novelty and a milder climate will no doubt attract multitudes and whenever the french make a reformation as their minds are much more enlightened than those of the english reformers were when our     present establishment was fixed their reformation will in all probability be much more perfect than ours and if the french through our folly and the ambition avarice or baseness of some spiritual dignitaries should be permitted to take the lead in this noble work and our emulation be not roused by their example the future motto of england may with too much propriety be taken from bacons speaking statute time is past section vi some distinctions that have been made on the subject of religious liberty and toleration considered in order to illustrate some of the fundamental principles of religious liberty i beg the readers indulgence while i animadvert on a few distinctions that have been suggested by some persons who     have written at different times on this subject and which i think have tended to introduce confusion into our ideas concerning it many of my readers may think some of the cases i shall mention unworthy of the notice i have taken of them but i hope they will excuse my giving them a place in this section when they consider that it is at least possible they may have occasioned some difficulty to other persons unused to these speculations i religion is sometimes considered as of a personal and sometimes as of a political nature in some measure indeed every thing that concerns individuals must affect the societies which they compose but it by no means follows that it is therefore right or wise for societies i e mankind collectively taken to intermeddle with every thing so as to make laws and appoint sanctions concerning every thing because in numberless cases more confusion and inconvenience would necessarily arise from the interference than from the     want of it since individuals are in many respects better situated for the purpose of judging and providing for themselves than magistrates as such can be these and many other reasons lead me to consider the business of religion and every thing fairly connected with it as intirely a personal concern and altogether foreign to the nature object and use of civil magistracy besides there is something in the nature of religion that makes it more than out of the proper sphere or province of the civil magistrate to intermeddle with it the duties of religion properly understood seem to be in some measure incompatible with the interference of the civil power for the purpose and object of religion necessarily suppose the powers of individuals and a responsibility which is the consequence of those powers so that the civil magistrate by taking any of those powers from individuals and assuming them to himself doth so far incapacitate them for the   0 duties of religion if for instance i be commanded by divine authority to search the scriptures and the magistrate forbid me the use of them how can i discharge my duty and for the same reason i must think the authority of the magistrates opposed to that of god in every case in which human laws impede the use of my faculties in matters of religion as a being capable of immortal life which is a thing of infinitely more consequence to me than all the political considerations of this world i must endeavour to render myself acceptable to god by such dispositions and such conduct as he has required in order to fit me for future happiness for this purpose it is evidently requisite that i diligently use my reason in order to make myself acquainted with the will of god and also that i have liberty to do whatever i believe he requires provided i do not molest my fellow creatures by such assumed liberty but all human establishments as such obstruct freedom of     inquiry in matters of religion by laying an undue bias upon the mind if they be not such as by their express constitutions prevent all inquiry and preclude every possible effect of it christianity by being a more spiritual and moral constitution than any other form of religion that ever appeared in the world requires men to think and act for themselves more accurately than any other but human establishments by calling off mens attention from the commandments of god to those of men tend to defeat the great ends of religion they are therefore incompatible with the genius of christianity ii in examining the right of the civil magistrate to establish any mode of religion or that of the subject to oppose it the goodness of the religion or of the mode of it is not to be taken into the question but only the propriety which is the same with the utility of the civil magistrate as such interfering in the business for what the magistrate may think to be     very just and even conducive to the good of society the subject may think to be wrong and hurtful to it if a christian magistrate hath a right to establish any mode of the christian religion or the christian religion in general a mahometan governor must have the same right to establish the mahometan religion and no liberty can be claimed by a christian under a mahometan government to exercise the christian religion that may not in the same degree be claimed by a mahometan subject of a christian government to exercise the mahometan religion also if it be unreasonable and oppressive to oblige christian subjects to support the mahometan religion it is equally unreasonable and oppressive to oblige a mahometan to support the christian religion in the place where he resides or to oblige christians of one denomination to support another mode of it which they do not approve the authority of god and conscience may always with equal justice be opposed to human authority and the appeal     of peter and john to the jewish magistrates concerning their obligation to obey god rather than man will equally serve a protestant in a popish establishment or a dissenter of any kind in a protestant one it is of no avail to the papist or the protestant in any establishment to pretend that the religion they enforce is true or that it is the same in general with that which those who dissent from them profess because the protestant and the dissenter do not object to the establishment in those respects in which they believe it to be true but in those in which they believe it to be false and to require them to believe and do what their conscience disapproves and for a protestant of any denomination whatever to maintain his own right to resist the impositions of a popish government and at the same time to insist upon a right to impose upon his fellow christians of other protestant denominations is too absurd to admit of a formal refutation     iii some persons of narrow minds may be ready to admit of a plea for the toleration of all sects of protestants they may bear them some degree of good will as brethren or at least as distant relations though the blood in their veins be not equally pure with their own but in order to demonstrate that there may be a licentiousness in toleration and that we must stop somewhere they say what must we do with heathens and atheists i answer the very same that you christians would wish that heathens and atheists in your situation should do to you being in theirs if your party has been so long in power that you cannot even in supposition separate the idea of it from that of the authority which has been so long connected with it read the history of the primitive church and see what it was that the first christians wished and pleaded for under the pagan emperors read the antient christian apologies and do the insidels of the present age the justice to put them or at least part of them into their mouths     iv others have the moderation and good sense to admit the reasonableness of persons being allowed to judge for themselves and to think as they please in matters of religion and even to exercise whatever mode of religion their consciences approve of but they will not admit of any thing that has a tendency to increase the obnoxious sect no publication of books or other attempts to make proselytes not even a reflection upon the established religion though it be necessary to a vindication of their own but what signifies a privilege of judging for ourselves if we have not the necessary means of forming a right judgment by the perusal of books containing the evidence of both sides of the question what some distinguish by the names of active and passive opposition to an established religion differ only in name and degree to defend myself and to attack my adversary is in many cases the very same thing and the one cannot be done without the other     besides the persons who make use of this distinction should consider that for the reasons they alledge the jewish rulers did right to forbid peter and john to preach or to teach in the name of jesus of nazareth and that peter and john did wrong in not submitting to that prohibition they should consider that the primitive christians under heathen governments had no right according to their maxims to any thing more than the private exercise of their worship and that they offended against the powers that then were and that were ordained of god when they wrote their excellent books and took the pains they did to propagate their religion among all ranks of men and among all nations of the world though they acted in obedience to the solemn injunction of our lord who bade them go and preach the gospel to every creature by the gospel every christian will and must understand the gospel in its purity i e what he apprehends to be the pure gospel in opposition not only to     heathenism and religions fundamentally false but to erroneous christianity or to religions that are in part true whatever be the religious opinions therefore that i seriously think are agreeable to the word of god and of importance to the happiness of mankind i look upon myself as obliged to take every prudent method of propagating them both by the use of speech and writing and the man who refrains from doing this when he is convinced that he should do good upon the whole by attempting it whatever risque he might run in consequence of opposing antichristian establishments is a traitor to his proper lord and master and shows that he fears more them who can only kill the body whether by the heathen methods of beheading crucifying throwing to the wild beasts c or the christian methods of burning alive and roasting before a slow fire than him who can cast both soul and body into hell v it is said by some who think themselves obliged to vindicate the conduct of     christ and his apostles that though no general plea to oppose an established religion can be admitted in excuse of a pretended reformer yet that a special plea such as a belief of a divine commission will excuse him but i can see no material difference in these cases the voice of conscience is in all cases as the voice of god to every man it is therefore my duty to endeavour to enlighten the minds of my friends my countrymen and mankind in general as far as i have ability and opportunity and to exert myself with more or less zeal in proportion as i myself shall judge the importance of the occasion requires let my honest endeavours be considered as ever so factious and seditious by those who are aggrieved by them it is no new cry among the enemies of reformation the men who have turned the world upside down are come hither also vi there are some who confine the obligation to propagate christianity to the clergy and even to those of them     who have a regular commission for that purpose according to the form of established churches and say that laymen cannot be under any obligation to trouble themselves about it in whatever part of the world they be cast and what they say concerning the propagation of christianity they would extend to the reformation of it but i can see no foundation for this distinction either in reason or in the scriptures the propagation or reformation of christianity is comprehended in the general idea of promoting useful knowledge of any kind and this is certainly the duty of every man in proportion to his ability and opportunity our saviour gives no hint of any difference between clergy and laity among his disciples the twelve apostles were only distinguished by him as appointed witnesses of his life death and resurrection after the descent of the holy ghost supernatural gifts were equally communicated to all christian converts the distinction of elders was only such   0 as years and experience intitled men to and only respected the internal government of particular churches as to the propagation of christianity abroad or the reformation of corruptions in it at home there is nothing in the scriptures that can lead us to imagine it to be the duty of one man more than another every man who understands the christian religion i consider as having the same commission to teach it as that of any bishop in england or in rome vii some of the advocates for establishments lay great stress on the distinction between positive and negative restraints put upon dissenters the former they affect to disclaim but the latter they avow and pretend that it is no persecution but here i can find no real difference except in degree an exclusion from an advantage and a subjection to a positive disadvantage agree in this that a man who is subject to either of them is in a worse condition on that account than he would otherwise have been if a man for conscience sake be     excluded from a lucrative office to which another person of a different persuasion has access he suffers as much as if the office had been open to him and a fine equal to the advantage he would have gained by it imposed upon him nay it is easy to suppose cases in which negative restraints may be a greater hardship than positive ones the interdiction of fire and water is not a sentence of positive punishment and yet banishment or death must be the consequence notwithstanding all this negative restraints however severe must not be called persecution while positive restraints how light soever cannot be denied to fall under that obnoxious appellation in reality those who defend the necessity and propriety of laying dissenters under negative restraints without chusing to be advocates for positive ones are only afraid of the term persecution which happily for the friends of liberty lies under an odium at present but their arguments would be much clearer and lose nothing     of their strength and their ideas would be more free from confusion if they would openly maintain that a certain degree of persecution was just though certain degrees of it were unjust and they might easily say that they could not pretend to fix any precise boundary in this case but must leave it to be determined by circumstances section vii farther observations concerning the extent of ecclesiastical authority and the power of civil governors in matters of religion it is said that a christian church or a christian society and the power of christian societies are certainly spoken of in the new testament that societies cannot subsist without officers and laws     nor can laws be enforced without penalties all this and every consequence of the like nature is readily granted but the sanctions of the church of christ in this world are like itself and like the weapons of the christian warfare not carnal and temporal but of a spiritual nature and do not affect a mans person life liberty or estate all that our saviour directs in case of the greatest refractoriness is to consider such obstinate offenders as heathen men and publicans that is we are justified in ceasing to look upon them as brethren and fellow christians and they are not intitled to our peculiar affection and attention as such the delivering over to satan which st paul mentions as a punishment for the greatest offence that could be committed in the christian church is not a delivering over to the civil magistrate or to the executioner in short all that the new testament authorizes a christian church or its officers to do is to exclude from their society those persons whom they deem unworthy of it there is no hint     of such excluded members lying under any civil disqualification if they were not to be considered as christians and proper members of christian societies they were still men proper members of civil society and not liable to civil penalties unless they had likewise offended against the laws of the state the horrid sentence of excommunication as it is in use in the church of rome or the church of england is well known not to have been introduced into the christian church till the roman emperors became christians and was not established in its full extent till about the fifth century when it was adopted by the barbarous celtes and other germanic nations and made similar to what they had practised in their own druidical religion which was in this respect analogous to that of the hindoos in both of them excommunication was the heaviest punishment that could be incurred in human society as it cut a man off from all the benefits of it     it will be said that in the times of st paul temporal penalties were inflicted upon members of the christian church for their irregularities committed in it for this cause says the apostle some are weak and sickly among you and some sleep which is generally understood to refer to sickness and death as a punishment for their shameful abuse of the institution of the lords supper but it should be considered that these punishments were the immediate act of god and in the strictest sense miraculous like the death of ananias and sapphira or the blindness of elymas the sorcerer these cases therefore will not authorize punishments inflicted by men all that can be done to those who are guilty of contempt against church power is to leave them to the judgment of god who will sufficiently protect his church and who is a better judge of its real danger than man can be and if he chuse to bear with such offenders what have we to do to obstruct the effects of his long suffering and mercy     i have no objection however on my own account to allowing ecclesiastical officers to do more than christ than st paul or the other apostles ever pretended to let them not only predict but if their zeal prompt them to it let them imprecate divine judgments let them pray that god would speedily plead his own cause taking it for granted to be their own were i the obnoxious person i should be very easy upon the occasion provided their own cruel and merciless hands were not upon me it is allowed by many that christian churches as such and its officers as such have no right to inflict civil punishments but they say the civil magistrate may embrace the christian religion and enforce its precepts by civil penalties but have civil magistrates when they become christians a power of altering or new modelling the christian religion any more than other members of the christian church if not its laws and sanctions remain just as they did before such as jesus christ and his apostles left     them and the things that may have been substituted in their place cannot be called christianity but are something else if the civil magistrate chuse to become a christian by all means let the doors of the christian church be open to him as they ought to be to all without distinction or respect of persons but when he is in let him be considered as no more than any other private christian give him a vote in all cases in which the whole assembly is concerned but let him like others be subject to church censures and even to be excommunicated or excluded for notorious ill behaviour it is certainly contrary to all ideas of common sense to suppose that civil magistrates embracing christianity have therefore a power of making laws for the christian church and enforcing the observance of them by sanctions altogether unsuitable to its nature the idea cannot be admitted without supposing a total change in the very first     principles and essentials of christianity if civil penalties be introduced into the christian church it is in every sense and to every purpose making it a kingdom of this world its governors then assume a power over mens persons and property a power unknown in the institutes of our religion if moreover the civil magistrate take upon him to prescribe creeds and confessions of faith as is the case in england what is it but to usurp a dominion over the faith of christians a power which the apostles themselves expressly disclaimed it may be said that the civil magistrate upon embracing christianity and being convinced of the excellency of its precepts may chuse to incorporate them into his scheme of civil policy and enforce them by civil penalties not as matters of religion but as belonging to civil government thus christ has forbidden polygamy and the civil magistrate a turk for instance being converted to christianity in order to put an end to the former custom may make     it death to marry two wives he may also think the ministers of the christian church a very respectable order of men and invest them with civil power whereby they may be enabled to inflict civil punishments in cases where before they could only make use of admonitions and he may tax the people for their support thinking one mode of christianity preferable to another may he not also arm its ministers with a civil power for suppressing the rest when before they could only have used arguments for this purpose are civil and ecclesiastical powers so very incompatible that the same persons may not be invested with both were not all heads of families both kings and priests in the patriarchal times i answer that whatever regulations the civil magistrate may adopt yet as his adopting of them and enforcing them by civil penalties makes them confessedly to be of a civil nature he is not intitled to obedience with respect to them so far as they are of a religious   0 nature if therefore any private christian should differ in opinion from his civil magistrate or those invested by him with civil power with respect to those things which are of a religious nature he cannot consider himself as under any more obligation to submit to him than he would be to submit to a heathen magistrate in the same case a conscientious christian will never hesitate about obeying god rather than man though that man should be a magistrate or though he should be a christian and assume the title of supreme head of the whole or any part of the christian church any other maxims than these it is evident might be attended with the utter subversion of the christian religion for the civil magistrate would have nothing to do but to adopt christianity into his system of civil policy and then having the whole within his own cognizance he might add and alter at pleasure till he had made it quite a different thing from what he found it     it is upon this principle of the civil magistrate converting christianity into civil policy or something similar to it that dr balguy and i believe most of the advocates for church power in england at present found their claim to ecclesiastical authority the clergy of former ages went upon quite another ground they claimed authority jure divino and scorned to derive their power from the civil magistrate these two species of authority were perpetually opposed to one another and the church encroached upon the state or the state upon the church as opportunity favoured their respective attempts insomuch that the history of europe in the dark ages is little more than an account of the violent struggles between these two contrary powers the romish clergy still keep up the same pretences and so did the clergy of the church of england till they were fairly argued or laughed out of them upon this they have lately set up another claim to power not contrary to but     under that of the civil magistrate in their present ideas the ecclesiastical establishment is a creature of the state they consider themselves as civil officers employed by the king to teach the religion the state has adopted and they receive their wages as other servants of the crown now admitting all this what have the people to do with them as ministers of the gospel and servants of jesus christ since they teach for doctrines the commandments of men hitherto the christian people of this country have imagined that their ministers came to them with a commission from christ to teach them the things that relate to their everlasting happiness and thereby secure the salvation of their immortal souls hitherto they have held them in reverence as successors of the apostles and submitted themselves to them as to persons who watched for their souls as those who must give an account to their chief shepherd when he shall appear and who for their good were invested with spiritual     power independent of all human authority should they not now therefore be apprized that their ghostly superiors have of late renounced the principle on which they have hitherto yielded them obedience and that their clergy chuse to rank with justices of the peace and other civil and crown officers that they may accordingly change the mode of respect they have hitherto paid them not that i wonder that the advocates for the church of england have changed the ground of their defence and that they are not a little embarassed with their temporal supreme head it was a thing that was quite new in the christian church a thing that was by no means their own choice originally but was forced upon them and what they are now obliged to make the best of so that if one hypothesis will not support the innovation they must have recourse to another     at this day articles of faith and rules of church discipline are enacted and liable to be abrogated by acts of parliament whereas all this business was formerly done in synods and general councils which acknowledged less dependence on the civil power and low as is my opinion of the persons who composed the synods and general councils of former times i cannot help thinking them more competent judges of articles of christian faith than any king of england assisted or not assisted by an english parliament when these temporal powers shall think proper to enact any more ecclesiastical canons or confessions of faith i hope that for the sake of decency they will purge the two houses of those members who cannot give satisfactory evidence that they are christians at all but upon recollection dr balguy will not think this circumstance necessary since according to his determination the civil magistrate is not to provide for himself but for the largest sect among his subjects and therefore a mahometan magistrate might be as safely     trusted to make christian constitutions as any christian magistrate whatever perhaps he might be thought more proper since having no bias in favour of any particular sect of christians he might be expected to be a more impartial judge in the case the reason which the bishop of gloucester gives for the propriety of making the civil magistrate the supreme head of the church whereby he becomes possessed of the sole right of ordering and decreeing every thing that the ministers and officers of the church had before a power of doing so that even all matters of opinion are out of the jurisdiction of the church is really curious the church it seems wants protection from external violence this protection the state only can give to it but says this author protection not being to be afforded to any person or body without power over that person or body in the person or body     protecting it necessarily follows that the civil magistrate must be supreme i cannot help thinking that the church according to this author made a very hard bargain and paid very dear for protection might not the state have been content to protect the church without dictating to her in ecclesiastical matters certainly at the time this famous alliance was made the agents for the church were under a panick and must have forgotten that christ himself had promised to protect his church to be with it to the end of the world and that the gates of hell should not prevail against it were it not for the power to favour the professors of religion with which magistrates are invested one might wonder how of all mankind they should ever have been thought of as proper to take the lead in an affair of this nature i should much sooner have thought of applying to them to superintend the business of medicine in which the healths     and lives of their subjects are so much concerned but happily for mankind they have not taken it into their heads to intermeddle so much with it the reason is that there is nothing in the business of medicine of which they could avail themselves whereas a league with priests who have always a great influence over mankind has often been extremely convenient for them of all mankind surely magistrates have the least leisure and the least capacity for judging in matters of religion consequently they are most likely to determine rashly and in such a manner as best suits with their worldly views of this we have a notable example in the hamptoncourt conference there the advocates for presbyterianism and episcopacy had a solemn meeting to debate on the merits of their respective modes of church government in the presence of king james i of blessed memory in the church of england at a time when perhaps a majority of the nation were disposed in favour of presbyterianism     but was a king with his head full of the notions of arbitrary power in a proper disposition to decide a controversy of this nature and might it not have been expected that the maxim no bishop no king would be sufficient to determine his choice against the weight of a thousand solid arguments the issue of the conference is well known but no better than it was before it took place such cause have the advocates for episcopacy to boast of their triumph the history of this hamptoncourt controversy so admirably exemplifies the reasoning of the bishop of gloucester that i wonder it was not adduced by him in aid of his argument to prove that the civil magistrate is more likely to decide according to truth in matters of religion than churchmen let us hear the great champion himself on this subject as this part of his argument seems to be the great hinge on which the most important part of the controversy concerning establishments turns     church sanctity being acquired by secession and retirement from human affairs and that secession rendering men ignorant of civil society its rights and interests in the place of which will succeed all the follies of superstition and fanaticism we must needs conclude that religion under such directors and reformers will deviate from truth and consequently a capacity in proportion of serving society on the other hand when religion comes under the magistrates directions its purity must needs be well supported and preserved for truth and public utility coinciding the civil magistrate as such will see it for his interest to seek after and promote truth in religion and by means of public utility which his office enables him so well to understand he will never be at a loss to know where such truth is to be found so that it is impossible under this civil influence for religion ever to deviate far from truth risum teneatis amici   0 i shall only observe in answer to this curious piece of reasoning that in an advertisement prefixed to this very work he says it is a trite observation that divines make bad politicians i believe it is more generally true that politicians are but bad divines a confession which i own i should not have expected from a man who in the very same book pleads for the propriety of making these same politicians alias bad divines the final judges in all ecclesiastical causes and for giving them a power of enacting articles of faith and ecclesiastical canons this author indeed thinks there is a necessity for churchmen making part the legislative body lest instead of being subjects they should be the slaves of the state p    but so long as the bishops in parliament have no negative upon the resolutions of the house a privilege which this bishop himself would not allow them i do not see what their seat there would avail them if all the laity should differ from them in their opinion     concerning religious matters in this case ecclesiastical canons would be made and articles of faith enacted as contrary to their inclinations as if they had not been consulted at all so that in case of an opposition between the two powers the clergy are still entirely at the mercy of the laity and therefore their slaves upon the whole considering every thing relating to this new business of a temporal head over christians who are expressly commanded to call no man master upon earth and considering how averse the clergy always were to such a catastrophe in their affairs and how little they were prepared for it i cannot help thinking that they have given very striking proofs of their acuteness and presence of mind in defending it so plausibly as they have done to make this case of a temporal head to a spiritual church the more intelligible let us suppose there are in any country a number of persons who have formed     themselves into a society for promoting natural philosophy that the civil magistrate hears of it and having a taste for the study becomes a member if upon this he should take upon him to make laws for the society and to enforce them with civil penalties or if he should compel the members to subscribe to particular propositions and hypotheses should we not pronounce that the philosophical society was to all intents and purposes dissolved in like manner a christian magistrate pretending to make laws to the christian church is to be considered as doing every thing in his power to abolish christianity and setting up something else in its place that may be more or less like it just as it shall happen it may be said that an union of civil and ecclesiastical power may take place in another manner namely by a nation of christians voluntarily chusing the civil magistrate to be their protector or head and to make laws for them so also a society of philosophers may chuse     the civil magistrate for their protector and head but if in this case he should compel their assent to his own opinions would it not be thought that notwithstanding their choice of the civil magistrate for their head if they submitted to his impositions they ceased to be what they were before and the society changed its nature and character in like manner christians act altogether out of character in chusing a temporal head and no person who has a just regard to his religion and the liberty wherewith christ has made him free will ever acknowledge such a dependence on the civil power whenever therefore the civil magistrate either in consequence of becoming a member of the christian church by incorporating christianity into his system of civil policy or by being chosen supreme head of the church in a christian nation introduces into the gospel such laws and sanctions as are evidently unsuitable to the nature of it as for instance when instead of voluntary contributions to the church     stock he appoints the compulsory payment of dues and when for exhortation and reproof he substitutes fines and confiscations torture and death this new modelled scheme cannot be called christianity thus when the poor in england became intitled to a legal maintenance charity on which they before subsisted was so far precluded for a man who now pays a poor rate is not to be ranked with him who gives alms of that which he possesses in all cases a change in the fundamental maxims of government especially a change both in the laws themselves and in the sanctions of them cannot be deemed less than a change in the constitution for my own part i can conceive no method whatever in which the civil magistrate can be invested with ecclesiastical power or ecclesiastics with civil power so that a conscientious christian shall consider himself as under any obligation to yield them obedience in their new character in civil matters he will obey the civil magistrate and where religion     is concerned he will listen to nothing but the dictates of his own conscience or the admonitions of his chosen spiritual guide and to him no farther than he is satisfied he has a better authority than his own for what he says however they agree to change or mix their powers their alliance and stipulations will have no weight with him he will still give to cæsar the things that are cæsars and unto god the things that are gods and he will judge for himself what are the things that are due to the one or the other if he should make any mistake in this case it will be some apology for him that his superiors had confounded his understanding by the unnatural mixture they had made of things of such different natures had there been such a connection between ecclesiastical and civil matters as the advocates for church power contend for had it been the proper office of the civil magistrate to superintend the affairs of religion and had it been unlawful as some assert for private persons to attempt     any alteration in it except by application to the civil governor is it not unaccountable that our lord and his apostles did not make their first proposals to the supreme magistrates among the jews or romans they certainly had no idea of the peculiar obligation of magistrates to attend to this business and to chuse a religion for the people since we never hear of their making application to them on any such account it was their constant custom to preach the gospel wherever they came in all companies and to all persons promiscuously and almost all the intercourse they had with magistrates seems to have been on occasion of their being brought before them as criminals our lord sent out both his twelve apostles and also seventy disciples among all the cities of israel but we do not read of his sending any deputation to the rulers of the jews john the baptist seems to have confined his preaching to the wilderness of judea and the territory in the neighbourhood of the river     jordan where he gave his exhortations to all that came to hear him without distinction of persons st paul indeed made an appeal to cæsar but it was in order to obtain his liberty in an unjust prosecution we are not informed that he or any of the apostles ever took any measures to lay the evidences of the christian religion before the roman emperor or the roman senate in order to convince them of the truth and excellency of it and induce them to abolish heathenism in favour of it throughout the roman empire which many persons would now think to have been the readiest the most proper and the best method of christianizing the world on the contrary their whole conduct shows that they considered religion as the proper and immediate concern of every single person and that there was no occasion whatever to consult or advise with any earthly superior in a case of this nature if magistrates had a right to chuse a mode of religion for their people much more one would think had masters a     right to chuse for their slaves in this case yet we find great numbers of converts were made amongst this most dependent part of mankind without any account of their masters being consulted or applied to about it the contrary is clearly inferred from the first view of things in primitive times though it be true that we must not expect to find in the scriptures an accurate account of every thing belonging to a christian church including a minute description of the rank and power of its officers it does not therefore follow that it is not worth our while to consult them on this subject for we shall find such a general view of the mutual relations and reciprocal duties of christians as may prevent our making any considerable mistake with respect to the authority of some or the subjection of others it cannot be inferred from any thing that our saviour has delivered that any one christian has a right authoritatively to dictate or prescribe to another but i     think the very contrary if it be in the power of words to convey such a meaning if we consider the plan of the primitive church we shall see that it was evidently formed upon that of the jewish synagogue in which the elders all of whom promiscuously instructed the rest were persons of the greatest age and experience and he that is called the ruler of the synagogue to which the office of the christian bishop corresponds was only one of them distinguished indeed by some titles of honour but with no superior power worth mentioning this is the reason why both the rulers of the synagogues among the jews and bishops in christian churches are generally called elders in common with the rest the office of deacon was also the same in both and needs no description in this place the apostles always represent themselves as appointed witnesses of the life sufferings and resurrection of christ   0 but seem not to have arrogated any dominion over the faith of their fellow christians so far were they from assuming any authority over their brethren or peremptorily enjoining any thing of themselves except they were authorized to do it by the immediate direction of the holy ghost that they virtually disclaimed all such power and when their advice was not taken and their designs obstructed they wrote as persons who had nothing but reason on their side without dictating or giving themselves such airs as modern dignitaries in the church would assume in case of such opposition     section viii of the necessity or utility of ecclesiastical establishments the friends and advocates for church power generally found their system on the necessity of establishing some religion or other agreeably they say to the custom of all wise nations this being admitted it is evident they think that the supreme civil magistrate must have the choice of this religion and being thus lodged in the hands of the chief magistrate it is easily and effectually guarded thus the propriety of a most rigid intolerance and the most abject passive obedience are presently and clearly inferred so that the people have no right to relieve themselves from ecclesiastical     oppressions except by petition to their temporal and spiritual governors whose interest it generally is to continue every abuse that the people can complain of but before this admirably connected system can be admitted a few things should be previously considered and i am aware that if they had been duly attended to the system either would never have taken place or it would have been so moderated when put into execution as that it would never have been worth the while of its advocates to contend so zealously for it   all the rational plea for ecclesiastical establishments is founded on the necessity of them in order to enforce obedience to civil laws but though religious considerations be allowed to be an excellent aid to civil sanctions it will not therefore follow as some would gladly have it understood that therefore the business of civil government could not have been carried on at all     without them i do not know how it is that this position seems in general to have passed without dispute or examination but for my own part i see no reason to think that civil society could not have subsisted and even have subsisted very well without the aid of any foreign sanctions i am even satisfied that in many countries the junction of civil and ecclesiastical powers hath done much mischief and that it would have been a great blessing to the bulk of the people if their magistrates had never interfered in matters of religion at all but had left them to provide for themselves in that respect as they generally do with regard to medicine there are says the bishop of gloucester a numerous set of duties of imperfect obligation which human laws could not reach this can only be done by an ecclesiastical jurisdiction intrusted by the state with coercive power and indeed the supplying that     defect which these courts do supply was the original and fundamental motive of the state seeking this alliance but i would ask are not ecclesiastical officers men mere human beings possessed of only a limited power of discernment as well as civil officers will they not therefore find themselves under the same difficulty in enforcing the duties of imperfect obligation that the civil officers would have done notwithstanding the coercive power they receive from the state for that purpose in short i do not see what an ecclesiastical court can do in this case more than a civil court of equity is not this in fact confessed by this author when he allows p    that there must be an appeal from these courts to the civil in all cases for if the civil courts be qualified to judge of these things by appeal why could they not have done it in the first instance   if the expediency of ecclesiastical establishments be allowed it is allowed on account of their utility only and     therefore as there are infinite differences in the coercive power of these establishments this reason will not justify their being carried to a greater extent than the good of society requires and though it may be productive of or at least consistent with the good of society that the civil magistrate should give some degree of countenance to the professors of one sect of religion which with me however is extremely problematical it were a gross perversion of all reasoning and common sense to infer from thence that the people should not have free liberty to dissent from this religion of their civil governor or even to use any honest and fair method of gaining converts to what they should think to be the truth because whatever utility there may be in ecclesiastical establishments there is certainly utility in truth especially moral and religious truth and truth can never have a fair chance of being discovered or propagated without the most perfect freedom of inquiry and debate     though it may be true that there never was any country without some national religion it is not true that these religions were always adopted with a view to aid the civil government it appears to me that with respect to the states of greece and other barbarous nations for the greeks were no better than their neighbours in this respect motives of a very different nature from these motives derived from nothing but the most blind and abject superstition and the most groundless apprehensions were those that really induced them to make such rigid provision for the perpetuity of their several religions their laws have not in fact any such intermixture of civil and religious matters as is now found in the systems of european states we do not find in them that duties properly religious are enforced by civil sanctions nor duties properly civil enforced by religious ones in the senses in which we now use those terms as if these things had naturally so necessary a connection but in these ignorant and superstitious ages men fancied there was what we should     call an arbitrary connection between the observance of certain religious rites and the continuance of certain states and that the gods who were particularly attentive to their preservation would withdraw their protection upon the disuse of those ceremonies the bishop of gloucester seems to agree with me in this for he says the unity of the object of faith and conformity to a formulary of dogmatick theology as the terms of communion is the great foundation and bond of religious society now this the several societies of pagan religion wanted in which there was only a conformity in national ceremonies had the antient heathens entertained any such notion of the direct subserviency of religion to civil policy i e in a moral view as the advocates for church power endeavour to avail themselves of at this day they would have made a     distinction among religions whereas it is plain they had no idea of the excellence of one mode of religion above another as more conducive to the happiness of mankind unless there was something peculiarly shocking in some of their rites as that of sacrificing human victims but they imagined that different rites rites differing not in moral excellence but in mere form were necessary for different states and that it was wrong and hazardous for two nations to interchange their religions indeed after these establishments had taken place it is probable that some of the defenders of them in ransacking their imaginations for arguments might hit upon some such reasons as modern high churchmen have urged but it no more follows from thence that the establishments were originally founded on those principles than that because plausible reasons may for any thing i know be alledged for the use of a white surplice in reading the prayers of the church and for bishops wearing mitres and lawn     sleeves that therefore jesus christ and his apostles used them   though there may be no christian country in which some species of christianity is not more or less established i e more or less favoured by the government yet there are countries in which less favour is shown to the prevailing mode than in others and in which much less care is taken to guard it as in holland russia pensilvania and i believe others of our american colonies now let an enquiry be made into the state of these countries and see whether the result of it will be favourable or unfavourable to establishments what tendency to inconvenience has there been observed in those states in which church government is most relaxed and what superior advantages in point of real happiness are enjoyed in those countries in which it is strained to the highest pitch i have no doubt of the result of such an inquiry turning out greatly in favour of the relaxation of religious establishments if not of their total suppression a just   0 view of all the real evils that attend the ecclesiastical establishment in england with respect to knowledge virtue commerce and many other things with which the happiness of states is connected but more especially with respect to liberty would be sufficient to deter any legislator from introducing any thing like it into a new state unless without thinking at all he took it for granted that there was no doing without one or was so weak as to be frighted by the mere clamour of bigots   though it may be true that inconvenience would arise from the immediate suppression of religious establishments it doth not therefore follow that they were either necessary or expedient that the nation would have been in a worse state if they had never existed and that no measures ought to be taken to relax or dissolve them were the religion of mahomet abolished every where at once no doubt much confusion would be occasioned yet what christian would for that reason wish for the perpetuity of     that superstition the same may be said of popery and many other kinds of corrupt religion customs of whatever kind that have prevailed so long as to have influenced the genius and manners of a whole nation cannot be changed without trouble such a shock to mens prejudices would necessarily give them pain and unhinge them for a time it is the same with vicious habits of the body which terminate in diseases and death but must they be indulged and the fatal consequences calmly expected because the patient would find it painful and difficult to alter his method of living ecclesiastical establishments therefore may be a real evil and a disease in civil society and a dangerous one too notwithstanding all the arguments for the support of them derived from the confusion and inconvenience attending their dissolution so far is this consideration from proving them to be things excellent or useful in themselves even the mischiefs that might be apprehended from attempts to amend or     dissolve establishments are much aggravated by writers much less opposition i am persuaded would arise from the source of real bigotry than from the quarter of interest and the bigotry that was set in motion by persons who were not themselves bigots it is imagined by some that christianity could not have subsisted without the aid of the civil powers and that the dissolution of its establishment would endanger its very being the bishop of gloucester says that the state was induced to seek an alliance with the church as the necessary means of preserving the being of religion and that all the advantage the church expects from the alliance with the state can be no other than security from all outward violence§ it being impertinent as he justly observes‡ in the church to aim at riches honours and power because these are things which as a church she can neither use nor     receive profit from he also says† that religion could not operate for want of a common arbiter who had impartiality to apply the rule of right and power to enforce its operations but these persons seem not to be acquainted with its proper internal strength or they would not lay so much stress on such poor and heterogeneous supports they should consider how the christian religion was supported without the help of any establishment before the time of constantine is it not true in fact that it not only subsisted but amazingly increased in all that period when it was so far from being protected by civil authority that all human powers were combined against it if they say it was supported by miracles in all that interval it behoves them to make good the assertion on the contrary it appears from church history that when christianity was once established if i may use that term by     the preaching and miracles of the apostles it was able afterwards to support itself by its own evidence and this evidence is still sufficient to support it though all the powers on earth and the gates of hell were combined against it certainly those who make use of this plea for christian establishments seem to insinuate that christianity is destitute of sufficient evidence and could not advance any thing more favourable to the purpose of its most inveterate enemies one circumstance in favour of my argument is very evident if the support of christianity had not been piously undertaken by constantine and the succeeding roman emperors the popish hierarchy that great mystery of iniquity and abomination could never have existed and i think all the advocates for church power will not be able to mention any evil attending the want of ecclesiastical establishments equal to this which flowed from one     all other ecclesiastical establishments among christians partake more or less of the nature of this the first and greatest of them being nothing more than corrections and emendations of it many of the abuses in it have been rectified but many of them also are retained in them all that there are some things good and useful in them all is true but it is no difficult matter to point out many things that are good that is which have been attended with consequences beneficial to mankind in the grossest abuses of popery those who study history cannot fail to be acquainted with them and there is no occasion to point them out in this place thanks to the excellent constitution of things that there is no acknowledged evil in the whole course of nature or providence that is without a beneficial operation sufficient to justify the appointment or permission of it by that great and good being who made and who superintends all things but because tempests by land and sea poisonous     plants and animals c do good considered as parts of the whole system and because it certainly seems better in the sight of god that they should exist than not must we not therefore guard against their pernicious effects to ourselves let this be applied to the case of civil and ecclesiastical tyranny in every form the divine being for wise and good ends permits them but he has given us a power to oppose them and to guard ourselves against them and we need not doubt but that things will be so guided by his unseen hand that the good they were intended to answer will be answered notwithstanding our just opposition or will appear to have been answered if we succeed in putting a final end to them he makes use of men as his instruments both in establishing and removing all these abuses in civil and ecclesiastical government ecclesiastical authority may have been necessary in the infant state of society     and for the same reason it may perhaps continue to be in some degree necessary as long as society is imperfect and therefore may not be entirely abolished till civil government have arrived at a much greater degree of perfection if therefore i were asked whether i should approve of the immediate dissolution of all the ecclesiastical establishments in europe i should answer no this might possibly especially in some countries for reasons that cannot be foreseen be too hazardous an experiment to begin with due caution let experiments be first made of alterations or which is the same thing of better establishments than the present let them be reformed in many essential articles and then not thrown aside entirely till it be found by experience that no good can be made of them if i be asked in what particulars i imagine them to be most deficient and what kind of reformation i could wish to have made in them i answer i could wish they     were reformed in the four following respects which are all of a capital nature and in which almost all our present establishments are fundamentally wrong as i make no doubt will appear to every man of common sense who shall give the least attention to this subject   let the articles of faith to be subscribed by candidates for the ministry be greatly reduced in the formulary of the church of england might not thirtyeight out of the thirtynine be very well spared it is a reproach to any christian establishment if every man cannot claim the benefit of it who can say that he believes in the religion of jesus christ as it is set forth in the new testament you say the terms are so general that even deists would quibble and insinuate themselves i answer that all the articles which are subscribed at present by no means exclude deists who will prevaricate and upon this scheme you would at least exclude fewer honest men but all temptation to prevaricate will be taken away if the next article of reformation be attended to       let the livings of the clergy be made more equal in proportion to the duty required of each and when the stipend is settled let not the importance of the office be estimated above its real value let nothing be considered but the work and the necessary expences of a liberal education   let the clergy be consined to their ecclesiastical duty and have nothing to do in conducting affairs of state is not their presence in the cabinet rather dangerous the seat of our bishops in parliament is a relick of the popish usurpations over the temporal rights of the sovereigns of europe and is not every thing of this nature justly considered as a great absurdity in modern government the question by what right they sit need not be discusled as teachers of the religion of christ whose kingdom was not of this world can they have any business to meddle with civil government however if they be allowed to sit in the great council of the nation as members of the community at large  00 suppose they were fairly elected like other members but let not such a civil power as they now have devolve upon them as a matter of course on any pretence whatever   let the system of toleration be completely carried into execution and let every member of the community enjoy every right of a citizen whether he chuse to conform to the established religion or not let every man who has sufficient abilities be deemed qualified to serve his country in any civil capacity because a man cannot be a bishop must he therefore be nothing in the state and his country derive no benefit from his talents besides let it be considered that those who depart the farthest from established opinions will have more at stake in a country where they enjoy these singular privileges and consequently will be more attached to it the toleration in england notwithstanding our boasted liberty is far from  0  being complete our present laws do not tolerate those more rational dissenters whom the bishop of gloucester looks upon as brethren it is known to every body that if the toleration act was strictly put in execution it would silence all those dissenting ministers who are held in any degree of esteem by the church in the same manner as a truly conscientious subscription to the thirty nine articles would silence almost all that are rational and free from enthusiasm among themselves it is not the law but the mildness of the administration and the spirit of the times to which we are indebted for our present liberties but the man who should attempt to abuse the letter of the law contrary to the spirit of the times and in order to trample upon the sacred rights of humanity will ever be infamous the most unexceptionable establishment of religion that i have yet heard of is that of some of our northamerican colonies in which all the inhabitants are obliged to pay a tax for the  0  support of some form of the christian religion but every mans contribution is faithfully applied to the use of whatever church or society he himself shall chuse to such an ecclesiastical establishment as this few persons i believe in the present state of things would have much objection it would not indeed be perfect and unbounded liberty in matters of religion but it would be pretty near it and might make way for it i do not mean therefore to plead against religious establishments in all cases but only argue against fixing every thing so unalterably that if a change in any particular should be desired by a great majority of the clergy or laity themselves they should not be able to accomplish it without the danger of throwing every thing into confusion such rigid establishments imply the authors of them to have been well persuaded of their own infallibility or rather that they were determined to enforce every measure once adopted notwithstanding the fullest conviction of its being a  0  bad one for no man who could suppose it possible for himself to be mistaken would think of setting up his opinions as the invariable standard for posterity and none but the founder of a median or persian establishment would think it was reasonable that after a mistake was discovered in his system and universally acknowledged to be such all persons if they would enjoy any advantage under it should be obliged to affirm that they believed it to be no mistake but perfectly agreeable to truth how far this is the case with the church of england let those of her clergy say who may understand the subject of religion a little better than the first reformers just emerging from the darkness of popery who may have some reluctance to subscribe what they do not believe and who may feel notwithstanding every evasion to which they can have recourse that a church preferment is dearly bought at the expence of a solemn falsehood i do not appeal to those who may really believe  0  all they subscribe or to those who may subscribe without thinking at all or to those who would wait upon any minister of state in the world with a carte blanche ready signed in saying this i even hint no more than what many of the greatest ornaments of the church have said again and again that some things in our present establishment are wrong and want reformation and that there are thinking and unthinking honest and dishonest men in this as well as in every other profession i doubt not the wisest and the most worthy of the english prelates would rather see the privileges of the dissenters enlarged than abridged in any important article for allowing their dissent to be ever so unreasonable there is no man who has the least knowledge of history or of human nature but must be sensible that the very distinguished reputation which the body of the english clergy enjoy at present is not a little owing to the existence and respectable figure of the protestant dissenters several of the most  0  discerning of the english bishops have given their testimony directly or indirectly to this truth particularly if i remember right bishop gibson in his charges to the clergy of his diocese the present state of the dissenting interest can give no alarm to the established clergy with respect to their temporalities and certainly the interests of religious knowledge which all wise and good men of every denomination have most at heart cannot fail to be promoted by that spirit of emulation which will always subsist betwixt scholars and writers in two opposite persuasions there is no power on earth but has grown exorbitant when it has met with no control what was the character of the romish clergy before the reformation how shamefully ignorant imperious lazy and debauched were the bulk of them whereas very great numbers of them are now sensible moderate and virtuous and little in comparison of the old leaven remains except in spain and portugal where the clergy have no  0  intercourse with protestants which might call forth an exertion of their faculties and check the extravagance of their appetites and passions to say that the english clergy in future time would not run into the vices and sink into the contempt into which the romish clergy were sunk before the reformation when they were in the same circumstances would be to say they were not men it is puffendorf i think who accounts for the great superiority of the english clergy over the swedish upon this principle in sweden though it be a protestant country no dissenters are allowed and their clergy have never produced any thing in ethics or divinity that deserves notice whoever made the observation there is no doubt of the fact a few among the inferior clergy may wish the extinction of the dissenting interest and might be ready to gratify their zeal by persecuting those of their brethren whose consciences are more tender than their own but certainly  0  there would not be wanting in this age men enow of more humanity of juster sentiments and of more enlarged views among the higher ranks in the church who would with indignation snatch the torch from their misguided hands the indelible infamy which would to the latest posterity pursue the man who should form countenance or even connive at persecuting measures in this age of moderation and good sense will effectually deter men of understanding and of a just knowledge of the world from these measures and it is hoped that men of zeal without knowledge will want abilities and influence to carry such schemes into execution  0  section ix a review of some particular positions of dr balguys on the subject of churchauthority several of the considerations mentioned in the preceding section were suggested by the perusal of dr balguys sermon and i flatter myself are sufficient to refute any arguments that he has produced in favour of churchauthority i shall however just descant upon a few passages in his performance where we discover the great hinges on which his whole scheme turns not only says he p   must persons be appointed for the performance of religious duties but the manner also is to be prescribed the assembly  0  may not unfrequently be deceived in their choice and the ministers if subject to no restraint may introduce principles and practices which the people condemn or it may happen that one minister shall pursue a different plan from another perhaps a contrary plan which must evidently tend to confound the minds of the people and weaken the impressions of religion if the difference be not in form only but in doctrine the case will still be worse for nothing is so apt to root out all religion both from mens heads and hearts as religious controversy here then says he we have the first sketch of what may be called not improperly churchauthority as the inconveniences arising from the want of churchauthority are here referred to as the reason for ecclesiastical establishments let us briefly examine whether they are not much exaggerated by this author and on the other hand just point out a few of the inconveniences attending establishments which he has   0 not so much as hinted at that the one may be fairly weighed against the other in this i shall not content myself with mere theory as dr balguy does since there are known facts to refer to as examples in both cases among the dissenters if a minister introduce principles and practices which the people condemn they dismiss him from their service and chuse another more agreeable to them if his difference of sentiment occasion any debate the subject of the debate is thereby more thoroughly understood and the worst that can happen is that some of them separate and form themselves into a new society or join another in their neighbourhood that is more to their liking in this as in all other contests some ill blood is produced the effects of which may remain for some time but the minds of the people in general are not so much confounded nor the impressions of religion as a principle of moral conduct so much weakened as this writer imagines     among dissenters church emoluments are not worth contending for and therefore those fierce contests about places or in places but seldom happen a minister seldom chuses to be connected with a society whose general sentiments are much different from his own nor do societies often invite a person to officiate among them without having previously sufficient reason to depend upon his being agreeable to them upon the whole i am willing to appeal to any person who is well acquainted with the state of dissenters in england whether disagreeable events happy so often or whether the worst effects are of so much consequence as to bear being put in the balance with the capital advantages of their situation for improving in religious knowledge and virtue something of the spirit of controversy seems necessary to keep up mens attention to religion in general as well as to other things and notwithstanding a fondness for debate may be of some disservice to practical religion it is far less     so than a total inattention to the subject in theological and scriptural inquiries the practical truths of christianity must necessarily present themselves to the mind besides there is hardly any branch of christian knowledge but is more or less of a practical nature and suggests considerations that are of use to mend the heart and reform the life religious knowledge is however itself as valuable an acquisition as knowledge of any other kind some may think it an unhappiness that the common people should be so knowing in matters of religion but this complaint is to be considered in the same light with the complaint of statesmen in free countries of the common people troubling themselves so much about politics while the friend of his country and of mankind will not upon the whole be displeased with either of these circumstances being sensible that the one is some guard against the incroachments of civil and the other of ecclesiastical tyranny     as to the confusion that is occasioned in congregations when they happen to be dissatisfied with their ministers it is not to be compared for its pernicious effects to the almost perpetual squabbles between the established clergy and their parishioners about tythes few parishes in the country are without disputes upon this subject which create a standing opposition of interest between the people and their spiritual guides lastly what inconvenience can be pointed out as having actually taken place among dissenters for want of a standing confession of faith that can be named with the dreadful mischiefs that have arisen from enforcing subscription in the church of england this precludes all free inquiry upon subjects of religion and entails every error and abuse from generation to generation so that a reformation can hardly take place without violence and blood if the emoluments of church livings be considerable the temptation to prevaricate     with conscience is by this means made too strong for the generality of those who have been educated for the church and who are now incapable of getting their bread at least of making their fortune in any other way also what must the people think to see those who are appointed to instruct them in the principles of religion and morality solemnly subscribing to articles of faith which they are known to disbelieve and abhor and who among the clergy that read and think at all are supposed to believe onethird of the thirtynine articles of the church of england i have so good an opinion of dr balguys good sense notwithstanding the futility of his reasoning in this performance as to think it is a thousand to one but that he himself is an unbeliever in many of them one would have thought that the shocking abuses of the church of rome might have served as a standing monument of the danger of church establishments when that mystery of iniquity stands     upon record as having thereby got so firm a footing as for so many ages to have set all the civil powers of europe and all the powers of reason too at defiance having seen what this author has been able to advance in favour of the necessity of ecclesiastical establishments and churchauthority i shall follow him a little farther and observe what he has to alledge for bringing a number of christian societies into one common system in order to lay a broader and firmer foundation for the power of the church from this combination he expects p       more wisdom and uniformity a greater variety of candidates for church officers and a better choice of them these societies he well observes must necessarily act by deputies so that at least either single men or small bodies of men must be authorized to govern the church there is no necessity says he that the ministers of religion should be appointed by the people and much expedience in a different method of appointment     to me all this appears mere imagination and the supposed advantages of this elaborate scheme to be altogether contrary to fact i should much sooner have imagined there might be much expedience in town officers not being chosen by their townsmen than in the ministers of a christian church not being chosen by the congregation the nomination to church livings except by the members of the church themselves is a thing so absurd that the idea of it never occurred for many centuries in the christian world and we may venture to say that it never could have entered into the head of any man had not the revenues of the church grown so considerable as to become worth the notice of the civil magistrate who took advantage of them to oblige his creatures and dependents the fruits of this method of proceeding are such as might have been expected from the manner of its introduction the people belonging to the established church are like the vassals of the polish nobility     or the mere live stock of a farm delivered over as parcel of the estate to every successive incumbent as to the wisdom of choice among candidates for the ministry we see in fact that the interest of the people is not at all considered in it the same interest is openly made for church livings as for places or emoluments of any other kind and being procured by the same means they are enjoyed in the same manner without any idea of obligation to the people from whom their revenue arises what reason there is or would be to boast of the happy effects of uniformity in a great number of societies comprehending a whole kingdom or the whole christian world we may judge from the horrible evils before recited that attend the necessary methods of enforcing this uniformity in a single society for these must be multiplied in proportion to the number we see in fact much more good than harm is found to result from     the diversities in dissenting congregations they are extremely favourable to the advancement of religious knowledge and they afford a fine opportunity for the exercise of christian candour and charity the very possibility of which would be excluded in what dr balguy would call a complete and perfect establishment some inconveniences cannot fail to arise from the most favourable situation of things but in this state of trial the divine being has not provided for the prevention of vice by cutting off all occasions of virtue besides so wise is the constitution of human nature that differences of opinion cannot be prevented by any human means it is labour in vain to attempt it it is our wisdom therefore not to irritate one another by opposition but to derive every advantage we possibly can from a circumstance that will necessarily take place there is as much diversity of sentiment and consequent animosity in the church of england as far as the members of it think for themselves     at all and even in the church of rome notwithstanding the infallibility they pretend to in the decision of controversies as among dissenters but without the advantage which they derive from their situation of unconfined freedom of debate and not having their inquiries restricted within certain limits only we have now seen says this author p    on what principles the authority of a religious community both over the ministers and members of particular congregations may be securely maintained whether residing in the community at large or delegated to some certain persons we shall now examine in what manner he would join the authority of the civil magistrate to this system of church authority here as he is wandering still farther from the simplicity of the gospel we may naturally expect more wildness in his suppositions and greater confusion in his reasoning   0 because we see says he p    by the history of all ages that religion in the hands of selfish and factious men is a very dangerous instrument it therefore greatly concerns the public peace and safety that all church authority should be under the control of the civil governor that religious assemblies as well as others should be subject to his inspection and bound by such rules as he shall see fit to impose the most effectual method of obtaining this security is to invest the supreme power civil and ecclesiastical in the same person there are indeed good reasons why the offices of religion ought not to be administered by the magistrate both the education of his youth and the attention of his riper years have been employed on very different objects and amidst the numberless toils and cares of government it is impossible he should find leisure for any inferior profession p    to obtain completely the benefits proposed from this union of civil     and ecclesiastical authority all the members of the same community should be members also of the same church variety of sects having a natural tendency both to weaken the influence of public religion and to give disturbance to the public peace where this is impracticable not the best but the largest sect will naturally demand the protection of the magistrate p    as ministers while employed by public authority are not at liberty to depart from established forms or to assemble separate congregations so neither are the people at liberty while they remain in society to desert at pleasure their lawful pastors and flock in crowds to receive instruction from those who have no authority to give it if they cannot lawfully comply with the terms of communion let them make an open separation in vain do men unite in civil or religious communities if each individual is to retain intire liberty of judging and acting for himself     concerning the impropriety and absurdity of making a civil magistrate the supreme head of a christian church i think enough has been advanced above i should indeed have thought that the same reasons which this author gives why the civil magistrate should not be concerned in the offices of religion might have made him at least suspect his qualifications for superintending the whole business of religion and directing all the officers in it according to this maxim a person might be very fit for the office of a bishop and especially an archbishop who was by no means qualified to be a common curate but to prevent disturbances the civil magistrate must have security for the good behaviour of all his subjects whatever be their religious persuasion and as he observes the most effectual method he does not say the only sufficient method though it be precisely the thing that his argument requires of obtaining this security is to invest the supreme power civil and ecclesiastical in the same person be they ever so incompatible and the same person     ever so ill qualified to conduct them both but is not this as i have hinted in the parenthesis in the last paragraph giving the civil magistrate much more power than upon his own premises is necessary is it not possible that all churchauthority should be sufficiently under the control of the civil government and that religious assemblies as well as others should be subject to his inspection and even be bound by many of his rules so far as was necessary to prevent any breach of the publick peace without investing him with supreme ecclesiastical power for my own part i should have no objection to the presence of an inspector from the civil magistrate in a religious assembly or the attendance of as many constables or even soldiers as might be judged necessary to keep the peace upon all occasions in which religion is concerned and if the civil magistrate be no more concerned in this business than the public peace and safety is concerned and this writer himself does     not so much as hint at any thing more i should think this might satisfy him but both he and the civil magistrate want much more than this when the latter must needs pass out of his proper character and insist upon being the supreme head of the church the avowed object and end of the union of civil and ecclesiastical power will not justify this claim for it may be compassed at a much less expence if i want a house that will not be blown down by the wind and two feet of thickness in the wall will sufficiently answer my purpose should i make it twenty feet thick because this would be a more effectual or the most effectual security a sufficient security is enough for me the doctors reasoning in this case is of a piece with the obligation which he lays upon the magistrate to countenance the largest sect of his discordant subjects in preference to the best this indeed might tend to reconcile the dissenters in his dominions to their situation by considering that their magistrate himself the     supreme head of the established church could not command the religion of his choice any more than they could for though he prescribed to one part of his subjects the other part of them dictated to him and that he was under the disagreeable necessity of enacting the articles of a religion which he himself did not believe the bishop of gloucester too dr balguys master in the science of defence says that the state must make an alliance with the largest of the religious societies i wish that either of these gentlemen or any person for them would tell us what ought to be the established religion of ireland on these principles certainly not that of the church of england for if i be rightly informed there are many parishes in that kingdom in which the clergy of the established church do no duty at all because they can find none of their parishioners who would attend their ministrations had constantine the great been aware of the force of this reasoning     though a christian himself he would have thought himself obliged to strengthen the establishment of the heathen worship and to discountenance the profession of christianity in the roman empire for the same reason also a protestant king of france would be obliged to continue the revocation of the edict of nantz it is really very difficult to animadvert upon such positions as these and retain ones gravity at the same time there is something one cannot help smiling at in the reasons which dr balguy gives for the legal maintenance of christian ministers this provision he says p    is of great importance to them and the public as we may easily judge from the wretched and precarious condition of those who want it a condition which seldom fails to produce a slavish dependence highly unbecoming a public teacher and in some measure disqualifying him for the discharge of his office     if our lord had imagined that any real advantage would have accrued to the ministers of his gospel from a legal provision i do not see why we might not either in his discourses or parables have expected some hint of it and some recommendation of an alliance of his kingdom with those of this world in order to secure it to them but no idea of such policy as this can be collected from the new testament for my part i wonder how any man can read it and retain the idea of any such worldly policy so far am i from thinking it could have been collected from it upon the whole when i consider my situation as a minister of the gospel or a member of a christian society i do not see what either the state or myself could get by an alliance admitting there was nothing unnatural and absurd in the idea of such a connection i want nothing that the state can give me except to be unmolested by it for i want neither a legal maintenance nor power to enforce my admonitions i look upon both     these things as unsuitable to and destructive of the proper ends of my ministry and without any hire from the civil powers i shall think it my duty to do all i can towards making my hearers good subjects by making them good men and good christians i shall therefore never court any alliance with the state and should the state be so absurd as to make any proposals of alliance with me i hope i should have virtue enough to reject them with indignation as peter did the not very dissimilar offer of simon magus let the men of this world and the powers of this world know that there are some things that cannot be purchased with money in the same spirit are this writers reasons for the difference of ranks among the clergy and for a provision suitable to those ranks and will not the same reasons p    serve peculiarly to recommend those forms of government in which the clergy as well as the laity are distributed into different ranks and enabled to support those ranks in a becoming     manner that both the lower orders may avoid contempt and the higher obtain distinction and regard were all the ministers placed in low stations of life it is easy to see with what neglect they would be treated and with what prejudice their doctrine would be received poverty aukwardness and ignorance of what is called the world are disadvantages for which the highest attainments in learning and virtue could never atone i shall close my remarks on this writers method of defending the establishment with repeating a trite observation that there is generally both a true and an ostensible reason for mens conduct and that these are often very different from one another because i cannot help thinking that it is verified in the case before us the ostensible and plausible reasons for church establishments are such as this writer has represented derived from the imaginary evils attending the want of them but the true reason with respect to the ministers may   0 be the scantiness and uncertainty of their provision without them and with respect to the civil magistrate the vast addition of influence he thereby acquires in consequence both of having so many benefices at his disposal and likewise of retaining in his pay the public instructors of the people men who being kept in continual expectation by the exhibition of higher preferment and greater emolument will not fail to inculcate maxims the most favourable to the establishment and increase of that power on which they depend but firm as the connection seems to be between the civil and ecclesiastical power a connection cemented by mutual worldly advantage this high alliance may yet be broken and interest divide what interest has united it has often seemed good to divine wisdom to take the wise in their own craftiness and to bring about his own designs by the very means that were used to defeat them of this we have a recent example in france in which we have seen the necessities of the state     compelling its governors to abolish the richest of the religious orders did not the english ministry who have not so large a standing army as the french want more dependents of other kinds so that honours pensions and church preserments are extremely convenient to them something similar to this might take place in england and who can tell what may be the case when some future tyrannical administration shall not be able to ride the storm they have raised or to struggle without unusual resources with the difficulties in which they shall have involved themselves the remainder of the largest quotation i lately made from this writer plainly respects the methodists at whose conduct he seems to have taken great offence i agree with him that ministers while they are employed by public authority are not at liberty to depart from established forms but i can see no reason in the world why in a country that admits of toleration the people may not desert their usual places of public worship and return     to them whenever they please have the laity subscribed to any articles of faith or formulary of religious worship if not they are clearly at liberty to act as they shall think most convenient and to dissent partially or totally secretly or openly as they like best but it is probable that this author may not mean being at liberty with respect to the laws of this country but with respect to conscience so that though the law allows a man to quit the worship of the church of england either occasionally or entirely his conscience should dictate to him to do it intirely and wholly if at all which to me sounds strange and paradoxical enough the situation of conscientious laymen in the church of england according to the casuistry of dr balguy is truly remarkable and such as i dare say few or none of them are aware of if they were easily as the common people are generally led by the priests i think the spirit of an englishman would revolt at it for this writer absolutely declares     that the union of civil and ecclesiastical powers in the establishment is in vain if each individual is to retain entire liberty of judging and acting for himself certainly a churchman ought to insist upon receiving some very great advantage in the establishment as an equivalent for the surrender of this great and important natural right to judge and act for himself upon the principles of this writer a professed churchman is not at liberty so much as to hear a single sermon by those who have no legal authority to preach i e dissenters and methodists or as he chuses to call them sectaries and enthusiasts so that he is cut off from the very means of judging for himself for certainly this writer cannot have less objection to his parishioners reading the discourses of sectaries and methodists than to their hearing them this writer indeed is inconsistent enough to allow the members of the established church to make an open separation from it if they cannot lawfully comply     with the terms of communion but were the terms ever so unlawful what chance has any person for coming at the knowledge of it can it be supposed that a man should at once of himself and without any means of information become so dissatisfied with the service of the church that he should think it unlawful to join in it i dare say the doctor imagined no such event but in point of conscience why may not a person think himself at liberty to leave the communion of the church though he should not think it unlawful may it not be sufficient that he thinks another form of religion preferable to it take the whole paragraph that i have quoted and i really think it a curiosity both in point of sentiment and reasoning but withal one of the greatest insults that i have yet seen offered to the understandings and spirit of men and yet this is from an englishman to englishmen     the dissenters are obliged to this writer for the goodwill he seems to bear them in being an advocate for toleration in general but i cannot help saying i think him a very aukward and inconsistent advocate in the case and that intolerance would be much more agreeable to his general principles if it be true as he says p    that a variety of sects has a natural tendency both to weaken the influence of public religion and to give disturbance to the public peace how is the magistrate unqualified or uncommissioned to persecute for conscience sake is he not constituted the guardian of the public peace and must he not use the most effectual means to prevent the disturbance of it if in order to obtain completely the benefits proposed from the union of civil and ecclesiastical authority all the members of the same commonwealth should be members also of the same church a conscientious civil magistrate might think it his duty and well worth his while to hazard something with a prospect of insuring so great an advantage especially     as according to this writer it is only when the union of all the members of the commonwealth in one church is impracticable that toleration is necessary i own i should be very sorry to trust the civil magistrate with dr balguys general maxims of civil and ecclesiastical policy i would not even trust dr balguy himself in certain circumstances when his principles give me so uncertain a hold of him but toleration very fortunately happens to be the fashionable doctrine at present and it must be incorporated into every system how ill soever it may connect with it an example of one of the mischiefs attending establishments dr balguy has given in himself in the conclusion of this sermon in which he reflects very severely upon the author of the confessional and his friends for i think it is very evident that his censures respect nobody else there is says this writer p  0 one class of men to whom this plea for compassion due to methodists as out of the reach of rational     conviction will not extend those i mean who without any pretence to inspiration live in open war with the national church with that very church of which they profess themselves ministers and whose wages they continue to take though in actual service against her whether this conduct proceed from a dislike to all establishments or from a desire of erecting a new one on the ruins of that which subsists at present in either case it is contrary to the most evident principles of justice and honour we see then that when religion has once been established all the ministers of it are to be considered as servants in her pay and bound to fight for her and support her the very proposal of a reformation by any member of an establishment is contrary to the most evident principles of justice and honour a maxim that shuts the door against all reformations that may not be called violent ones every disorder how flagrant soever must be winked at so long     as a person continues in the church and in order to put himself into a situation to propose an amendment he must quit his preferments and declare war as an alien this sufficiently justifies the common complaint against establishments that they never reform themselves but that all reformations have ever been forced upon them ab extra this has hitherto been matter of surprise to many persons and some among whom i think is the bishop of gloucester have pretended to deny the charge but now it appears to be rather a matter of boasting for it would have been contrary to the most evident principles of justice and honour for the clergy to have made the attempt it is not improbable but that dr balguy and his friends if they would explain themselves freely might carry this point of honour a little farther and say that no person who has ever eaten the bread or tasted the salt of the church should lift up his heel against her nor perhaps the man whose father or grandfather had eaten of it     i should think the most scrupulous casuist might allow a clergyman who is dissatisfied with the church to make a fair attempt to procure the reformation of those abuses that are intolerable to him and consequently to wait a proper time to see the effect of his endeavours before he absolutely quitted his station in the church for if his endeavours succeed he will have no occasion to quit it at all and in the mean time the remonstrances of a person who is a member of the church may be expected to have a more favourable hearing than those of one who has no connection with it so far am i from joining with dr balguy in his harsh censures of the author of the confessional that i rather think that every principle of justice and honour should prompt a man to use his best endeavours for the benefit of any community of which he is a member and of whose privileges he partakes if therefore there be any thing wrong in the constitution of it those principles require him to promote   0 a reformation of the abuse and it would be manifestly contrary to the principles of justice and honour to be an unconcerned spectator of so great a misfortune to it i cannot help comparing the author of the confessional to a man who would endeavour to stop a leak he perceived in the vessel in which he was embarked and dr balguy to a man who would run the risque of its sinking all at once rather than insinuate that there was any thing amiss with it strange as this authors declamation against the friends of the confessional is it follows directly from his avowed principle that authority once established must be obeyed speaking of the founders of our holy religion he says p    they established a form of church government for the church must be governed in some form or there could be no government but their directions to us are for the most part very general even their example must be cautiously urged in different times and under different circumstances in     this one point they are clear and explicit that authority once established must be obeyed but was not popery once established in this island how then is it possible upon these principles of passive obedience and nonresistance to vindicate the reformation whatever it be that is once established and in whatever manner it is once established it must it seems be submitted to if this principle be applied without restriction it will vindicate the continuance of every system the most absurd and mischievous in the world and if it do admit of restriction and limitation it could signify nothing to this authors purpose to alledge it it might have been expected that a writer who is so extremely severe upon those who propose a reformation in the church while they continue in it should have expressed some degree of indignation against those who intrude themselves into it by false oaths and pretences subscribing the articles and canons c     when they disbelieve and ridicule them but i fancy that i can put my reader into possession of the secret reason why nothing of this kind occurs in the writings of the friends of church authority men who have come this way into the church have always proved its firmest friends having made no bones of their own scruples they pay no regard to the scruples of others a conscientious bigot to the church is not half so much to be depended upon as the man who believes not a single word of the matter nor is he so fit to be admitted into the cabinet council of churchpower such my gentle reader are the maxims and such the reasoning with which this writer stands forth to support the declining cause of churchauthority for he justly complains p   that notwithstanding the members of the church of england have from its foundation been carefully instructed in these points by its ablest defenders yet so capricious is the public taste that these great writers have gradually fallen into     neglect their doctrines are now in a manner forgotten and enthusiasts and sectaries revive the same follies and defend them by the same arguments which were once effectually overthrown in this deplorable situation of things this great champion has judged it not to be improper to resume the beaten subject and to explain on rational principles the foundation of church authority it is indeed truly deplorable that these great authors should have fallen into neglect and that their excellent doctrines should be in a manner forgotten but this misfortune has been owing chiefly to themselves the truth is that these great writers have been very inconsistent with one another which is a very unfavourable and suspicious circumstance for the cause they are so zealously labouring to support while each of them is busily pursuing his own separate scheme and they are applying their very different methods to gain the     same end they only obstruct and embarrass one another in reality the principles of the dissenters are not more opposite either to those of hooker or warburton than those of these two great champions for churchauthority are to one another and other writers have proposed other schemes of church power quite different from them both now if three persons be building a house and one of them will have it of brick another of stone and the third of wood and if each be so obstinate that he will pull down what the others build how can it be expected that the edifice should be completed or how can the spectators refrain from laughing to see them so laboriously employed if i may be indulged another comparison i would say that when the schemes of the different writers in defence of ecclesiastical establishments are considered together they make such kind of harmony as would result from a number of persons singing the same words each to his own favourite tune at the same time     in these circumstances i cannot help thinking that dr balguy is unreasonably severe upon the members of his own church and expects too much from them when he says p   it might well have been expected that the members of the english church should have seen farther and judged better than to consult the scriptures for what is not to be found in it with respect to church government because this church even from its foundation has been carefully instructed on these very points by some of its ablest defenders but so capricious is the public taste c had these ablest defenders of the church defended her upon the same principles and upon the same general maxims of church power this writers censures might have been just for by a proper degree of attention and deference to such instructors they might have been long ago well grounded in this important branch of knowledge but he only says that some of the ablest defenders of the church not all of them have instructed her so carefully and were the members of the     church ever so desirous of receiving instruction either for their own benefit or that of their teachers what proficiency could they be expected to make when their ablest masters did not teach the same general doctrines if this hath been the case even from the foundation of this church which in proportion to its occasions has been blest with so many able defenders how much more embarrassed must her members have been since the publication of the confessional when if i be rightly informed for i have not yet read any of them myself almost every oppugner of that excellent work has adopted a different system of churchauthority so that as the controversy proceeds we may expect to be entertained with the exhibition of as many crude systems of church power as there are said to have been unformed animals in egypt after an inundation of the nile i do not know what we should do after such another inundation but that these halfformed beings generally perish as soon as they have shewn any signs of life     since however the ablest defenders of the church will each go their own way to work suppose that in order to make the best of this unfavourable circumstance those who are to be instructed by these able masters be distributed into distinct classes and that care be taken that they do not intermix with one another provided the same end be answered and the church be supported what doth it signify how different or inconsistent are the means by which it is effected when this experiment has been made that mode of instruction may be adopted in exclusion of the rest which shall be found in fact to make the most zealous churchmen in the issue i suspect that though the modern improvements in the science of church government may appear to be the best for the politer and more freethinking part of the nation nothing will be found to answer so well with the common people who do not easily enter into refinements as the oldfashioned jure divino doctrines i am afraid dr warburton has been rather impolitic in decrying those old supports of the cause     rotten as he thinks them to be they have been of excellent service in their day to conclude this section with perfect seriousness i congratulate my reader and the age in which we live that the great writers as dr balguy calls them in defence of church power have fallen into neglect and that their doctrines are in a manner forgotten to account for this remarkable fact in an age in which knowledge of all other kinds and especially the knowledge of government and laws and i think the knowledge of religion too has been so greatly advanced may surprise the doctor and his friends and therefore they may resolve it into caprice or chance but it is no surprise to me or my friends magna est veritas c the translation of which saying i shall give my reader in the words of this author p   truth can never suffer from a free inquiry the combat may be sharp but she is sure to conquer in the end and though the performance i am animadverting upon be an attempt to revive the memory of some     of the arguments in defence of churchauthority i trust it will only serve to hold them forth once more to the generous contempt and detestation of men of sense and reflection and accelerate their being finally consigned to everlasting oblivion as the disgrace of human reason and human nature section x of the progress of civil societies to a state of greater perfection showing that it is retarded by encroachments on civil and religious liberty the great argument in favour of the perpetuation of ecclesiastical establishments is that as they suit the several forms of civil government under which they have taken place the one   0 cannot be touched without endangering the other i am not insensible of the truth there is in the principle on which this apprehension is grounded but i think the connection artfully as those things have been interwoven is not so strict but that they may be separated at least in a course of time but allowing that some change might take place in our civil constitution in consequence of the abolition or reformation of the ecclesiastical part it is more than an equal chance that the alteration will be for the better and no real friend to his country can wish to perpetuate its present constitution in church or state so far as to interrupt its progress to greater perfection than it has yet attained to i can heartily join with the greatest admirers of the english constitution in their encomiums upon it when it is compared with that of any other country in the world i really think it to be the best actual scheme of civil policy but if any person should say that it is perfect and that no alteration can be made     in it for the better i beg leave to withhold my assent dr brown himself doth not hesitate to acknowledge that there are imperfections in it how then can a real friend to his country wish to fix its imperfections upon it and make them perpetual it will be said that alterations may indeed be made but cannot be made with safety and without the danger of throwing every thing into confusion so that upon the whole things had better remain as they are but allowing this for the present why should they be perpetuated as they are if the proposed alterations were violent ones that is introduced by violent measures they might justly give alarm to all good citizens i would endeavour to stop the ablest hand that should attempt to reform in this manner because it is hardly possible but that a remedy so effected must be worse than the disease but still why should we object to any states gradually reforming itself or throw obstacles in the way of such reformations     all civil societies and the whole science of civil government on which they are founded are yet in their infancy like other arts and sciences this is gradually improving but it improves more slowly because opportunities for making experiments are fewer indeed hardly any trials in legislation have ever been made by persons who had knowledge and ability to collect from history and to compare the observations which might be of use for this purpose or had leisure to digest them properly at the time taking it for granted therefore that our constitution and laws have not escaped the imperfections which we see to be incident to every thing human by all means let the closest attention be given to them let their excellencies and defects be thoroughly laid open and let improvements of every kind be made but not such as would prevent all farther improvements because it is not probable that any improvements which the utmost sagacity of man could now suggest would be an equivalent for the prevention of all that might be made hereafter were the best     formed state in the world to be fixed in its present condition i make no doubt but that in a course of time it would be the worst history demonstrates this truth with respect to all the celebrated states of antiquity and as all things and particularly whatever depends upon science have of late years been in a quicker progress towards perfection than ever we may safely conclude the same with respect to any political state now in being what advantage did sparta the constitution of whose government was so much admired by the ancients and many moderns reap from those institutions which contributed to its longevity but the longer continuance of what i should not scruple to call the worst government we read of in the world a government which secured to a man the fewest of his natural rights and of which a man who had a taste for life would least of all chuse to be a member while the arts of life were improving in all the neighbouring nations sparta derived this noble prerogative from her constitution     that she continued the nearest to her pristine barbarity and in the space of near a thousand years which includes the whole period in which letters and the arts were the most cultivated in the rest of greece produced no one poet orator historian or artist of any kind the convulsions of athens where life was in some measure enjoyed and the faculties of body and mind had their proper exercise and gratification were in my opinion far preferable to the savage uniformity of sparta the constitution of egypt was similar to that of sparta and the advantages that country received from it were similar egypt was the mother of the arts to the states of greece but the rigid institutions of this mother of the arts kept them in their infancy so that the states of greece being more favourably situated for improvements of all kinds soon went beyond their instructress and no improvements of any kind were ever made in egypt till it was subdued by a foreign power what would have been     the state of agriculture shipbuilding or war if those arts had been fixed in england two or three centuries ago dr brown will urge me with the authority of plutarch who largely extols the regulations of egypt and of sparta and censures the roman legislators for adopting nothing similar to them but i beg leave to appeal from the authority of plutarch and of all the ancients as by no means competent judges in this case imperfect as the science of government is at present it is certainly much more perfect than it was in their time on the authority of the ancients dr brown might as well contend for another institution of the famed egyptians viz their obliging all persons to follow the occupations of their fathers and perhaps this might be no bad auxiliary to his prescribed mode of education and prevent the springing up of faction in a state it would likewise favour another object which the doctor has professedly in view viz checking the growth of commerce     supposing this wise system of perpetuation had occurred to our ancestors in the feudal times and that an assembly of old english barons with their heads full of their feudal rights and services had imitated the wise spartans and perpetuated the severe feudal institutions what would england at this day have been with the unrivalled reputation of uniformity and constancy in its laws but the most barbarous the weakest and most distracted state in europe it is plain from fact that divine providence had greater things in view in favour of these kingdoms and has been conducting them through a series of gradual changes arising from internal and external causes which have brought us to our present happy condition and which if suffered to go on may carry us to a pitch of happiness of which we can yet form no conception had the religious system of our oldest forefathers been established on these wise and perpetual foundations we had now been pagans and our priests druids     had our saxon conquerors been endued with the same wisdom and foresight we had been worshipping thor and woden and had our ancestors three centuries ago persevered in this spirit we had been blind and priestridden papists the greatest blessing that can befall a state which is so rigid and inflexible in its institutions is to be conquered by a people who have a better government and have made farther advances in the arts of life and it is undoubtedly a great advantage which the divine being has provided for this world that conquests and revolutions should give mankind those opportunities of reforming their systems of government and of improving the science of it which they would never have found themselves in the excellent constitution of nature evils of all kinds some way or other find their proper remedy and when government religion education and every thing that is valuable in society seems to be in so fine a progress towards a more perfect state is it not our wisdom     to favour this progress and to allow the remedies of all disorders to operate gradually and easily rather than by a violent system of perpetuation to retain all disorders till they force a remedy in the excellent constitution of the human body a variety of outlets are provided for noxious humours by means of which the system relieves itself when any slight disorders happen to it but if these outlets be obstructed the whole system is endangered by the convulsions which ensue some things in civil society do in their own nature require to be established or fixed by law for a considerable time but that part of the system for the reasons mentioned above will certainly be the most imperfect and therefore it is the wisdom of the legislature to make that part as small as possible and to let the establishments which are necessary be as easy as is consistent with the tolerable order of society it is an universal maxim that the more liberty is given to every thing which is     in a state of growth the more perfect it will become and when it is grown to its full size the more amply will it repay its wise parent for the indulgence given to it in its infant state a judicious father will bear with the frowardness of his children and overlook many flights of youth which can give him no pleasure but from the prospect they afford of his children becoming useful and valuable men when the fire of youth is abated i do not pretend to define what degree of establishment is necessary for many things relating to civil society but thus much i think is clear that every system of policy is too strict and violent in which any thing that may be the instrument of general happiness is under so much restraint that it can never reform itself from the disorders which may be incident to it when it is so circumstanced that it cannot improve as far as it is capable of improvement but that every reformation must necessarily be introduced from some   0 other quarter in which case it must generally be brought about by force is it not a standing argument that religion in particular has been too much confined in all countries that the body of the clergy have never reformed themselves and that all reformations have ever been forced upon them and have generally been attended with the most horrible persecutions and dangerous convulsions in the state i cannot help thinking also that every system of government is violent and tyrannical which incapacitates men of the best abilities and of the greatest integrity from rendering their country any service in their power while those who pay no regard to conscience may have free access to all places of power and profit it seems to be the uniform intention of divine providence to lead mankind to happiness in a progressive which is the surest though the slowest method evil always leads to good and imperfect to perfect the divine being might no doubt have adopted a different plan     have made human nature and human governments perfect from the beginning he might have formed the human mind with an intuitive knowledge of truth without leading men through so many labyrinths of error he might have made man perfectly virtuous without giving so much exercise to his passions in his struggles with the habits of vice he might have sent an angel or have commissioned a man to establish a perfect form of civil government and a priori this would seem to have been almost as essential to human happiness as any system of truth at least that it would have been a valuable addition to a system of religious truth but though it would be impiety in us to pretend to fathom the depths of the divine councils i think we may fairly conclude that if this method of proceeding had been the best for us he whom we cannot conceive to be influenced by any thing but his desire to promote the happiness of his creatures would have pursued it but a contrary     method has been adopted in every thing relating to us how many falls does a child get before it learns to walk secure how many inarticulate sounds precede those which are articulate how often are we imposed upon by all our senses before we learn to form a right judgment of the proper objects of them how often do our passions mislead us and involve us in difficulties before we reap the advantage they were intended to bring us in our pursuit of happiness and how many false judgments do we make in the investigation of all kinds of truth before we come to a right conclusion how many ages do errors and prejudices of all kinds prevail before they are dissipated by the light of truth and how general and how long was the reign of false religion before the propagation of the true how late was christianity that great remedy of vice and ignorance introduced how slow and how confined its progress     in short it seems to have been the intention of divine providence that mankind should be as far as possible self taught that we should attain to every thing excellent and useful as the result of our own experience and observation that our judgments should be formed by the appearances which are presented to them and our hearts instructed by their own feelings but by the unnatural system of rigid unalterable establishments we put it out of our power to instruct ourselves or to derive any advantage from the lights we acquire from experience and observation and thereby as far as is in our power we counteract the kind intentions of the deity in the constitution of the world and in providing for a state of constant though slow improvement in every thing a variety of useful lessons may be learned from our attention to the conduct of divine providence respecting us when history and experience demonstrate the uniform method of divine     providence to have been what has been above represented let us learn from it to be content with the natural though slow progress we are in to a more perfect state but let us always endeavour to keep things in this progress let us however beware lest by attempting to accelerate we in fact retard our progress in happiness but more especially let us take heed lest by endeavouring to secure and perpetuate the great ends of society we in fact defeat those ends we shall have a thousand times more enjoyment of a happy and perfect form of government when we can see in history the long progress of our constitution through barbarous and imperfect systems of policy as we are more confirmed in the truth and have more enjoyment of it by reviewing the many errors by which we were misled in our pursuit of it if the divine being saw that the best form of government that even he could have prescribed for us would not have answered the end of its institution if it had been imposed by himself much less can we imagine it     could answer any valuable purpose to have the crude systems for they can be nothing more of shortsighted men for ever imposed upon us establishments be they ever so excellent still fix things somewhere and this circumstance which is all that is pleaded for them amounts to is with me the greatest objection to them i wish to see things in a progress to a better state and no obstructions thrown in the way of reformation in spite of all the fetters we can lay upon the human mind notwithstanding all possible discouragements in the way of free inquiry knowledge of all kinds and religious knowledge among the rest will increase the wisdom of one generation will ever be folly in the next and yet though we have seen this verified in the history of near two thousand years we persist in the absurd maxim of making a preceding generation dictate to a succeeding one which is the same thing as making the foolish instruct     the wife for what is a lower degree of wisdom but comparative folly had even locke clarke hoadley and others who have gained immortal reputation by their freedom of thinking but about half a century ago been appointed to draw up a creed they would have inserted in it such articles of faith as myself and hundreds more should now think unscriptural and absurd nay articles which they would have thought of great importance we should think conveyed a reflection upon the moral government of god and were injurious to virtue among men and can we think that wisdom will die with us no our creeds could we be so inconsistent with ourselves as to draw up any would i make no doubt be rejected with equal disdain by our posterity that ecclesiastical establishments have really retarded the reformation from popery is evident from the face of things in europe can it be thought that all the errors and abuses which had been accumulating     in the space of fifteen hundred years should be rectified in less than fifty by men educated with strong prejudices in favour of them all and yet the augsburg confession i believe stands unrepealed the church of england is the same now that it was in the reign of queen elizabeth and the church of scotland is to this day in that imperfect and crude state in which john knox left it little did those great reformers whose memory i revere think what burdens they who had boldly shaken off the load from their own shoulders were laying on those of others and that the moment they had nobly freed themselves from the yoke of servitude they were signing an act to enslave all that should come after them forgetting the golden rule of the gospel to do to others as we would that they should do to us could religious knowledge have remained in the state in which the first reformers left it could the stone they     had once moved from its seat on the top of a precipice have been stopped in its course their provisions for perpetuation would have been wife and excellent but their eyes were hardly closed before their children found that their fathers had been too precipitate they found their own hands tied up by their unthinking parents and the knots too many and too tight for them to unloose the great misfortune is that the progress of knowledge is chiefly among the thinking few the bulk of mankind being educated in a reverence for established modes of thinking and acting in consequence of their being established will not hear of a reformation proceeding even so far as they could really wish lest in time it should go farther than they could wish and the end be worse than the beginning and where there are great emoluments in a church it is possessed of the strongest internal guard against all innovations whatever church livings must not be touched and they     may if any thing else be meddled with this makes the situation of sensible and conscientious men in all establishments truly deplorable before i had read that excellent work intitled the confessional but much more since it has grieved me to see the miserable shifts that such persons whether in the church of england or of scotland are obliged to have recourse to in order to gild the pill which they must swallow or starve and to observe their poor contrivances to conceal the chains that gall them but it grieves one no less to see the rest of their brethren hugging their chains and proud of them but let those gentlemen in the church who oppose every step towards reformation take care lest they overact their parts and lest some enterprizing persons finding themselves unable to untie the gordian knots of authority should like another alexander the great boldly cut them all let them take care lest for want of permitting a few repairs in their ruinous house it should at last fall   0 all together about their ears a number of spirited and conscientious men openly refusing to enter into the church or throwing up the livings which they hold upon those iniquitous and enslaving terms and such men there have been in this country would rouse the attention of the temporal heads of the spiritual part of our constitution they would see the necessity of an immediate and compleat reformation and then the alarm of churchmen with their paultry expedients and compromises would come too late the temper of these times would not bear another st bartholomew if only one or two persons of known probity and good sense did now and then act this heroic part it would serve to keep up an attention to the subject if every man who doth not in his conscience believe the articles he has subscribed would magnanimously throw up the emoluments he enjoys in consequence of his subscription it can hardly be doubted but that a reformation of at least     the capital abuses in the ecclesiastical system would take place the very next session of parliament this nation would never suffer all her pulpits to be filled by such clergymen as would then remain in the church in the mean time let the friends of liberty by no means give way to impatience the longer it may be before this reformation takes place the more effectual it will probably be the times may not yet be ripe for such an one as you would wish to acquiesce in considering that whenever it is made it will probably continue as long as the last has done it was well for the cause of truth and liberty that the romish clergy at the beginning of the reformation held out with so much obstinacy against the smallest concessions for had they but granted the cup to the laity and been a little more decent in the article of indulgences the rest of popery might have continued     to scourge mankind for ten dark ages more and at the restoration here in england had a few a very few trifling alterations been complied with such numbers of the presbyterians would have heartily united to the established church as would have enabled it entirely to crush every other sect to prevent the growing liberty of the press and to have maintained for ages the most rigid uniformity this observation may perhaps teach patience to one party and prudence to the other dissenters even of the presbyterian persuasion have by no means been free from the general infatuation of other reformers all the denominations of dissenters have made attempts to fix things by their own narrow standard and prescribed confessions of faith even with subscriptions have been introduced among them but happily for us there have always been men of generous and enlarged minds who having no civil power to contend with have had courage to stem the torrent and now     among those who are called the more rational part of the dissenters things are not upon the whole to be complained of no subscriptions to any articles of faith or even to the new testament is now required and ministers are excused if they chuse not to give any confession of their own to have preached and behaved like a christian is deemed sufficient to recommend a man to the christian ministry unfettered by authority they can pursue the most liberal plans of education the whole business is to give the faculties of the mind their free play and to point out proper objects of attention to students without any concern what may be the result of their inquiries the design being to make wise and useful men and not the tools and abetters of any particular party if any person should think that religion is not to be put upon the same footing with other branches of knowledge which they allow to require the aid of every circumstance favourable to their future growth that since the whole of     christianity was delivered at once and is contained in the books of the new testament there is no reason to expect more light than we already have with regard to it and therefore that they are justified in fixing the knowledge of it where it now stands i shall only say that i sincerely pity their weakness and prejudice as such an opinion can only proceed from a total ignorance of what has passed in the christian world or from a bigotted attachment to the authoritative institutions of fallible men to recur to dr brown he would raise the terms on which we are to live in society so that under his administration a man could enjoy little more than bare security in the possession of his property and that upon very hard conditions the care he would take to shackle mens minds in the first formation of their thinking powers and to check their exertions when they were formed would i apprehend put an effectual stop to all the noble improvements of which society is capable knowledge particularly of     the more sublime kinds in the sciences of morals and religion could expect no encouragement he would have more restrictions laid upon the publication of books he complains p  0  that in the late reign deistical publications proceeded almost without cognisance from the civil magistrate and asserts appendix p    that there are many opinions or principles tending evidently to the destruction of society or freedom and which therefore ought not to be tolerated in a well ordered free community the civil magistrate then according to this writer ought to control the press and therefore prevent by means of effectual penalties or else he doth nothing the publication of any thing that might directly or indirectly thwart his views of civil policy which in england comprehends the present form of our established religion but so extensive is the connection of all kinds of truth that if a man would keep effectually clear of the subject of religion he     must not indulge a free range of thought near the confines of it the subjects of metaphysics morals and natural religion would be highly dangerous there might be heresy or the foundation of heresy without coming near revelation or any of the peculiar doctrines of christianity we must only be allowed to think for ourselves without having the liberty of divulging or in any form publishing our thoughts to others not even to our children a mighty privilege indeed and for which we might think ourselves obliged to dr brown if it were in the power of man to deprive us of it this is a privilege which the poor wretch enjoys who lives under the same roof with a spanish inquisitor even the subjects of the grand seignior enjoy far greater privileges than those which dr brown would indulge to englishmen for the greater part of them are allowed to educate their children in a religion which teaches them to regard mohammed as an impostor nay the pope himself permits those to live unmolested and under his     protection at rome who look upon that church of which he calls himself the head as founded on fraud and falsehood and to educate their children in the same principles nor hath the pope or the grand seignior ever seen reason to repent of their indulgence were any more laws restraining the liberty of the press in force it is impossible to say how far they might be construed to extend those already in being are more than are requisite and inconsistent with the interests of truth were they to extend farther every author would lie at the mercy of the ministers of state who might condemn indiscriminately upon some pretence or other every work that gave them umbrage under which circumstances might fall some of the greatest and noblest productions of the human mind if such works could be produced in those circumstances for if men of genius knew they could not publish the discoveries they made they could not give free scope to their faculties in making     and pursuing those discoveries it is the thought of publication and the prospect of fame which is generally the great incentive to men of genius to exert their faculties in attempting the untrodden paths of speculation in those unhappy circumstances writers would entertain a dread of every new subject no man could safely indulge himself in any thing bold enterprizing and out of the vulgar road and in all publications we should see a timidity incompatible with the spirit of discovery if any towering genius should arise in those unfavourable circumstances a newton in the natural world or a locke a hutcheson a clarke or a hartley in the moral the only effectual method to prevent their diffusing a spirit of enterprise and innovation which is natural to such great souls could be no other than that which tarquin so significantly expressed by taking off the heads of all those poppies which overlooked the rest such men could not but be dangerous and give umbrage in a country where it was the     maxim of the government that every thing of importance should for ever remain unalterably fixed the whole of this system of uniformity appears to me to be founded on very narrow and shortsighted views of policy a man of extensive views will overlook temporary evils with a prospect of the greater good which may often result from or be inseparably connected with them he will bear with a few tares lest in attempting to root them out he endanger rooting up the wheat with them unbounded free enquiry upon all kinds of subjects may certainly be attended with some inconvenience but it cannot be restrained without infinitely greater inconvenience the deistical performances dr brown is so much offended at may have unsettled the minds of some people but the minds of many have been more firmly settled and upon better foundations than ever the scheme of christianity has been far better understood since those deistical writings have occasioned the subject to be   0 more thoroughly discussed than it had been before besides if truth stand upon the false foundation of prejudice or error it is an advantage to it to be unsettled and the man who doth no more and even means to do no more is in fact its friend another person seeing its destitute and baseless condition may be induced to set it upon its proper foundation far better policy would it be to remove the difficulties which still lie in the way of free enquiry than to throw fresh ones into it infidels would then be deprived of their most successful method of attacking christianity namely insinuation and christian divines might with a more manly grace engage with the champions of deism and in fact engage with more advantage when they both fought on the same equal ground as things are at present i should be ashamed to fight under the shelter of the civil power while i saw my adversary exposed to all the severity of it     to the same purpose i cannot help quoting the authority of dr warburton nor less friendly is this liberty to the generous advocate of religion for how could such an one when in earnest convinced of the strength of evidence in his cause desire an adversary whom the laws had before disarmed or value a victory where the magistrate must triumph with him even i the meanest in this controversy should have been ashamed of projecting the defence of the great jewish legislator did not i know that his assailants and defenders skirmished under one equal law of liberty and if my dissenting in the course of this defence from some common opinions needs an apology i should desire it may be thought that i ventured into this train with greater confidence that i might shew by not intrenching myself in authorized speculations i put myself upon the same footing with you the deists and would claim no privilege that was not enjoyed in common divine legation p       but sorry i am that the paragraph which immediately follows how proper soever it might be when it was written looks like a tantalizing of his unfortunate adversaries this liberty then may you long possess know how to use and gratefully to acknowlege it i say this because one cannot without indignation observe that amidst the full enjoyment of it you still continue with the meanest affectation to fill your prefaces with repeated clamours against the difficulties and discouragements attending the exercise of free thinking and in a peculiar strain of modesty and reasoning make use of this very liberty to persuade the world you still want it in extolling liberty we can join with you in the vanity of pretending to have contributed most to its establishment we can bear with you but in the low cunning of pretending still to lie under restraints we can neither join nor bear with you there was indeed a time and that within our memories when such complaints were seasonable     and meritorious but happy for you gentlemen you have outlived it all the rest is merely sir martin it is continuing to fumble at the lute though the music has been long over let peter annet if he dare write a comment on this passage so far are deists from having free liberty to publish their sentiments that even many christians cannot speak out with safety in present circumstances every christian divine is not at liberty to make use of those arguments which he may think would supply the best defence of christianity what are in the opinion of many the very foundations of our faith are in a ruinous condition and must be repaired before it will be to any purpose to beautify and adorn the superstructure but the man who should have the true courage and judgment to go near enough to such     rotten foundations would be thought to mean nothing less than to undermine them and intirely destroy the whole fabric his very brethren would stand off from him thinking him in league with their adversaries and by an ill judging zeal might call in the destructive aid of the civil power to stop his hand in consequence of which notwithstanding his most laudable zeal in favour of our holy religion he might stand upon the same pillory and be thrown into the same prison with wretched and harmless infidels many undoubted friends of christianity and men of the most enlarged minds will know and feel what i mean hitherto indeed few of the friends of free inquiry among christians have been more than partial advocates for it if they find themselves under any difficulty with respect to their own sentiments they complain and plead strongly for the rights of conscience of private judgment and of free inquiry but when they have gotten room enough for themselves they are quite easy and in     no pain for others the papist must have liberty to write against pagans mohammedans and jews but he cannot bear with protestants writers in defence of the church of england justify their separation from the church of rome but with the most glaring inconsistency call the protestant dissenters schismatics and many dissenters forgetting the fundamental principles of their dissent which are the same that are asserted by all christians and protestants in similar circumstances discourage every degree of liberty greater than they themselves have taken and have as great an aversion to those whom they are pleased to call heretics as papists have for protestants or as laud had for the old puritans but why should we confine our neighbour who may want more room in the same narrow limits with ourselves the wider we make the common circle of liberty the more of its friends will it receive and the stronger will be the common interest whatever be the particular views of the numerous tribes of     searchers after truth under whatever denomination we may be ranked whether we be called or call ourselves christians papists protestants dissenters heretics or even deists for all are equal here all are actuated by the same spirit and all engaged in the same cause we stand in need of the same liberty of thinking debating and publishing let us then as far as our interest is the same with one heart and voice stand up for it not one of us can hurt his neighbour without using a weapon which in the hand of power might as well serve to chastise himself the present state of the english government including both the laws and the administration which often corrects the rigour of the law may perhaps bear my own opinions without taking much umbrage but i could wish to congratulate many of my brother freethinkers on the greater indulgence which their more heretical sentiments may require to the honour of the quakers be it spoken that they are the only body of     christians who have uniformly maintained the principles of christian liberty and toleration every other body of men have turned persecutors when they had power papists have persecuted the protestants the church of england has persecuted the dissenters and other dissenters in losing their name lost that spirit of christian charity which seemed to be essential to them short was their sunshine of power and thankful may britain and the present dissenters be that it was so but the quakers though established in pensylvania have persecuted none this glorious principle seems so intimately connected with the fundamental maxims of their sect that it may be fairly presumed the moderation they have hitherto shown is not to be ascribed to the smallness of their party or to their fear of reprisals for this reason if i were to pray for the general prevalence of any one sect of christians which i should not think it for the interest of christianity to take place even though i should settle the articles of it myself it should be that of the quakers because different     as my opinions are from theirs i have so much confidence in their moderation that i believe they would let me live write and publish what i pleased unmolested among them and this i own is more than i could promise myself from any other body of christians whatever the presbyterians by no means excepted the object of this forced uniformity is narrow and illiberal unworthy of human nature supposing it accomplished what is it possible to gain by it but perhaps a more obstinate and blind belief in the vulgar while men of sense seeing themselves debarred the very means of conviction must of course be infidels in those circumstances it would really be an argument of a mans want of spirit of sense and even of virtue to be a believer because he would believe without sufficient evidence who would not with every appearance of justice suspect any cause when he was not allowed to examine the arguments against it and was only pressed with those in its favour     what sensible and upright judge would decide a cause where all the witnesses on one side were by violence prevented from giving their evidence those who converse with deists well know that one of their strongest objections to christianity arises from hence that none of the early writings against it are preserved how much stronger and even unanswerable would that objection have been if christianity had been from the beginning so effectually protected by the civil magistrate that no person had dared to write against it at all such friends to the evidence and true interests of christianity are all those who would suppress deistical writings at this day suppose any article in a system of faith so established and guarded to be wrong which is certainly a very modest supposition let any of the advocates of this scheme say how it is possible it should ever be rectified or that if the truth should insinuate itself by any avenue which they had not sufficiently guarded how it could bring its evidence   0 along with it so as to command the attention and acceptance which it deserved indeed it is not so much from the mistaken friends of truth that we apprehend these measures of rigid uniformity but rather from those who would sacrifice truth and every other consideration to public tranquility from those mere statesmen who looking upon all systems of religion to be equally false and not able to bear examination will not suffer that examination to take place for fear of destroying a system which however false they imagine to be necessary to the peace and well being of the state the most unrelenting persecution is to be apprehended not from bigots but from infidels a bigot who is so from a principle of conscience may possibly be moved by a regard to the consciences of others but the man who thinks that conscience ought always to be sacrificed to political views has no principle on which an argument in favour of moderation can lay hold was not bolingbroke the greatest promoter of     the schism bill in england and richlieu of the persecution of the protestants in france besides as was in some measure observed before all these systems of uniformity in political or religious institutions are the highest injustice to posterity what natural right have we to judge for them any more than our ancestors had to judge for us our ancestors from the time of the britons had no doubt as high an opinion of their political and religious institutions as we can have of ours but should we not have thought the fate of greatbritain singularly unhappy if they had been entailed upon us and the very same reason of complaint will our posterity have if we take any methods to perpetuate what we approve as best for ourselves in our present circumstances for farther than this we cannot pretend to see let us by all means make our own circumstances as easy as possible but let     us lay posterity under no difficulty in improving theirs if they see it convenient rather let all plans of policy be such as will easily admit of extension and improvements of all kinds and that the least violence or difficulty of any kind may attend the making of them this is at least very desirable and i believe it is far from being impracticable however though it should not be thought proper to unfix any thing which is at present established let us proceed no farther than is manifestly necessary in those establishments posterity it may be said will never complain of our institutions when they have been educated in a strong and invincible attachment to them it is true and had we been pagans or papists through a similar system of education fixed in a more early period we should not have complained we like the old spartans or the sons of bigotry in spain and portugal at present might have been hugging our chains and even proud of them but other persons who could     have made a comparison between our actual condition and what it would have been had those institutions not been made would have complained for us they would have seen us to be a less great wise and happy people which affords the same argument against throwing difficulties in the way of future improvements highly as we think of the wisdom of our ancestors we justly think ourselves of the present age wiser and if we be not blinded by the mere prejudice of education must see that we can in many respects improve upon the institutions they have transmitted to us let us not doubt but that every generation in posterity will be as much superior to us in political and in all kinds of knowledge and that they will be able to improve upon the best civil and religious institutions that we can prescribe for them instead then of adding to the difficulties which we ourselves find in making the improvements we wish to introduce     let us make this great and desirable work easier to them than it has been to us however such is the progress of knowledge and the enlargement of the human mind that in future time notwithstanding all possible obstructions thrown in the way of human genius men of great and exalted views will undoubtedly arise who will see through and detest our narrow politics when the illadvisers and illadvised authors of these illiberal and contracted schemes will be remembered with infamy and execration and when notwithstanding their talents as statesmen or writers and though they may have pursued the same mindenslaving schemes by more artful and less sanguinary methods they will be ranked among the bonners and the gardiners of past ages they must be worse than bonners and gardiners who could pursue the same ends by the same means in this more humane and more enlightened age     the time may come when this country of greatbritain shall lose her liberty there are who think they perceive too many symptoms of this approaching loss but while the precious moments of freedom remain let us at least indulge ourselves in the gloomy satisfaction of predicting the infamy that will certainly overwhelm the authors of our servitude whether they be future kings and their tools the ministers or ministers and their tools the kings indeed ministers are much more to be suspected of designs upon the liberties of a people than kings for in all arbitrary governments it is the minister that is in fact possessed of the power of the state the prince having nothing but the name and the burdensome pageantry of it those princes therefore who listen to such pernicious advice are in reality submitting their own necks and those of their posterity to the yoke of their servants for such is the condition of human affairs that in all the successions of arbitrary princes nine have     been weak and governed by others for one who has been able to govern himself and in despotic monarchies the chance of having able sovereigns is on many accounts much less than in others this seems to be the time when the minds of men are opening to large and generous views of things politics are more extended in practice and better understood in theory religious knowledge is greatly advanced and the principle of universal toleration is gaining ground apace schemes of ecclesiastical policy which in times of barbarity ignorance and superstition were intimately interwoven with schemes of civil policy and which in fact made the greatest part of the old political mixed constitution have been gradually excluded till at present though ecclesiastical power be looked upon as an useful support and auxiliary of civil government it is pretty much detached from it and the more sensible part of mankind are evidently in a progress to the belief that ecclesiastical and civil jurisdiction     on being things of a totally different nature ought if possible to be wholly disengaged from one another religious sentiments with respect to their influence on civil society will perhaps be regarded in time as a theory of morals only of a higher and more perfect kind excellent to enforce a regard to magistracy and the political duties but improperly adopted into the same system and enforced by the same penalties till we know whether this work which seems to be going forward in several parts of europe be of god or not let us not take at least any rigid and violent methods to oppose it but patiently wait the issue unless in the mean time the disorders of the state absolutely force us into violent measures at present notwithstanding some trifling alarm perhaps artfully raised and propagated may seem to give a handle to the friends of arbitrary power to make use of some degree of coercion more gentle measures seem better adapted to ensure tranquility     england hath hitherto taken the lead in almost every thing great and good and her citizens stand foremost in the annals of fame as having shaken off the fetters which hung upon the human mind and called it forth to the exertion of its noblest powers and her constitution has been so far from receiving any injury from the efforts of these her free born enterprising sons that she is in part indebted to them for the unrivalled reputation she now enjoys of having the best system of policy in europe after weathering so many real storms let us not quit the helm at the apprehension of imaginary dangers but steadily hold on in what i trust is the most glorious course that a human government can be in let all the friends of liberty and human nature join to free the minds of men from the shackles of narrow and impolitic laws let us be free ourselves and leave the blessings of freedom to our posterity no nation ever was or can be truly great powerful and happy by pursuing     oppressive and persecuting measures and a sovereign who has a true sense of his present and future glory must see it can only arise from his being the head of a great powerful and happy nation made or continued so by himself his best friends are those who would raise his greatness by augmenting the greatness of the people over whom he presides he himself must see the absurdity of every scheme which proposes to raise his character at the expence of that of his country as if it were possible to depress the people to the condition of slaves without sinking the sovereign into a master of such slaves poor preeminence such maxims may have influence with asiatic monarchs but can never impose on a sovereign of greatbritain educated in british principles and with a just regard to the privileges of his subjects with which his own true dignity is inseparably connected the nation will execrate and the discerning prince will see through and detest the meanness of that adulation which  00 however disguised would tend to enslave the kingdom and debase the king the meanest tool of the meanest party may exclaim against licentiousness and faction men of genius learning and integrity may through the force of prejudice be induced to join in the cry and courtiers may think to recommend themselves to a sovereign by any measures which tend to quiet the clamours of the people but the true enemy of sedition and he who most effectually pays his court to a wise and good prince is the man who without any views of preferment proposes with a manly freedom whatever he thinks conducive to the greatness and glory of his country this conduct cannot fail both to give satisfaction to his fellow citizens and ensure him the esteem of his prince because such measures will proportionably raise the lustre of all ranks of men in the state will make a wise prince the idol of a grateful nation and endear his memory to the latest posterity finis  0   written in       alliance p           alliance p     alliance p     alliance p
