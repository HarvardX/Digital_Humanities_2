springs from private inclination and is sanctioned by public duty  that private inclination dictates this address witness the gratitude with which your lordships unexampled liberality has indelibly impressed me and which is irresistably my perpetual theme and your lordships situation as lord chamberlain of his majestys household and master of the revels evidently renders it a public duty in me to address a book which professes to record a history of the stage and such circumstances connected with as it relate to your lordships high office to you my lord and to you alone  having however been formerly honored with dedicating a work to your lordship my difficulty in acquitting myself of this welcome duty would have been insurmountable had not your lordship waved ceremony and precedent by generously condescending to relieve me from this embarrassment  i could long dwell my lord upon this subject long indulge my willing inclination with describing in how many ways my reputation has been advanced by your lordships patronage and protection but that the same feeling which impels me to be grateful forbids me to be importunate nobly to confer is the most exalted exercise of the human mind may you my lord long live to enjoy that best of propensities so congenial to the munificent and in particular to your lordship and may every object of such benevolence be inspired with the pride and

this work once collated and gathered into volumes i had intended as my original advertisement states to have gone into it at length by way of preface to have enumerated every particular that might be necessary for its illustration to have given such reasons for every part of my own conduct as in that case would have been due to the public and such answers to all those who have anonymously praised and censured me as might ensure my opinions the award of candor and impartiality  when i made this rash promise however for rash it was beyond precedent i was not aware that to acquit myself of this almost impossible task i must have added at least five volumes to those five i now publish and all this perhaps to lead myself into scrapes with numerous individuals a predicament which it is neither my inclination nor my interest to risk i shall therefore content myself with a few general remarks letting praise or censure light upon the work according as those may be inclined to indulge either propensity who deliberately peruse it without which degree of attention it cannot be read to any purpose and instead of showing how readers ought to be pleased explain in what manner i have endeavored to please them  the prodigious mass of materials perpetually at variance with one another that i have had the slavery to wade through precluded all possibility of a particular elucidation for they were a complete chaos of jarring atoms out of which i defy any man to have formed a perfect historical world and therefore to have taken them otherwise than according to their general bearing however it might have encouraged ingenuity would not have favored fidelity under this impression i have established judgment as the arbitrator between those two competitors of which article i have certainly given up to the subject all that i possessed which is as much as any reasonable reader can desire  i might perhaps have exercised this necessary quality more deliberately had not a number of circumstances intervened that it was impossible for me to have foreseen i had no idea when i began the history of the stage that i should take a circuit of between three and four thousand miles during the prosecution of it and be in consequence obliged to dispatch copy written upon the spur of the moment to a printer sometimes at four hundred miles distance who had he been paid to have involved me in every difficulty and inconvenience could not more completely have discharged this retrogade office i might to be sure have given it up at the end of the first volume but this would have violated my respect due to the subscribers and my regard to my own reputation and as to foregoing every thing else upon this account i appeal to the candid for whom i have as graceful a deference as i have an ineffable contempt for cavillers whether it would not have been a supererogate and absurd instance of quixotism if for the sake of watching the press and of digesting historical matter into mere form i had given up prospects which have confirmed my health enlarged my connexions and augmented my interest and my reputation especially as by the experiment i should have lost the activity of truth and gained nothing but its precision in which particular perhaps after all i have been virtually as correct as my neighbors  a mere history of theatrical events i take to be a very insipid thing i consider the stage as a state branching from the empire of literature and therefore an examination of its rulers and the rise and operation of the various circumstances issuing from its general interest cannot be related to effect without digesting different opinions and forming a rational judgment of them in this one is apt to be a little dictatorial which however is a merit for it implies that after every necessary examination you have fully persuaded yourself that certain facts exist and therefore you naturally expect an implicit acquiescence on the part of the reader provided your general reasoning have made the matter clear in this view the historian may expect and ought to be credited for if every trivial fact were to be argued upon the chain of narrative would be perpetually broken through and nothing would be concluded  it is upon this broad ground i wish this book to be judged indeed i think it ought to acknowledge no other authority for i will venture to say that any thing written upon the conviction of long experience will be more likely in its essence to be faithfully authentic than a history composed or rather vamped from a whole library of printed and written documents especially when to my own knowledge many articles in even recent publications relative to the theater are completely false  it is no subject of wonder therefore though heaven knows i have had recourse to printed documents and written ones too many of them thanks to those busy gentlemen who seem to have had but little to do with their time through the medium of the penny post that i have had more difficulty in avoiding fancied errors that in coming at evident truths and here i cannot help reflecting on the egregious absurdity of those who have been so officiously friendly as to tender opinions which i could not but see or else i must be fit for bedlam were traps for my veracity and yet poor devils i forgive them indeed they are my friends without their own knowledge for the anticipation of an injury is next to the enjoyment of a benefit as to all those who from real kindness and friendly solicitude have shown an anxiety for my reputation in the course of this work i should have to accuse myself of every thing unworthy and ungrateful if i did not feel their generosity and acknowledge the advantages derived from their advice but of this they will be conscious by an observation of the use i have made of their various remarks  my great difficulty has been to curtail for from the large cargo of matter i have had the drudgery to consult my task had been as troublesome as that of a manager in the shortening an overgrown play i have therefore never teazed the reader with dates of births or deaths or any times or actions that i have conceived to be irrelative to the essence of the facts i have commemorated i have also cut out second titles wherever i could by the absence of all which extraneous matter i have been able to crib room for anecdotes and other articles which i conceived would be much more entertaining to the reader above all i have as much as possible omitted christian or first names a circumstance which may in some instances perhaps be taken in dudgeon though certainly nothing can be a greater compliment i remember when garrick was absurdly particular on this subject a lady of distinction wrote her friend a minute account of the jubilee in the moment the little man returned home with all his blushing honors thick about him in this account she frequently called him garrick without any prefatory appellation he was told of it and remarked that it was a strange want of attention for that it might at least have been mr garrick the lady heard of this and wrote him a letter professing to apologize for the omission but yet full of close and keen irony among other things she said that nothing could be farther from her intention than the most distant idea of an impropriety she only wrote while her heart was full at which moment she could no more have said mr garrick than mr shakespeare  to enumerate the various objects this subject embraces would give this address more the form of a prospectus to recommend a work than a preface to the work itself the history of the stage is now published and let it stand or fall by its general merits it may not however be irrelevant to notice that music has never been treated as it relates to the theater till now  i shall finish this intrusion by entreating that i only desire to receive that proportion of commendation to which a fair construction of the above remarks may entitle me that the letter may be considered as comprised in the spirit of the work that inferior faults may be liberally overlooked in short that i may find as far as they are my due as to the literary part of this undertaking which rested with me credit for good intention industry and discrimination in the candor and consideration of my readers and for the typographical part which did not rest with me an errata in their generosity and indulgence  the stage book ix from the first appearance of carrick to his departure for italy chap i comparative view of the french and english stage and a continuation of authors being now upon the point of introducing the greatest actor that ever existed for so we must pronounce garrick to have been if all we have witnessed of him added to all we have been told of others be fairly weighed and considered it will be necessary to show how many adventitious circumstances combined together to lend assistance to that merit which like every thing else transcendant received brilliancy from competition  the collateral advantages from which garrick derived assistance in a higher degree than betterton were the large and valuable stock of materials with which the stage had been furnished originally at home as well as those imported from france which last however inferior to the sterling value of meritorious english productions by lending a variety to dramatic entertainments heightened considerably the effect of talents so versatile as those of this actor  it will be unnecessary again to go over the ground of the french drama or to show that whatever there might have been both of theatrical regularity and sprightliness there was a pancity and a sameness which the worst english writers would have disdained to copy or indeed if they had copied the dullest english auditor would have been absurd enough to tolerate vanbrugh nevertheless turned moliere and regnard to advantage destouches le sage boursault and at length voltaire and many others became fashionable when metamorphosed by their english translators and that merit which it has been pretty clearly shown that the french originally derived from us after being filtered into insipidity by them regenerated by being again revived in its more congenial soil exactly as our golden pippin planted in ameria enlarges in bulk and degenerates in flavor but which replanted in england regains its usual size and embibes its original sweetness  the french authors who died in the interval between shakespeare and garrick a list of which i have before me where i count more than four hundred and fifty many of them voluminous writers inundated the theater with an incomprehensible number of pieces  but what were they the most trifling and flimzy popular anecdote was subject enough for a french comedy and this maigre kind of diet made their season of acting plays a sort of dramatic lent and the dorantes and erastes the scapins the crispins and the blaises differently dressed and ornamented were stuffed down their throats like the painted eggs in careme which whether you choose red yellow blue or purple are still hard undegestible and insipid and still eggs  these would not content an english stomach and therefore none of their plays were ever translated to advantage except by those who knew how to incorporate with them a little stamina when they were brought out here in that state it cannot be denied that we have benefited by the chance of which the confederacy and zara are still striking proofs the contrary has however at particular periods prevailed and we have seen genteel comedies and sentimental comedies banish for a time fair humor and honest laughter from the stage  but as there will hereafter come an opportunity when we may indulge in observation upon this subject i shall at present wave this and every thing else to bring up the account of authors till      after which to the death of garrick though there will remain plenty of names and certainly some admirable materials it is wonderful how little that can be called excellent will be sound when the number of admirable actors are considered that gave advantage to literary fame during that period  to prepare my way for this examination i must slightly touch again on those whose productions are yet brought no further than   0  and the first left in that imperfect state was steel whose private conduct having already been noticed pretty much at large as it was involved in the history of theatrical management it will be only necessary to speak now of the conscious lovers his last play that was performed though there are two other plays attributed to him called the gentlemen and the school of action  the conscious lovers is an instance that there is no danger in permitting an author to borrow when he knows as well as steel did how to improve his materials this comedy which was produced in      is imitated from the andria of terence but improved exactly in the way that an excellent engraver imortalizes an insipid and spiritless painter here however the comparison drops for it is not only heightened so as to be superlatively superior to the original but embellished with scenes of great intrinsic merit purely the authors own among these are every thing that belongs to tom and phillis and that admirable scene between myrtle and bevil in which duelling is execrated in so noble and so dignified a manner from which scene richardson has evidently taken more than a hint in sir charles grandison  we now go to mrs centlivres comedy of the busy body which proves that members of a theater have not in all cases any very strong eventual judgment for as we have seen it was expected to be damned and even wilks swore that no audience would ever endure such stuff the event as we well know gave the lie to their predictions and whenever there has been a good marplot it has never ceased to be a popular play  the mans bewitched performed in    0 has the usual fault of mrs centlivres plays it is flimzy it is however sprightly and full of whim and those who have an inclination to leave rigid criticism at home may laugh very heartily at many of the incidents whenever they are well acted bickerstaffs unburrying marplet a sequel to the busy body and the perplexed lovers add little to this ladys reputation and will never again perhaps trouble the public  the wonder performed      is certainly the best of mrs centlivres plays and for an intricate and perplexed plot is one of the fullest of interest and pleasantry that can be conceived there is nothing that the dullest auditor cannot easily conceive and yet the whole depends upon a mystery inextricable to the characters themselves jealousy in comedy is perhaps depicted in this play better than in any other and the characters are highly drawn and strongly contrasted it requires however excellent acting and perhaps felix was never represented to perfection from its first appearance to this moment but by garrick  mrs centlivre seems to have written well only at intervals the gotham election the wise well managed and the cruel gift not having the gift of pleasing the public or ensuring any reputation for their writer the latter of these pieces was a tragedy and therefore too ponderous a subject for so feeble a pen  a bold stroke for a wise which except the artifice a comedy that had no success is the last of this writers productions was brought out in      it is by no means a good play for the language is poor and the circumstances impossible but there is so much of whim contrivance and pleasant variety in it that it is difficult to refrain from laughing at different parts of it the performance however of feignwell is so hard a task that the part has never yet been acted in all its requisites to perfection  southern remains yet to be spoken of so does cibber with whom i shall finish the account of resumed authors the spartan dame which was produced in      though it has not kept the stage is by no means a trifling addition to the same of this charming writer the heroine of this play is finely drawn and the language has a great deal of that nature and pathos that characterize so markingly the beauties of southern this play nobody knows why was prohibited for a considerable time one attempt more an abortive one closes the list of this authors productions in which those requisites of exquisite beauty and impressive interest that i have with pleasure enumerated stand highly distinguished among the best excellencies of tragedy  cibbers remaining pieces are twelve in number the rival fools was performed in   0  it did not succeed owing in some measure to those enemies that cibbers comfortable situation very naturally conjured up against him it has a resemblance of beaumont and fletchers wit at several weapons but is not so good an improvement on these authors as cibbers amendments generally were  venus and adonis is merely an interlude and one of those things which managers inconveniently enough are now and then constrained to prepare to eke out other matter the music was composed by pepusch who had great merit but who too servilely shrunk under the influence of handel myrtillo is criticized by the above comment on venus and adonis  we come now to the nonjuror confessedly taken from molieres tartuffe but materially improved the coquet of high life has never been drawn so well upon the whole as by cibber and after lady betty modish perhaps maria is in his boldest and truest manner nothing can answer the true end and drift of real comedy better than the operation of this piece upon the human mind a pernicious serpent under the veil of sanctity who gets admittance into the house of a gentleman to work his ruin by the seduction of his family it is the true province of the stage to expose and punish  cibber however got all the critics against him as had moliere before him and as they were stirred up by those who did not perhaps choose to appear openly for fear of appropriating to themselves some of those fair strokes of satire which could alone be levelled against the villainy of hypocricy they employed by way of a vehicle mists journal a paper of all work and it is shrewdly suspected not without great color of truth that pope was not a little active in this dirty work for it happened immediately after the damnation of that farce written by pope arbuthnot and gay which we know gave rise to the enmity of pope against cibber and introduced the laureat into the dunciad  cibber with his usual gaiety and good nature for it must be allowed that he had the good sense never to be hurt by folly of this kind speaks of this circumstance with the same coolness with which he wrote to pope where he most pointedly shows the malignity and burning envy that had actuated all his conduct toward him merely one would think because nature had not given him the talent to write plays the nonjuror in spite of all its enemies had great success and made a considerable addition to its authors reputation mist seems to be extremely angry with cibber that he could never so far catch him off his guard as to give him any reply and got at last so exasperated at finding that nothing could irritate him that a paragraph appeared in his paper when cibber lay very ill that he was dead cibber bad as he was upon this unexpectedly appeared on the stage and thus gave the lie direct to the libeller which without considering the shame it heaped on himself m congratulates himself upon calling it an answer to his paragraph   ximena performed in   0  is a tragedy a sort of productions in which cibber certainly did not excel it is in some degree taken from the cid of corneille the refusal or the ladys philosophy borrowed principally from les femmes savantes of moliere had not so much success as it deserved mist and his abetters had not forgot the nonjuror and besides the severe strokes in it which were levelled at the famous south sea bubble were not easily pardoned by those they exposed though nothing can be fairer game for scenic detection than any species of national fraud caesar in egypt is another tragedy the subject of which is furnished by corneille it would have been better for cibber and the stage if he had employed the time he took to prepare this piece for the theater by writing a comedy  the provoked husband as the world knows was left in an unfinished state by vanbrugh and brought forward with material alterations by cibber indeed more than half of it was written by him vanbrugh having written little more than that part of it which relates to sir francis wronghead and his family cibbers enemies however determined to do the thing judiciously chose to select what they supposed to be his and right or wrong damned vanbrugh when they thought they were damning cibber this he detected to their confusion by publishing the play as vanbrugh had left it behind him and thus he proved to the satisfaction of every sensible critic with how much judgment he had improved a celebrated author without injuring his fame  the rival queens was a parody on lees alexander we know but little of its reputation yet though it had some humor it is very unlikely that it had success love in a riddle was a pastoral and one of the earliest pieces of this kind brought out after the beggars opera it is wonderful how cibber could see so little of probable consequences as to imagine that any thing written professedly in imitation of a piece so very popular let whatever be its merit could possibly succeed there can be no doubt but party right or wrong wrought the fall of this opera for it certainly had merit and the idea of the authors endeavor to strike a balance in favor of morality by making virtue as captivating as gay had rendered vice alluring was perfectly laudable but to oppose the torrent of fashion is always madness and cibber ought to have known better the piece cut down to a farce under the title of damon and phillida has always been considered as an entertaining trifle  papal tyranny in the reign of king john is by no means borrowed from shakespeares play though written upon the same subject in this play cibber in imitation of aesop returned to the stage very late in life for it came out in      at which time its author was seventythree he did not however meet with the reception of aesop for in spite of the impediments nature had added to those he formerly labored under there was a dignity and a grace in his performance of pandolph which the public very warmly applauded the play had merit but it is very probable that the actor saved the author or at least reaped the greatest share of public favor it is needless to say that no king john has since been popular but that written by shakespeare  with hob in the well which is well known and no more than doggets country wake cut into a farce we take leave of cibber an author a manager and an actor whose whole study was to promote the credit the character and the consequence of the theater who in his writing as well as in all his public conduct was the encourager of merit the friend of decorum and the advocate of morality  chap ii addison gay fielding and hill as the authors immediately preceding garrick furnished many of the materials with which he worked out his fame it is proper to continue a clear account of them till his appearance we have therefore yet to examine all those who wrote in the interval between   0  and       addison a very great ornament to letters in this country who possessed many of the useful requisites of an author and hit the middle line of writing with more felicity and exactness than perhaps any other claims a place here as the author of calo rosamond and the drummer it will not however be enough to mention his plays for though i cannot be of opinion with dr johnson that it is either worth while or necessary to give our days and nights to the labors of addison as the ultimatum of atchieving an english style yet many of those labors are valuable and an advantage to literature  the spectator certainly not originally addisons idea but that of steel who began the tatler a work of the same complexion without the participation of any other writer has in it particular papers which have such a peculiar neatness for what they are as perhaps cannot be parallelled those essays which are written on the common and ordinary occurrences of life are wonderfully adapted to all capacities and at the same time they teach an elegance of speaking and thinking they have a drift more noble no less than that of regulating the mind and teaching the heart to love morality  when addison goes beyond these known and obvious subjects he however is not so happy his zeal is as fervid and his motives as sincere but his arguments are often fallacious and he seems more to have the wish than the ability to convince as however common readers do not make this distinction his end is generally obtained and whatever may be the nice difference which oblige men of discernment to give him that credit for the will which they cannot for the deed it were to be wished that the youth of both sexes might be restricted from reading that abominable trash which lumbers up the circulating libraries and obliged to treasure the admirable lessons which will be found in addisons papers in this publication  as for the rest of his prose it was generally provoked from him to serve that party purpose which for the moment he espoused and we see him promoted from a pension of three hundred a year to the place of secretary of state mounting step by step to the top of preferments ladder of which his various publications formed the rounds all this is manifested in various papers in the guardian the freeholder the old whig and other productions  as to his poetry however it might have been extolled by those whom he patronized it has now found its level and when we hear from his admirers of which they are now but few that his ode to st cecilia is beautifully correct though it is a poor copy from dryden that the letter from italy is more correct though dr johnson acuses him of having made a goddess a horse and a boat in two lines by bridling her for fear she should launch into a song and that the campaign is corrector still of which nobody remembers any thing but the angel borrowed though it has escaped all his critics from king david we are furnished with all the praise bestowed on addison as a poet  though i have by no means the smallest inclination to qualify the foregoing paragraph it cannot be denied that addison has some sterling merit as a poet but whenever poetry is derived from erudition rather than from genius it must of course be in proportion less intrinsic and occasional and complimentary verses however well written claim a place only on the threshold of parnassus  addisons first dramatic piece was rosamond it was performed in   0  and contains perhaps more lines truly poetical than any thing he has written it is however flimzy and though there is some attempt at comedy in sir trusty and grideline the whole is a drawing in water colors neat correct and pretty but neither interesting warm or beautiful a great deal has been urged to prove that it was a folly in addison to write so well for music which he himself says as we have seen ought only to be coupled with nonsense now it so happens that this remark stigmatizes for one thing alexanders feast and for another thing miltons comus and tickel addisons dumby insists upon this rule so strongly in a flaming copy of verses that he says poetical compositions for music are innocent of thought meaning to show by a stroke of his own that he knows what it is to be both ignorant and dull for poetical compositions cannot think but if they could it would be difficult to prove why thought must necessarily imply guilt  it is not very material to go at length into the merits of cato it is a most ponderous tragedy and was rated at least according to its weight it ran for eighteen nights and was ushered into notice by eight complimentary verses besides a prologue by pope and an epilogue by garth it is by much the best written of all addisons poetical works and that they may securely rate its real merit it is decided by the french to be a true model for tragedy that is to say it is the essence of every thing heavy dull and declamatory  at the time this play made its appearance it was considered and taken up as a party business cibber tells us that the whigs applauded it as a warm compliment to their cause and the tories reechoed the applause to show that they were not hurt pope says that at every two lines of his prologue he was clapped into a staunch whig and that at the same time the author was sweating behind the scenes to find that the applause came more from the hand than the head  cato has been too warmly admired and too severely censured voltaire has run into both these errors great french poets with less judgment have found in it no errors at all dennis whose observations were always warped has nevertheless hit upon a great deal of truth in his strictures on cato his ridicule of addisons having religiously observed the unity of place and thereby rendered the action impossible is as good as any thing in the rehearsal and it cannot be denied that as to conduct there is nothing on the stage more completely absurd than the management of the circumstances in this play  time has as usual settled every dispute upon this subject the day of prejudice is gone by and without reference to any party or any opinion we soberly find that cato is more properly a succession of declamatory scenes than a tragedy elegantly written perfectly moral and correctly in nature we care no more about the characters than we are solicitous about the deliverer of a sermon we listen to the sentiments we admire the beauty of their language and we are delighted with the morality they convey we are told that addison was of this opinion but that it was hurried on the stage through the importunity of his friends party prejudice turned out a lucky hit otherwise as the experience of the present time evinces addison would have been under the necessity of upbraiding his friends for inflicting on him a mortification which his own better judgment had warned him to avoid  the drummer out of excessive modesty as it is supposed addison sought to have concealed his pretensions to as its author nay we have nothing but strong circumstances to warrant his being considered so at this moment steel kept the secret till after his friends death and then asserted that he only knew it by a circumstance having been told by addison who put the play into his hands while some friends were present that it was the production of a gentleman in company the trait is singular and has been productive of some disputation steeles conduct however seems to be full of veracity and honor  willing to give every bird of parnassus its proper feather he took an opportunity when the feelings of the author could no longer be hurt and indeed when the play had grown into a fame which was at first denied it of placing it among addisons works observing that it made no figure on the stage originally though exquisitely well acted and when i observe this says he i say a much harder thing of the public than of the comedy it is said that both theobald and tickell knew the truth of this business even more correctly than steel and that congreve was very severe upon tickell for his taciturnity  certainly considered as a play it is the best in addisons works for it is as warton says a just picture of life and manners and indeed the characters have a truth and a propriety that might have served as a model as warton hints for more expert dramatic writers there is a novelty and an interest in the fable and none of the requisites are for a moment violated but the misfortune is that it is correct even to coldness and as cato was translated by des champs and pronounced the model of french tragedy so was the drummer by destouches and pronounced the model of french comedy i cannot refrain from noticing the principal heads of the preface to the french play of the drummer destouches says that he does not copy dryden and other english writers who after enriching themselves at the expense of french authors write long prefaces to criticize them and turn them into ridicule instead of acknowledging their obligations to them on the contrary he frankly owns he has borrowed this play from the great addison one of the best english authors and who had not the least aversion to french literature which he has proved by imitating the exactitude and the decorum of the dramatic productions of that country this comedy did not succeed on the english stage and no wonder for it had too much simplicity and regularity and too few incidents it had too much of the wisdom of the french manners and too little of those enormous and monstrous liberties in which the comic writers indulge themselves in england mocking at the unities and stuffing their pieces full of episodes till they no longer can be tasted or understood he goes on censuring that satire in english authors which he says attacks every thing and respects nothing not even the fair sex who however take nothing amiss if they happen to have their fans with them he at length winds up this reprobation of english dramatic writers by advising them to form themselves upon the example of the french theater and shun the licentious works of ben jonson dryden and congreve   this brief account is all that comes within my province in relation to addison who as a man was too modest to speak in public acknowledge his own writings or in any other way appear to arrogate the smallest merit yet he comfortably took to himself every lucrative situation that came in his way and even married the mother of his pupil for aggrandizement though he knew he should not be happy with all the sacerdotal forbearance of a bishop at his induction which situation he is said once to have aimed at who was so good that he undermined and injured almost all his friends some of which conduct pope called damning with saint praise he took his friend steel in execution for a paltry hundred pounds he sickened with jealousy at popes homer and he prevented the harmless and amiable gay from enjoying that court favor which he had been so often promised and was so justly entitled to but he no doubt repented of these faults before he called in lord warwick to show how a christian ought to die  but the gods took care of cato and fortune of addison and there is a spice of inflated vanity of hypocritical affectation both in the author and his nominal prototype a circumstance that posterity has pretty well regulated we have here however nothing to do with him but as a writer in which capacity he is better known by infinite degrees by those papers in the spectator where he has treated familiar and domestic subjects in which narrow circle nobody ever moved so nimbly or so expertly than by the rest of his writings these will secure him a peculiar fame small indeed but brilliant confined but valuable brilliant because they infuse pleasure and valuable because that pleasure mends the heart  the history of gay is so well known his amiable mild unsuspecting heart which permitted him to be bubbled by the south sea scheme and disappointed at court without having the power to bear up against misfortune has been so much pitied and applauded for it broke by the weight of the calamity it sustained and was afterward universally and deservedly commiserated that it is impossible to say any thing of this valuable man and meritorious writer here that the reader cannot anticipate  gay was an elegant poet as his pastorals his trivia his fables and other things evince and in proof that i speak the general opinion all these things are at this moment read with pleasure it is true they are of a secondary rank but a great mind may be seen through an humble covering and the violet and the jessamine have charms in their simplicity with which the lily and the tulip with all their gaudiness cannot impress the heart if poetry be meant to dignify sentiment to exalt idea and to charm the mind why must the poets reputation wait upon lofty and towering subjects always false and always dazzling  when such a poem as alexanders feast astonishes the world a circumstance that does not happen perhaps in seven centuries i am willing to give any enthusiastic tribute of admiration you please to the wonderful effort of extraordinary genius and feel a servent glow of gratitude that such celestial ideas should be conceived by a human creature but for feeling for pathos for mental pleasure for something delicious to the soul i had rather and i am sure i shall have every votary of sensibility on my side be the author of black eyed susan than half the odes of pindar  it is the cant of great poets and the cant of great critics to rate every thing domestic every thing familiar every thing common among the lowest classes of poetry this mode however of narrowing the avenues to the heart is a serious injury to the cause of rhyme which by this rule to be great must have every thing of pomp and nothing of sentiment but the position is false the conception achs at being perpetually fixed on grand objects as our eyes are dazzled by looking full on the fun we sicken at the glare though the genial influence it diffuses is even necessary to our existence thus when splendid virtues and striking qualities are brought home to us and exemplified in real life the fiction is realized and the heroes gods and guardian angels of poets are found to have a practical existence in the courage love and friendship of common mortals  among those capable of giving poetry this impression was gay who if he had had nerve equal to idea would have blendid all that is great in his writings with all that is beautiful his dramatic pieces are upon various subjects and variously conducted some are by no means happy but none are destitute of merit  the mohocks is a short piece attributed to this author and generally believed to be his it is intended to expose the bucks of that day who were a terror to all peaceable passengers as we read in the tatlers and spectators it had a laudable tendency but being temporary we know but little of its success the wife of bath      was gays first comedy but it was an unsuccessful attempt and was even rejected by the public upon a revival of it after the appearance of the beggars opera  the what do you call it a burlesque production well known had merit in its way it was so well acted as we are told by pope that mr cromwell who was deaf could not conceive how the audience could be kept in a roar of laughter while every thing was conducted with such solemnity on the stage three hours after marriage though always set down to gay was as cibbers letter to pope sufficiently proves the production of pope gays and arbuthnot  every body knows that the piece failed and that pope grew upon this so inveterate against all dramatic writers that he for ever afterward envied them and of course abuted them in his writings but it is not generally known that its failure was owing to the spirit of aristophanes which it breathed it ridiculed most pointedly and most undeservedly a very valuable member of society because he happened to be fond of fossils and the public were not at that time ripe for that bold ungenerous and wanton personality which i shall certainly warmly reprobate when i come to foot it therefore disgusted the audience and was in consequence very properly withdrawn from the stage  dione was a tragic pastoral and professedly in the manner of amynta and paster fido subjects which we have seen frequently attempted before it has merit but when we consider that randolphs amyntas though performed before the king and queen had very little public success it is natural to suppose however it might enrich the poems of gay that it was very wisely suppressed as a subject for the stage  the captives performed in      gay was uniformly unfortunate in relation to this play he obtained leave to read it to the princess of wales but being very timid and his attention entirely fixed on the personages about him as he advanced to the company assembled upon this occasion he made a pantomime trick of his tragedy by tumbling over a stool overturning a screen and throwing the audience into the completest confusion this is supposed to have been remembered during the representation of the piece which on this and other accounts was very little attended to  we come now to mention a performance celebrated more variously than any other production in the english language the readers recollection anticipates the mention of the beggars opera a piece which has been criticized in all manner of ways and which has begot all manner of opinions some of these i shall presently examine in the mean time let us literally see its success  this piece as we are told from the notes to the dunciad was performed sixty three nights the first season and repeated the following season with the same extraordinary success it was performed thirty or forty times at most of the principal towns in the kingdom at bath and bristol it was repeated fifty nights the ladies carried about the favorite songs in fans and handkerchiefs and houses were furnished with them in skreens the beggars opera was not only performed in england but in ireland scotland and wales nay at minorca and many other foreign places  its same was not confined to the author the actress who performed polly till then an obscure and not a very respectable character became all at once the favorite nay the toast of the town her portrait was painted and engraved and sold in great numbers her life was written eulogiums in prose and verse swarmed in the newspapers and in different periodical publications books were made of her sayings and jests and to crown all here i quote swift after being the mother of several antinuptial children she obtained the rank and title of a duchess by marriage  as to the tendency of the beggars opera as if there was no fixed rule whereby to judge of a stage representation nothing can be more contradictory than public opinion concerning it on one side dr herring afterward archbishop of canterbury and a number of adherents condemned it as giving encouragement to vice by making a highwayman the hero and dismissing him with reward rather than punishment on the other side swift and another large party contended that the piece was highly moral for that it is impossible to place vice in too strong or too odious a light  swift was certainly more in the right than herring for if the great who are severely satirized in the persons of macheath and his gang are truly satirized then is the labor of gay a valuable one if not he wrote it only for those whom the cap might happen to fit and as place and preferment and bribes are the vehicles through which all gangs are kept together no doubt there are characters in the world who are obliged to make wry faces and put it on for as to herrings remark that the hero goes unpunished it is literally but not virtually a fact for the beggars opera was written as well to ridicule the italian opera as to convey general morality which last end the author had it in idea literally to inculcate and therefore makes the poet say that it is his intention to hang macheath and either to hang or transport all the rest of the personages aye says the player this would be very right provided your piece were a tragedy but being an opera it it must end happily your objection replies the poet is very right but the difficulty is easily removed for in these kind of dramas no matter how absurdly matters are brought about he then makes the rabble cry a reprieve and the captain is brought back to his wives in triumph  under this crooked policy those who smarted at the satire in this piece affected to shield their feelings for no man in his senses will aver that refusing a license to the sequel to it called polly which was the next of gays productions was lest highwaymen and housebreakers should be taught to glory in their wickedness but lest corruption should be exposed  we know that whenever a magistrate or other forward character has wished to add to his popularity he has pretended to deplore the immorality in the beggars opera sir john fielding did this and others have done it but it is difficult to say why thieves should think it necessary to emulate macheath when they can find the examples of turpin and jack shepherd in the newgate chronicle and as to any hope of their escaping unpunished the very end of their existence would not according to their ideas be accomplished if every thief of them did not make his exit upon his death bed at tyburn for the rest as this piece has so much of what swift calls not wit nor humor but something better than either as the songs are most charmingly written as the fair purposes of honest satire are triumphantly accomplished and lastly as we owe to this lucky hit the ballad opera which has very elegibly served the cause of the drama of poetry and of music i know not to whom the stage in any one instance has had more obligations than in this to gay  polly was printed by subscription the reader has seen why it was never performed it produced a much larger sum of money for its author than it could have done had it made its public appearance even had its success been equal to the beggars opera which event is impossible to have happened for it had neither the novelty the interest the writing or any other single requisite of equal merit to recommend it and this shows how absurd those who were inimical to gay acted for had they let it come out it would not only have died away unheeded itself but have been a severer reproach to its author than its suppression which rather than injure gay lifted him into more consequence this was pretty well evinced when colman revived it in the year      it was then found to be an insipid unentertaining performance a remarkable circumstance happened upon this occasion the duchess of queensberry who had been gays patroness who had made so much interest to get this piece performed and who finding the tide of power so strong against it was so very instrumental in procuring its author that large subscription on the publishing it was fifty years afterward at this representation of it in the haymarket she was very old and survived her last visit to this production of her favorite but a few weeks   acis and galatea a well known and beautiful written pastoral opera has been so often repeated and attended to with so much pleasure that it is unnecessary here to dwell upon its merits as to the music as a work of genius it is clearly the best composition of handel it is astonishinly varied and yet always pastoral nay the very gigantic pipe of polypheme seems to breath magnified tenderness but i shall go into this more particularly hereafter when i place handel and arne by the side of each other  achilles was again an opera it has had very little success either originally or at any time when it has been revived the distressed wife a comedy was left finished by gay but not perhaps to that perfection it would have been had he lived to have seen it brought on the stage it has been attempted but without success there is another thing attributed to this author called the rehearsal at gotham which we know but little about  thus we have seen that no one of his pieces had success any thing equal to the beggars opera and the reason in great measure is that they were generally upon the same plan without the merit of originality or so fortunate a conveyance this blunted the edge of the satire and destroyed the interest another reason is that the music of the beggars opera seems to have exhausted all that was to be found beautiful in ballad composition or at least it comprehended the most choice selection for there cannot be any thing more exquisite natural sweet and delightful than those airs who selected them we are not told they were harmonized by pepusch and when we find in them that the best airs originated as far back as ferrabosco and rizzio who only improved what was more ancient who shall show melodies so delicious so affecting so winning as those of the english and the scotch  thus we have seen gay leave a counter to shine in the most brilliant circles of poetic attraction to be praised envied disappointed neglected and at last to die with a broken heart the world are certainly the better for this but as to himself however he acquired applause patronage reputation and posthumous fame his life would have been more happy and contented had he pursued any trade but the trade of a poet  fielding was but an indifferent poet but he has left behind him one species of reputation which no author ever so eminently possessed his novels have hitherto been unequalled tom jones is perhaps the finest assemblage of natural characters and happy incidents in any language joseph andrews has a vein of the purest and most gratifying humor within the conception of human ingenuity and were it not that it is professedly written as a satire on one author and in imitation of another it would be very nearly a complete work in its kind amelia manifests a most astonishing judgment of fieldings knowledge of the world there is scarcely a person or circumstance introduced in that novel but every body knows to be somebody or something already seen in real life in short though these novels may have  and indeed so has the sun resplendent as it is  something to cavil at yet the worst of them greatly excels the best of any other author if nature truth interest humor and character are the requisites of such productions  fieldings dramatic works have great merit but they are not so well calculated for the stage as the closet he could not write ill and in general his dialogue has marks of strong nature and pointed character but it is too witty congreve at last fell off as to success sweets will cloy this is however no reproach but as men of genius rather a compliment to both congreve and fielding  as it was impossible for fielding to bring forward any work unworthy the attention of the public so his dramatic pieces have a considerable claim to applause but they were in general slight and indigested as to stage effect the author seeming to fancy that the strong and nervous style in which he was at all times capable of writing would answer every purpose in this he was mistaken for cibber who did not write so well by knowing the trim of the theater and the town had at all times better success  fieldings first piece was a comedy called love in several masks it came out immediately after the provoked husband it nevertheless had good success and there is certainly in it some strong and nervous dialogue the temple beau was performed at goodmans fields in    0 this was a hasty play but has nevertheless strong wit and humor but it is more gay than interesting which is fieldings great fault the authors farce which contains the rehearsal of another farce called the pleasures of the town is a thing intended to ridicule the italian opera this has always been done with partial success but whoever attempts to destroy the temple of folly will soon see its votaries mending the depredations as carefully though not so laudably as ants repair every innovation upon their nests  tom thumb is at this moment well known its humor is in the truest style of burlesque the coffee house politicians was performed at the little theater in the haymarket and had good success it is however greatly inferior to the generality of this authors dramatic works the letter writers had much about the same sat and possessed the same pretensions fieldings five act pieces have always something good but always want consequence the welsh opera which was afterward called the grub street opera is by no means a good piece some of the ballads are sprightly but upon the whole it is a strange jumble  the lottery is a very pleasant ballad farce indeed there are very few of fieldings after pieces that are not very entertaining the modern husband      was a found written comedy but it was not sufficiently balanced by either pleasantry or interest the mock doctor taken from molieres medicin magre lui has been always a successful favorite fieldings genius seems to have a kindred feeling with that of moliere the humor however of both though perfectly chaste and natural had something too saturnine something too much of cervantes for general broad laugh an ingredient considered so necessary in farces  the debauchees was levelled at the jesuits and to good purpose but one species of religious hypocricy is like another and fielding was a good deal forestalled by drydens spanish friar and cibbers nonjuror there is nevertheless considerable merit in the piece the covent garden tragedy is a burlesque on the distressed mother but the characters are too low being composed of bawds bullies and others of that description it has nevertheless considerable humor the miser is certainly the most valuable of fieldings plays it is molieres avare but greatly improved it is chaste proper and full of nature and would some of our modern playwrights in this age of equivoque look at the scenes of coincidence in that comedy it might be no bad hint to correct that monstrous assemblage of unnatural and incongruous circumstances that seem now to be received as the criterion of comic writing or rather of comic plotting every real well wisher to the interest and consequence of the stage must grieve to see this valuable play cut down to a farce and performed by the most indifferent actors in the theater  the intriguing chambermaid      is an admirable farce it is in some measure taken from the dissipateur of destouches a piece with which several authors have made pretty free don quioxte in england is what one must naturally suppose well written for whoever copied cervantes so faithfully as fielding and ill calculated for the stage because mere knight errantry without spectacle never yet had success upon the english theater if he had carried don quixote to any other part of the world and have introduced a few elephants or camels and made him fight half a dozen tigers and have decorated the stage with castles that lose their battlements in the air about fifteen feet from the ground the whole an outrage upon nature and art the redoubted knight as mad as his audiences might have acted every species of extravagance to the admiration of full houses  the virgin unmasked and miss lucy in town which is the sequel to it are pleasant pieces and claim a place among the hoydens notables prues and corinnas which by being always in nature give constant pleasure pasquin and all the consequences of its being performed we have already gone over as well as the historical register euridice was damned and euridice hissed its sequel met with and deserved the same fate for an apology for a bad piece when an author could have produced a good one is an insult and ought not to be admitted  tumble down dick was a satire upon richs pantomimes a useless one because nobody cared about the propriety of pantomimes so they had enough of harlequin and colombine plutus was translated from aristophanes by fielding and young it was never performed the wedding day acted in      is a comedy which met with very little success and indeed deserved very little it was the last of fieldings pieces who had he lived in ease and tranquillity would certainly have written better for the stage for it is absurd to suppose that he did not know every dramatic requisite and no man has given more abundant proof of being a complete judge of character of effect and of human nature  aaron hill who seems to have fagged himself into learning if not into genius who did the task of the noble dunces at westminster school that his mind might have an unusual portion of exercise who in his thirst after knowledge followed his relation lord paget to constantinople and by this means traveled through egypt palestine and the greatest part of the east in company with a well informed tutor who afterward became tutor to sir william hamilton and acquitted himself though little more than a boy to the satisfaction of his pupils friends who was the projector of nut oil of masts of ships from scotch firs of cultivating georgia and of pot ash and who in short as a writer had all the merit due at least to indefatigable toil and industry was the author of seventeen dramatic pieces principally tragedies  elfrid produced in    0 was afterward rewritten and brought out in      under the tittle of athelwold it is an exaggeration of the story of elfrida in which the character of athelwold is so totally different from the history as to be an object of detestation instead of pity a circumstance that totally destroys the poetical beauty of the fable who but such an author in stilts could have thought of making that character an object of commiseration who is a traitor to his mistress his friend and his king the walking statue was a farce and a very indifferent one trick upon trick was again a farce it was damned on the first night  rinaldo was the celebrated opera composed by handel we have seen that it was written by hill in english and translated into italian by rossi the badini of that day the fatal vision was a tragedy and performed in      the second title of the fate of siam is fictitious and intended only to give the appearance of truth to enforce the facts which are wholly invention it is written to reprobate rashness a kind of lear in water colors henry the fifth is a historical play imitated from shakespeare there is some merit in it and the introduction of lord scropes niece who had been seduced by henry and yet who discovers the plot upon his life is interesting but nobody wishes to see shakespars plays altered since it is so difficult for alteration to amend them  zara was performed in      in this tragedy which is taken from voltaire and upon the whole is his best play if not the best play upon the french theater hill has gone so infinitely beyond all his other productions that in point of the true requisites of tragedy it is almost the most perfect also on the english stage it consists of a simple interesting and unembarrassed story and being written at that time when voltaire had still all that glow of patriotism in his mind which had revolted the minds of his countrymen when he wrote brutus it was peculiarly adapted to the english stage so that hill had that part of the work most likely to insure its popularity ready done to his hands i find an anecdote in a french history of the english stage relative to zara so singular that though i do not discover the smallest trace of it in all the english materials i have collected i cannot refrain from relating it especially as time place and circumstances very strongly combine to give it feasibility an english gentleman named bond being delighted with the zaire of voltaire employed a poet of reputation to translate it into english and endeavored to get it performed at drury lane theater but to no purpose he therefore determined to get it represented privately among his friends and chose the part of lusignan for himself it was performed in a concert room in york buildings neither pains nor expense was spared to render the performance respectable and the assembly was numerous and elegant the applause was universal and well merited but that bestowed on mr bond was much louder and more sincere than all the rest together his acting was considered as a prodigy and he yielded himself up so to the force and impetuosity of his imagination that on the discovery of his daughter he fainted away here the applause was redoubled but finding that he continued a long time in that situation the audience began they knew not why to be uneasy and apprehensive with some difficulty chatillon and nerestan placed him in his chair when he saintly spoke extended his arms to receive his children lifted up his eyes to heaven and then closed them for ever   it is remarkable that zara both in france and in england had the adventitious advantage of being greatly assisted at its first representation for as on the french stage as i have already mentioned it brought forward dufresne and mademoiselle gaussin so on the english stage a near relation of hill performed osman and mrs cibber made her first appearance on the theater in zara  alvira      was also a translation from voltaire but though it is well written it did not as we have seen succeed greatly in france the truth is it was too much after their own model in point of stage regularity and too full of declamation which hill has unfortunately rendered duller than in the original in france envy attributed it to some scribbler from whom it was said voltaire stole it in england it excited no envy and therefore hill was permitted quietly to keep it to himself  these were all the works of hill before the appearance of garrick to whom we shall arrive after i have in the next chapter given an account of inferior authors from   0  to that period  chap iii charles johnson hughes thomson theo bald savage lillo and other authors i am now compelled to give the account of other authors before garrick as briefly as possible i shall nevertheless mark as strongly as my limits will permit me the most prominent features of their respective works and though i cannot dwell particularly on all the circumstances that attended their success i shall endeavor to place every author in as conspicuous a situation as his public reception entitled him to  charles johnson who as we are told was famous for writing a play every year and being at buttons every day must according to this calculation have been before the public nineteen years for he produced that number of dramatic pieces the fact is however that he took one and thirty years to accomplish that task his first piece the gentleman cully came out in   0  it is only attributed to johnson by coxeter but it is no matter who was the author of it for it has very little merit  fortune in her wits   0  this is a bad translation of cowleys naufragium joculare it was not performed love and liberty a tragedy was intended for drury lane theater it is dedicated to the judicious critics throughout the town who had however no proper opportunity of judging of its merits for it was never performed the force of friendship was a tragedy and the first play poor johnson could get on the stage it however might as well have been kept off for it was completely damned as well as an after piece called love in a chest which accompanied it so that as far as we have gone johnsons labor was labor in vain  johnson having hitherto sound very few dramatic materials in himself thought it would be a wiser way to have recourse to others his next play called the wises relief is borrowed from shirleys gamester and had success its principal merits however we have gone over in the account of shirley it was produced in      the successful pirate      johnson next paid a visit to carlell from whom he stole the best materials he could in arviragus and philicia but the original was bad and the copy worse the generous husband was borrowed from nobody and therefore had no success the victim      johnson is charged with having borrowed this play from boyers achilles and racines iphigenie it was time misapplied however and so the public thought  the country lasses was a more fortunate business for in order to make assurance double sure it is as i formerly noticed taken from three plays which had been in part taken from others it has been at times revived with success and kenrick fashioned it into an opera which was performed at covent garden theater upon this occasion the musician whose name appeared in the bills as the composer was determined to convince the public that he understood thieving as well as the original author of the piece  the cobbler of preston which is taken from shakespeare was thought so well of before it made its appearance that bullock the actor wrote a piece upon the same subject which was begun and finished in four and twenty hours in order to get the start of the other but if they had been both burnt before they had made their appearance it would have been no great matter the sultaness is a translation of racines bazajet which is his worst play and we find it here less considerable than the original it was performed in      and some how or other procured johnson a corner in the dunciad  the masquerade was an insignificant thing entirely invented by johnson love in a forest is neither more nor less than shakespeares as you like it most barbarously mangled and disfigured it would insult the reader to notice its success the female fortune teller this play is only attributed to johnson it is not very material however for it has not merit enough to help even his fame the village opera is very poorly written and had but indifferent success it furnished the hint however of love in a village which is made up of this play the gentleman dancing master le jeu de lamour et du hazard of marivaux and two or three other things  with the ephesian matron a farce of one act medea a tragedy only attributed to him and bad enough to have belonged to a worse author and coelia or the perjured lover we finish the plays of charles johnson the last of these he calls a play and the epilogue was written by fielding but he seems to have profited so little by his long experience that he left off as much slighted as he began  of hughes whom it has been the fashion to praise as a man and condemn as a poet the world have seen nothing dramatic but the siege of damascus except some trifling and some unfinished pieces in that tragedy however there is enough of the poet and enough of the dramatist to show that had he thought proper to bend his talents more toward the stage he would have stood very high as a theatrical writer addison had such an opinion of him that he entreated him out of despair as he said of his own powers to write a fifth act to cato but the jealousy of the dramatic tartusse made him soon repent of his request and before hughes had finished it he took care to write one himself  hughes as well as a poet was a musician and a painter and of no mean description but he seems to have possessed the two last accomplishments more as an amateur than a master his taste for music induced him to write cantatas and ballads which though hasty are many of them very creditable steel speaks of him in those three capacities very warmly and had not his zeal to check the italian opera the abuses of which spectacle has always been abused and always will prevail pervaded his musical pieces his time would not been have so ill employed  besides the siege of damascus of which the coolest of his admirers for he had no enemies speaks of in terms of commendation he wrote the misanthrope a mere translation and never performed and calypso and telemachus an opera performed in      the music was composed by galliard and it seems intended to show what ought to be considered as rational in an opera a part of that species of dramatic amusement even if it could be admitted that would never be admired  apollo and daphne was a masque this was written with the same laudable view but to no better purpose cupid and hymen was a masque of the same description which with the first act of the miser from moliere and one scene only from the orestes of euripides make up the small catalogue of this authors dramatic works  thomson the celebrated author of the seasons poems full of extraordinary merit and extraordinary singularity to which latter quality they most owed their success as the seasons have been as much read and as much criticized as any thing in the english language men of uncommon information have generally handled it with the greatest severity which is a proof that its faults are such as ought not to be pardoned to a man of brilliant genius herne the critic whose observations though critical and accurate have seldom any acrimony speaks of thomson in one of his chapters on literature where he treats of that figure in speech which he calls utter absurdity i shall transcribe the passage  james thomson in his poem called spring among his seasons has with great tenderness of heart pleaded as from his very bowels against the inhuman practice of killing oxen to make beef stakes and almost told us he would rather want his stake than have any such doings nay what is still more tender he advises us not to torment poor worms by putting them upon the hook alive  upon the hook for what purpose why to catch fish to be sure which he proceeds to give us cool directions for as a fine diversion  strait as above the surface of the flood  they wanton rise or urged by hunger leap  then fix with gentle twitch the barbed book  some lightly tossing to the grassy bank  and to the shelving shore slow dragging some o jamie jamie had you no bowels for fish the poor man forgot that fish had feelings i suppose because he was fond of catching and eating them whereas killing of oxen was quite out of his way      whose poetry has eminent beauties and gross faults but who had such an original genius that the want of his name would make a material chasm in english literature was the author of six dramatic pieces  the first play of thomson was sophonisba a subject we have seen repeatedly treated it came out in    0 at the time he was writing it he had published winter which was written into fame though it had merit before it was known whether it possessed any at all the public expectation therefore was a tip toe for this his first dramatic production and the rehearsals were crowded by an assemblage of all that was fashionable about town this anticipation of its public reception however only foretold that its real effect would not be reputable it was considered as a dull moral performance and one single line gave a ludicrous opportunity to turn it into a jest a symptom generally fatal to tragedy  this line was parodied in fieldings tom thumb in thomsons play it was oh sophonisba sophonisba oh   in fieldings sarce it was oh huncamunca huncamunca oh and the town by way of making it more ludicrous added oh jemmy thomson jemmy thomson oh if every tragedy were to be laid aside for a nonsensical line i am afraid there would be but little employ for melpomene  agamemnon a tragedy was performed in      and had every assistance from thomsons friends and among the rest pope affecting to patronize it placed himself very forward in the theater during its representation the good people of england however like to feel for themselves and could not be taught to find any merit in it  edward and eleonora was prepared for the stage but interdicted by the lord chamberlain some say by the connivance of the author who feared its public fate but this is a very improbable story the history of the play is well known or rather well believed it is the circumstance of eleonora queen to edward the first who is said to have cured her husband by sucking the venom from a wound he received from a poisoned arrow  the masque of alfred written in conjunction with mallet so beautifully composed by arne and of which every body knows the success is the last of thomsons dramatic performances before garrick who performed in tancred and sigismunda his next play which circumstance of course lent that consequence to the piece that has been the means of keeping up the reputation it acquired  theobald  whose edition of shakespeares works was preferred to the editions of pope warburton and hanmer and with reason because however he might have been a heavy minded man it had that sort of merit for which addison preferred ticklers homer to popes that is to say more of shakespeare in it and indeed more honest inclination to do justice to the subject it treated  has very little else to be remembered by he wrote eighteen dramatic pieces of one description or other which i shall now describe i am sorry to say that justice will not let me speak their eulogium  electra      was a mere translation from sophocles the persian princess      was written according to the authors account before he was nineteen this is one reason perhaps that it is so full of puerility the perfidious brother      is the orphan spoilt another man a watch maker of the name of mestayer says that theobald stole this play from one written by him on the same subject oedipus king of thebes is a translation from sophocles with critical notes and a heavy business it is plutus and the clouds are of course from aristophanes none of these greek tragedies and comedies were intended for the stage  pan and syrinx was an opera set to music by galliard who was a sprightly composer with considerable genius this piece had some success in the ladys triumph a piece written by settle theobald introduced some episodic parts which were set to music richard the second altered from shakespeare had success lord orrery made theobald a present upon this occasion of a hundred pounds enclosed in a snuff box worth twenty the rape of proserpine apollo and daphne and harlequin sorcerer were the next productions of this author these pantomimes are well known though they do more credit to the machinest and musician than the author some of the music of the sorcerer was composed and in a very fine style by dr arne the rest and all that remains of the original is by galliard  the double falsehood      theobald endeavored to palm on the world for a production of shakespeare probably because he wished the brat to have a good father dr farmer says it was by shirley and mr malone gives it to massinger it is generally however believed to be theobalds and thus these reports compose a triple falsehood the proverb of too many cooks spoil the broth was here reversed for the play had very good success orestes      why this piece is called an opera it is difficult to say perhaps because the subject is romantic and it is interspersed with a little music it is a strange thing and the public were of that opinion the fatal secret was k to every body before it came out for it is stolen from websters duchess of malfy orpheus and eidice is the famous pantomime under that title the happy captive is the last of theobalds pieces and intended to ridicule the italian opera it is however so ridiculous itself that it recoiled and wounded its author  savage whose strange turbulent life has been so laboriously written by dr johnson had however very little either in that or his writings to command public applause if he had an unnatural mother he was himself unnatural and ungrateful toward all his brothers and sisters of creation for he never enjoyed the bounty or friendship of any individual whom he did not offend and incence which is so well known by those who have read the long catalogue of his strange vicissitudes that it is unneccessary if it were not impossible to go into it here  savages dramatic works are love in a veil a comedy and sir thomas overbury a tragedy the first though brought out under the advantage of the kindest attention from wilks and steel which he returned as usual with ingratitude had no success the other was sparingly praised it yielded altogether from the theater and the press some say two hundred pounds some only one  lillo the celebrated author of george barnwell was an original english writer of great merit it is impossible to deny that domestic subjects are best treated in natural and unaffected language and derive most pathos and interest from forcible prose than measured blank verse the heart knows nothing of heroics it cannot feign it cannot be depressed shocked or torn raised interested or delighted so well by any language as that which utters ideas expressive of naked and instant conception all sublimity is simple and if no author has hit it oftener than shakespeare it is because his verse has all the force and fidelity of prose  lillos first piece was silvia or the country burial it was an opera and was performed in      at which time nothing of this description could possibly succeed owing to the great reputation of the beggars opera it must be confessed that its own fair pretentions to public favor were very slender  george barnwell is so well known that it is difficult to make any addition to what has been already said of it dr johnson has declared that he scarcely thinks a tragedy in prose dramatic that it is difficult for performers to speak it that the lowest when impassioned raise their language i think he had better have said their voices for as to their language i believe upon such occasions it is lowered even to blackguardism and that the writing of prose is generally the plea or excuse of poverty of genius  lillo has very plainly given the lie to all this in george barnwell a play that would have lost all its pathos had it been in blank verse and this fact is so strongly proved that if it had not boasted sterling and valuable merit to a most uncommon degree it must have sunk under the weight of that calumny which was intended to crush it but says an author those auditors who brought with them the old ballad from which the play was taken with a view to ridicule and decry it were at length obliged to drop their ballads and pull out their handkerchiefs  the christian hero is taken from scanderbeg and is by no means a proper subject either for the stage or for lillo fatal curiosity is however proper for both for it is certainly very interesting and admirably well treated there is a mixture of horror and tenderness in it which in a very uncommon degree penetrate the heart the story though the circumstance really happened is extremely novel and the moral is grand and commanding there seems nothing against us success were it to be revived but its length for it is in three acts and even a good author would tremble at an attempt to extend it to five marina a play of three acts is taken from pericles britannia is a masque written on the marriage of the princess of orange and the princess royal  elmeric was a posthumous work of lillo it did no particular credit to his reputation arden of of feversham was left in an imperfect state but it was finished by dr hoadly and brought out with success in      this play is written upon the old story from which a tragedy had before been made it was falsely imputed to shakespeare and introduced by the following title the lamentable and true tragedy of m arden of feversham in kent who was most wickedlye murdered by the means of his disloyal and wanton wise who for the love she bare for one mosbie hired two desperate ruffins blackwill and shagbag to kill him  charles shadwell nephew or as some say son to the laureat whom dryden has immortalized by his mac flecknoe enjoyed some public post in ireland and wrote seven dramatic productions all which except one the fair quaker of deal an account of which and miss santlows celebrity we have seen were performed on the irish stage they were called the humors of the army the hasty wedding sham prince rotheric oconnor plotting lovers and irish hospitality in all these pieces shadwell has studied dancourt taking up such slight flimzy circumstances as might form temporary exhibitions the humors of the army is exactly les curieux de compeigne  taverner was a name a good deal distinguished in various branches of the arts the present object of our notice practiced the civil law in doctors commons and painted and wrote plays for his amusement and certainly in no mean degree for the amusement of the public he however painted better than he wrote the titles of his plays are the faithful bride of grenada the maid the mistress the female advocates the artful husband the artful wife and it is well if it takes  swiney whose history has been already pretty well traced wrote the quacks camilla and pyrrhus and demetrius the first is a poor farce and the others were done in quality of operatical manager ward was a whimsical fellow of strong natural parts who finding that he could breathe no atmosphere but that of an alehouse resolved to keep one himself he was by no means a bad writer and was distinguished by a mock heroic poem in the style of hudibras called the reformation his dramatic pieces are honesty in distress the humors of a coffee house and the prisoners opera there was another ward who wrote the happy lovers the petticoat plotter and the widows wish  philips who was one of the satelites that moved about addison and whose sappho is thought by some to be worth all the rest of his works his pastorals and his tragedy included even though he is supposed to be greatly indebted to his friends for their assistance in it and whose namby pamby is said by a great man to have delighted all ranks from a walpole the steerer of the helm to miss pulteney in her nursery wrote for the stage the distressed mother the briton and humphrey duke of gloucester  the distressed mother is completely from the andromacque of racine it was puffed into reputation by addison and all his friends and certainly has a degree of merit the perpetual seesaw however of interest being divided between four characters who relieve one another like sentinels or buckets in a well is intolerably tedious i once saw it acted by four performers each of whom had a different lisp the briton was brought out in      it was well received but has been ever since neglected humphrey as good a designation of a briton as the other was not so well received  ozel was little more than an industrious translator his pieces are principally translations from moliere whose whole works he has given the public corneille racine and others and as he thus occupied himself for amusement rather than emolument being employed in business very lucratively and respectably his pieces were little adapted for the stage  carey the well known writer of several farces which occasionally are now revived with pleasure was by profession a musician he had some genius but little taste there is scarcely any thing of his however but has something like merit though not actually the thing itself sir john hawkins has impartially and rather generously described his character as a musician says he carey seems to have been the first of the lowest rank and as a poet the last of that class of which durfey was the first with this difference that in all the songs written on love wine and such kind of subjects he seems to have manifested an inviolable regard for decency and good manners the author before me finishes an account of his history with these words he led a life free from reproach and hanged himself october  th       harging and marriage was never acted the contrivances has been acted and very frequently with considerable success everybody knows that arethusa used to be the probationary part of female singers before they were bold enough to venture upon characters of more consequence a mode of conduct which would be more serviceable to the stage than beginning as is usual now with stepping on the top round of the ladder a circumstance that precludes asscension and may produce a fall amelia after the italian manner and produced at the french theater had no great merit here we begin to see the extent of careys musical abilities for whenever the limits of the poetry exceeded mere trifles he was obliged to call in assistance lamp a man of considerable merit composed this opera teraminta was a piece of the same description the music was composed by smith i very much suspect that carey could do little more than invent a melody and get some other person to transmit his ideas from his mind to paper or at least the arrangement of it not so bad but something like the lady composers of the present day and indeed the gentlemen too in some cases  chrononhotonthologos is a well known burlesque in which there are many passages that successfully ridicule inflated and bombastic writing the idea of the warriors piling himself upon dead bodies till he reached the gods who invited him for his heroism to remain with them which offer he rejected because he was summoned to earth by the eyes of his mistress is very happy the honest yorkshireman is a true english farce and has much pleasantry the parts of the music which are not selected came very properly within the reach of careys musical genius  the dragon of wantley has frequently given pleasure on the stage it is much more the right sort of burlesque on italian operas than the generality of pieces written upon that principle the terror excited in the old ballad by the dragon and the superiority of moore of moorehall to either hercules or st george are admirable materials for the purpose for says the ballad speaking of hercules and the dragon of lerna  he had a club  his dragon to drub  or he never had dont i warrant ye  but moore of moorehall  with nothing at all  soon slew the dragon of wantley   margery the sequel to the dragon is unfortunate as indeed are sequels in general betty or the country bumpkin was not successful but nancy or the parting lovers is a happy trisle and has always had success the song of and can thou leave thy nancy shows that careys mind was musical there is more genius in it than in many a labored fugue  bullock son to the celebrated actor of that name was himself an actor and a dramatic writer but he fell short of his father in one profession and of his cotemporaries in the other his pieces are as follows womans revenge a comedy      is a filtration of bettertons match in newgate which he had filtrated from marstons dutch courtezan the slip merits its name for it is no more than a cion from middletons mad world my masters adventures of half an hour was scarcely suffered by the audience half that time the cobbler of preston we have already seen an account of in the article charles johnson  the perjuror is a very poor thing it seems intended to reprobate the constant breach of official oaths and to strike at trading justices constables and their understrappers but such characters are too callous to be hurt by so tiny a club bullock seems to have acted the hercules with a switch in his hand womans a riddle was claimed by savage and brought out by bullock but is nothing more than a translation of a spanish play by a lady the traitor      if bullocks attempts in comedy were so ineffectual this single effort of tragedy must be of course ten times worse this traitor which has been also attributed to shirley and to rivers betrayed bullock into the folly of confirming the town in their opinion that he had very poor pretensions as a dramatic writer  theophilus cibber whose variegated and complicate history was as scandalous and would have been as noticeable as that of savage if he had been born with as much genius who was forward in all manner of theatrical schisms and got into all manner of scrapes who has been considered by goldsmith and others to have fortunately escaped hanging by being drowned who in short was a constant imposition in every thing he said and did all which is attributed by an author to his having been born on the day of the most memorable storm ever known in this kingdom which happened november   th   0  brought out for we cannot say he wrote six dramatic pieces t cibber was allowed by the world to claim some share of reputation from the work published in five volumes and called cibbers lives of the poets but johnson upon indubitable authority no less than having the original manuscript in his possession insists that cibber had no hand in it whatever for that it was the work of robert shiels a native of scotland to whom he pays some handsome compliments there is one matter rather irreconcilable in this account for johnson says that this work was never seen by either of the cibbers and yet he informs the reader that cibber betrayed the name of the author for ten guineas this is a curious circumstance altogether cibber published the work as his own he must therefore not only have seen it but have purchased it of shiels and a promise of secrecy along with it which secrecy must have been kept by shiels inviolably till his death which happened as johnson tells us just after the work was published how came johnson to know this fact does he mean to say it was to him that cibber betrayed the secret for ten guineas or what is more unlikely did he know shiels and his hand writing and by that means was able to ascertain that the manuscript in his possession was written by shiels really this bare assertion contradicting itself so many ways is very questionable  henry the sixth a miserable alteration of shakespeares play was performed only in the summer and received very little applause but yet more than it merited the lover which play he dedicated to his wife whose acting gave it the little celebrity it obtained was a flimzy piece full of common place and puerility patie and peggy is allen ramseys gentle shepherd reduced to one act cibber boasts that he achieved this mighty task in one day which he might easily do pen and ink being totally out of the question and nothing more being necessary for the labor of this memorable playwright than paste and a pair of scissars the harlots progress was an obscene thing which was deservedly hissed romeo and juliet if any thing could revolt the town i think it must have been to see an attempt to improve shakespeare by theophilus cibber the auction was an interlude stolen from fieldings historical register  coffey an irishman who was possessed of an inexhaustable fund of that humor that distinguishes the low irish who had a knack of patching up old plays and farces and who performed aesop for his benefit merely because he was deformed for he was an execrable actor brought out southwark fair a droll taken from an old play the beggars wedding made up from the jovial crew and other things phoebe the same piece cut into a farce the female parson which was damned the first night the devil to pay or the wives metamorphosed a well known and justly admired farce not however written by coffey but metamorphosed by him mottley the two cibbers and others from shadwells devil of a wife the boarding school taken from a miserable play of durfey the merry cobbler a sequel to the devil to pay and damned the first night and the devil upon two sticks stolen from an indifferent play written by one gwinnet  mottley derived more consideration from his being a man of family and some fortune than by his dramatic efforts the imperial captives a tragedy    0 merely a passable production was performed for a few nights with that negative sort of success which to an author of any spirit is more than a positive damnation antiochus is founded on the strange improbable or if probable the unnatural story of seleucas nicanor who gave up his wife stratonice to his son antiochus who was dying for love of her that folly which is a satire on the passions instead of a compliment to them ought not to be made a subject of the drama this would be a good theme for kotzebue  penelope      this is a burlesque of homers odyssey mottley was assisted in it by cook it was intended or supposed to be so by pope as a satire upon his homer and therefore cook is crammed into the notes in the dunciad the craftsman is only a poor satire on a newspaper under that title widow bewitched this was the best of mottleys plays and had the best success but the wicked compared with the more wicked seem lovely  griffin was an author and an actor he brought out injured virtue a tragedy      merely altered from massinger and decker love in a sack a poor farce humors of purgatory taken from the comic part of southerns fatal marriage the masquerade a thing that had temporary success and whig and tory which had no success at all  the remainder of those authors before garrick i shall take in a summary way hunt wrote the fall of tarquin a most wretched piece says my intelligence jacob was author of the poetical register and produced love in a wood a farce never performed and the soldiers last stake this he informs his readers was ready for the stage which of course was not ready to receive it for it never made its appearance sir hildibrand jacob who wrote poems and other publications produced the fatal constancy a tragedy      performed with applause enough to encourage its author to go on just as we are tempted to play after winning the first stakes the nest of plays was three comedies in one it was damned the first night some say because it had no merit and others because it was the first play brought out after the licensing act the last reason seems nonsense  mrs haywood a most whimsical writer who seemed determined to prove that women cannot not only talk faster but write faster than men whose novels essays and other productions of a similar kind take up nineteen volumes who took mrs manlfy for her model whose indecency so offended pope that he clapped her up in the dunciad and who is defended by her biographer because though she wrote indecently at first she wrote delicately afterward from which this charitable advocate supposes that she was gallant in the early part of her life and afterward reformed  wrote four dramatic pieces fair captive wife to let frederick duke of brunswick and opera of operas which the same gentleman confesses were but indifferent the first was not written by her but by captain hurst the second did not succeed though the lady attempted the principal part the third was damned and the fourth was fieldings tom thumb set to music  samuel johnson not the lexicographer but the author of hurlothrumbo got some reputation by affecting singularity a trick that has too often imposed upon the public he wrote also cheshire comics the blazing comet and all alive and merry these pieces were all represented at the haymarket the rage for hurlothrumbo was a disgrace to the public for the audience were fairly laughed at all through the piece  the author honestly tells them that they will find it full of madness and extravagance fine thoughts and unintelligible fustian and fiction and thus goes on in a mixed style between the euphiusm of lylly and the visions of rabelais performing the principal character himself and confessing that it is impossible for them to understand him owing to their not tasting the different sentiments as he did when he composed the piece by sometimes playing on a siddle and sometimes walking in stilts  how such incomprehensible stupidity cold have been followed with the insatiable avidity it was challenges astonishment the fact however is indubitable all the world flocked to hear this rhapsodical nonsense a set of smarts formed themselves into what they called the hurlothrumbo society nay it is said that sir robert walpole encouraged this infatuation to amuse the people while some state secrets were getting properly ripe for discovery  estcourt of whom i have already spoken of as an actor brought out the fair example a comedy and prunella an interlude neither of which claim much rank as dramatic pieces smith wrote phoedra and hyppolitus   0  this play was performed but three nights which doctor johnson accounts for by saying that it pleased the critics and the critics only it is true that addison says the neglect of it was disgraceful to the nation but addison always lavished praises on those writers from whose abilities he had nothing to fear  fyfe an obscure author wrote the royal martyr king charles the first governor hunter who took two thousand palatines to settle at new york and who was at different times governor of new york virginia the jerseys and jamaica wrote a thing distinguished as a biographical farce called androborus lord blessington wrote a contemptible farce called the lost princess charles lord otrery was the author of an unsuccessful comedy the prologue by lord landsdown called as you find it dr king known by his siding with sacheveral by having a hand in the examiner by writing the art of love and the art of cookery produced a tragicomedy called joan of headington crimes who was a schoolmaster and famous for exciting insurrections among his boys wrote a thing which he called an opera alluding to peace  the famous puppet show powell rival of the italian opera produced a mock performance called venus and adonis jackson translated ajax from sophocles blanch wrote three pieces which were however not performed they were called the beau merchant swords into anchors and hoops into spinning wheels hamilton wrote two miserable things called doting lovers and the petticoat plotter the last of which however in consequence of the authors interest who was related to the duke of hamilton procured him a handsome benefit at advanced prices  molloy who was a staunch advocate for government and therefore says my author was neglected by ministry wrote the perplexed couple the coquette and the half pay officers neither of which met with any great success says the same author although in one of them an old woman of eightyfive called peg friar played a part and danced a jig three pieces called the earl of mar marred the prerenders flight and the inquisition are attributed to an author of the name of john philips though very uncertain accounts are given of either this author or these plays knipe wrote a farce called the city ramble  brereton a major in the army in two pieces he produced imitated racines esther and corneilles policuete booth the actor wrote an opera called the death of dido which was composed by pepusche mrs davys an irishwoman and the keeper of a coffee house wrote the northern heiress and the self rival one only of these pieces was performed and that had but very indifferent success leveridge the singer wrote pyramus and thisbe breval wrote the confederates and the play is the plot from which pieces were taken the strollers and the rape of helen the confederates is a satire on three hours after marriage which breval published under the assumed name of joseph gay this was provocation enough for pope who instantly introduced breval into the dunciad weaver was a dancing master and a dramatic poet a coalion of extremities in talents rather rare the head and the heels seldom having any thing to do with each other in the way of genius these pieces are a sort of pantomimes and are called mars and venus orpheus and euridice persius and andromeda and the judgment of paris  beckingham who was represented as a soldier and nothing more wrote scipio africanus and henry the fourth of france two pieces correctly regular and therefore insufferably dull brown produced a stupid farce called the two harlequins from the french of le noble sir thomas moore brought out a tragedy full of the absurdities of hurlothrumbo without its genius called manjora it is impossible to avoid selecting the following passages by way of giving an idea of the bombast that ignorant authors fancy they may foist upon the town with impunity in one part of the play the king says by all the ancient gods of rome and greece i love my daughter better than my niece if any one should ask the reason why i will tell em nature makes the strongest tie    in another call up my guards call em up every one if you dont call all you may as well call none    dr smith of this gentleman a circumstance is related which does the highest honor to the feelings and friendship of wilks the actor smith was designed for the church but finding it impossible to become an orator from an impediment in his speech he was determined to turn his thoughts to some other profession and upon considering the matter every way he at last thought physic the best choice he could possibly make to furnish himself with the means of prosecuting his studies he wrote a play called the captive princess it was refused by the actors but wilks entering into the spirit of smiths intention and greatly approving the good sense of his plan offered him a benefit for it which he rendered so profitable that it enabled his friend to enter himself at leyden where he applied to the study of physic so diligently that doctor boerhaave recommended him to the czarina who made him one of the physicians of the russian court wilks received a letter from smith after he was established in russia in which he speaks of his situation and gives him advice of furs and other presents which he had sent him to show how much he was obliged to wilks and how gratefully he felt toward him i shall quote the latter part of his letter  but who gave me these furs this affluence this royal mistress this happy situation a man just of your age and stature if you cannot find him out ask my dear and worthy friend sir harry wildair and tell him at the same time the grain was his and the reaper with the crop shall ever be at his command   tolson who was a clergyman and by his irregularities begat a suspicion that he had murdered a child the consequence of an illicit amor with a young lady of distinction and who afterward became chaplain to the earl of sussex and was protected by lady longueville produced the earl of warrick t killigrew of the old stock of his name who was gentleman of the bed chamber to george the second when he was prince of wales wrote a trifle called chit chat croxall of whom there is nothing remarkable but his being a staunch whig wrote a dramatic performance which is however nothing more than a version of solomons song called the fair circassian  chetwood who was many years prompter of drury lane and to whose anecdotes relative to theaters and actors all those who have written on the subject of the stage have been materially indebted wrote the stock jobbers intended as well as another farce of this author to expose the south sea mania the lovers opera a piece which had but little success and the generous free mason a trifle only intended for bartholomew fair leigh an inferior actor wrote kensington gardens and hobs wedding to show one would think that he was an indifferent writer as he was an actor the latter was a continuation of doggets country wake  odell who had been patronized by lord warton and who lost first an estate in the court interest but afterward obtained a pension erected a theater in goodmans fields as we have already seen and afterward ceded his interest to giffard he is thought however to have made the theater afterward assist his fortune for soon after the business of the golden rump and the accomplishment of the licencing act he was made deputy master of the revels under the duke of grafton which place he held to his death he produced for the stage chimera a temporary thing on the south sea bubble the patron performed with very little success the smugglers a farce better received and the prodigal a comedy which is little more than an alteration of shadwells woman captain  mitchel called sir robert walpoles poet and who was famous like savage for companionable qualities and dissipation wrote only a piece of some merit called the highland fair for the fatal extravagance which is attributed to him was written by aaron hill to do him a pecuniary kindness concanen who was attorney general of jamaica and wrote some poems produced a thing in imitation of tunbridge wells and epsom wells it was called wexford wells two blllamys husband and son to a lady who kept a boarding school at chelsea wrote between them eight pieces merely for the scholars they are principally translations from guarini and others sturmy who is but little known wrote love and duly the compromise and sesostris these pieces are said to be ill written but they afforded some hints to other writers sefostris in particular is supposed to have furnished voltaire with materials for his merope which is possible though as gilbert in      chapelle in      and le grange in      had treated this subject it is more likely not only that voltaire borrowed from his own countrymen but that sturmy resorted to the same source  duncombe translated racines athaliah and wrote junius brutus he is only known by being related by marriage to hughes sterling was one of the associates of mitchell but he reformed and took orders he wrote the rival generals and the parricide neither of which are particularly noticed by any writer pitcairne intended for the church and afterward eminent as a physician wrote a comedy called the assembly as we are told but as the invidious and unhandsome abuse of which this piece is full does not by any means characterize the mind or talents of this great man the authenticity of his being the author of it is very questionable  fenton who experienced various fortune who translated several books of homers odyssey published by pope and was requited by a small gratuity and a stolen epitaph wrote a tragedy upon the well known subject of mariamne it came out in      and was the means of raising the reputation of the theater in lincolns inn fields southern is said to have assisted fenton cibber had no opinion of the play which fact has been told to his prejudice the town and cibber certainly did not think alike for fenton got a thousand pounds for his trouble  the celebrated allan ramsay besides the gentle shepherd which has at various times been performed with much reputation brought out a complimentary piece called

upon the strength of examining the plays campbell is said to have been the author of a play called the rover reclaimed west lord chancellor of ireland produced hecuba he complains it was not heard out it was merely a translation from euripides  lewis wrote a miserable play called philip of macedon it was dedicated to pope and according to the dedicator read and approved in all its parts by his discerning and consummate judgment as it is a vile performance let us hope that pope read only the dedication smythe who was really a man of merit was unable however to infuse any of it into his only dramatic piece it was called the rival modes great expectations were however formed of it and while the town was on tiptoe for its appearances a play with much more merit called the dissembled wanton written by welstead was produced which was undeservedly neglected harrison an obscure writer produced a play called belteshazzar  frowde who was one of addisons satelites wrote the fall of saguntum

night and then to twenty one pounds and revived afterward with a prologue written by garrick and yet the audience were dismissed the lawyers feast was a mere trifle it however had some success tracy wrote periander of which we only know that it was privately praised and publicly condemned the private applause can be accounted for the author read his tragedy to his friends and on the same evening gave them an elegant supper when it was universally agreed that if the play was relished as well as the supper it would do  draper wrote the spendthrift there is no trace of the author or his piece except this positive assertion of gordon who wrote a piece called lupone the accounts are just as clear the duke of warton began a play on the subject of mary queen of scots hippesley the father of

was never offered to either licencer or manager drury an attorney wrote a farcical ballad opera called the devil of a duke the mad captain the fancied queen and the rival milliners which last is a

charles the second which was interdicted nesbit brought out at edinburgh caledons tears a piece taken from chronicles and records potter produced an opera called decoy which however was not attractive bond wrote the tuscan treaty as we are told by some but others say it was written by another genman and only revised and brought forward by bond it is more than probable that this is the very bond of whom i have already related the anecdote concerning zara there is a confused account that it was actually aaron hills zara which some persons performed at york buildings a year before it made its appearance at drury lane but it is easy to prove that this is impossible zaire was produced in france in      the following year bond through some influence he had over the manager of covent garden theater brought out the tuscan treaty written by a friend which was not interesting and therefore did not succeed in that very year bond in the french account is stated to have been in france and so delighted with zaire that he was determined to get a translation of it for the english stage which he was very competent to inspect though he was no writer for he had learnt the play by heart and was such an enthusiast to it that it was continually his practice to repeat the most striking passages in the paris coffee houses upon his return as we have seen before he procured it to be translated not by aaron hill but most likely the author of the tuscan treaty and it is also very likely that the managers refused to accept it because it was the labor of a man who had produced an unsuccessful play this was in      hills play came out in      who would hardly have sneaked into york buildings to get at the opinion of a few individuals when he was always welcome to the voice of the town nay it is possible that the treaty of the managers with hill for his translation was a reason why they refused the play from bond at any rate the historians seem to be wholly in the dark as to the real history of bond and therefore as it has been their usual practice when they could not find out the truth the private translation of zara they give at once to hill whose play was known talked of and stipulated for long before it made its appearance and who could not have had a doubt of its success at a time when voltaires play was in every bodys mouth as one of the most popular that ever was produced in addition to all this i have an account which is corroborated as i understand by the gentlemans magazine of zara translated by a gentleman of the name of johnson and printed in the year      freeman produced a piece called the downfall of bribery downs not the promptor brought out a play at smock alley called all vows kept popple wrote the ladys revenge and the double deceit j philips an indifferent writer produced love and glory and a very poor thing called the rival captains fabian wrote trick for trick  mrs charke whose memoirs in the annals of profligacy make almost as conspicuous a figure as those of theophilus cibber her brother who a sort of english deon amused herself in fencing shooting riding races currying horses digging in gardens and playing upon the fiddle who was at different times an actress a grocer an alehouse keeper a valet de chamber a sausage seller and a puppet show woman one day in affluence the next in indigence now confined in a spunging house presently

confessed very judicously the songs however are many of them falsely attributed to him for they were written by landsdowne and other cotemporary poets a critic loudly complains that the poetry was so little relished with all its incomparable merit that it it had not been for the charms of the music the piece would not have extended to a second night had the same critic lived to witness the performance of comus at the present time he would have also to lament that the music so highly honorable to genius and to this country is gone to sleep with the poetry and that thanks to mutilation and false taste a combination of the talents of milton and arne is now considered as an intrusion i could vote most sincerely that this union of beautiful poetry and exquisite music might be performed

failure in consequence of this he was frequently hissed by the authors friends when he came forward to perform other parts at length to put a stop to their importunity he one evening told the audience that he had read the play before it was performed and given the author his sincere opinion that it was the very worst play he had ever read in his life and for that reason had refused to act in it in consequence of this address the audience of course silenced the cabal   over and above this list of plays for which we have been able to find authors i count a hundred and eightyfive many of them attributed to individuals but none of them authentically traced to authors at all and now having got rid of materials which it was incumbent on me to produce but which can have no great claim upon the readers praise except that due to accuracy and method i shall proceed to particulars which will be more interesting and of course more entertaining both to myself and to those i study to please  chap iv garrick it is neither within my promise nor my inclination to put myself forward as the biographer of garrick for my own part i think it very immaterial to the fame of a public character to manifest much anxiety as to where he was born at what school he was brought up and many other particulars which i am not to learn are held sacredly and indispensibly necessary in biography a research generally however terminating in uncertainty and disappointment and which therefore unfortunately leaves this species of writing incomplete by the want of one of its attributed unities as i have had opportunity to urge this before and as all those who esteem merit and genius for their intrinsic value will be naturally more solicitous to set up their locality than that of the person who possesses them i shall endeavor to gratify these by a description of the mental acquisitions of garrick which i had particular opportunity of watching for seven years through all their shades and gradations  the words that cibber applied to betterton that he was an actor as shakesperr was a poet may unequivocally be applied to garrick but one strong circumstanee which i believe has never been noticed and which when noticed will be sparingly at first perhaps but afterward generally and literally admitted shows that garrick must have been nearer in his genius to the comparative merit of shakespeare than betterton this circumstance which i assert without hesitation is that garrick at any time on or off the stage alone or in company about whatever occupation study or pursuit or in short employed in any manner he might was an actor a complete actor and nothing but an actor exactly as pope during the whole course of his life was a poet and nothing but a poet  the acting of garrick on the stage was to acquire fame and fortune than which nothing was ever more fairly earned and merited and off the stage to make that fame and fortune a source of reputation consequence and importance and in this last species of acting he certainly manifested more potent merit more commanding talents than in the first incompatible as his public acting was no man exacted homage from all ranks with more success than garrick he was a man as the irish say that you never caught without himself  it is true that to attain this sort of rank with the world the mavelous side must be perpetually turned outward and the hidden springs and wires must be managed with great dexterity and exactness to keep up the deception any invention however ingenious in its construction and wonderful in its operation would cease to excite admiration if the spectator was to discover that it worked upon common mechanical principles and therefore garrick who goldsmith seems to have known au fond  who threw off his friends as a huntsman his pack  for he knew well enough he could whistle them back knew also that off the stage as well as on it was his business to subdue his own passions that he might the better subdue the passions of his spectators  i never saw garrick either laugh or cry that is to say shed tears or manifest mirth or even pleasure spontaniously involuntarily and from the soul i have seen him taking the hint from shakespeare who has certainly well described real acting by the passage in a fiction in a dream of passion force his soul so to its conceit that from her working all his visage warmed  tears in his eyes distraction ins aspect  a broken voice and his whole function suiting  with forms to his conceit and all for nothing  for hecuba     all this and the opposite extreme were always at his command garrick would indulge some few friends  but it was very rare  with what he used to call his rounds  this he did by standing behind a chair and conveying into his face every possible kind of passion blending one into the other and as it were shadowing them with a prodigious number of gradations at one moment you laughed at another you cried now he terrified you and presently you conceived yourself something horrible he seemed so terrified at you afterward he drew his features into the appearance of such dignified wisdom that minerva might have been proud of the portrait and then  degrading yet admirable transition  he became a driveller in short his face was what he obliged you to fancy it age youth plenty poverty every thing it assumed  his laugh was well put on but it was not a natural laugh of his own he seemed afraid that if he did not conquer a propensity to risibility in himself the better to provoke it in his audience he should like tom thimble in the rehearsal be so tickled by the humor of his author as not to be able to play his part in short no man will deny but that the very essence of excellent acting centered in garrick and yet every member of the theater will vouch for me that the greatest and most astonishing effects produced by his acting arose from an artful suspension of his real feelings lest they should provoke him into a sensibility which it was his business to transfer to his auditors  in acting the human passions would run riot were they not kept in absolute command feeling and sensibility are the riches of an actor and would too soon be squandered if they were not managed with economy there are very few situations in tragedy and the great art is how to vary them a passion like a color must have a variety of shadows nor will every shadow do for the same light and i will even venture to say that a good actor or actress should vary the mode of acting according to the different dispositions of the audiences before whom they appear  i sincerely mention this as my real sentiments on good acting every thing on the stage must be a little elevated the scenes if they were highly finished would lose all their effect the same mode must be observed in dress and it holds good throughout every thing else a hero must not speak in common prose  it must be measured for him into what we call blank verse this gives a dignity an emphasis to the feeling that is to be expressed and unless the actor who represents the character can so far possess himself with an idea that he is the very hero for the time being he will never attain perfection as his substitute  these requisites which garrick taught himself on the stage he could with the same facility transfer to his private conduct and whether he condescended at his own levee to smile at a borrowing actor who was praising his poety cut jokes with becket the bookseller explain an unintelligible passage to phil butler the carpenter blame hopkins the prompter for having the gout because he was at the expense of chair hire rebuke messink the pantomime trick maker for attempting to be witty like him chuckle at newspaper criticisms that he intended to buy off or burn cards and letters from dukes lords judges and bishops to strike his dependants with awe and admiration   whether at court he honored men of title with the hopes of bolstering up the reputation of some dramatic brat produced with the assistance of the chaplain whether ladies were promised that their friends should be disappointed of boxes that had never been let or that the new fashion they last produced should be noticed in the next epilogue or that an epitaph on a favorite parrot should grace the toilette table or whether he appeared distressed that he could not be let down by an ambassador because he had given a prior promise to a countess dowager   whether at the rehearsal of a piece his own he demanded an acknowledgment that every passage was the achme of perfection or at the rehearsal of a piece not his own he himself allowed praise in proportion as he was permitted to make alterations or to be brief in whatever manner by managing not the minds for many of them were too ponderous for him to wield but the tempers of men both of the first wordly and professional distinction  he so played his part as to be courted carressed admired and looked up to by rank and talents with very slight pretensions to the character of eminent abilities himself otherwise than as an actor  garrick prosessedly studied the character of cibber than whom however he possessed more consummate abilities except as a writer but he blended with this character the essence of every other that had been celebrated for acquiring fame by wordly conduct and possessed so much superraded good sense that he seldom ran into any of their inferior follies and never into those of any magnitude he had what he called common sense to which he gave an unbounded definition and practically showed that its meaning was to take every advantage within the pale of fair dealing upon the mart like a chapman upon this principle he conducted all his wordly concerns liberal in offers and close at a bargain  by this mode of conduct though his wishes were characterized by boundless ambition he never let them impose upon his reason and thus by never out soaring his strength he was at no time in danger of falling garrick might have been laureat he might have had a seat in parliament he might have been knighted but he knew he could write a a prologue better than a birth day ode that his oratory would have been a poor business if it had been called upon extemporaneously in his own language and without dress and action and he could anticipate the ridicule of seeing against the wall the part of abel drugger to be performed by sir david garrick  all these meritorious acts of becoming forbearance spoke in him the highest degree of good sense and became the foundation of that general action by which he commanded the attention the regard the solicitude and better than these the contributions of mankind it was this put into practice through the medium of common sense as we have seen it defined that made him the idol of the great in fortune and the great in talents to none of whom he was at any time offensive though he always arrogated equality in short he was a duke a lawgiver a philosopher a logician an architect a painter nay a scholar and a critic and even in the opinions of those most eminent for these distinctions when in fact those sentiments which he had deliberately collected and which he sported through the advantage of a lucky moment were the studied ideas of others acted by him  one of garricks great strokes of mundane acting was the fame he was so solicitous to command abroad in which he so succeeded that the french accounts of him in particular which it is a pity his biographers had no opportunity of consulting exalt his merit excellent as it was infinitely beyond any thing that we have of him speaking of his acting a french author has the following passage garrick the celebrated english roscius has alone perhaps been capable of conveying all that we have heard or can conceive of the astonishing acting of the ancients i saw him in london says the writer perform a tyrant who dies on the stage terrified with the enormity of his crimes and torn with remorse humanity in the last moments of this tyrant triumphs over his crimes his murders and his barbarity sensible too late of his villainy his reflections are his judge and his executioner overwhelmed with this dreadful conflict he dies piece meal his eyes begin to be extinguished his voice can scarcely articulate his ineffectual penitence his gestures announce his last moment nature yet retains some strength and as the human faculties decay and horrible phantoms bring his crimes to his imagination in his frantic fear he struggles with death and is overcome he now faintly freezes with horror he tears up the earth and seems in madening fancy to dig his grave and now the moment of death arrives and the convulsive distraction of his face his quivering lips the extension of his arms and a last agonizing sigh give the finishing stroke to this terrible picture  in another french writer i find the following anecdote of garrick told as a proof that he could not only at will represent all passions but all persons a woman of fashion in london says this writer had a great desire to procure the portrait of a nobleman with whom she was in love but who had a particular aversion to sit for his picture she prevailed upon garrick to notice the face of this lord and so possess himself of his features that the painter might easily design a faithful likeness through the medium of his borrowed resemblance this was undertaken and after having studied every trait and gesture and each possible manner of giving them variety till it was no longer garrick but my lord the painter was set to work and so succeeded that the portrait was universally known for the nobleman in question who was the first to express his astonishment at so perfect a likeness being obtained without his knowledge and who liberally rewarded the actor and married the lady in return for her love and her ingenuity i never heard of this anecdote through any other channel there is a story told that garrick frightened hogarth by appearing to him as the ghost of fielding whom he so resembled by altering his features that hogarth is said never to have recovered the shock it is a strange story however unless garrick walked upon stilts    it was however occasioned sometimes by rather bold and prodigious flights a friend might have shuddered for him to have been present when voltaire received his ode on shakespeare especially as it happened at the time when that dictator was fretting away his life in his retirement at geneva and fulminating his critical anathemas against dunces but whether he was softened by the present that accompanied it or however he might be wrought upon by that magical persuasion which garrick sometimes accorded but never gave it is certain for i saw it that the circumstance produced an acknowledgment full of insincere praise of which garrick believed perhaps but very little but what was better for him the world believed the whole  in the performance of all these various parts one consideration obtruded itself on garricks mind and operated as a material deduction from the applause so lavishly bestowed on so much professional excellence this was no less than a continual soreness occasioned by certain flies that perpetually buzzed about him and never ceased to teaze and torment him till they were suffered to suck their fill and drop off if he had set out with a firm and resolute determination the fatal examples of dryden and pope before him to have armed himself with indifference they would have hummed their day and been forgotten but he wanted strength of mind to take this course he should have considered that he had not the abilities to resort to mac flecknoes and dunciads or even had he been capable of wielding such formidable weapons they had been already rendered useless by the immaterial beings they had to cope with clubs cannot wound atoms  garrick a better actor in every other respect though constantly his emulator unfortunately disdained to copy cibber in this half of whose reputation at least was owing to a steady resolution of disregarding anonymous cavillers or else coaxing them into some scrape that he might take a most triumphant advantage of them cibber turned the satire in the dunciad most pointedly against pope whereas garrick would have sunk under it but cibber was a writer of a different description far however from being perfect and this he so truly knew and so honestly acknowledged that cavil was by him politically deprecated and the shafts of ill nature disarmed by anticipation  had garrick given an idea that he went for nothing but a prologue writer and that his other productions were merely in aid of that experience and dramatic knowledge which as a manager he must necessarily possess the fostering care of the public would have carressed and nurtured these offsprings of diffidenee and having adopted them have become so blind to their foibles that he would have received credit for much more than his fair reputation whereas fondly fancying that the world implicitly believed him an author of first rate merit that they would find better poetry in his prologues than in those of dryden truer character and nature in his plays than in any of his predecessors and more lyric beauty in his ode than in alexanders feast the world have not come up to his actual desert but have sunk him in every other respect and quietly have set him down as a mere prologue writer which as the subjects of his prologues and epilogues were merely temporary and a lash at some prevailing folly is every thing but denying him any merit as a writer at all  unfortunately this was garricks foible his writings were his tendon achilles which the meerest witling was at any time paris enough to find out and lest he feared it would remain undiscovered unless he himself perpetually exposed it he unnecessarily and upon every trivial occasion bared it to view till by showing how he might be wounded the worst bungler at critical archery in all grubstreet was sure to hit him  when he was afraid the wits should be satirical on his marriage he anticipated their satire by calling himself  a very sir john brute all day  and fribble all the night when he trembled at what he feared might be the judgment of the critics on his performance of macbeth he foolishly wrote a pamphlet on the mimical behavior of a certain fashionable faulty actor when he dreaded the censure and ridicule that he imagined he should be greeted with on his return from a tour to italy he produced the sick monkey as a ridicule on what was supposed to have been his conduct abroad these are some of the instances in which his favorite common sense deserted him  he imagined that these things would be considered as illiberal and therefore treated them with contempt there were three risks in this first filth generally sticks and in this world many want ability and more inclination to rub it off secondly in this pretended satire it was possible that faults might have been exposed through consciousness which an indifferent person would never have suspected and lastly a discovery might have been attended with indelible because meritorious ridicule his conduct was evidently an imitation of pope in relation to his pastorals but pope had more ability and his reputation was less involved  upon an examination of his conduct as it was concerned in those transactions that led him to the management of the theater which most worthily improved it into an extraordinary degree of credit and reputation his character and genius will more gradually develope than in a studied detail i shall therefore ceace to speak of him particularly till i have traced the steps by which he ascended to the highest pitch of fame and fortune  chap v state of the stage from      to      as garrick in imitation of cibber not only looked up from his infancy to the chair of roscius which churchill accorded him after he had possessed it by universal suffrage but also to the chair of management it will be necessary to show what a theatrical machiaval he was in attaining the first reputation in both capacities neither situations having been filled at any time with such ability or such credit  to drop at present the merit of garrick as an actor to whom in that capacity i shall hereafter pay my tribute of warm and willing admiration let us see with what cautious and wary judgment he conducted himself to become a master of his profession and while the account is read by all young actors who emulate his merit let them at the same time emulate his industry his various trials of his theatrical powers his gradual ascent to superiority or let them for ever despair of attaining his excellence or indeed any excellence as actors  garrick knew that the profession he was peculiarly gifted to fill required more variety of requisites than any other that there is scarcely any accomplishment the human mind or form is capable of receiving but must be studied and learnt by the actor that conception and memory which are too often considered as perfection in the science of acting are only parts of a complicate whole and that without the possession of every one of these various qualities which acquire versatility and teach the passions a capable scope of representing human nature in all its moods and humors an actor can no more be perfect than a watch without its wheels  garrick knowing this both by the examples of those actors in the school of betterton and by his own consummate keenness and foresight determined to be sure of his mark and that the arrow should go beyond the barb instead therefore of risking a raw and unexperienced genius and venturing crudity and awkwardness he put himself to school and not only learnt practically every thing that experience could give as to the exercise of his versatile powers in tragedy and comedy but headded dancing fencing and pantomime and even studied the character of harlequin  thus his first appearance was facination for it blended all the attraction of novelty with veteran experience it was useless for quin to say that it was a fashion and would soon be over it was a new religion that whitfield was followed for a time but the people came back again to church it was not heresy but reformation as garrick himself wittily enough said in reply and it proved so for the world with one consent stamped it as theatrical orthodoxy  garricks great success which thinned the other theaters and brought all the world to goodmans fields began very early to prove a source of fortune in proportion to the savor he received which was prodigious giffard gave him half the profits and he soon of course amassed a very large sum for he performed every night for a considerable time this would have been a serious blow at the fame and fortune of the theaters had not an application been intended though i believe never made to government which was backed by the authority of sir john barnard who in the name of the city was prepared to revive those objections which we have already seen preferred by the magistrates lest the theater should be an injury to the members of the commercial part of the town by being immediately seated among them  garrick seeing plainly how this would operate proposed to accommodate matters with fleetwood provided giffard were made a party to the treaty this was soon adjusted and he received five hundred a year for his acting and giffard appears to have been satisfied with the emolument allotted him in return for giving up a concern which he held by no legal authority  garrick being now come to drury lane and having in the following summer experienced improvement reputation and profit by an excursion to dublin where he was so attended that the vast crouding produced a contagious disorder which was called garricks fever began to look forward toward the management and while fleetwood was swindling the tradesmen and performers and bribing attorneys and bailiffs to keep executions out of the house which it was their duty to levy he fortified himself for the occasion both as to property and friends he saw however that the moment was not arrived for him to step forward for that the theater was going so fast to ruin that it would be extremely difficult to have any concern in it without involving his private fortune with the general interest of the concern  he was taught by this an extraordinary contemptation he could not be insensible that properly applied the large sums his performance brought to the theater might have liquidated or at least lessened the demands on the property so as to make it in time a clear possession to the proprietor but the reverse was the fact the treasury was the sieves of the danaides always full and always empty and fleetwood plainly saw that by a proper gloss and a little adroitness in legerdemain hidden by well applied juggling and small talk the richer he got the more he should persuade the poor devils who were mortified at his pride his insolence and his want of feeling but at the same time delighted by his good humor his wit and his plausibility to believe him in necessity  what a school was this for parsimony to a parsimonious man like garrick i never heard that there was any complaint as to his money indeed it has been thought that garrick macklin and another or two were in a compact with fleetwood that so he might laugh at the rest of the company covered by their united strength i scarcely know however how to give credit to this because macklin declared in my hearing and in the presence of several gentlemen now living that it was the business of the performers to invent all manner of tricks to procure that money which though their own they could not obtain by persuasion importunity or menace and that he himself who was empowered as acting manager to undertake for the payment of certain articles and was therefore in some sort amenable was once under the necessity of putting into practice a stratagem in which he pretended to have broke out of newgate where he said he had been put by a creditor and thereby obtained the sum he wanted which he appropriated to his own use it being part of his just demand and afterward left the creditor to sue fleetwood  certainly somehow or other garrick sound his account in staying at drury lane for covent garden was at any time open to him but he accepted no engagement any where till      at which time though the published accounts are against me i think it very probable that fleetwood went to france and not in      as it is generally believed for at that time the patent was sold by fleetwood to green and amber bankers in the city who speculated upon it clogged with a hopeful condition no less than that lacey who we shall presently see as the partner of garrick was to manage the concern  lacey had been a sort of assistant to rich after leaving an unprofitable trade at norwich and becoming a very indifferent actor the conditions of this purchase were that green and amber should pay three thousand two hundred pounds for the patent and an annuity to fleetwood till it should be expired of six hundred pounds and at the same time a mortgage of seven thousand pounds on the property was suffered to remain and lacey for his management was to have a third of the profits green and amber in a very short time became bankrupts and the patent was put up to public sale whether therefore garrick foresaw every one of these consequences and did not choose to interfere till a clear and an easy purchase should present itself or perhaps till his interest was strengthened by an accumulation of connections it is equally certain that from the moment of his first appearance he had an eye to the management and that he determined to forbear from engaging in it till it should be in his power to do so without being entangled or embarrassed  this is pretty well proved by his conduct previous to his taking the management which was of a piece with that prior to his commencing actor for as he had gone in    0 to ipswich to try the effect of his personal appearance on the stage so in      he went again to ireland in order to feel out what his deportment ought to be as director behind the scenes and even here he proved himself an excellent discriminator for he allied himself to mr sheridan a man from whose knowledge judgment liberality and rectitude he would not fail to receive every instruction necessary for his purpose  after attaining this experience garrick engaged himself at covent garden during the season of      and then in conjunction with lacey purchased the patent and paid off the mortgage the whole sum amounting to twelve thousand pounds they also continued fleetwoods annuity which certainly was not all he got by the bargain for besides the three thousand pounds he received for the patent very little of which one would suppose he gave to his creditors he most probably had been for a considerable time saving out of the fire i can myself vouch that his son i do not mean the son that went to india but him to whom he left his fortune lived about four and thirty years ago in a very handsome style went to court and joined in expensive pleasures with people of distinction  it is true this fortune was dissipated in a few years but it must certainly have been something very considerable and as this was at the distance of sixteen or seventeen years after the expiration of the patent when the annuity to fleetwood ceased he must have saved money and that not a trifle exclusively that is to say out of the earnings of those performers he cajoled imposed upon disappointed delighted and robbed  the next wonder is how lacey could get the money to purchase his share of the patent for we know he was not assisted by garrick because his full and entire half remained with him till that unfortunate propensity to dig for coals in oxfordshire induced him to get also a propensity of mortgaging his share piecemeal to his partner it has been said that he bought a very beautiful horse to captivate the duke of grafton who offering any price for it was told that the highest price that could be fixed for it would be his graces acceptance which handsome offer being graciously acceded to he through the interest of this nobleman obtained a renewal of the patent and that therefore he was assisted by garrick but this is very improbable for it is not difficult to see that garrick could scarcely at that time have hinted a request to persons of condition and in power which would not have been readily granted especially any thing so evidently beneficial to the public and the credit of the theater after the distress and discredit it had so long experienced  the real fact must remain a mystery i have taken some pains to come at this fact though after all it is not of any great importance lacey was manager during the short time that green and amber held the property and after their bankrupty perhaps in trust for the assignees and i am informed from an authority i cannot doubt that he immediately previous to garricks joining with him in the management stood in a manner in fleetwoods shoes and compounded with the performers and creditors of different descriptions which is an additional argument in proof of garricks stipulating for a clear stage and no favor  in the mean time it is my business to relate that with a renewal of the patent these joint proprietors upon equal shares opened the theater in      with johnsons celebrated prologue the best actors and actresses of course rallied round garrick and he was soon reinforced by barry mrs pritchard and mrs cibber  as to covent garden theater it continued till    0 to be uninteruptedly managed by rich who it must be confessed upon his fathers plan though he was not the same nesarious character continued to keep himself up as a formidable rival to the managers of drury lane his own performance of harlequin and the advantage he took of english inclination for foreign gewgaws now and then operated in his favor with decided superiority in the time of fleetwood his pantomimes were a great injury to his opponents and though i do not find he was ever splendidly off indeed he is described to have been at one time so necessitated as to have taken a house situated in three different counties to avoid the importunity of the sheriffs officers yet he took care to satisfy to the letter his performers and all those with whom he made engagements  this gave him a certain respectability without which no concern can maintain solid reputation but his situation was nevertheless fluctuating for though at times the run of a successful pantomime filled his treasury yet his ignorance of the common business of the theater and want of discernment as to the merit of performers gave the other house a preeminence which with all the assistance of quin and others bespoke the favor of the critical and the judicious especially after it began to feel the influence of garricks management  thus the success of rich was by fits and starts at christmas perhaps his house overflowed and caricature prints were circulated with harlequin weighing down the the theatrical scales and garrick barry and all the force of drury lane kicking the beam the infatuation over his benches were empty and continued so till the french painter invented new scenery and he perfected himself in new attitudes and invented new pantomime tricks  rich by this means was of great utility throughout his whole management to the general theatrical interest he was what a formidable minority are to an able ministry and though his measures were not so efficacious yet it kept the exertions of his opponents braced to their full strength and vigor and this by the operation now and then of a lucky hit wrought wonderfully in his favor both as to advantage and popularity we have seen one instance of this in the beggars opera his own performance also which was incomparable in its way was greatly followed and when garrick ran romeo and juliet in which he and mrs cibber performed the lovers rich instantly opposed to them barry and miss nossiter  by these and other spirited instances of opposition he kept up a constant and formidable bustle which it required very frequently the whole united force of his rivals to oppose in spectacle he was confessedly superior to them and as garrick knew and felt this he ought to have entered into no competition with him but have rested his sole expectation on the more respectable ground of giving every advantage to tragedy and comedy and this he would very probably have done had it not been that sufficient novelty was not to be procured fewer authors of eminence by a considerable difference as we shall presently see having appeared during the first sixteen years of his management than during any equal period since shakespeare  to this it may perhaps be owing that garrick was obliged to permit spectacle occasionally in his own defense it however at length sapped the foundation of his popularity for when rich brought out the coronation which so completely and deservedly triumphed over the stupid niggardly parsimonious apology for it that had been for a few nights foisted on the public at drury lane covent garden began to feel a powerful superiority  this superiority gathered such strength that it began to master the whole exertions of garrick gigantic as they were these advantages a number of circumstances combined to strengthen beard perhaps upon the whole the best english singer that ever was heard whose excellence i shall not interrupt the thread of my present narrative to describe had married the daughter of rich and stepped pretty forward in the musical management this circumstance induced garrick to play off the old trick of romeo and juliet by opposing low and mrs vincent as macheath and polly in the beggars opera to beard and miss brent which by way of parenthesis provoked rich to start wilkinson in the minor against foot the contest however operated greatly against drury lane beard at the head of his phalanx was irresistible and certainly at no period has the real excellence and true character of english music been so well understood or so highly relished  though it would be irregular to go at length into this subject now yet i shall indulge myself with saying a few proud words merely to show that in arts as well as in arms we want only union to conquer the world the public decision was at that time honest fair candid and impartial the italian opera was in a state of merited celebrity which it had never known before nor can ever know again yet was the true and genuine beauties of english music felt and acknowledged and the same taste and judgment that admired the delicacy the sweetness and the grandeur of jomelli galluppi and pergolese delighted in the nature the truth and the beauty of purcell arne and boyce  rich at the instance of beard brought forward every thing which had musical merit with every possible advantage the beggars opera and the jovial crew were relieved by the chaplet and the shepherds lottery and to give contrast consequence and diversity to those familiar materials comus that wonderful union of exquisite sound with incomparable sense which in these days of elephants dragons and flying cats after being tortured crippled and mutilated is compelled to halt on and sing the dirge to its once perfect existence was brought forward with all its appropriate advantages playful winning and dissusing round that enchantment by which the theater was intended to delight and improve its auditors  rich died during the run of the coronation having accomplished the sum of his glory and left the theater in equal shares between his widow and mrs beard mrs bencroft and mrs morris his three daughters beard was very sensibly appointed manager who dreading perhaps the superior power and ability of garrick whom he both loved and feared determined to raise as formidable an opposition as possible upon the only ground on which he was able to make any thing like an effectual stand  italian singing was at that time rationally and judiciously tasted he therefore thought that if opera could be attempted upon a grand scale to a grand effect it might give our theaters a consequence as to music which it had never known before he knew there was an englishman in whom were united the great requisites of all the italian school whose genius mind understanding and knowledge were superlative he knew the composition of this man could be greatly supported with but very little auxiliary assistance and the world were thus obliged by perhaps the greatest musical production in its way in this or any other country the artaxerxes of arne  other musical pieces followed as we shall presently see in their place till the property of covent garden became so valuable that it was at length eagerly purchased in      for sixty thousand pounds thus we find that the unremitting success of this theater was the sole cause of garricks retirement to italy he had no novelty to produce that could stem this torrent host as he was he was almost alone there were scarcely any authors to support him and as to actors king had certainly attained that height of reputation which he has ever since invariably maintained and kept but holland and obrien were only opening into fame quin had long retired and ireland had deprived the stage of barry and woodward he had certainly started powel whose merit he is said to have dreaded which i can scarcely credit because he knew better than any body that admirable as powels genius was with so poor an understanding it must run riot  thus the literal fact is that the public were no longer garrickmad which i say more to their shame than to his his name was no longer an attraction he performed to empty benches notwithstanding the last season before he left england he personated scrub the ghost in hamlet and a great variety of other charcters in which he had never before appeared and this very naturally made him so sick that he retired to italy that the public might feel his loss which they did most completely by the management of his partner who finding artaxerxes had grown into high celebrity instantly brought out a string of serious operas without considering that to produce pieces of that description it is necessary to have writers composers and singers  chap vi garrick as an author to      though the merit of garrick considered as an author is the deepest shade in his public character yet it is one that very frequently relieves the picture to advantage for though had he been nothing else his reputation would have been indeed but of a very inferior kind the assistance this quality lent to the stage and to stage effect was of a first rate consequence for it improved and elevated his own acting separated simplified and regulated the productions of greater talents and gave altogether a tone to the theater which rendered it within the comprehension and taste of the public and highly promoted its interest as a school of nature  as manager a quality of this perfect kind was to him and indeed to the public of consummate advantage and his conduct here in opposition to cibber shows that he not only possessed it in a much more eminent degree but knew better how to make use of it for garrick would never have refused the beggars opera which cibber did he knew too well his own interest it is true we shall at times trace some traits of the man that now and then eclipsed the actor such as his refusal of she stoops to conquer because goldsmith wrote retaliation goldsmiths account of this in my hearing was that garrick wanted to foist in so much stuff of his own that he grew tired of his objections and would not leave the play with him which foisting in perhaps would have done the effect of the play no injury though goldsmith was twenty times a better writer than garrick but this was not the case goldsmith had offended garrick for a forced smile with him was always a symptom of anger and therefore he would not take the pains to whistle to him thus knowing that goldsmith was tremblingly alive all over upon all such occasions which as an author was natural enough but as a playwright might have been spared he only claimed the privilege that other authors had given who had been benefited by his assistance and this offer being as he knew it would be refused he had a fair excuse for getting rid of the play which both his resentment to goldsmith and his friendship to kelly who together with sentimental comedy was cut up by it had predetermined him not to accept upon any account  and other instances but upon the whole his judgment was a very material cause of the success of dramatic authors in the reign of garrick  justice obliges us from this conclusion to acknowledge that garricks merit as a dramatic writer consists more of what is concealed from the public than what has been published for he had little genius and great judgment and therefore though his judgment became of the highest consequence in directing genius in the productions of others it only served to detect a paucity of genius in his own  there is another and a material deduction from the merit of garrick and yet it ought not to weigh against his reputation i mean the reiterated necessity of writing pieces for temporary purposes in quality of manager we have seen the best talents upon these subjects wasted to little purpose and therefore much merit is attributable to him who never actually failed in any one of these instances on the contrary there as every where else whatever absence there might be of excellent poetry and fine conception in his pieces of this stamp those deficencies were so made up by disposition and effect that his judgment kept his reputation constantly afloat having premised so much which certainly is but fair and candid we shall let his dramatic pieces speak for themselves at the same time that they bring out such collateral circumstances as may serve to illustrate the history of the stage  it is plain that garrick had predetermined to become an author as soon as possible under an idea that if bad acting could be defended by an able pen good acting might be celebrated even by an indifferent one to manifest therefore as soon as possible that such was his resolution he brought out the lying valet in      the very season of his first appearance in goodmans fields in which of course he performed the principal character he has been accused of borrowing this piece from the french and indeed sharp has a family resemblance of all the scapins and crispins and frontins of that theater it is not however the likeness of any one character but of the valet not only of france but of england and every where else he lies out of fidelity to his master he is in love with the chambermaid of his masters mistress and he is in short what every other convenient servant ever was and ever will be this is only the vehicle the piece itself appears to me to be original and is as far as it goes a complete dramatic performance it is full of pleasantry interest and effect the writing is elevated enough for the purpose and it has sewer faults than many productions of much greater men i say so much because i rather think that it is garricks most complete dramatic production and this shows that his mind was well made up to his profession at starting  whether garricks time was so taken up in the study and performance of that prodigious number of parts of all descriptions by which he acquired so deservedly the highest reputation or whether he found any difficulty in keeping fleetwood to a performance of his engagements he did not bring out his next piece which was miss in her teens till the latter part of the season in which he was engaged with rich this piece had so much success that on the fifteenth night a fact that i had both from rich and garrick when the author received the play bills he found his name advertised for a second benefit without his previous knowledge rich declared there was so much merit in the piece and it had done the theater so much service that the compliment itself would not have been recompense enough without this manner of conveying it and garrick said that he valued it only upon that account at the same time it must be confessed that rich has said he would not have done this had he expected to have lost garrick and garrick though he was struck with the generosity of the action never imitated it but once during his whole management miss in her teens derived its best reputation from the performance of garrick and woodward in fribble and flash the piece itself is a strong caracature and therefore very little in nature  lethe was the first piece written by garrick which was produced after he became manager of drury lane it had made its appearance at the same theater in    0 but it was then a mere sketch and soon withdrawn garrick has added the character of lord chalkstone when he produced it in      which he acted most admirably i cannot refrain from noticing that all the world have been deceived in the idea that this piece is taken from the french and was originally called les eaux doblivion and i was myself in the error i have however searched every authority and particularly a book where i have at one view every piece that ever came out at the french theater from the troubadours up to      and there is no such piece to be found  romeo and juliet which play has been repeatedly altered on account of the sudden change in romeos love from rosaland to juliet and the effect of the catastrophe which was conceived to be incomplete the propriety of which objections i have considered before had so much effect that it has ever since kept the stage garrick has touched shakespeare with much modesty and deference it gave great assistance to his own incomparable acting every man in his humor is ben jonsons comedy altered with the same view to the original authors reputation the fairies from the midsummers nights dream was attempted by garrick to less effect though formed into an opera with the addition of songs by some celebrated writers there was merit in it but the different ingredients did not mix it was performed by children it was composed by smith handels pupil a good musician with but little genius the tempest this piece was some of shakespeares scenes made into an operas and also composed by smith it had little effect garrick should not have brought it out it was sacrificing shakespeare to his own vanity florizel and perdita was produced from a better motive the two parts of the winters tale can bear separation on account of the great distance of time garrick preserved shakespeare this piece with the addition of songs was afterward performed at covent garden the music was beautifully composed by arne catherine and petruchio is shakespeares taming of the shrew cut into a farce which every body has seen and every body admires these are the occasions on which garrick evinced great dramatic judgment  lilliput was performed in      this was the worst of garricks pieces it had very little success it was performed by children the male coquette      this piece was written at a very short warning for woowards benefit and intended to ridicule a species of men or rather nonentities who though incapable of love and insensible of female loveliness talk like lothario of beauty that they never saw and fancy raptures that they never felt the character however was so disgusting that as it involved an unmanly and shocking idea with it the public very properly revolted at it fribble was bad enough but dafodil was detestable  garrick altered the gamester from shirley in      i have already explained the merit of of this alteration which is not so judicious as the alterations of garrick in general isabella is altered from southern by leaving out the comic part much to the advantage of the play the guardian a comedy of two acts performed in      and written for the purpose of bringing forward miss pritchard daughter to the celebrated actress of that name is taken from the pupile of fagan the success of mademoiselle gaussin in this piece who was complimented with verses out of number induced garrick perhaps to hope that his pupile would arrive at the same celebrity he was however ever mistaken he brought it out with the united strength of himself yates and obrien and it had as it deserved great success  the enchanter a kind of opera it was merely a passable piece the music was by smith and leoni then a boy appeared in it to great advantage cymbeline in which garrick performed posthumous so admirably is of course shakespeares play whose fame is certainly rescued from hawkins marsh brooks and others who had handled it too roughly garrick however has sunk the conduct of the physician which accounts for the harmless potion swallowed by imogen and therefore the piece is incomplete the farmers return from london was a temporary interlude written happily enough to ridicule the cock lane ghost which at that time engrossed the talk of the town this is the last production of garrick before his tour to italy i shall therefore examine other authors up to that time a review of whose works will bring out many collateral particulars relative to garrick  chap vii foot macklin and murphy to show how much the stage was indebted to garrick as an actor and how transcendantly adadmirable his acting must have been he maintained that great rank in reputation he so meritoriously filled during twentytwo years without the advantage of performing original characters except a very few and those were principally written by himself  as a proof of this i cannot find during that period as many celebrated writers as i have often enumerated in the course of this work within a given period of five or six years instead therefore of inserting in the head of this chapter the names of several writers of dramatic fame i am unable to discover more than foot macklin and murphy what then could possibly have kept the reputation of the theater and brought it step by step to that bright fame it acquired but the vigilance added to the transcendant merit of garrick who ransacked the hidden treasures of shakespeare and his cotemporaries brought them to view and gave them a polish by his exquisite acting massinger in some degree eclipsed shakespeare immediately before garrick  foot an admirable but a most mischievous writer who emulated aristophanes with less genius and less feeling who seemed fondly to fancy that to torture individuals was the only way to delight their fellow creatures measuring their pleasure by his malignity who knew no quality of satire but personality who would sacrifice his best friend for the gratification of tormenting him and who after all was perpetually the cats paw to his own vanity created among the fastidious the sour and the heart burnt a sort of veneration for that exotic from greece the middle comedy which greatly to the honor of the manly and benevolent character of the english may have a dwindling and a rickety existence but can never flourish to maturity in this country  who cares now for any thing that churchill wrote the topic of the day kept the world a tip toe for every new libel in which public men were branded with the accusation of public crimes to lift into notice private profligates and apostates had such talents for they were certainly eminent been employed in general satire which by admonishing all corrects many and privately induces amendment by conviction churchill would have lived in out minds now he is forgotten common nature is often absurd but it is never monstrous an indelible stain upon the reputation of dryden and of pope was caused by mac flecknoc and the dunciad foot like churchill was stained in this manner all over and would have been at this moment as fast for neither of them can ever be peaceably asleep if it were not for an attempt now and then to revive his pieces which however their malice being defeated have now but little attraction  there is another thing which naturally presents itself on an examination of these drawcansirs these dealers in fiats who expect the world to pay an implicit obedience not to their opinions for i will not be so uncharitable as to believe they always think what they write but to their assertions and this is that upon the principal that all critics ought to possess in their own minds a certificate of their ability to write as well as those authors they criticize so the minds of all moral menders ought to be moral  as the dramatic pieces of foot will bring out various observations naturally connected with them i shall now proceed to their examination taste this piece was produced in      at which time foot was in that prosperity which rendered it needless to write for profit he therefore gave all the emoluments to the celebrated jemmy worsdale the very person who took popes manuscript letters to curl it did not however greatly succeed it was intended to ridicule generally an absurd passion for virtu but it was so confined to the great who are too callous to feel attacks of this kind that it was no further useful to the authors reputation than to show that he could write and that he was capable of attacking whatever might be the reigning folly  the englishman in paris      is a farce of considerable merit the characters are natural the plot is interesting and the drift is laudable had foot uniformly kept to this species of writing he would certainly have established a legitimate reputation in his next piece the knights he began to indulge his favorite propensity by personating a peculiar character whom he had the supreme felicity of rendering ridiculous in his neighborhood where till then he had been respected and beloved and had never till the exhibition of this exaggerated portrait been suspected of possessing any follies but what were perfectly harmless and innofensive and in common with those of his neighbors and friends  the englishman returned from paris is a piece of a better kind it is general and has good discrimination it is also remarkable for a peculiar neat diction that foot had a good knack of writing he had however perpetually the contrary fault and having filled his head with that short responsive dialogue which though tierce enough in the french is flat and palling on the english stage the ear was in his pieces too frequently tired with certainly no doubt granted and a long string of other similar expressions which are repeated almost verbatim in every one of his plays  the author one of footes outrageous personalities was performed at drury lane in      the gentleman mimicked in this piece and held up by foot as an object for the hand of scorn to point its slow and moving ringer at was a person of fortune not in any respect deserving of public or private reprehension for any breach of honor liberality or moral rectitude but because he happened to have pecularities it would have been more to the honor of the satirist if his own pecularities had been as little liable to reproach the gentleman alluded to had interest enough to get the piece suppressed the diversions of the morning was composed of taste and other things  the minor was performed in    0 this piece is full of personalities we here begin to see in foot a mixture of shadwell and fielding from the first he had plenty of opportunity to take his bullies and his bawds and if the latter ridiculed cock the auctioneer foot had nothing to do but retail the same materials in order to represent cocks successor langford  the drift of this piece which it must be confessed is laudable enough might have been brought about without any of these reprehensibles vehicles profligacy imposition and hypocrisy are the proper objects of ridicule for the theater but why are particular characters held up as the only promulgators of these evils if the hydra vice is to be destroyed by striking at a single bawd a single auctioneer and a single methodist then is the labor no longer herculean  every body knows that this was not the fact mother douglas langford and whitefield were laughed at but wenching tricking and praying went on as before and thus general reprobation was lost in personal ridicule and the severity of the satirist eclipsed by the adroitness of the mimic  the orators performed at the haymarket in      is a kind of acted illustration of the principles of oratory it contains as usual many personalities and was rendered celebrated by footes mimicking a well known dublin printer who had but one leg the satirist little dreamt at that time that the personal defect at least which he thought proper to expose to laughter would one day be his own the printer when he caught him upon his own ground trounced him severely a dublin jury not being of opinion that natural infirmities ought to be quietly sported with upon this occasion foot wrote a prologue in which he modestly procured himself to be called the english aristophanes  the mayor of garrat performed in      is generally supposed to be in every respect original this however is not true as any one may be convinced who chooses to look at shadwells epsom wells where they will find major sturgeon jerry sneak bruin and the two wives the major who every body knew talked of mustering up courage enough to cane the poet no body would have been sorry if he had kept his word these are all footes pieces within my present promise  macklin whose writing was as harsh and as hard as his conduct was rude and dogmatic who though he did not produce many pieces contrived to make one answer the purpose of many whose strange pecularities made him a torment to himself and to every body else was however a useful and sometimes a great actor and very far from an inferior author  macklins first piece was henry the seventh or the popish impostor it appeared at drury lane the year that garrick performed at covent garden the second title of this piece is a misnomer for the story is that of perkin warbeck which we have seen treated unsuccessfully before and a man could not be said to be an impostor by professing the established religion it was however in every respect faulty and universally rejected macklins friends are solicitous to retrieve his fame by the stale excuse that it was done in a hurry to which they add that his employment as manager prevented him from paying it the private attention it ought to have received in the first place if he did not take time enough he ought to have found more and in the second he was not manager in that year lacey being then in that capacity and proprietor as we have seen with green and amber  a will or no will has been frequently acted for macklins benefit but never was considered of consequence enough to be regularly brought forward the suspicious husband critized is of course an invidious thing the play it was meant to ridicule standing deservedly high in the public opinion it had but little success yet more than it merited the fortune hunters never was performed except three or four different times at the authors benefits covent garden theater or peter pasquin turned drawcansir up to this period we find macklin nothing more than an imitator of fielding his performances were temporary and principally a ridicule on theaters and plays naturally poor and unprofitable to the fame of an author  love alamode was performed at drury lane in    0 this piece though heaven knows it has no superior traits of genius or talents made the author a little fortune when it came out it was strongly supported and strongly opposed its partisans however at length got the better and this victory gave the farce an admitted conseqenee it certainly did not critically deserve the story has been fifty times gone over and the denouement has always been the same in fact though never so bad in effect as in love alamode to made a needy irishman the only disinterested lover of a lady apparently without fortune is certainly a little too much upon the brogue especially when this irishman is the nephew of the ladys guardian who would certainly both naturally and theatrically speaking have let him into the secret  this farce owing to a number of adventitious circumstances had great success and this created a report naturally enough that macklin was not the author of it which according to custom though every body knew the contrary was at one time pretty generally believed the report itself is not so extraordinary as that with all his sourness and irrascibility he had the good sense to treat it with contempt  the married libertine was performed at covent garden in      it was very strongly opposed during its run which was no more than nine nights the contest relative to this play was like that which distinguished love alamode it did not however terminate so fortunately the author was as streniously supported by his countrymen who remembered their triumph in favor of little ireland and sir callaghan but the merits were universally allowed not to bear them out the distinction however was not correct as footes characters were notoriously held out to ridicule some person well known so the public gave macklin the credit or rather the obloquy of intending by his some person the idea of whom had never entered his imagination and thus as the supposed personification of lord bute had created a host of friends and enemies in sir archy so here the character of lord bellevile was supposed to imply a married nobleman whose intrigues at that time were pretty notorious the married libertine has never since been resumed though it certainly had more merit than love ala mode  murphy an author of merited celebrity who has written tragedy comedy and farce with fair and legitimate pretendons to fame an extent of dramatic talents very rarely concentrated in one writer comes next into consideration and i am pleased to acknowledge that the repugnance naturally arising from an unwillingness to give pain to living authors will in this instance yield to the pleasure of recording truth and praise in the same delineation  with the different pursuits of mr murphy i have nothing to do biographers of the living have at best an awkward task to perform and it is therefore seldom attempted with success but by the illiberal and the malignant who are as sure to find readers in those whose minds are congenial to their own as they are to be spurned and execrated by men of candor generosity and judgment  mr murphy was intended for business has been a party man was an actor a dramatic writer and at length a barrister about which a great deal has been said but how any part of it can as fact tell to his disadvantage is beyond the admission of my capacity all professions are honorable if they are honorably borne but the ipse dixits of churchil have found their low and dirty level and it would be well for the societies of the inns of court if they never had admitted among them men whose pursuits had been more dishonorable than those who have followed the profession of an actor  murphys first piece was the apprentice      a farce so well known and so generally approved that every reader can anticipate a description of it i shall therefore say that being his first attempt it gave good proof of that coming dramatic reputation which this author has so ably established the spouter or the triple revenge is a strange piece in which garrick rich and young cibber connived at being ridiculed it seems to have been one of those left handed whims of garrick like the sick monkey to anticipate ridicule which perhaps would never have been conceived but in his own imagination it had no success the englishman from paris which was performed in      only a single night and to which murphy spoke the prologue was of course the subject of footes englishman returned from paris to which latter the town gave the preference  the upholsterer this piece which has been so long and so deservedly a favorite was originally performed for mossops benefit but was found to possess so much merit that the managers very gladly admitted it among their stock performances the hint is taken from the spectator and is most completely to the very purpose of farce a discrimination which was peculiarly the talent of murphy  we now come to this authors first tragedy which was the orphan of china the original story of this play is to be met with in du haldes history of china which voltaire had wrought into a tragedy and of which i have already spoken murphys play is an alteration of voltaire with an eye perhaps to the heraclius of corneille it was certainly judicious to bring forward the orphan and make him a principal character in the piece but it has given it therefore a resemblance to merope and those numerous tragedies of the same complexion  this piece notwithstanding garricks incomparable acting and the opportunity it gave of displaying the valuable merits of mrs yates and other adventitious circumstances did not certainly succeed to the degree its merits had promised for which a variety of reasons have been given and one of them of a curious and private nature relative to a pique taken absurdly by garrick in consequence of a political transaction but i apprehend it principally arose for these circumstances are generally easily traceable from this play being considered a sort of innovation on tragedy and consisting of pompous and poetic rather than affecting and interesting language and depicting great rather than natural manners there may be too much truth in this last observation and perhaps it obtains too generally in murphy but the opportunities this has given to call forth great and transcendant powers in actors have made ample amends as far as it respects the general advantage of the theater no dramatic author in our recollection having given additional luster to the merits of more various and eminent performers  the desert island    0 this piece which is taken from metastasio is better written that is to say with more nature than this authors serious pieces in general it is however too barren of incident the way to keep him accompanied this piece they were each written in three acts and intended to make up the same evenings entertainment a mode of introduction that has seldom succeeded the desert island was soon withdrawn and the author by adding two acts to the way to keep him gave it a permanent right to keep the stage  the way to keep him is certainly a play of considerable merit its bent and drift are truly praise worthy and it is in many respects a kind of improvement upon cibber it is curious to remark that the critics decided when it was performed in three acts that it was imperfect and when it was extended to five that the addition had spoiled a perfect piece the new character of sir bashful constant was also settled both to be totally out of nature and to be the actual portrait of a person then living that sir bashful is not out of nature will i believe be easily granted and as to the other assertion it cannot be truth unless the person alluded to was both an englishman and a native of france for the character and a good deal of the conduct are taken from a play of la chaussee  all in the wrong was brought out in      at drury lane during the summer season at which time foot murphy and yates had the theater to themselves a plan which garrick well knew would come to nothing and that he should get the pieces then produced upon easy terms several of which were intended to have been brought forward none however was actually produced except those of murphy and one written by bentley which we shall see in its place called the wishes or harlequins mouth opened  murphy was a most powerful ally in this confederacy all in the wrong a play which has been long a deserving favorite had in it as much of stage bustle and perplexity as any piece that ever appeared and as it was intended to ridicule a natural though absurd passion at all points and in every possible view it certainly exhibited a most happy combination of circumstances by no means too strong for what is there extravagant that jealousy will not fancy and gave that inveterate folly a violent correction which alone can master its own irratibility  if the knot of circumstances in all in the wrong had been as ingeniously untied as it was knit together no candid critic could have found in it any thing to caval at as to the objection that has been generally made to murphys comedies that they have not the wit of congrieve and vanbrugh the anis that they have then more nature for indeed quibble and point is not the common language of mankind and in particular when the passions are busily at work it is a stronger proof of nature to consult the heart than the head from one the language comes measured and cold from the other intuitive and animated  the old maid was performed the same summer it contains a series of pleasant circumstances occasioned by a simple and natural equivoque a mode of conveying comic humor of the best kind when it is rationally treated but of the most monstrous and burlesque when violently caricatured the stage is too much a stranger to this species of afterpiece every thing in the old maid is just happy full of effect and managed with a nice and penetrating discrimination that are highly creditable to the author upon the whole there is scarcely any piece upon the stage more perfect in its way the resemblance it bears to letourderie of fagan is only that fair advantage of which every author has a right to a avail himself  the citizen which was also performed in the summer of      and which brought miss elliot on the stage has proved of considerable value to the theater nothing is more sensible or more meritorious in managers than to strengthen their interest as to the half price murphy was admirably well calculated to assist the theater in this particular when woodward came from ireland the citizen the upholsterer and the apprentice brought at half price a most incredible sum for at least three years and no trifle for several years afterward  the citizen was well calculated to display the various merit of miss elliot who certainly performed maria incomparably and though there is some extravagance in the conduct the drift is laudable and the circumstances are natural the scene which the author pretends to cover by giving an idea that it is an imitation of rule a wife and have a wife is the fausse agnes of destouches even to the oui monsieur which has always so good an effect there is however no harm in this every author has a right to imitate whatever he is capable of improving  chap viii young mallet dodsley brook william shirley and others the works of the authors now under consideration do not by any means militate against my declaration as to the inconsiderable number of celebrated dramatic pieces during the first sixteen years of garriks reign most of their productions as will appear having seen the world before the year      but as part of them were brought forward after that period i thought it best to give the whole in one view  young whose great character was singularity who seems in the course of his life to have been constant to all the virtues and vices and like captain plume with his fifteen attachments never melancholy for one whose writings are in places trite and in others sublime who had great natural requisites but who seems ambitious to be considered more as an uncommon than an origiginal poet wrote three tragedies one of which is well known to the public  busiris      like most of youngs works is an original conception of its author who seems every where to have introduced characters which he knew from the beginning he should not know how to dispose of at last and therefore he calls in the assistance of a dagger to get rid of them busiris is high and sounding but has no means of access to the heart  the revenge is well known because it has been by some considered as an improvement on othello zangas revenge being held up as more natural and more equitable than that of iago but this would be to make a virtue of revenge and to tolerate murder it is ridiculous to compare the probable or the moral propriety of the two pieces upon this point othello trusts a man whom he had loaded with benefits and on whose gratitude he has every right to repose alonzo confides his soul to a proud african prince his slave whose nature he must know if he knew any thing was vindictive malignity and as if it was not enough to submit his senses to the control of such a mind he does all this with his eyes open for he is conscious of having dealt this gloomy and implacable moor a blow which indelible stain and disgrace he would infallibly wipe off with his blood after having reproached him with his folly and weakness in having listened to him  as to the causes of jealousy they are infinitely preeminent on the side of shakespeare whose trifles light as air blind suspicion while forged letters pictures and such gross and palpable evidence would detect the villain in the mind of any man above an idiot and a driveller in short the plot cannot be defended except by those who are mad enough to maintain that a family ought to be destroyed for a fancied injury that the revenge of zanga which supersedes law justice and morality may be tolerated and that the folly and stupidity of alonzo deserves an exemplary punishment there are certainly passages of considerable merit in the play for whoever young has imitated the writing is his own which it is too little to say is greatly above mrs behn and it would be too much to say that it is any thing equal to shakespeare  of the tragedy of the brothers dr johnson tells us the world has said nothing and therefore he may be allowed the same indulgence one author has however said a great deal of it and after going into an elaborate and general account of its merits he tries to prove his assertion by saying that the author nobly gave up the profits for the propagation of the gospel in foreign parts young has been said to have written with the energy of dryden but the only resemblance between them seems to be that young dedicated the revenge to the infamous wharton and dryden his marriage ala mode to whartons infamous relation rochester  mallet a writer with more cunning than genius who courted the great to better purposes than authors in general are able to do and whom johnson has meanly for himself stigmatized in his dictionary in his etymology of the word alias this curious instance of deliberate malevolence ought be noticed johnson and mallet were together looking at the wild beasts in the tower and mallet observed as they were noticing the uncouthness of a greenland bear that it had strong resemblance to johnson remarking dryly that he did not know which was the handsomest the bear or the doctor johnson did not choose to resent the matter upon the spot but laid up this injury in his mind with a determination to take public revenge accordingly when he compiled his dictionary having occasion to explain the etymology of the term alias he gives it the following construction it should be observed that mallets real name was mallooh and the doctor of course concluded that he had some particular reason for concealing it alias says he is a latin word signifying otherwise as mallet alias malloch that is otherwise malloch  wrote several things of different descriptions and the following pieces for the theater  euridice is a weak tragedy and never had reputable success though strengthened by the performance of garrick and mrs cibber when it was revived in    0 it originally appeared in      mustapha a subject treated before by lord orrery and lord brook was probably written by mallet to show his attention to noble writers it had better success than euridice but not enough to satisfy any author of reputation alfred was originally performed in    0 at the gardens at cliefdon in commemoration of the accession of george the first and in      at drury lane we are told from good authority that mallet procured alfred to be performed at drury lane by insinuating to garrick that in his life of marlborough he should by an ingenious device find a nich for the hero of the stage my dear friend said garrick have you left off to write for the stage the hint was taken and alfred was produced  at which time it had undergone considerable alterations and had success great part of which however was ascribable to the beatiful music of arne thompson had a hand in this piece  britannia in which there is some charming music by arne had good success chiefly owing however to a prologue that garrick spoke in the character of a drunken sailor elvira      this is mallets best dramatic production but it had little success notwithstanding garrick whom mallet seems to have known how to manage did his utmost for it it however contained unpopular sentiments and could not resist the opposition that was made to it  dodsley who by his industry and his ingenuity was of great use to the cause of the theater and indeed of literature in general and who by his modesty and good sense preserved a respectable reputation and accomplished the difficult task of conciliating the favor of many friends wrote the following pieces  the toyshop which is one of those various dramas that have originated from randolphs muses looking glass and which good naturedly rebukes fashionable follies in short it is footes piece called taste with all its points and none of its asperity it was performed at covent garden in      with good success the king and the miller of mansfield a pleasant and well known farce which was afterward translated into french by sedaine the music by monsigny with most extraordinary success is founded on a traditional story in the reign of henry the second it has ever been deservedly a favorite sir john cockle at court also has merit but has the disadvantage of all sequels the circumstance however of making a man of plain integrity resist the corruption of a court is certainly a fair object for a dramatic pen  the blind beggar of bethnal green is an unhappy subject it did not succeed rex et ponsifex is only known in a volume of dodsleys works modlestly called trifles cleone is a tragedy of some merit it had great success which was principally owing however to the acting of mrs bellamy who certainly was never in any other character so excellent it is however unaffected and pathetic and the interest is in many places strong and home to the heart  brook who was a respectable though by no means a first rate author wrote fifteen dramatic pieces generally with indifferent success in his writings is diffused a turbulent spirit of liberty which may serve party purposes but ought not to pervade theatrical productions gustavus vasa was prohibited but a subscription of a thousand pounds made the author amends the piece was afterward performed on the irish stage with alterations the earl of westmoreland was performed in ireland with success jack the giant queller was interdicted though performed in ireland  the earl of essex is well written in places but the public gave the preference to the play of banks on this subject for the reasons we have already seen this play would scarcely be known but for a strange thing said by dr johnson about it which without examination passed so implicitly for sterling reason that even the author consented to alter the line which is reprobated by the remark johnson is said to have been solicitous to have a specimen of brookes language and mr sheridan repeated to him the line at the end of the first act which runs thus who rule over freemen should themselves be free   the doctors answer was that it would be as proper to say who drives fat oxen should himself be fat   than which nothing can be more false either literally or figuratively it so happens that nothing can be better or more just than the sentiment of brook though perhaps bunglingly expressed he alone is proper to rule over freemen who in his heart feels and cherishes the principles of freedom what is there amiss in the clear and obvious truth this conveys were this principle of argument carried on in the sentiment of johnson it would mean if it were intended to mean any thing that the drover must not only be corpulent which would be an impediment to his driving oxen but fit for killing which is a quality necessary in the oxen but not in the drover because men eat oxen but not drovers nay it is false sift it how you may the original position is wrong freemen may be ruled and led but they cannot be driven but it would be folly to pursue it any further i shall therefore only add that this was one of those instances in which johnson found it easier to knock down his auditors than to convince them    antony and cleopatra the impostor cymbeline montezuma the vestal virgin the contending brothers the charitable asiociation the female officer the marriage contract and ruth make up the number of this authors plays they are all imitations or alterations of other writers as may be seen by their titles but they were never performed  william shirley an excellent calculator except as to the merit of dramatic productions wrote a string of pieces the reception of which tolerably well proves my assertion the paricide was performed once and undeservedly damned if we may credit the authors dedication of it to rich king pepins campaign was short and unsuccessful edward the black prince an awkward attempt at an imitation of shakespeare was the third misfortune that befell this author on his dramatic road electra was as unfortunate an imitation of sophocles as edward had been of shakespeare it had a more merciful exit for the lord chamberlain interdicted it and therefore the author was less exposed  the birth of hercules was written immediately after artaxerxes and composed by arne it was rehearsed but never performed the music was extremely beautiful but it would not probably have succeeded it was not dramatic the songs composed for beard tenducci peretti and miss brent were of the first excellence i was present at the rehearsal and their effect will never be erased from my memory it was withdrawn as it was generally understood through some caprice of the author the roman sacrifice the last of this authors plays that appeared on the stage was however only performed four nights the remainder of the list which were printed but never otherwise produced were the roman victim alcibades the first and second parts of henry the second the fall of carthage all mistaken the good englishman fashionable friendship the shepherds courtship and hecates prophecy  worsdale a painter and a mimic and rather a retainer to authors than an author himself and in particular the jackall of the lion pope the circumstance relative to popes letters which are hinted at already was briefly thus and managed with consummate art it did not succeed pope privately employed jemmy worsdale to carry spurious copies of his letters both to lintot and curl neither of whom as the letters did not come authenticated by the author would treat for them this was the very thing pope wanted for it now appeared certain that if something were not done his correspondence would be laid before the public surreptitiously it behoved him awkward as the circumstance was to sound his own trumpet thus  if i may be allowed the expression  he submitted to the public with great deference his own posthumous works and thus did he cheat that very posterity whose favor he had made it the business of his life to conciliate  was an apprentice to sir godfrey kneller and turned out of his masters house for marrying the knights niece he was a facecious good natured fellow and author of many trifling productions in short a kind of second durfey his dramatic pieces are a cure for a scold which is shakespeares taming of the shrew made very unsuccessfully into a ballad opera the assembly which had no merit but his own admirable performance of an old woman the queen of spain which was probably a burlesque the extravagant justice known only by name and gasconade the great intended as a laugh at the partiality of the king of france to madame de pompadour  havard a respectable actor and a reputable character wrote scanderbeg founded upon lillos christian hero which had little success king charles the first did credit to the author and the stage but lord chesterfields remark on it in his famous speech against the licencing act was that it was of too recent too melancholy and too solemn a nature to be heard of any where but in a pulpit regulus has some sterling merit but it had but little success the elopement a mere farce was acted only at his benefit  marsh who was at different times a parish clerk a bookseller and a westminster justice and who fancied himself an author wrote a miserable piece called amasis king of egypt performed one night only in the haymarket and altered from shakespeare cymbeline the winters tale and romeo and juliet neither of which so altered was ever performed at all arthur the actor wrote the lucky discovery merely to assist his benefit  chap ix the hoadlys whitehead johnson moore and other authors to      dr benjamin hoadly the eldest son of the celebrated bishop of winchester was a physician of considerable eminence and in addition to other ingenious productions wrote the well known and greatly admired comedy of the suspicious husband this was one of the first novelties that garrick brought out after he had possession of the management it certainly has great intrinsic merit as every body knows much of which however was owing to garricks judicious advice and assistance during its preparation for the stage which he gave very honestly and which was permitted with even deference by hoadly who admirable as he was in his various writings upon grave subjects found great judgment and knowledge in the alterations made by his friend who in particular modelled ranger to his own manner and afterward performed it incomparably  dr john hoadly brother of benjamin who had also a hand in writing the suspicious husband which was originally intended to be called the rake wrote several dramatic pleces i had the honor of receiving a great deal of attention from this gentleman in the early part of my life when he was chancellor of winchester rector of st mary at southampton and held all those other places of immunity that might naturally be in the possession of the bishop of winchesters son and having met him frequently afterward at garricks house at hampton at the time i was one of his privy counsel i have been present at conversations wherein with all the playfulness of a boy though he was then tormented with the gout and obliged to be wheeled from room to room in one of merlins chairs who was at that time newly arrived among us those pranks which he garrick and hogarth played together were reiterated he delighted in the theater though an exemplary divine and though he knew how to treat serious subjects with proper strength of understanding and due solemnity he loved a jest in his soul his wit however was of the best kind for though it was irresistible it never gave a moments pain on reflection to him or his hearers   the contrast was written by the chancellor with the assistance of his brother benjamin indeed they seldom wrote upon any subject without consulting each other the design of this piece was to ridicule the poets of that day but the bishop their father thinking the subject too ludicrous to be treated by his sons prevailed upon them to withdraw it it however had been played five times before this mandate and with great applause the subject did not die for fielding afterward modelled his pasquin after it  jeptha was an oratorio loves revenge an opera so was phaebe so was the force of truth doctor green was the composer of these operas hoadly would have written other pieces for the stage if he had not been restrained by the entreaties of his father who with great paternal regard had studied to make his means honorable and ample he dabbled however a great deal in private and among other efforts he revised lillos arden of feversham wrote a tragedy called cromwell and planned a farce called the housekeeper on the subject of high life below stairs something relative to which i privately know but as much of my knowledge of the stage during the seven years i was articled to garrick is derived from confidential conversation it would be a weak way of recommending one species of veracity by violating another i shall withold nothing however that i may fairly communicate  whitehead who held the situation of poet laureat for many years with considerable ability wrote the roman father a tragedy that has borne a good rank on the theater it is confessedly taken from corneille and except in one or two respects materially mended it appeared in    0 fatal constancy was a mere sketch given to eke out footes diversions of the morning creusa which is founded on the jon of euripides and in which whitehead has introduced with great effect a youth bred up in the service of the gods and kept unacquainted with the vices of mankind was performed at drury lane in      it was however too lofty and classical for general effect  the school for lovers though a respectable play came out to disadvantage after the guardian it was one of the first attempts at what was called sentimental comedy which the french under the term drame have classed as superior in a moral sense to either tragedy or comedy in england it at last became a mere rhapsody of words the play in question is by no means of this outrageous species it is delicate sensible and to a degree impressive but neither the situations nor the interest was found sufficiently powerful notwithstanding it was admirably acted to ensure it permanence the trip to scotland was a passable farce and that was all whitehead could not write ill but his attempts at comedy are rather sketches than pictures  johnson who has written so many volumes himself and filled so many volumes written by others can only have a very small corner in this work because he wrote but one play and that an unsuccessful one i could with no great difficulty go largely into his literary character which i might be tempted to do were i not under an incumbent necessity of paying impartial attention to all those of whom i have undertaken to speak the reflections resulting from this forbearance perhaps are pleasurable for it is inconceivable how like the bundle of rushes he sinks more and more into insignificance upon our nearer acquaintance  irene the only play of johnson was performed by garrick barry mrs cibber mrs pritchard and all the strength of the company and yet excited no extraordinary curiosity or attracted any warmth of applause for which the public taste has been arrogantly arrainged by the critics though no dramatic piece was ever ushered into the world with more support and patronage in short it was regular to preciseness and verbose to dullness and what with the mixture of seneca and aristotle that pervaded it neither the critics the author or the actors could persuade the public that there can be any mode of delight and enjoyment but that which the heart and the understanding approve  moore who knew how to feel as he wrote the tendency of all whose productions was to cultivate truth and morality and who therefore found it difficult to become a fashionable writer brought out two comedies and a tragedy the foundling is a play of sterling merit it breathes a good deal the air of mercier it has however an unfortunate resemblance to the conscious lovers in the principal drift of the plot and therefore though it has been often performed and always with applause yet it yields to steeles play what has certainly superior merit this play was produced in      in      he brought out gil blas which garrick said he had the highest opinion of before it came out prefacing his declaration as he always did upon those occasions with a confession that he had no eventual judgment which was his way of bespeaking an indemnity whenever his opinion should turn out to be wrong it was the story of aurora in le sages novel which is difficult to be dramatized to effect one cause of the failure of this piece was the exposition of a spanish gentleman drunk on the stage which was certainly a gross violation of national manners it being well known that nothing can be considered as a greater disgrace a law having formerly existed that if a gentleman should be convicted of even a capital offense he should be pardoned on pleading his having been intoxicated at the time he committed it it being supposed that any one with the sentiments of a gentleman would rather suffer death than confess himself capable of so beastly a vice as drunkenness it were a pity but the custom obtained in england   the gamester is exactly the drame of the french stage except that it ends unhappily and thence becomes a tragedy in prose from this distinction the gamester even though the audience were drowned in tears obtained but a cold reception from the public so reprehensibly does custom triumph over nature is it not extraordinary that the feelings dare not manifest themselves but by command and that the affections of the mind are to halt till they receive the signal to march in measure and cadence moore was aware of this prejudice and therefore began his play in blank verse the subject however was too touching and the grief too natural to bear this heavy and unnatural garb he threw it off and discovered under it one of the most perfect and beautiful ornaments of the theater  another cause of its cool reception was a more natural one the audience could not bear to be touched on the side of that darling vice which the play reprobated these considerations and the failure of gil blas induced moore to persuade a gentleman to father it the mask was thrown off after the fourth night when to show what critics are it was loudly condemned by many who had been its warm admirers while moores name was concealed  sheridan an excellent actor a man of strict honor and a perfect gentleman who during part of a life of great credit and public utility managed one of the theaters in dublin for the better purpose of conducting that kind of undertaking wrote one dramatic piece and altered three plays the productions of other authors captain oblunder was a mere juvenile jeu desprit but it nevertheless became a great favorite on the irish stage and it was received as a model for all the sir callaghans and other characters of that description which have added so much pleasantry to the stage the loyal subject and romeo and juliet were only altered in that slight degree which a revival of plays sometimes makes necessary and coriolanus the last piece this gentleman was concerned in was a mixture of shakespeare and thompson and brought forward at covent garden with the addition of a grand ovation  mendez who though a rich jew was no churl for he was a bon vivant and a wit wrote a farce called the double disappointment which was a pleasant thing and a great favorite the chaplet so exquisitely set by boyce that it perhaps contains some of the sweetest and most delightful specimens of simplicity in music that can be conceived was greatly to the honor of english taste eminently successful the shepherds lottery also succeeded but not in the same degree these pieces are by no means excellently written but there is enough in them to set such a composer as boyce properly to work and he has made such use of the opportunity that these are some of the proofs that music to perfection has been produced by english composers and tasted by english auditors  smollet with whose various publications the public are so well acquainted wrote more for his amusement than for fame the regicide this play was refused the particulars of which circumstance smollet has pleasantly but severely treated in roderick random he was remunerated by a subscription the reprisals is a farce full of broad humor which as every body knows had great success at the theaters at bartholomew fair and every where else there is also a piece set down to this author called the israelite or the pampered nabob  glover the ingenious author of leonidas wrote a tragedy called boadicea which however it may be full of the scholar and the poet has very little in it of the dramatist its merits have been discussed at large and bishop herring has very sensibly distinguished its beauties and its faults medea has less pretensions as a tragedy than boadicea it was written after the grecian model and too full of preciseness and regularity for a chance of success  hill who was an excentric author of so voluminous a kind that nothing came amiss to him who though he begged to be excused as to the quality of writing beat out of sight any author that had ever existed in point of quantity seeming rather to have an ambition to be much than well read produced among the wonderful number of things he engaged in three dramatic pieces orpheus was in richs hands while his pantomime or rather theobalds pantomime was in preparation in consequence of which when the latter came out hill publicly and falsely attacked rich with great virulence for having stolen his piece which slander rich refuted by the testimony upon oath of several credible witnesses the critical minute was acted one night only at drury lane the rout was still a more contemptible piece it occasioned from garrick the following distich for physic and farces his equal there scarce is his farces are physic his physic a farce is   the pieces of inferior authors were the false guardian outwitted by godshall perhaps never performed the raree show by peterson a strolling actor antiochus by schuckborough the sharpers and the parthian hero by gardener which were probably performed in ireland as well as the preceptor of hammond herod the great written by peck arminius by paterson the friend and successor in office of thompson rosalind and davids lamentation by lockman secretary to the british herring fishery says his biographer and one of the compilers of the general dictionary orpheus and euridice neither hills nor richs by somner and sancho at court and the kiss accepted and returned by air and amyntas from tasso by airs  west an excellent writer produced the institution of the garter which was not known to the stage till garrick dressed it out at drury lane iphigenia in taurus translated from euripides and the triumph of the gout from lucian morris wrote a tragedy never performed called fatal necessity the school boys mask was written by spateman merely as a sort of school exercise yarrow an actor wrote love at first sight and trick for trick the first piece a mere incident originally in italian afterward in the magnifique and then in the busy body and the other taken from the match in newgate and lord harvey wrote agrippina a tragedy which however was neither printed nor acted  delamaine produced love and honor from virgil sommerville translated alzira from voltaire john theobald translated voltaires merope stevens rather a collector than a writer produced the modern wife cutts wrote rebellion defeated in which he cuts but a poor figure lion in a very lamb like way produced the wrangling lovers broughton with the strength of his namesake but with very little of the sweetness of a poet produced hercules which was set to music by handel maxwell a blind poet and unfortunately a poor one wrote the royal captive the loves of prince emilius and louisa and the distressed virgin these pieces were acted at york at different times to raise money for the author  dr patrick an usher of the charter house school and superintendant of henderies lexicon and ainsworths dictionary translated all the comedies of terence baillie another doctor not of divinity but of medicine wrote the married coquette hyland a farmer wrote the shipwreck clancy an irishman brought out in dublin hernon a tragedy and the sharper a comedy the latter piece was noticed by swift morell who was secretary to the antiquarian society and one of the original writers in the gentlemans magazine altered and fitted from milton gay and other authors many of those pieces some sacred and some profane which handel brought out under the titles of oratorios he also translated hecuba from euripides and promtheus in chains from aeschylus cunningham a poet and actor whose pastoral writings are deservedly in estimation brought out a farce at dublin called love in a mist wincop wrote scanderbeg lambert a most admirable scene painter published a thing called the wreckers it would have been a noble acquisition to the stage if his pen had been equal to his pencil  mrs hooper wrote two tragedies and one burlesque though her pieces were all nearer the last denomination than she was aware of her tragedies were called the battle of poictiers the cyclopaedia and her burletta queen tragedy restored mrs pilkington whose curious memoirs are in the usual style of those ladies who after the example of cibber have conceived it necessary to apology not for their lives but the manner in which they led them wrote among others of her excentricties a a thing quite in her own way called the turkish court hawkins whose biographer tries to prove his talents by instancing that his father was a great crown lawyer wrote henry and rosamond and the siege of aleppo and altered cymbeline the originals were never performed and the alteration were damned  moss or marriot wrote a contemptible piece called the general lover wilder an irish actor and manager in order to be dabbling brought out a piece from dancourt called the gentleman gardener woodward another dabler produced a furious number of things some of them however as they were on the subject of those pantomimes he brought out were not so much amiss the titles of these pieces none of which had success but the pantomimes are tit for tat queen mab a lick at the town harlequin ranger the genii fortunatus proteus marplot in lisbon altered from mrs centlivre mercury harlequin harlequin faustus harlequins jubilee the mans the master and the seasons  hallam that hallam whom macklin killed behind the scenes for which he took his trial and was acquitted at the old bailey brought out at the french theater lopera du gueux bland produced a strange thing called the song of solomon mrs clive the celebrated actress produced now and then for her benefit some new or altered piece flimzy enough but set off by her admirable performance bays in petticoats every woman in her humor sketch of a fine ladys return from a rout and the faithful irishman are her pieces of this description stamper a pleasant creature and a sound actor when he could be kept from the bottle introduced a new character into aesop  mrs leapor wrote a dismal tragedy called the unhappy father green published two plays which were never acted called oliver cromwell and the nice lady francis who was a good classical translator but a bad dramatic writer produced eugene and constantine both tragedies mrs cibber the celebrated actress translated the oracle of st foix with good success gordon translated the comedies of terence boyce a bon vivant about town who had a place in the south sea house whence have issued so many choice spirits wrote a number of fugitive pieces and a play called the rover henderson whom nobody seems to have known though he has written a great deal produced one dramatic piece called arsinoe  george alexander stevens who another durfey was a bon vivant and a ready writer who at pleasure could lug in the whole heathen mylothogy to electrify men into an admiration of poetry which they were too far gone critically to examine wrote for the stage distress upon distress never performed the french flogged damned in the theater and transferred to bartholomew fair the court of alexander a wretched imitation of the style of ohara wretchedly composed by the curiously celebrated dr fisher and a trip to portsmouth a musical piece performed upon a temporary occasion at the haymarket this man has been admired by those who are now ashamed of their former judgment he made a fortune by his lecture upon heads which was considered as a work of merit but is now reflected on with contempt he died however in indigence and had been so pampered by false praise that he fancied himself to the last moment a greater writer than homer  smart another dissipated promoter of midnight orgies was a better writer than stevens but not so solicitous to turn his excentric effusions to advantage he had strong sensibility and his fits of drunkenness brought him to a madhouse where he is said to have completed a translation of the psalms he recovered however and published many pieces but nothing could keep him from the most deplorable poverty he wrote for the stage the grateful fair and the judgment of midas which are mock operas and hannah an oratorio a strange heavy thing strangely and heavily set by worgan to the first of these pieces belong the following celebrated lines whimsically describing a conflict between love rage and jealousy which have been attributed to so many authors thus when a barber and a collier fight the barber beats the luckless collier white the lusty collier heaves his ponderous sack and big with vengeance beats the barber black in comes a brickdustman with grime overspread and beats the collier and the barber red black red and white in various clouds are tossed and in the dust they raise the combatants are lost   rolt to whom smart was indebted for his initiation into the mysteries of bacchus who was originally a hackney writer to an attorney who had the modesty to publish dr akensides pleasures of imagination as his own work and in his own name who was concerned with smart in the famous amusement called mother midnights entertainment who was celebrated by his congenial friend churchill and in short who lived and died in infamy and poverty wrote eliza which was prohibited the royal shepherd which was composed by rush and was one of those pieces which artaxerxes engendered and which lacey so much encouraged to no purpose while garrick was in italy as we shall presently see and almena another thing of the same kind which was composed by michael arne and in which miss wright afterward mrs arne sung most beautifully  de boissey translated molieres miser jones wrote the earl of essex and the heroine of the cave the last was finished by hiffernan the earl of essex was popular for a time but banks play at last triumphed over all others on this subject for the simple reason that feeling and sensibility are objects of superior attraction than any other requisites of tragedy joness biographer is very angry with him for being a bricklayer and insists upon it that it is impossible for persons of such a description to produce any writings of merit a circumstance which probably the gentleman forgot when he extolled ben jonson above all other dramatic writers  stayley brought out at dublin the court of nassau and the rival theaters neither of them but for regularity worth recording derrick who at the death of nash became master of the ceremonies at bath and tunbridge but who was so extravagant that no curb nor income was sufficient to keep him from distress translated a piece from the french of the king of prussia called sylla lee an actor famous for sterling merit and unaccountable singularity who in any situation was never at peace himself or would suffer any body else to be so altered macbeth most miserably the country girl as bad and the relapse equal to either

rival father mrs tollet produced susannah heart a scotchman wrote a tragedy for the theater of edinburgh called herminia and espasia goodhall is said to have written florazene and to have altered king richard the second very little however is known of him or his writings brown who was known as an ingenious author and a restless character and who put a period to his existence from impatience of temper and extreme sensibility produced a tragedy called athelstan certainly well conceived and well written but ponderous and clogged in consequence of which it met with a cold reception barbarossa however which was greatly received is probably not so well written and it is besides too like merope and other similar pieces the performance however of garrick and mossop and the great solicitude with which garrick brought it forward made it an object of profit and indeed reputation to the author brown also wrote the cure of saul which was composed by dr arnold  lewis out of an inclination to make a total change in the drama and introduce every thing horrible revolting and dreadful in the place of natural productions calculated to mend the heart and amuse the senses wrote for it was never performed garrick was the wrong manager for his purpose a most extraordinary piece upon the old theme of the italian husband which ravencroft as we have seen had before treated i shall content myself

piece was never performed except at shrewsbury i am afraid his family were not much the better for it  townley master of merchant taylors school is said to have written high life below stairs i know it has been ascribed to this gentleman but the letter which at that time publicly appeared saying that this piece is not written either by mr townley or mr garrick i can if i may be guided by circumstances undertake to say is truth hoadley had certainly a hand in it and there were other communications from persons who were in the secret but who conceived the subject to be rather ticklish that garrick fitted it to the stage there can be no doubt mozeen an indifferent actor but by no means an insignificant writer produced a piece called the heiress white translated the clouds from aristophanes i also reckon a hundred and twentyfive anonymous pieces since my last general account  chap x actors the dearth of great excellence in acting from cibbers secession to the time of garricks approach gave me but little opportunity of going into that subject and i now take it up merely to join the chain together so that the readers view of the comparative merit of actors may be collected and undisturbed  many of the actors and actresses ranked respectively but that was all among these were as we have seen keen milward the elder and younger mills johnson bowman thurmond walker wright bullock and mrs bullock and others most of whom were brought forward to england from ashburys nursery in ireland which certainly promoted very materially the interest of the stage the public however were obliged to be content with these and a few more till the time of fleetwood when the later shoots from ashburys stock began to emancipate and expand in english soil  from this time the english stage began to know among many others macklin quin ryan delane hulet and afterward sheridan digges sparks barry mossop and woodward among the men and mrs bellamy mrs clive and mrs woffington among the women besides mrs cibber and mrs pritchard and a large addition of names somewhat respectable though less eminent than those i have mentioned  it seems to be evident that acting having fallen off from the death of booth and the secession of cibber never regained its natural tone till the public saw a perfect model for imitation in garrick macklin was surely a turgid heavy actor with neither real dignity in tragedy nor native humor in comedy there was a sort of precise studied correctness which always reached sufferance but seldom admiration like a reader at a press who goes critically over every word without feeling the sense of the sentiment or the beauty of the writer the acting therefore of that day must have been cold and unnatural for macklin was the theatrical schoolmaster  quin though he must have been an actor of much greater understanding and more mind than macklin was still in stilts and proved that though action comprehends the whole of oratory oratory by no means comprehends the whole of acting greatness and dignity quin is universally allowed to have possessed for a correct and commanding understanding and a thorough and discriminating power of expressing the sense of an author i have always understood he never had a superior we are told and i do not dispute the truth of the assertion that his manner of utterance was so just and such a display of that feeling which the sentiment he pronounced conveyed to his mind that he transfused an equal sensation of pleasure and conviction to his auditors  this is surely transcendent merit yet it is only transcendent as far as it goes for it is but one requisite of a great actor who when he loses sight of the part he is performing with all his reason his understanding and his judgment is no more than a performer lecturing his auditors this actors dignity was the dignity of quin not of pyrrhus or cato in other words dignity of person not dignity of mind and i think we may easily conceive that booth gave more force to the sentiment of cato by assuming the suavity of the philosopher rather than the asperity of the cynic  it is impossible to assert with certainty any thing positive on this subject we can only assist our opinions by arguing rationally on such parts of it as we know to be infallible and to form a conclusion  an impartial view of the whole upon this  with the perpetual objection in our teeth  however that actors and their reputations  ether we can infallibly pronounce on the me of roscius betterton garrick and others who went for and accomplished a correct representation of nature but we have no guide to lead us to the degree of merit possessed by theatrical readers and oratorical actors any further than to conceive that they conveyed the correctness of their authors without manifesting the beauty  ryan is spoken of in terms of the warmest praise by his biographer who fancying himself obliged to write nevertheless in the language of candor confesses while he speaks of his person and features as the model of symetry and perfection that having first received a blow in the nose in one affray which turned it out of its place and a brace of pistol bullets in his mouth in another which broke his jaw these accidents so discomposed his voice that he became a most ridiculous object of imitation but that he remained a very deserving stage favorite to the last  it is universally acknowledged that he was a very sensible man and a most respectable member of society and upon this account he was probably encouraged greatly beyond his professional merit nobody seems to have known this better than quin who in the most friendly manner after he had retired from the stage performed falstaff regularly for his benefit once a year till he himself took a hint from nature and found that the deception would not do in short in spite of whatever may be said by those who from the best intentions in the world wish well to the reputation of ryan he never could have ranked on the stage as an actor of first rate abilities  there seems to have been a great deal of this philanthrophy about quin i cannot deny myself the pleasure of relating two anecdotes which though they are generally known will not lose upon repetition when quin found himself admonished by age and infirmities not to appear again in public he wrote to ryan that he had the greatest regard for him as a friend but that he would not whistle falstaff for him or any man breathing to which he added that he had set him down a thousand pounds in his will and if his occasions required it he was welcome to draw for the whole or any part of it during his life time the other circumstance relates to thompson to whom quin is said to have introduced himself at a spunging house where he informed him after a delicate and a proper introduction that as he owed him two hundred pounds he thought he could not choose a more seasonable moment to pay his debts thompson remonstrated but quin insisted upon the fact and having prevailed upon thompson to receive the money which probably in that situation was not a very difficult task he informed him that he had received pleasure from a perusal of the seasons equivalent to the sum he had now reimbursed a compliment more to his philanthrophy than to his taste delane was considered as a sound good actor of a respectable but by no means of a first rate description he was particular and garrick successfully mimicked him in the rehearsal bowman however we are told had merit enough to keep alive a spirit of jealousy in quin though bowman at that time was very old hulet was a useful performer and a good singer harper was a kind of a second to quin in comedy and played sir epicure mammon and other parts of that description with truth and spirit cashel is said to have been a promising actor  we have thus seen that quin macklin and ryan had a smattering of cibbers school the merits of which have been already canvassed and which consisted more except in the instances of chaste and natural representation in booth and mrs oldfield and their imitators of the art of acting than the power of demonstrating nature with garrick came perfection perhaps that perfection which is supposed to have died with betterton and i think it may fairly be conceived that even quin afterward improved by that novel because natural system which at garricks first appearance he had reprobated  i have not ranked sheridan with these because though a mannerist and a peculiar actor yet he had no necessity to model himself upon the plan of any other performer having as much genius and judgment as perhaps any one who ever trod the stage it was not at all times that you would get at garricks real sentiments about acting which indeed was no more than the pardonable duplicity of a tradesman who is obliged now and then to be a little insincere to puff off his wares but he had his unguarded moments and through those i am able to ascertain that he had made it his business to avail himself of the sound sense and critical discrimination which marked the judgment of sheridan and i can assert with safety which is greatly to the honor of garrick and a strong proof of his understanding that he sought a connection with that scholar and critic in uniting himself with him in the management of the irish theater as much for the purpose of learning to act as learning to manage  a sonorous voice and an expressive face are very imposing requisites in favor of an actor and where these are denied the best understanding and the most critical conception are veiled and obscured there is something however by which they announce themselves we acknowledge the value of the sun even in a mist though we do not at that time perceive its brilliancy nor feel its influence we are only aflicted that nature should oppose such an inconvenient obstacle to what we decidedly know would otherwise be capable of affording a most complete and satisfactory enjoyment on the contrary a meteor is a momentary object of delight but our senses soon correct the fallacy and our admiration vanishes with the delusion that created it  nature had certainly thrown such impediments in the way of sheridan who however excited abundant admiration in those who were judicious enough to penetrate beyond the veil and view the commanding power of mind and strength of comprehension with which he was internally gifted in the powers of an actor quin seems to have been superior to sheridan in the feelings of an actor sheridan appears to have been superior to quin quin felt all he expressed and therefore exceeded sheridan could sheridan have expressed all he felt he would have soared above quin  mossop from all i can collect was a commanding but never an agreeable actor there are various ways of convincing the mind we are convinced by subtilty by plausibility by blandishment and by eloquence but we can also be convinced by perseverence by confidence by earnestness and even by vehemence these latter qualities seem to have been mossops mode of convincing an audience into an admiration of him which with all his pomp his stiffness his peculiarity and his affectation he contrived to bring about i have heard mossop praised for great and commanding powers in tragedy such as no other actor ever possessed and it has been insisted that if he was quaint and starched at times he was at other times grand and energetic and indeed that his influence over the feelings of his auditor was irresistible the mind however is not very fond of being threatened into pleasure nor are those confessions very sincere that are effected by compulsion we cannot therefore reasonably acquiese in the opinions of either the admirers or deciples of mossop proselytes are seldom gained by denunciations nor do those scholars turn out brightest who have their educations hammered into them  as the actors i have yet to name stood high in reputation after garricks return from italy except havard barry hippesley collins and some others who certainly deserve to be spoken of with respect but to whom it is impossible i should be expected to pay separate and particular attention i shall mention those actresses who up to the year sixtythree ornamented the stage with a degree of reputation certainly upon the whole putting garrick out of the question superior to the men and equal but most probably exceeding those ladies of whom cibber seems to have written the eulogium  mrs cibber was a most exquisite actress in all characters of tenderness and pathos in which the workings of the feeling mind call for the force of excessive sensibility she was like garrick the character she represented love rage resentment pity disdain and all those gradations of the various passions she greatly felt and vigourously expressed her face her figure and her manner were irresistably impressive and her voice was penetrating to admiration actresses may have had more majesty more fire but i believe that all the tragic characters truly femenine greatly conceived and highly written had a superior representative in mrs cibber than in any other actress she was certainly not so happy in comedy but it would be no bad compliment to the present day if there were any actress who could perform it half so well  mrs pritchard was an actress of more general abilities than mrs cibber mrs cibbers acting was delightful mrs pritchards commanding one insinuated herself into the heart the other took possession of it nothing could be so fortunate for the stage as this junction of different talents it made acting like a picture with grand breadths of light and shade we have seen the excellence of mrs cibber that of mrs pritchard was unceasing variety lady macbeth the queen in hamlet clarinda estifania doll common in short every species of strong nature received from her a polish and a perfection than which nothing could be more truly captivating cibbers judicious remark that the life of beauty is too short to form a complete actress proved so true in relation to mrs pritchard that she was seen to fresh admiration till in advanced age she retired with a fortune to the great satisfaction of her numerous admirers  mrs woffington was an actress of a most extraordinary kind and in some parts must have been unrivalled she had a bad voice but this seems to have been the only impediment to her becoming superlatively excellent for though it is universally allowed to have prevented her from interesting the passions in so eminent a degree as either mrs cibber or mrs pritchard yet her superior beauty and grace the industry with which she cultivated her profession by observing the instructions of cibber getting introduced to mademoiselle dumesnil the attention she paid to garrick and every other eligible opportunity to improve which she seized with solicitude and avidity established for her a solid and firm reputation she is said in cleopatra jane shore and calista and all other parts which require a form of commanding and majestic beauty to have interested her auditors to a degree of astonishment she also greatly excelled in many comic characters but i cannot think it an addition to her fame or to female delicacy that the most prominent of those characters was sir harry wildair resources are a bad specimen of great talents and beauty like charity can hide defects  mrs bellamy according to regularity comes next but this sort of justice puts me out of my way because the art of sinking is not more advantageous to proof than to poetry mrs bellamy though an actress of considerable abilities cannot be ranked with mrs cibber in short in what i have seen though it may perhaps be proper to rely with diffidence on my own opinion yet i have a confirmed criterion in the recollection of those impressions that authors and actors have made upon their auditors for though in particular instances where both are taken up from partiality and prejudice such judgment may have deserved to have been arraigned yet it is impossible upon reflection to mistake those decisions which feeling has excited and conviction confirmed  upon this principle we can say of mrs bellamy that she was natural easy chaste and impressive that as far as person features voice and conception went none of which were by any means of an inferior description she highly pleased and never offended but these commendations respectable as they rank her would be cold and negative applied to mrs cibber or mrs pritchard who commanded attention who seized the passions and modelled them at their will but with all this deduction the public would be at this moment be a good deal astonished to see such an actress as mrs bellamy were mrs siddons out of the question  as i mean to bring into one view toward the end of this work that prodigious assemblage of excellent acting which was at its height some time after garricks return from italy and has from that moment gradually declined which opportunity will give me occasion to exhort the actors of the present day to look up to the few valuable vestiges which remain of that magnificent and ruined fabric i shall close this book after i have said a few words of mrs clive  this performer who fairly opened the book of nature and pointed out every valuable passage to so good effect that no actress in her way has completely succeeded who has not trod in her steps and traced her through all those fanciful paths to which she was conducted by the goddess who delighted in her had certainly most superlative merit we have seen nothing succeed in her various styles of acting but what has been modelled after her she created a sort of school of her own in which mrs green miss pope and their imitators studied nature and effect but this will be hereafter better exemplified when we see her at a time when she had perfected her scholars to which period i shall defer this subject to look after the opera music in general and other points relative to the theater as well as to the conduct of both houses during the theatrical interregnum  end of the ninth book the stage book x from      to the death of garrick chap i state of the opera and music in general as this is the warmest opportunity that can possibly occur to take up the opera and all collateral particulars relative to music i shall certainly avail myself of it which will be the more necessary as it is comletely a novelty no such thing having been done in any publication similar to this  i know it has been the fashion to consider music as a menial and servile attendant of the theater rather than an ally and an auxiliary nothing can be more usual than to read accounts of operas and masks that have been performed with success without even a single hint as to who were the composers of the music but i would beg leave to ask if a piece were to be advertised written by a pen superior could it be to that of shakespeare and acted by the best members of the schools of betterton and garrick whether the audience would not hiss down the curtain if they were deprived of the first music  i look upon this ungrateful contempt of music in authors and managers to have arisen from their want of a taste for it and their total inability to describe it music has never been encouraged but when beard had the management of covent garden theater what i mean to say is judiciously encouraged for lacey as we shall see aped the fashion exactly as a guinea pig apes a squirrel or a clown a tumbler when at any other time have we seen a manager like beard competent to afford the public amusement in this way i have known garrick and more than garrick imposed upon by experiments till it was apparent they did not know one tune from another  what hope or expectation then can the public entertain of receiving that rational that irriproachable delight which the theater is capable of affording us through the medium of music if managers know not what it is and if it is not to be known through the theater much less heaven knows is it to be known through the opera a spectacle where the dance is the plot and the opera the episode an amateur who deplored most pathetically this innovation by which operas are now sunk to nothing was listening to an admirable opera which was so little attended to that the audience wished it over with all its merit this is too bad said he such exquisite music to be so slighted my dear friend said a gentleman the rage for operas is gone by the only chance for success at the opera house now is to lengthen the dances and shorten the petticoats of the dancers  but remarks of this complexion will come better after i have gone through an account of music which during forty years grew into the highest perfection in this country and is now sunk into insignificance as land when it ceaces to be fertilized degenerates into fourness and sterility  as italy as well in the opinion of purcell as of every man who when he speaks of music is competent to judge of it by its effects upon the heart was the school alone in which english music could receive congenial improvement and as germany has ever thrown an impervious gloom over our pleasures which has entangled our reason and misled our senses into error and perplexity which in music in particular has constantly introduced schisms till we have been left nothing of harmony but its discords so it will be particularly my business to watch the progress of this corn that once produced a fair and plentious harvest and the tares which have since completely choked it up  it is impossible for me here to go into the differences of handel and bononcini and the disputes of various kinds that kept up the opera as a subject of perpetual contention for a considerable time and which in proportion as handel turned more to oratorios and the italian interest gained ground of the german materially brought the opera gradually to perfection the progress of music in ilaly had been astonishing and though the great genius and judgment of corelli had in the public opinion conducted it to perfection it was soon afterward seen that music though an imitative art had properties immediately derived from nature which had been but little noticed and when noticed were almost altogether rejected  what i mean to allude to is the distinction between melody and harmony two things that though they assist each other in union are completely different in their nature whereas it is generally understood at this moment that they both mean the same thing i hope i shall be pardoned for going into this because although there is no axiom so clear no position so infallible not one in a thousand appears to comprehend it nay our dictionaries mislead us while the strictures of the most scientific writers though they appear to feel the fact leave the most penetrating understanding in the dark look for melody in any dictionary you will find the explanation to be music harmony of sound look for harmony you will find concord correspondent sentiment and for music you will find the science of harmonical sounds nothing can be so indefinite while nothing can be so clear and simple as the real truth melody means a succession of sounds harmony a combination of sounds and music the art of uniting melody and harmony or rather of assisting melody by the addition of harmony thus music of all studies ought to be the least complex and it is on this account that elaborate treatises have done more injury to the cause of music than to any other study because in other studies causes are frequently remote and hidden and therefore demand enquiry and investigation but in music where every thing is self evident and apparent the fact speaks for itself without the assistance of an advocate or a reasoner and stands confessed a plain a beautiful and an unsophisticated truth this is clearly made out by the manner in which great men have gone into the subject in the treatises that are extant out of which prodigious number i shall instance which will be sufficient for my purpose rameau the most profound perhaps of them all rousseau the most ingenious and dalembert the most simple and faithful to truth rameau with an eye more to scientific reputation than a regard to general and legitimate fame shows the wonderful variety of which founds are capable in terms of calculation so close so connected and so clear that the scholar is astonished to find the endless positions elucidations and conclusions to be proposed agreed upon and established by a correct investigation of such numerous variations of harmony rousseau with more sophistry turns and twists the same propositions in all number of ways and making a polypus of music shows that it may be tortured into a hundred fragments and yet every fragment retain its pristine shape what is the consequence rameau finding his arguments incongruous and crude fondly fancies he shall bind them together by an expedient and before the mind has time to disentangle itself from the rhapsody in which it has been so long ingeniously bewildered but not a single moment convinced he gravely attempts to implore a belief that every difference of opinion ought to be reconciled in the admission that the fundamental bass is exactly newtons center of gravity rousseau is not so fortunate he most indefatigably ransacks invention to prove assertions which he certainly makes out in argument but at length finding that though he has been able to establish nothing for music he has established a great deal for calculation he is reduced to the necessity of confessing that a fugue after all is le mauvais chef daeuvre dun bon musicien as to dalembert the case is not the same he volunteers himself on the subject and finding scientific as he was and minutely acquainted with all the subtilties of argument that music as it had been represented by all those who wrote before him was completely undesinable for the sake of the world he set about studying it what was the consequence he found a prodigious mass of chequered trappings and pie balled ornaments which shrouded eclipsed and suffocated something like a form with infinite labor and pains he stripped off this misshapen and motley annoyance and having cleared away dissonance and discord with those enarmonic and chromatic auxiliaries that had sweated and smothered this poor unfortunate object his ears became gradually attracted by some most delicious sounds which at length he found to proceed from almost exhausted melody that like a dying swan was sweetly singing the dirge to its approaching funeral this treatise which is professedly written to elucidate develope and simplify that of rameau which dalembert will not allow to be a system has nothing for its object but the grand and simple position that music consists of two parts melody and harmony that melody is the gift of inventing sounds in succession which delight the ear that harmony is the art of flattering the ear by the union of several sounds together that melody which has always existed is nature that harmony which is the only decoration of nature and has been invented is art that so far as harmony is pursued for the embellishment of melody it ought to be considered as a friend and a preserver but that the moment this duty is neglected it beomes a foe and a destroyer  composers about    0 began to feel that melody was an animating principle which though it could exist of itself harmony the carcass which it was intended by nature to vivify could not in other words that melody was the song and harmony the accompanyment and in proportion as the judgments of musicians began to be more simplified and the grand and natural effect manifested by the ancients in the other arts considered as subjects of imitation which circumstance was adventitiously forwarded by the sudden appearance of many composers instructed by nature and their feelings the true end and tendency of music were accomplished labored abstruse calculated harmony was rejected and nothing but what served to give appropriate embellishment to melody was retained  the moment this system was fully resolved on it is astonishing how beautifully the bird music sung emancipated from its cage but to keep to plain narrative handel whose great disadvantage added to his ignorance of the english language which was a great impediment to his vocal music was this harmonic mania though he turned and twisted it about pretty well came forward with improved excellence after his trip to italy where he composed the triumph of time and truth in which he has imitated italian basses almost to servility gemeniani appeared the advocate of melody tartini introduced an appropriate union of melody and harmony and instrumental music dared not further intrude than to the modest and becoming bounds prescribed to it by nature  pergolesi that musical wonder who though we know nothing more of his compositions than two comic interludes la serva padrona and it maestro de musica one salva regina and his immortal stabat matter reached perfection and therefore was poisoned at twentytwo galluppi who composed most sweetly because he despised extraneous harmony deliciously agitated every pleasing sentation by his music vinci perez jomelli and a long string of celebrated italians brought this taste to england and confirmed its reputation till from about      to       about this time the german taste began again to prevail and though bach and abel but particularly abel still adhered to the perfect style in which harmony had no triumph over melody yet the manner began by piccini of loading air with accompanyment which was ingenious enough in him but followed awkwardly and bungingly by others shook that reputation which truth and nature had established and in spite of the meritorious efforts of vento and a few others the ear began to be stunned instead of delighted and music that had so lately roused the affections and soothed the soul was considered as destitute of merit unless it could describe the confusion of a battle or the violence of a hurricane  the opera having thus been considered as the criterion and regulator as to music in this country not very properly indeed since music ought not to be submitted to any criterion or regulator but the heart and its feelings the prevalent taste of the opera became the prevalent taste of the nation and thus operas which had certainly been a national benefit became more and more a national injury till the theaters following this retrogade motion not step by step but halt by halt sidled off gradually and left the throne of music to be usurped by the demon of discord  as i have attributed this false taste to the prevalence of german music it is but fitting that i honestly make out my position i have shown in how many periods of the history of music in this country this innovation was to be dreaded we have in consequence of the researches of the orinal printers of music in the sixteenth century proved that documents were found which plainly show that the style of musical study would be nature in the italians and art in the germans we have seen aron ramis and agricola lost in the labyrinth of harmony to which by their own confession they knew not how to find a clue and yet these men agricola in particular wrote lessons for young beginners were not therefore the inextricable barbarities of the germans then exactly what they are now  what did zarlino and his followers the cotemporaries of those germans did they lose nature to perplex themselves and the world with art no they traced music to its origin and not only felt but demonstrated that music is not derived from construction and calculation but from nature and simplicity my premises then are clearly made out by that most infallible of all proofs the evidence of long experience and as the stage upon the same principal is now adopting every thing monstrous and unnatural it becomes a question whether in our insatiable thirst after novelty we may not one day or other take it into our heads to discard art and adopt nature  but not to lose sight at present of music it will be fairly asked me whether there is no such thing as melody in the compositions of the germans it would be very hard indeed if in such an immense wilderness there should not be a few flowers but luxuriance was never yet a symptom of strength or maturity and this is the very thing i complain of for were the germans barren of genius their impositions would be detected whereas by scattering here and there a few traits of fancy a study of their works is something like what the poets describe of the road to the temple of pleasure which is flowery and deceitful and which beguiles our time with idle trifling till the night of disappointment overtakes us and we view the promised goal through the medium of delusion and presently lose it in the shades of obscurity  melodies however these germans have but by introducing them by fits and starts their music has no character except indeed the sort of character that a masque has compared to a face which serves to disguise it by the substitution of deformity i will not allow a work of genius to be complete in all its parts unless like a perfect poem its drift be premised followed up and concluded and upon this ground the stoutest stickler for the present fashionaable music has not a single argument to stand upon  i cannot more clearly give an idea of these redundant compositions and their opposites than by supposing two orators one shall be a man of natural eloquence who supports his arguments in simple and perspicuous language who borrows no ornament but from reason nor courts assistance but from truth the other shall deal in metaphor allegory and allusion he shall wrap up the plainest axiom in figure logic and system in soaring to sublimity he shall fall into quaintness and in striving to transcend he shall sink to nothing  what must be the different effect on their hearers one shall delight and convince the other dazzle and mislead one shall win from attention the willing tribute of praise the other wrest from astonishment a mixture of admiration and pity  every thing the ear acknowledges as music is song poetry is originally supposed to have been sung italy therefore must be considered as the first musical school vocal music having been ever in greater repute there than in any other part of the world and on that account the italians are less apt than other composers to go into any thing extraneous for vocal music is in its nature regular this is not the case with the germans whose study being almost wholly instrumental music they traverse the wide field of modulation and quarter it as regularly as a pointer in the stuble or rather like a citizen on a sunday who walks out till he is tired forgetting that he has to come home again  this then i conceive to be the cause of that perversion of taste in this country which has unhappily obtained and in particular as to music our national characteristic being warm benevolence and broad liberality which too frequently encourages when it ought to discriminate  chap ii the theater during the interregnum and immediately on garricks return when the finishing stroke which was no less than indifference and neglect had been given to garricks determination of traveling for two years that the public which was infalliable might feel their loss both beard and lacey felt bold at the circumstance beard from a consciousness that having established opera upon a firm and solid basis he should exclusively possess the favor of the town and lacey from a contempt he had ever entertained of garricks judgment as a manager and a firm belief that through his fancied superiority he should both eclipse covent garden and lower his partner in the opinion of the public  both these effects garrick had foreseen and had very early anticipated the consequence of them he saw the certain operation of all that could possibly be brought forward to supply the place of his exertions he saw supported as it was by a national taste that music would naturally make a considerable head against him but he saw that lacey would court the assistance of this auxiliary to the temporary disadvantage of the theater and that even beard would not be able to find a sufficient stock of materials to compensate for the loss of tragedy and comedy  his penetration was equally keen in respect to writing and acting which he knew must in his absence come to what the sportsmen call a complete stand still as to the veteran writers they so uniquivocally adopted this sentiment that they patiently waited his return and for the novices their certain ruin must have been the consequence of venturing any thing material in his absence both these effects were in a remarkable manner produced colman whose reputation had received complete confirmation by the assistance of garrick in the jealous wife had the good sense to venture at no production of a first rate kind till his coadjutor returned and powel whom nature had endowed with many of the best requisites of an actor by having the reins thrown over his neck soon lost sight of the admirable lessons he had received from garrick who had been his most able preceptor and was bewildered out of that little native judgment he he possessed by folly vanity and indiscriminate applause  all this which garrick had foreseen literally happened arne was the only composer of real eminence known to the theater at that time for boyce had retired to the church michael arnes music was always passable but never excellent rush had just arrived from italy and knew the taste of that country but wanted the judgment to adopt that taste to english ears or rather to english hearts bates had bluster and bustle and could compose songs as fast as a blacksmith can make hobnails all of the same size and quality and as to the rest they were still inferior pretenders  it is true that there were plenty of compilers who furnished the theaters with lumping pennyworths and this mode sometimes as in the case of love in a village and the maid of the mill was adopted with success but never unless superintended with judgment and assisted by the original composition of some excellent musician love in a village though benefitted by very beautiful music by galuppi giardini and others received twothirds of its value from arne and the maid of the mill being though better assisted by italians rather a grand than interesting selection  all this however was neither seen nor felt by lacey who being accustomed to hear god save the king roast beef and rule britannia knew there were such tunes but could scarcely distinguish one of them from another fancied that three composers must naturally conquer one and therefore set rush bates and michael arne to work and presently in opposition to artaxerxes came out the royal shepherd pharnaces and almena  in the mean time garrick received very dismal accounts from victor the treasurer of the immense sums squandered away to decorate serious operas on the one side of the account and on the other a beggarly account of empty boxes of which though it was the very effect he anticipated he bitterly complained while he privately hugged himself for his own sagacity well knowing that the tendency of this temporary loss would be future same and permanent profit  garrick now began to feel a consequence he had never known till that moment and excellent as his worldly acting had always been he was astonished at his own power of attracting such universal applause he was wished for and expected with the most anxious curiosity at home while the accounts we received of him from abroad some of which by the bye by way of whetting public impatience even went to insituate that he meant to pass the remainder of his life in italy were the honorable and flattering reception he every where met with the invitations he continually received from princes and ambassadors which another stroke of acting he rejected to sort with men of professional eminence and in short the great and distinguished attention he daily experienced such as never had been paid to any other individual  nor was this all he found the success of dramatic writers as indifferent as his most sanguine hopes would possibly have suggested he found that in proportion as powel got shakespeare in his head he lost him in his heart he found that his partner having begun to give up operas as a bad thing had by way of retrieving his declining fortune conceived an expectation of finding coals in oxfordshire from which circumstance he knew he should get as much of the theatrical property into his own hands as he thought proper he found in short that the musical mania began to be on the decline nay he found johnny beard deaf and dr arne damned and yet can it be credited such was the strange crooked policy and singular vanity of this extraordinary man  he wrote the sick monkey  it was well for garrick that the public despised this contemptible production under an idea that it was written by an insidious enemy otherwise it must have operated heavily against him but the tide was in his favor and nothing could stop it the town knew no other topic presents awaited him and every trifling circumstance relative to him in ever so remote a degree was a subject of general conversation in short no object of the greatest national importance could engross more attention the royal family graced his first appearance while he as contentedly swallowed all this adulation as an alderman does the green fat of a turtle still keeping up those outward signs of diffidence and apparent selfdenial which he ever put on by choosing much ado about nothing for his first appearance that it might signify how much the goodness of the public surpassed his desert what a wonderful union of merit and modesty no bishop ever repeated noli episcopari more devoutly garrick prepared an address to the audience which he deivered previous to the play he first appeared in when he came upon the stage he was welcomed with three loud plaudits each finishing with a huzza as soon as this unprecedented applause had a little subsided he used every art of which he was so completely master to lull the tumult into a profound silence  and just as all was hushed as death and anxious expectation sat on every face old cervetto who was better known by the name of nosey anticipated the very first line of the address by  aw  a tremendous yawn a convulsion of laughter ensued and it was some minutes before the wishedfor silence could be again restored that however obtained  garrick delivered his address in that happy irresistible manner in which he was always sure to captivate his audience and retired with applause such as was never better given nor better deserved but the matter did not rest here  the moment he came off the stage he flew like lightning to the music room where collaring astonished nosey he began to abuse him pretty vociferously wha  why  you old scoundrel  you must be the most infernal  at length poor cerverto  oh mr garrick vat is the matter  vat i haf do  oh god vat it is  the matter why you old damned eternal senseless idiot  with no more brains than your damned bass viol  just at the  a  very moment i had played with the audience  tickled them like a trout and brought them to the most accommodating silence  so pat to my purpose  so perfect  that it was as one may say a companion for miltons visible darkness  indeed mr garrick it vas no darkness darkness stupid fool  but how should a man of my reading make himself understood by  a  answer me was not the whole house pit box and gallery very still yes sir indeed  still as mouse well then just at that very moment did you not with your damned jaws extended wide enough to swallow a sixpenny loaf  yaw  oh i wish you had never shut your damned jaws again sare mr garrick  only if you please hear me von void it is alvay the vay  it is indeed mr garrick  alvay the vay i go when i has the greatest rapture mr garrick the little great mans anger instantly cooled the cunning readiness of this italian flattery operated exactly contrary to the last line of an epigram  the honey was tasted and the sting forgot  and it not only procured noseys pardon but forced a declaration from his patron that he ought to be forgiven for the wit of the offense   he certainly however deserved every attention that could possibly be paid to him his absence had shown that without him the theater could exist but not live and on that return which for the remainder of his management ensured the stage a large flow of health and vigor no wonder he became more than ever the theme of universal admiration  having now turned to as the sailors call it and gone in earnest to work materials of course flocked in upon him from every quarter and he even began to have a better choice of new goods than he had been in possession of since he had become manager lacey in this business played off a stroke of policy which his partner with all his wariness had not foreseen as soon as he had given the matter breathing time garrick represented to lacey the prodigious success he had met with and that the public would not be satisfied unless they saw him twice a week at least well and what then said lacey hey what then why then what do you mean to allow me for the advantages the concern will reap in addition to those derived from my return to the management by my acting why said lacey i have been thinking of this david and i will not allow a halfpenny play and gratify your vanity or let it alone and let the theater take its chance if you play we shall have broken legs and arms and cries of murder to amuse us two evenings in the week and on the other four evenings there will be nobody in the house if the common business goes on the receipts will be less but they will be regular and the average every saturday will be pretty nearly the same garrick totally unprepared for this thrust did however all in his power to parry it but lacey remained inflexible and if garricks assertions are to be credited he never had any stated emolument with these advantages seconded by the exertions of his company who were glad enough to welcome his return that something like regularity might be restored he set himself busily forward and saw each department conducted with every possible propriety and decorum instead of the indecency profligacy and debauchery that had been known at different periods to characterize the green rooms the dressing rooms and the avenues of the playhouse the manners of the actors and the actresses were unoffending polite and elegant and nothing appeared in the conduct of the theater but might have graced a drawing room it is but justice also to say that during beards management of covent garden every possible attention was paid to propriety and decorum  chap iii garrick as an author resumed as an examination of the merits of authors and actors will naturally bring out all that will be necessary now to relate concerning the stage and my limits are verging toward a close i shall go on with authors and such collateral particulars as are involved in a description of their works  the first dramatic undertaking garrick engaged in after his return was the production of a play in conjunction with colman who had given strong proof both of genius and judgment in the jealous wife he had given also proof of deference modesty and good sense in permitting garrick to teach him his trade for it proved in the event that colman was never so good a dramatic writer as while he had garrick at his elbow  garricks share of this play the clandestine marriage was lord ogleby and the courtly family colmans sterling and the city family and it is astonishing how the two men appear in their separate tasks colman has chastely and accurately delineated character garrick has added to strong character strong situation and to add to this consummate knowledge of stage effect how admirably well it was got up  it is really honorable to letters and to the nation that the theater could be capable of furnishing so rational a treat so greatly perfect and excellent in all its parts so unaffectedly attractive as this play which though garrick only superintended it was acted to perfection i dont make this remark as a singularity for many pieces at that time deserved this praise i only mean to prove that when we consider the incomparable acting of king which like a single jewel rescued from the plunder of time is now preserved to us with equal brilliancy his mixture of gout folly pleasantry philanthropy debility and dignity put on with such fancy and worn with such elegance   when we reflect on that astonishing creature mrs clive who if she herself had written the part as the portait of a real character and not content with this had infused herself into this real character could not have been more in nature  when we go on and speak of the chaste propriety and sound good sense of yates the pert vulgar consequence so naturally and characteristically assumed by miss pope the accommodating servility of baddeley than whom nobody ever performed that particular foreigner a swiss so well as garrick perfectly knew the easy familiar impertinence of palmer not the late palmer but his predecessor  when we add to all this that the play was strengthened by holland in melville and powel in lovewell that mrs abington performed one of the chambermaids and that the inferior parts even to the counselors witness the admirable performance of love in sergeant flower were supported most ably i cannot resist a belief that the stage at any time whatever could not have been in a state of higher perfection as to acting for the merits of every performer i have mentioned were of such superior excellence that the parts be what they might could not degrade them and the public accorded their applause to holland and powel as much for the good sense and condescension in accepting parts below their usual standard as for the intrinsic merit they displayed under such disadvantages and it heightened their opinion of mrs abington in whom they plainly saw under the ease of betty the chambermaid that merit which afterward perfected into the elegance grace and fashion of lady betty modish  the country girl which was performed in      was a judicious altercation of wycherleys country wife as it is now frequently performed and the public have had many recent opportunities of judging of its merits i shall only say that every thing has not yet been done which might have been to the advantage of that subject neck or nothing almost a literal translation of le sages crispin rival de son maitre deceived garrick when he read it in the french as it would have done any person for it there seems to be the very sort of farce to please on the english stage the event however did not justify the experiment though it was admirably performed  cymon a piece written to display those scenic effects which garrick had witnessed in france and italy was in itself a weak production but it was neither without interest nor pleasantry there was always a want of consequence in those first pieces which were the sole production of garrick his pen was not equal to more than a farce the performance however was powerfully sustained and among other material advantages michael arne by copying the manner of his father and thinking of boyce as he composed produced a number of sweet airs particularly those so deliciously sung by his wife  a peep behind the curtain came out in      with good success garrick who always knew consequences felt that the old vehicle of dramatic strictures and mock rehearsals had been generally received with a sort of jealousy and revolt he therefore bespoke the favor of the town in a most artful manner king spoke the prologue in which there was this line i thomas king of king street am the poet the fact is this admirable performer was the bays of the piece but this equivocal assertion which ninetenths of the audience took literally gave a warmth to the applause which was of infinite assistance to the first nights reception garrick had practiced something like this with success before cymon came out after the public had been deprived of kings exertions for some weeks in consequence of his having broken his thigh they were glad enough naturally to hail the return of their favorite which garrick took the advantage of by making king in the prologue thus bespeak the public favor in favor of himself i believe the last line was for i quote from memory scarce well of one spare me a second tumble  it was a fair satire indeed rather an admonition than a castagation it hit but it did not wound besides which there are some things in it irresistably comic particularly the circumstance of making the old man dance against his will this piece was incomparably performed and the music which was composed by bartheleman and which had a mixed character of italian french and english produced a degree of novelty which gave it good effect  the jubilee as the jubilee was a memorable epoch in the reign of garrick it would be unpardonable to speak of it without noticing some of those curious circumstances that attended so extraordinary a business nothing can be more evident than that shakespeare might have laid very quietly in stratford church nobody would have disturbed his ashes had not such a popular measure been the probable means of insuring a plentiful harvest to drury lane on the following season and yet it was managed with so much caution so much wariness that according to the representation of the matter to every body who was concerned in it there did not appear any such thing in agitatton this cautiousness answered two purposes  it not only drew many to stratford who would otherwise have suspended their curiosity till they should have seen it in london but it served as a feasible excuse for requesting every bodys trouble and attendance for nothing in short garrick in relation to the jubilee maneuvered every where and with every body he procured abuse to be inserted in the papers which he got all his friends to answer he enlisted a prodigious number of volunteers whose exertions he pretty liberally exacted at their expense and at length performed the same entertainment ninetyfive times in one season at drury lane which he sent people an hundred miles not to see indeed it was impossible it should be seen for had the pageant been attempted at stratford the streets were so uneven that the cars of melpomeme thalia and the fairies would have been overthrown into chasms in the pavement besides the leather tinsel and spangled trappings would have cut a lamentable figure by daylight it is true they heard garrick an advantage worth ten times the money repeat so exquisitely his ode which poem foot pronounced excellent when he heard it and execrable when he read it and they heard arnes exquisite music to that ode and to say the truth the dinners and all the circumstances relative to them were pleasurable if we indeed except the fireworks the horserace and the masquerade the last in particular was inconvenient and distressing beyond description for the booth being built on a swamp close to the river and nobody having considered that sometimes in the month of september it rains the company had scarcely assembled when the wet began to ooze through the crevices in five minutes after they were paddling in the wet five minutes after that it was over their shoes and presently they were obliged to take to the benches then to the orchestra and then to the windows  thus there was not a creature out of about four hundred people that escaped being wet through a spectacle in which were introduced characters in shakespeares plays was performed as every body knows more than half the season of      and    0 a circumstance certainly unprecedented in the annals of the theater king arthur was brought forward in      and assisted by scenery and most judiciously improved as to the music by arne who greatly to his honor though according to garricks plan he was obliged to introduce some music of his own so far from mutilating purcell rescued those beauties from oblivion which time and ignorance had before obscured arne idolized purcell and it was his pride in this particular instance to place him in that conspicuous situation the brilliancy of his reputation demanded garricks view in bringing out this piece was to perform the same duty by dryden  hamlet was in the same season with great diffidence altered by garrick in compliance with the judgment of a host of critics who have so often suggested a necessity of getting rid of ostric the grave diggers and as much as possible of the lighter parts of the play the critics however on the other side of the question began to consider him like bottom the weaver who wishes to play all the piece after a very few nights it was withdrawn the institution of the garter was brought out in honor of that ceremony at windsor garrick used wests materials and added a fool and some other comic characters it was performed twentysix nights a run at least equal to its merits  the irish widow performed in      grew popular through the exertions of mrs barry to whom garrick most pompously dedicated it it is extraordinary that he who better than any man knew it to be bad policy should be so fond of deprecation the chances in which garrick performed don john so incomparably and in which performance he was so ably assisted by mrs abington then in the zenith of her reputation was produced in      and is only beaumont and fletchers play with appropriate alterations albumazor was performed the same year it was an alteration of the old play as i have before stated it had no success alfred came out the beginning of the following season it had great support but little success the music was confided to the care of theodore smith who had better have let arne alone since he had not the ability to treat him as arne had treated purcell in arthur  a christmas tale appeared in      the subject was la fee urgelle of favart which beaumont and fletcher had treated under the title of woman pleased but which had a much more ancient date this piece was full of magic and intended like cymon to give advantage to scenery and decoration a circumstance which garrick had adopted with great caution after the chinese festival till his return from italy though i would not place this spectacle under the head of dramatic pieces it will not be improper to say a word or two concerning it the chinese festival was a grand ballet indeed nothing more than has been always considered as admissible at the opera and indeed at the theater except in that one instance produced by noverre the vestris of that day it took eighteen months in its preparation and was expected to eclipse every thing that had been seen of its kind but unluckily we had just declared war against france and popular prejudice prevailing the spectacle was damned without mercy the theater was mutilated and an attempt made to pull garricks house down did this spirit prevail rationally it might do service but why one spectacle of this nature should be interdicted to the toleration of so many others is an instance of supererogate criticism a kind of intruding justice that can spring from nothing but absurd and unfair prejudice foot ridicules this very well in the minor where he makes shift say speaking of his situation as a candlesnuffer that he acquired intrepidity but says he an unlucky crab apple applied to my right eye by a patriot gingerbread baker from the borough who would not suffer three dancers from switzerland because he hated the french forced me to a precipitate retreat i have often lamented that the beauties of real classical writers are seldom tasted by the erudite foot who often really meant more than met either the eye or the ear had in this speech an idea of military gasconades the ball that struck the french general crequi was said to have had a label with the words a crequi this says the french author who relates the circumstance is like the arrow that deprived philip of macedon of his eye which was addressed  a loeil gauche de philip nothing can be better burlesque than this louterbourg was at that time first known in this country who wanted completely with great propriety to alter the system of scenery which always had prevailed and indeed it does in a great measure yet prevail but garrick finding the new system very expensive would not adopt the whole of it and therefore though scenes were improved the evil has not to this day been completely cured this piece has been most unmercifully handled and heaven knows it was poor enough but where spectacle only calls in assistance from the relative acts if the piece be of that character that admits it there certainly is not so much injury done to the public as by the exhibition of finery monsters and gewgaws i dont care how much the dramatist employs the painter my quarrel to him is when the taste of the town is to be regulated by the property man  bon ton which is high life below stairs reversed is a farce of considerable merit it was performed in      may day was a mere trifle it had very little success there were two or three preludes written by garrick and prologues and epilogues out of all number and reckoning which though they cannot be quoted for excellent poetry were nevertheless full of excellent point  chap iv foot and murphy resumed i shall now return to those authors an account of whose works remains to be completed we left off foot at the mayor of garratt his next piece was the patron brought out in      the subject is from marmontel which colman had an idea of treating but was forestalled by foot this comedy had pretensions to more favor than it received perhaps its cool reception was owing to its want of that personality which he had taught the town to grow pleased with it is true the principal character was intended for a nobleman whose follies were known to the literati but the public at large were strangers to them  the commissary the next piece of this writer performed in      was of another complexion here was character and personality enough this comedy though it must be confessed the best writers of that day held it in contempt the town greatly approved it is more a melange and a patch work play than almost any thing upon the english stage the commissary is le bourgeouis gentilhomme of moliere from which author many other parts and particularly the orator who in the original which is better than in foot after he is locked out of the door harangues from the window is also taken  this is not all the whole of the plot which relates to mrs mechlin is still a stronger plagiary for it is rendered almost word for word from la femme dintrigue and bits and scraps from other pieces of dancourt nay the old widow who wants a young husband is not omitted nor even the musicmaster nor the circumstance of sending the child home in a bass viol what i particularly allude to is the character of dr catout which was levelled at arne who had peculiarities and what man who ever lived has been without them but perhaps upon earth never breathed a being of more honorable principles i should be the most ungrateful wretch that ever existed even though it may perhaps be deemed intrusion if i did not force this truth upon the reader arne rescued my musical fame and character and established both when his fiat might have crushed me and all this with scarcely a personal knowledge of me i have known him the warm and liberal friend of others he had no radical fault in the world but his mind was weak and he was perpetually imposed upon and is this a reason why a man who has left behind him a most splendid professional reputation is to be publicly exposed at the moment he was getting his bread by the public mimickry is at best a poor act but it becomes infamy when it attempts to wound the peace of individuals it cannot be denied however that there is much pleasantry in the piece but still that wanton personality that pervades it devotes it to execration in all honest minds  the devil upon two sticks which was produced in      contained a good deal of general and a good deal of personal satire for the vehicle its author had as every body knows to thank le sage and for many parts of the piece he had obligations to moliere the controversy between the fellows and the licentiates of warwick lane was fair game and dr last which it is said was actually a living character and which was so wonderfully performed by wiston is that sort of personality which may be tolerated because the object was obscure and the drift was general admonition for the cure of folly other objects however had better have been left alone knavery will never be corrected by the exposition of one notorious knave except by law nor will intrigues of a court wear a new face by informing an audience rather indecently by the bye that a commoner has been disgraced by accepting a coronet foot has now and then felt this severely the taking one lord for another in this piece had very nearly damned it   the lame lover was performed in    0 it had a good deal of the sort of merit which characterized this authors pieces that is to say asperity and good writing but the string may be wound up till it cracks health and property are objects of great solicitude in this and every other country but this does not prove that there is no fair game for the stage but physicians and lawyers the maid of bath acted in      ought to have been hissed off the stage not as a dramatic production for it is one of the pleasantest pieces by this writer but because it was an unwarrantable and scandalous attack on a family who were the more likely to feel the injury by being in a public situation it is certainly best when it can be practicable to treat unprincipled malignity like this with contempt but the world in such cases should be the arbitrator and do justice to individuals that this sentiment was felt the first nights reception of this piece evinced indeed footes pieces were generally very nearly damned the first night though they grew afterward into fame the fact is what is every bodys business is nobodys business and thus harmless and unoffending characters are held up to derision to fill the pockets of profligate satirists  the nabob performed in      is a play strongly written and boldly drawn and upon a subject had it been generally treated which might have come within the province of the stage but the theater is no court of enquiry and it was extremely indecent to judge a cause before an audience which was at that moment agitating in the senate it was unhandsome and unjust to excite a general odium against a body by the exposition of a single character but these were the means by which this satirist is said to have caught the living manners which assertion is false he never caught the living manners at all he only caught the peculiarities of a few living individuals  piety in pattens was produced in february      to eke out a spectacle which foot had long promised the town under the title of the primitive puppet show and in which he pronounced an exordium celebrated at that time as the achme of eloquence genius and erudition but afterward found to be a mixture of historical narrative abuse against the other theaters and a promise of excellence at his own that never was kept for to use the words of an irishman upon the occasion the entertainment was all exordium any other author would have had his theater pulled down for this imposition the bankrupt had for its drift the exposition of those nefarious members of society who manufacture artificial failures and systematically evade the bankruptcy laws it also went into the arcana of doing newspapers both which objects were clearly fair game it was successful and except in a few trifling particulars deservedly so  the cozeners which play we find again a good deal from dancourt and in which also we are perpetually put in mind of face subtle and doll common in the alchymist was one of footes boldest pieces if lord chesterfield and his graces had been laudably attacked there could not have been found a fairer object of satire because it was not a reprobation of the man otherwise than as it concerned a foul and poisonous system that he had disseminated but merely to bring on a clown and put him perpetually in mind of the graces was leaving the improper tendency of the publication where he found it mrs simony was an unwarrantable attack strike at the vice with all my heart but let the individual receive his punishment from the hand of justice it is not for the stage to supercede the practice of the courts and if the laws have determined the necessity of establishing sober solemn enquiry into the perpetration of crimes and if after all the innocent have sometimes suffered for the guilty shall the characters of men lie at the mercy of a prowling satirist and their fame be destroyed by the dash of a pen no man can defend the measure for it is not only a libel on the man but on the government by which he is protected  the capuchin performed in      is an aggravation of all this authors former temerity for to shameless impudence it added despicable cowardice to attack and expose to public ridicule a woman it was too contemptible but foot seems to have studied his own safety through the whole of his conduct having chosen characters either so independent that he excited only their contempt or so insignificant as to be sheltered by kindred pusilanimity and this grew on him for in the cozeners be was protected by dr dodds gown and in the capuchin by the duchess of kingstons petticoat  thus have i with some pain because the merit of foot was equal to any undertaking had he pursued the right road examined the dramatic works of this author which i have conceived it my duty to hold out as a beacon to warn others of those rocks foot split upon in his attempts to emulate aristophanes whose moral character has been devoted to execration and contempt and introduce that vicious and licentious perversions of broad truth and universal morality on the english stage which even the wonderful genius of menander was unable to recover and by which the grecian stage degenerated more and more till at length it was lost in the wreck of the grecian empire  we now return to murphy who produced at covent garden in      on the same evening a comedy called no ones enemy but his own and a farce under the title of what we must all come to two misnomers a man who is an enemy to morality and the exercise of it in all mankind cannot be said to be no ones enemy but his own nor are fighting and squabbling for trifles what necessarily we must all come to in marriage during the honeymoon the last piece was the best and perhaps was damned for being in bad company it has however given repeated pleasure since under the title of three weeks after marriage the choice was a farce hurried up for the benefit of mrs yates  the school for guardians a comedy performed at covent garden in      was taken from three of molieres plays the materials were good in their kind but they made up a strange incongruous mass when mixed together the play was performed but six nights  zenobia was a tragedy which had great success the opportunity murphy had at that time of wriing for the barrys was of great consequence to his reputation and theirs it cannot be denied that the fault of pompous language pervades this as well as the rest of this authors tragedies but strong effect by no means strange or unnatural was eminently their characteristic  murphys next piece was the grecian daughter on which a variety of opinions have been ventured it has been an acted pantomime virtue outraged and a great deal more but no observation has been able to controvert one plain fact which is that it has been long a favorite of the public that the grand incident on which the plot hinges is simple and natural and begets a most extraordinary degree of interest  the subject is the old story of the roman matron and the author is candid enough to confess that he in some degree availed himself of the zelmire of belloy i have heard and i believe my authority is pretty good that the rst idea of writing this play was suggested by a picture wh he author accidentally noticed as he was waiting in the room of a  in this picture the sentinel as he witnessed the interesting scene of the daughter suckling her parent bursts into tears he might perhaps have gone further and traced the subject to metastasio from whom belloy took his play belloy was called the dramatic thief he was howev a avourite of voltaire who answered when he eard  pilsering from him  ah le cher voleur il ma bien embelle   alzuma      had the fault of the school for guardians it was a mixture of three french tragedies as that had been of three french comedies consequently the author endeavored to reconcile those jarring interests without effect it was just permitted on the stage where it lingered nine nights and then expired  know your own mind performed in      is a comedy of considerable merit it had a long run during the season in which it was produced and has been repeated frequently with good effect with this comedy i finish my account of murphys dramatic productions an author who studied stage effect very happily and whose writings whether in tragedy comedy or farce never outraged nature nor wounded morality  chap v hawkesworth hume franklin bickerstaff hiffernan arne kenrick gentleman reed and love as those authors who wrote principally after      and but little before that period had better for the sake of a general review of their productions come in this place i shall bring them now under a regular review  one of these was hawkesworth celebrated for several works of great ingenuity for the stage he altered amphytrion from dryden at the desire of garrick but introduced very little of his own the principal part of what he supplied being from moliere it did very little  oroonoko was altered from southern by hawkesworth by leaving out the whole of the comic scenes a vacuum that required much more than he has supplied admirable as his writing is though not equal to southerns to fill it the interest was beautifully kept alive in the original by the relief bad as it was the author had given it the planters were in nature and material to the plot though it must be confessed they were gross it was difficult to protract the principal story and however meritorious the attempt so both hawkesworth and the public felt it edgar and emmeline was an elegant piece but changing of sexes has always something in it preposterous and revolting unless contrived for some comic purpose  when we talk of hume we always add the author of douglas a play that ever was and ever will be ranked among those of first rate merit though it must be confessed it is the less interesting because of its resemblance in the catastrophe to many other things the language is however beautifully poetic gray calls it the true language of the stage and adds that though it has infinite faults the scene between matilda and the old peasant is so masterly that it strikes him blind to all the defects in the world  agis was finely acted and assisted by spectacle otherwise it is probable it would not have been performed a second night gray who loved hume as a writer says of this play i cry to think that it be by the author of douglas why it is all modern greek the story is an antique statue painted white and red frized and dressed in a negligee made by a yokshire mantua maker the siege of aquileia performed in      had success and as to the writing it certainly is in many places very fine but for a siege it is a tame business and so far from being a resemblance to the memorable circumstance it ought to describe it is actually the description of the siege of berwick in the reign of henry the third  the fatal discovery was performed in      hume had certainly by this time greatly fallen off as a writer this tragedy was reluctantly permitted during nine nights and so was alonzo which play through mrs barrys admirable acting deceived the audience on the first night into a high opinion of its merit hume says in his preface that she received applause greater than ever shook a theater alfred the last production of this author lived only three nights in short douglas is equal in value to all the rest of humes works  franklin a voluminous writer and translator but who like many other men of literary consequence is supposed to have lent his name to booksellers than which nothing can be more reprehensible for it is actually literary swindling is said to have translated the works of sophocles and voltaire and to have either written or translated the following plays  the earl of warwick performed in      was little more than a direct translation of le comte de warwick of la harp mrs yates performed margeret of anjou incomparably orestes produced in      from voltaire was performed for mrs yatess benefit electra from voltaires play which he stole from hamlet after having abused shakespeare was performed in      but it had very little success matilda was little more than a translation of voltaires duc de foix the contract a comedy brought out at the haymarket and damned in the presence of the king and the royal family the only time perhaps they ever partook of such an amusement is stolen from le triple marriage of destouches it is a very curious circumstance that the same incident that damned the play in england had very nearly procured for it the same fate in france and yet certainly it is truly comic and very natural the father the son and the daughter are married unknown to one another and are therefore embarrassed at making known the secret but when they find that they are all in the same predicament a general amnesty is passed upon this the youngest daughter a little girl of twelve years old tells her father that she has her secret to impart too hey cries the father why zounds you are not married secretly are you no says she papa but i beg you will let me be married as soon as possible foot said that when he lighted the king to his chair his majesty asked who the piece was written by it is written replied the wit by one of your majestys chaplains but it is dull enough to have been written by a bishop   bickerstaff produced the following dramatic pieces thomas and sally the principal merit of which piece was arnes charming music some of the poetry is neat and lyric for this author knew the art of writing for music but whatever there is technical in it is completely false i heard a sailor say when he heard the expression tack about and bear away why that is go out of the door and go up the chimney  love in a village      which had a run almost equal to the beggars opera is made up as we have seen of several things even to the stealing of charles johnsons songs which were before stolen one of these my dolly was the fairest thing from randolph the circumstances are nevertheless interesting and entertaining and the poetry is well calculated to assist musical expression but nothing can be more puerile than the dialogue the music is a beautiful selection and those songs composed by arne are delightful  the maid of the mill      is much better written than love in a village the first act is perhaps as perfect as any thing on the stage it however anticipates the denouement and every thing afterward declines the fault of this author was that he was bigoted to italian music and french dialogue and therefore the music in this opera is fine and the dialogue dull ralph and fanny are the best characters in the piece but they are only an improvement on hodge and madge  daphne and amintor      was st foixs loracle interspersed with songs to bring forward the wonderful singing of mrs arne gallupppis music was delightful and chalons the compiler composed a good overture and a pleasing duett the plain dealer was judiciously enough altered from wycherley it was greatly performed love in the city      which piece has been since cut down to the romp was hissed through six nights and then withdrawn shuter who would not allow this author to be more than a good cook said when he came off the stage on the fifth night it was all up with the piece brandy would not save it  lionel and clarissa had considerable merit but in this piece there were too many cooks and when it came to be altered under the title of a school for fathers it did no better this author measured his scenes as an engraver squares a picture and thus though correct by being always regular they were always cold the prepetually going off with a song and teaching the audience in imitation of the opera when to expect a bravura song a comic song a cavatina a duett a quartetto and a finale began to grow intolerable tiresome besides sentiment at this time was only for comedy and just as that author had complained that the clandestine marriage has anticipated love in the city though he himself had stolen the hint so he now complained that false delicacy had anticipated lionel and clarissa  the absent man performed in      was only bruyeres story which was copied into the spectator put into dialogue it was too imzy to do any thing material the padlock was performed at drury lane in      as every body knows with very great success this authors pen never held out to the end there is a great disproportion between the first act and the second it was however well managed the plot is from cervantes nothing could exceed the sweetness of mrs arnes singing and bannister as a manly chaste and natural singer gave a specimen of abilities that had perhaps never before been heard  the hyprocrite which was altered from cibbers nonjuror with an additional character for weston had success mrs abingtons acting was a rich display of fashion and elegance as well as feeling and nature the ephesian matron was performed at ranelagh where it was considered as vulgar to listen to music and therefore the real effect of this piece was never known dr last in his chariot was a bad sequel to a good piece it was taken from molieres malade imagenaire foot wrote a complete scene indeed the best in the piece the captive which was taken from drydens don sebastian had no success  it is well it is no worse a comedy which has since been cut down to a farce under the title of the panel was nearly damned on the first night it was taken from caldrone the plot was extremely intricate and betrayed a great want of knowledge in this author of tying and untying a dramatic knot king and mrs abington were incomparable in the valet and the maid the recruiting sergeant was performed successfully at drury lane after being repeated without attention for two seasons at ranelagh he would if he could was la serva padronas it was performed but once  hiffernan a character in the style of smart and holt who on account of his want of prudence and principle every body shunned wrote an afterpiece called the ladies choice which had no success the wishes of a free people was a handsome compliment though by the bye it is most miserably written to the queen on her arrival in this country it is dedicated to her majesty in french it contained a charge on managers for not bringing out meritorious productions which charge the want of merit in the piece itself completely refuted  the new hippocrites which is intended to ridicule the absurd practice of pinning implicit faith on the judgment of empiricks was performed only two nights it was a miserable business the earl of warwick was a translation from la harp but not so good as franklins these and a poor farce called the philosophic whim make up all the pieces of this curious character  arne to whose incomparable musical talents it will be my pride to pay every tribute of praise and admiration ventured incautiously though in one instance not unwisely to write for the stage i allude to artaxerxes there was no translation of this piece except the literal one which was used for english readers at the opera house where it had been performed with the music of hasse  with this translation for want of a better and so much knowledge of italian as might serve to assist him in the adoption of metastasios ideas arne formed his opera there is nothing sublime in his language certainly but the circumstances which are strong and the conduct which is artful were so rendered as not to lose their original force if the poetry of the songs is not beautiful it is at least flowing and as care has been taken to preserve the images which give the best expression to the music of which this wonderful composer was surely competent to judge he would have found it difficult to furnish himself with a translation to better purpose hooles is the best translation we have but it has a most forbidding musical aspect nor is this declaration at all in favor of addisons assertion that nonsense is best suited to music for there are many passages in this opera that in idea are grand and beautiful and lend a powerful help to musical expression i shall only out of many of these give only one instance behold on lethes dismal strand thy fathers murdered spirit stand in his face what grief profound see he rowls his haggard eyes and hark revenge revenge he cries and points to his still bleeding wound   when it is recollected how these lines are set and how beard sung them i think the appropriate epithet instead of despicable which has unsparingly been applied ought to be exquisite  in relation to the next piece of arne he certainly cannot be so well defended here he had no metastasio to lend him assistance yet the position of addison is so fairly inverted that by having indifferent words to set he never composed such indifferent music it was damned on the sixth night which would have been its fate on the third but for shuter who when the galleries were very riotous seized a moment of suspension and uttered very comically in the language of justice clack nay if we all speak together how shall we hear one another  kenrick who will longer be remembered to his infamy for his unmanly and scandalous attack on garrick this unprovoked and impudent libel cannot be forgotten the business finished by a most servile and pusillamious concession in the newspapers he asked a gentleman with his usual effrontery what he thought of his conduct why said the gentleman the public have for these six months considered you as a rascal and now lest they should be mistaken you have given it under your hand than to his credit for any work of genius wrote fun which was a satirical thing intended to ridicule fielding hill and other well known characters but fielding determined to spoil this same fun of kenrick apprehended the actors and the audience on the first and of course the only nights performance which was at the castle tavern in paternoster row  falstaffs wedding this was a sequel to the second part of henry the fourth and written professedly in imitation of shakespeare it was an arrogant performance and must sink to nothing while the english language endures for so long will shakespeares falstaff be remembered this play was afterward altered and performed at loves benefit to as little purpose as before the widowed wife in which garrick assisted the author who unkindly in return said he had spoiled his play was performed to bad houses for nine nights the duellist taken from fieldings amelia was damned on the first night this author also brought out one plot of johnsons country lasses as an opera which with the help of some vauxhall music was performed for a time and the other plot as a farce which was damned on the second night as to the rest kenrick would write but it was with difficulty he could procure himself to be read for what between his perpetually filling his head with rancour and his stomach with brandy he burnt with envy at the success of every rational mans pursuit and by hating every body was hated by every body  gentleman an author of very poor abilities wrote and altered the following pieces sejanus the stratford jubilee the sultan the tobacconist the coxcombs cupids revenge the pantheonites the modish wife zaphira richard the second the mentalist and the fairy court none of which are now known to the stage and it is of very little consequence that they ever were reed a rope maker wrote the superanuated gallant a farce never performed madrigal and trulletta a mock tragedy performed only one night and also the register office a piece which was written with a very laudable intention and from which foot stole mrs cole it was performed for a length of time at drury lane in      and several successive seasons which considerable applause dido a tragedy was performed three times and tom jones taken of course from fieldings novel was performed with some success  love an actor of merit and much respected whose real name was dance and who was brother to the present city surveyor and the member for east grinstead wrote for the stage pamela      a piece remarkable for nothing but that garrick performed in it before he was an actor professionally the village wedding a piece tolerably written but very thinly constructed for it contained but three characters timon of athens was by no means an injudicious alteration of shakespeares play it was only performed at richmond the ladies frolic which is the jovial crew cut into a farce was brought out at drury lane in    0 with tolerable success the city madam altered from massinger was brought forward in      at richmond the alterations were judicious and indeed love had good sense and talents enough to render every thing he undertook respectable  chap vi colman kelly lloyd mrs sheridan mrs griffiths and goldsmith i shall next speak of colman as an author of great value to the theater for though it is clearly apparent that his dramatic pieces were not so well constructed nor operated upon at any time of his life as when he benefited by the advice and assistance of garrick yet there is a peculiar neatness a beauty a correctness without however tameness or vapidity that has scarcely ever been equalled he was a kind of english terence and engrafted classical eloquence upon truth and nature indeed menanders salt which is supposed to have evaporated in its passage from greece to rome  the first dramatic essay of this author was polly honeycomb written purposely to bring forward miss pope the end of warning young girls from that destruction of which they are in danger from swallowing the mental poison which to the scandal of the press is disseminated through the circulaing libraries is well accomplished and there is something extremely dramatic and perfectly novel in the mans being gradually deserted by his whole family at the finish this piece was first performed in    0  the jealous wife was produced in      this is one of the best comedies on the stage thanks however in great measure to garrick for never was there an occasion where his assistance was more wanted or rendered more honestly or more effectually colman was a young author which will easily be credited when the reader knows that the musical lady made originally a part of the jealous wife he had the good sense to listen to garrick who took great pains with the task assigned him and in the performing it evinced great judgment and knowledge of effect it is generally supposed that this play was written by colman and garrick in conjunction in the same manner that they wrote the clandestine marriage but this is not the fact garrick suggested the alterations but colman wrote the whole  let the public regret the acting of that day when they are told that oakly was performed by garrick major oakley by yates lord trinket by obrien sir harry beagle by king lady freelove by mrs clive and mrs oakley by mrs pritchard and that the other characters were proportionably supported  the musical lady      has as good a tendency as polly honeycomb ladies make themselves rediculous in no way so much as in pretending to understand the science of music of which it is the study and the interest of their instructors to keep them in the dark frequently for fear of an investigation of their own ignorance the plot lies very round and is most judiciously worked up king yates and miss pope very ably supported the piece  philaster was altered from beaumont and fletcher by colman for the purpose of introducing powel on his first appearance this alteration was made with great good sense and with an eye strictly to the reputation of the original authors the assistance given to it by powel and mrs yates was of infinite benefit to the piece the deuce is in him was brought out while garrick was in italy and had good success it was one of those things in the style of the french after pieces and was full of that peculiar neatness with which this author always wrote the plot is partly from marmontel and partly from a circumcumstance publicly known at that time  the clandestine marriage has been already spoken of the english merchant which is a close translation of voltaires lecossaise was performed at drury lane in      this play is full of sound good sense but it is too french and too cold for any great admiration on the english stage in fact it is gold and sterling but is unfashioned lear was altered from shakespeare and with some propriety but we have already seen why tates alteration will ever have the preference colman being at this time in the infancy of his covent garden management he was obliged to buckle to this kind of work which was not his fort so much as original writing it was for colman to invent and for garrick to improve and this is clearly evident here colman having lost himself very materially as to stage effect from the moment he parted from garrick  the oxonian in town in which piece it was clearly evident that colman was left alone appeared at covent garden it very properly attacked a favorite vice but the  squire of alsatia and other similar things had anticipated all the effect that could be expected from it it would have quietly sunk to oblivion if some gamblers had not stupidly volunteered themseves as the guardians of sh honor which finished by their tacit confession that they were the very outcasts of society that the author meant to detect and punish  man and wife was a very injudicious performance colman ought to have known that nothing could stand against the spectacle that garrick was preparing at drury lane it must therefore naturally lose him reputation it had however the good effect of furnishing garrick with the idea in his prologue of comparing the two houses to the two magpies between hounslow and colnbrook the portrait taken from le tableau parlant of anseaume was a burletta the music by dr arnold it had very little success the fairy prince was a spectacle gathered from shakespeare dryden and gilbert west and brought out to introduce the ceremony of the installation of the knights of the garter in this piece miss brown afterward the unfortunate mrs cargyl made her first appearance  comus performed in      was of course altered from milton colman would have more obliged the public and assisted his own reputation by undertaking some original piece achilles in petticoats was an alteration from gay it met with very little success the man of business is another strong proof that colman felt himself awkward when left alone it had but very moderate success notwithstanding he produced it at his own theater with all the advantages that a manager has in his power to give his own productions epicene altered of course from jonson is judicious enough but it had not great success  islington spa was brought out at drury lane after colman had sold his share of the other theater it was well written but it wanted the touch of garricks promethean pencil which he was not much inclined perhaps to lend after colmans apostasy for though it is true that colman made money by his covent garden expedition he certainly would have made more reputation had he staid at drury lane new brooms an interlude at the opening of drury lane theater after garricks secession was of course well received  the spanish barber performed in the haymarket in the summer of      at which time colman became manager of that theater was performed with merited success it was during that season miss farren now countess of derby made her first appearance on the stage the music of this piece was composed by dr arnold the female chevalier had no great success it was altered from the artful husband of taverner bonduca altered from beaumont and fletcher did no great matters the company at the haymarket were not competent to the representation of such a piece  with the suicide i shall finish an examination of this authors dramatic works it was performed at the haymarket in      and was certainly colmans best piece after the clandestine marriage which evidently confirms how much the genius of colman was indebted to the judgment of garrick colman however is an author very worthy to be imitated chaste neat unexaggerated nature he hit most wonderfully he was a kind of teniers in writing his figures were small but they were beautifully finished they had always the best effect however when they were grouped by garrick who knew their keeping better than the painter did and yet though garrick knew light and shade style and effect better than colman without such admirable materals as colman possessed the public would not have had so much opportunity of benefiting by the judgment of garrick  kelly who ought to follow colman at an humble distance wrote nevertheless for the stage with some success he happened fortunately for himself and unluckily for the public taste to take advantage of the rage that then prevailed for sentiment every thing was at that time sentiment it was the only secret of writing for success if a man was to be hanged or med out came a sentiment if a rogue triumphed or was tossed in a blanket what an opportunity for a sentiment if the butler was drunk or the chambermaid impertinent listen to a sentiment in short if the alderman ate too much custard or his wife frequented too many routs if the vice was gaming in the alley or at brookss wenching or drinking if fortune came unasked or was deaf to solicitation if the subject was health or sickness happiness or misery hooraw for a sentiment  false delicacy      had almost all these requisites and that the audience might have enough of their darling sentiments after they had been delighted with a plentiful number of them in the course of the action the moment the catastrophe finished forward came every individual actor and actress and suspended the fall of the curtain with a sentiment nay so far did this folly prevail that the critics themselves began to congratulate the world on the restoration of menander classically conveyed in the manner of the greek chorus  a word to the wise    0 was damned on the stage but the author was remunerated by a large subscription this failure has been imputed to kellys having broached his political opinions pretty freely in the newspapers but without any outrage of probality or common sense it would be more natural to impute its failure to the want of merit in the piece which was miserably bad besides goldsmith had before this balanced the account between nature and sentiment in which poor sentiment was left minus by a considerable difference  clementina a tragedy by this author performed at covent garden in      was almost as dull as his sentimental comedy it set the audience asleep and therefore they had not spirits enough to damn it a gentleman was asked after one of the representations of this play why he did not hiss it how the devil could i said he it was impossible a man cannot hiss and yawn at the same time which they nevertheless might have been tempted to have done if it had not been for mrs yatess admirable acting the prince of agra altered from dryden and also brought out at covent garden was performed for the benefit of mrs lessingham but had very little success this play and the school for wives were fathered out of kindness to kelly by a respectable gentleman now at the head of the police which shows that the public manifest their sentiments as to plays without regard to the circumstances or situations of the authors but merely according to their merits for this play had no success and the school for wives not enough to flatter the pretentions of a reputable author  the romance of an hour was taken from marmontel and was passable enough the man of reason is acknowledged by kellys biographer to have been inferior to the rest of his works for which there was no occasion but yet the failure of it is very kindly attributed to woodwards misconception of the principal character in short kelly was but an indifferent writer but by having many companionable qualities and being ready at all times to render his conduct pleasurable and serviceable to society both the public and his friends wherever they properly could were happy in return to oblige and serve him  lloyd the friend and companion of churchill and wilkes was a good writer his actor is a poem of considerable merit and proved a bone that wits of high reputation have been happy to nibble at his dramatic productions however are of no high rank the tears and triumphs of parnassus was merely an ode arcadia or the shepherds wedding was a compliment on the nuptials of their majestys it was neatly written the school for wives from moliere was printed but never acted indeed it was merely written to show how far murphy had borrowed from the french  the death of adam was translated from the german of klopstock it is complained of as a bad translation and certainly it is not a good play the capricious lovers to say the truth is the only piece of lloyd which can be called in the smallest degree an acquisition to the stage it was performed at drury lane while garrick was in italy the music was composed by rush and it was well acted the subject was favarts ninette a la cour  mrs sheridan who had pretensions as a writer greatly beyond those which are possessed by ladies in general wrote sydney biddulph for the closet and for the stage the discovery in which there is great nature and spirit and the dupe in which indelicacy a quicksand so often fatal to lady writers sunk her venture it has been urged that the audience were too delicate but this was not the truth for the dupe was performed in      and the rage for false delicacy did not prevail till       mrs griffiths was a writer widely different from mrs sheridan for she was a type of the celebrated mrs philips the never to be enough admired orinda even to her platonic letters her dramatic pieces were the platonic wife performed in      and taken from marmontel it lingered through six nights amana was a kind of dramatic poem but it was never acted the double mistake had about the same reception as the platonic wife the school for rakes      was a translation from beaumarchais and proved to be the best of this ladys productions it was well performed and had a tolerable run a wife in the right exhibited a lady writer in the wrong for it was performed only one night it came out at covent garden in      the times gave mrs griffiths a hint that it was time she should leave off writing for the stage this hint she took and this piece finished her dramatic career  goldsmith who has done honor to english literature who was the best meaning strange good whimsical creature in the world whose intentions though always right by doing nothing like any body else he executed always wrong whose writings which are a mixture of merit and singularity scarcely had a part that did not contain some trait of himself who has left two beautiful poems a sweet ballad and a charming novel wrote successfully for the stage but not up to the standard of his other productions  the good natured man was brought out at covent garden exactly at the moment when the public began to be under the influence of the sentimental mania there is nothing however better than croker and the incident of the incendiary letter but bailiffs were introduced on the stage which had been done an hundred times before and has been an hundred times since and it was enough that the audience did not like such vulgar acquaintance there have been times when if they had been real bailiffs the managers would have sympathized with the audience to see however that the public are a very short time deluded when they adopt false taste without consideration they were glad of the next opportunity goldsmith gave them of laughing away the gloom that had been thrown over their minds by the introduction of an infatuation so totally contrary to the english character  she stoops to conquer goldsmith considered as a desperate remedy for a desperate disease it operated effectually indeed like electricity the audiences seemed as if they had been at some place the reverse of the cave of trophonius for they went in sad and came out merry this piece was a good deal abused and no wonder for it went to the ruin of dull authors its efficacy however was confirmed and whatever absurdities the public taste may have assumed at times it has not since then trenched upon the pulpit goldsmith also altered for quicks benefit the grumbler from sedley  chap vii cumberland bentley mason mrs brook mrs lennox hull ohara hoole and victor cumberland a well known voluminous writer who besides a prodigious number of different productions has labored in the theatrical vineyard with great earnestness and some reputation even from      to the present moment brought out during the period to which my strictures extend thirteen dramatic pieces  the banishment of cicero      was offered to garrick but not accepted the business of clodius and his sister and the debauching of pompeys wife in the temple of juno were not to be tolerated it was in fact though strongly written in many parts evidently an inexperienced production and therefore the manager in refusing it did his duty by the public the summers tale was an opera performed at covent garden theater in      it was too heavy for a comic opera and therefore was called a comedy with songs the music was an italian selection but it was in general dull and ill chosen this piece was cut down to a farce but it did as little in that form as at first  the brothers was performed at covent garden      and received considerable applause the west indian by infinite degrees the best production of this author was performed at drury lane in      mr cumberland had by this time seen that recourse must be had to other authors if any expectations of success were formed by him with safety he had tried this expedient with effect in the brothers which were tom jones and blifil and here he was determined not to inconvenience himself but i do not mean this a as reproach since campleys generosity and other circumstancs in the funeral the twin rivals and other plays so whetted his theatrical knife that it carved a most entertaining play which in spite of a great deal of affected language created interest and afforded pleasure  timon of athens was an alteration from shakespeare and performed at drury lane in      with but little success the fashionable lover came out the same season but it was a most injudicious play and contained such a mixture of the conscious lovers false delicacy taste and clarissa harlowe that it was impossible for any thing to be more heterogeneous and to add to the other misfortunes of this comedy moody was brought forward to perform a scotchsman the note of hand a farce had some success but was not equal to the afterpieces of murphy or colman the choleric man was very much attacked by the critics which brought out an irascibility from the author which has been ever since played upon let no man write unless he can know how to treat calumny with contempt  the battle of hastings performed at drury lane in      turned out the battle of the critics who had certainly too much reason on their side they alleged that the truth of history had been violated and that a perpetual imitation of shakespeare exhibited the writing of this author as indeed it would of any other to a disadvantage not however that it is not tolerated and praised too by authors of the present day the fact is the public had been caught to expect too much from this play which was certainly a strange incongruous business any man might have sworn that the west indian would have been the be all and the end all with this gentleman when a man finishes a work with saying this is well but i shall make the next better it is a thousand to one but he succeeds if he pronounces that nothing in its way can go beyond it he speaks truth as to himself for he will not exceed it again  bentley son of the celebrated dr bentley wrote a piece in the nature of the old italian comedy called the wishes which as we have seen was performed at drury lane during that summer that murphy and foot had the management of it it was odd extravagant and eccentric but there was something so novel in making the whole pantomimic family speak when we had been accustomed to be entertained only with their attitudes and jesticulation that the public knew not how to take it this helped its sat which was however accelerated by its want of plan connection and interest bentley also wrote philodamus a kind of tragedy on which gray has written a most elaborate eulogium but the best that can be said of it is that it may be passable in the closet but it would be intolerable on the stage  mason a sweet and beautiful writer and a man universally beloved and esteemed wrote elfrida and caractacus neither of which pieces were intended for the stage they were brought out assisted by the music of arne and though it is both natural and proper to prefer regular tragedy as time and custom has established it yet it was a compliment to the stage and a proof of colmans classical discrimination to bring forward elfrida though not so well altered by him as it was afterward by the author in this kind of tragedy caractacus is the best because the catastrophe is more noble more elevated and the distress is heightened by a consideration that valor suffers for patriotism and that history is not violated  in elfrida the punishment is hard but it is the punishment of treason and truth is outraged by making elfrida retire to a convent rather fondly by the way than religiously while recollection busily reminds us that the real elfrida married the king who murdered her husband again a chorus of druids who were professionally bards is superior both naturally and musically to a chorus of virgins but on the other hand domestic woe always makes the deepest impression and the lyric part of elfrida is better written for music than that of charactacus i am competent to give an answer to all those who have expressed great astonishment that mason never wrote a regular tragedy by assuring the reader that he himself told me at aston in yorkshire that he had then in his bureau two tragedies written agreeable to the usage of the english theater but that they never should be produced owing to the trouble and pain he had experienced from the solly and caprice of managers   mrs brook who has written many novels that have been well received by the world if that be a criterion of merit wrote also a tragedy the only production i am entitled to mention here called virginia mrs lennox stands upon much the same foundation as to reputation as mrs brook her dramatic pieces are philander never performed the sister performed one night only in      at covent garden and old city manners altered from eastward hoe and performed with very little applause at drury lane  hull whose various merits as author actor and manager have long been known to the public produced the following dramatic pieces the twins altered from the comedy of errors and performed with success the absent man performed once pharnaces an opera set by bates and performed at drury lane while garrick was in italy the spanish lady performed for the authors benefit in      all in the right from destouches also performed for the authors benefit the perplexities a comedy that deserved its title for there never was so perplexed a plot which was taken from tukes adventures of five hours and in which beard sung spoke and with his usual philanthropy did every thing else in his power to serve his friend and the fairy favor a trifle performed in      for the entertainment of his royal highness the prince of wales  hull also wrote or rather fashioned into an opera the royal merchant from beaumont and fletcher the music was by linley it had but little success some of the songs were taken into the camp a piece performed at drury lane in      and supposed to have been written by the manager of that theater at which time the public received them as we have seen with rapture when they had passed them by with indifference at covent garden so much fascination is there some times in a great name rosamond was a wonderful favorite for some time wonderful i say because perhaps nothing could have been more insufferably dull but the story did the business queen elenors poisoned bowl and dagger penetrated to the very back of the upper gallery edward and eleonora was altered from thompson but it did nothing love will find out the way an opera and the victim a tragedy finish mr hulls works neither of which experienced much success  ohara through whose pieces we have been taught to admire the native irish melodies produced midas the golden pippin and april day original burlettas and translated the two misers from fenoillot and altered tom thumb from fielding midas in which there was certainly much excellent humor and fair burlesque was by infinite degrees the best of these pieces  hoole who translated metastasio altered three of that admirable authors operas into tragedies which producing a new effect by ending happily received considerable applause it was only an innovation however for they completely exhibited an anticlimax and lowered in proportion as the novelty wore off these tragedies are cyrus timanthes and cleonice it is worthy of remark that this new era of tragedy began with sentimental comedy cyrus being the companion of false delicacy and brought out in       victor more celebrated as a theatrical treasurer than a theatrical writer produced however several things of different descriptions he altered most miserably shakespeares two gentlemen of verona altemira a tragedy was published but never performed the fatal error a soft name for the commission of adultery altered from heywoods woman killed with kindness was also never performed the fortunate peasant taken from marivauxs paysan parvenu shared the same fate and so did the sacrifices  chap viii sheridan jephson bate miss more burgoyne king andrews mrs cowley and holcroft as i profess to close this work at the death of garrick to which period we are now hastening and as the authors of whom i have lately spoken produced theatrical exhibitions after that event as well as those whose names are placed at the head of this chapter i shall merely have opportunity to speak of the nature and tendency of their different merits and review such pieces as they produced up to       sheridan a man of most commanding talents would have stood inferior to very few writers on this or any other similar list had his time been entirely devoted to the theater for in that case as genius loves to spread and expand and seldom satisfies itself with adopting when it can have opportunity of traversing the wide range of invention the public would no doubt have seen original tragedies and comedies such as might have served as models for the imitation of authors not so happily gifted instead of scenes hints and circumstances most ingeniously wrought together indeed but as far as any thing on the stage from originality  this is a fact so universally known and so constantly admitted that it has been often argued upon it has been said that there is not in nature a new character nor a new sentiment and all that can be done is to take old matter and give it a novel appearance that it is safer to do so i will not deny for certainly when any thing comes in contact with the imagination that has been familiar to it without consideration we give credit for its merit upon the spot whatever we may do upon reflection and having once praised a thing a false pride prevents us from discovering that we were deceived it must not be believed that congreves bon mots were all impromptus and it is a literal fact that some of joe millers best jests are stolen from the ancients but when this is allowed it will yet be granted that mr sheridan could have invented incidents as good as those he has borrowed  this is confirmed by this authors first production the rivals which though lydia languish falkland and his mistress and some other characters are copies instead of portraits is the most original of his plays and by many of the judicious thought the best it was nearly damned on the first night and he is said to have remarked to a friend as he withdrew it i have now got the last and it shall be my fault next time if i dont make the shoe to fit his labor however being only coblers work it required too much method for his volatile genius to buckle to for the rest the adopted passages are not judicious for polly honeycomb was better in its former place the nutbrown maid is only fit for the poem she adorns for though her language on the stage is full of sweetness and delicacy it is no more appropriate than would be the fine strokes of a miniature painter in the finishing of flats and wings being therefore neither wholly original nor wholly imitation this piece stands like this authors own simile in the duenna of the wall between church and synagogue for it is part natural and part incongruous  we shall see that mr sheridan completely got rid of the original part of the system in his next piece in the duenna there is not a single new situation from beginning to end the whole of the plot of turning the daughter out of doors is conjointly the sicilienne of moliere and il filosofo di campagna where every circumstance is to be found from the serenade in the first scene to the marriage in the last  in il filosofo di campagna a father insists on his daughters marrying to please him and refuses her the man of her heart which trouble she gets rid of by palming her maid on the object of her aversion to which maid in the end he is actually married and it is impossible but the equivoques in one piece must be extremely similar to those in the other it must be allowed there is more humor or if you will farce in the duenna than in the other piece but not so much nature for the countryman might be supposed without difficulty to mistake a smart country lass for his friends daughter whereas it is a very strong violence on probability to make isaac mistake the duenna for louisa one he is told is twenty years old and the other he must know to be sixty  the business of ferdinand and clara is the wonder clara elopes louisa keeps the secret isabella elopes violante keeps the secret louisa is the sister of ferdinand so is isabella of don felix lissardo is threatened sword in hand by don felix so is isaac by ferdinand don felix quarrels with his sisters lover so does ferdinand don felix mistakes isabella veiled for violante so does ferdinand mistake louisa for clara nay so closely is the wonder copied that lissardos anxiety to get gibby a drubbing is apparent in isaacs telling ferdinand that he may cut antonios throat and welcome  father paul is marmontels philosophe soi disant who as he sits at a feast and enveighs against gormandizing actually says as he entreats a lady to help him to some nicety at table cannot we be satisfied with the wholesome roots of the earth and laments after drinking a glass of burgundy that people will not be content like our forefathers with the crystal stream but the circumstance that proves this author as fallible as any other is that he has made the critic laugh at the duenna for the clock strikes four at the beginning of the tragedy rehearsed which according to the dedication professes to be critical with a view of course to ridicule the unity of time and it strikes three at the beginning of the duenna intending without doubt to mark that unity as a beauty  the poetry though seldom original is every where neat and stowing and well suits the beautiful music partly selected and partly from linley which proved of infinite advantage to the piece it was however very fortunate both for the author and the musician that the rage for catches and glees prevailed a good deal at that time otherwise the public might have thought it a little out of place to make the characters express their happiness by singing anthems it has the effect of reviving false delicacy by setting sentiment to music it is impossible to omit in this place that the beautiful glee of how merrily we live was rehearsed and thrown aside under an idea that it would have no effect  as to the dialogue of this piece it is lively pointed and pertinent it has not the ease of vanburgh the neatness of farquhar nor the wit of congreve and yet it has something of them all it is managed with the cunning of a painter who does not imitate any particular artist but who copies the school the aside speeches of isaac showing before hand and without his knowledge how easily he is himself to be taken in by his different attempts to cheat others convey the most artful species of anticipation that ever was practiced and show a judgment of theatrical effect powerful new and extraordinary  the school for scandal is no more original than the duenna the school itself is congreves cabal and the play may fairly be called a sequel to the way of the world the scandal has been all detailed in different pieces but principally in the plain dealer where in novel lord plausible olivia and eliza will be found sir benjamin crab lady sneerwell and mrs candor the brothers have been in a variety of productions from the adelphi to fifty other things but the squire of alsatia on the stage and tom jones in the closet contain the closest resemblances the uncle lately returned from abroad and introduced to the drunken company and the sale of the pictures are extremely like the intriguing chambermaid which was taken from destouches we have sold every thing says the drunken colonel what all my pictures says the father oh damme they went first cried the colonel the reserving the uncles picture is in a french piece called lecole de la jeunesse joseph and lady teazle are constant and lady brute but with an infinitely worse argument on the side of the gallant and less provocation on the side of the lady for it would be a species of ingratitude dangerous to risk even in fiction for lady teazle to swerve even in the remotest degree from her duty whereas lady brute has more provocation to justify her wavering fidelity than any wife on the stage thus upon the principle that men had better be born fortunate than rich so it is profitable to theatrical writers to use penetration rather than genius  the dialogue of the school for scandal is in general admirable but it is expressly warped in places for the purpose of procuring that applause as addison calls it which proceeds from the head rather than the heart heron the critic points out several of these tinsel ornaments which he tells you are known by the name of clap traps and in particular instances the speech of charles to rowley who tells him to observe the old proverb and to be just before he is generous why so i would says charles if i could but justice is an old lame hobbling beldame and i cannot get her to keep pace with generosity for the soul of me this sentiment which half the audiences to this play have received with the loudest applause is he tells us and he tells us truly false and immoral and that no reprobation can be too severe for it and nothing can be more sterling reason for the money that a man holds who has not paid his debts is not his and therefore it is not in his power to bestow it but these are errors easily in this authors power to rectify and it is truly to be lamented that either indolence or avocation should check the exertions of talents which are so reputable to himself so gratifying to the public and so honorable to literature  jephson a gentleman i believe greatly courted and beloved by his private friends produced briganza a piece written with considerable judgment and good poetic effect the scene of the monk though evidently an imitation of king john and hubert is uncommonly beautiful and highly wrought the resemblance of this play to venice preserved in the end injured its success though it was well received and frequently repeated during the first season which was in      the law of lombardy      was performed but nine nights it was much inferior to briganza  bate dudley a gentlemen who has written more for his amusement than for the sake of the public he ought to have done produced for the stage henry and emma performed for mrs hartleys benefit in      the rival candidates an afterpiece at drury lane      which had creditable success the blackamoor washed white      which was damned as it was generally understood by a party created by the authors political disputes and the flitch of bacon performed at the haymarket in      which was frequently in that season and has been since performed repeatedly with considerable success  miss more who as a writer and a school mistress is well known produced a dramatic pastoral called a search after happiness only recited by young ladies in the manner of racines athaliah the inflexible captive a tragedy performed one night at bath percy another tragedy performed at covent garden which had considerable success and fatal falsehood which was exhibited only three nights nothing can be more ridiculous than literary quarrels even among men but when ladies fearful lest their poetic offsprings should crawl through life unheeded publicly expose themselves to the world in order to ascertain their beauty and legitimacy who does not wish they had occupied their time with a needle instead of a pen the attention of the world was called when fatal falsehood came out to a newspaper dispute between miss more and mrs cowley who brought out a tragedy called albina miss more was penetrated with the deepest regret at being compelled to take a step so repugnant to her own feelings and the delicacy of her sex but her moral character had been grossly attacked and she felt herself under the necessity of solemnly declaring that she had never seen heard or read a single line of mrs cowleys tragedy mrs cowley in reply said that she wished miss more had been still more sensible of the indelicacy of a newspaper altercation between women and of the ideas of ridicule that the world are apt to attach to such unsexual hardiness she says in her preface she has only related events and is truly sorry to find that miss more can not only be angry but when she is angry she can be very unpolite had these foolish ladies no friend to prevent their making themselves a town talk what were they cavilling about after all one of these plays was withdrawn on the third night and the other was performed but once and then scarcely heard to an end   burgoyne the saratoga general produced before garricks death the maid of the oaks which with the assistance of garrick was made into a very entertaining performance there was a good deal of cibber in this authors dialogue and had he oftener tried his hand while he had opportunity of deriving assistance from so able a friend he certainly would have been a respectable playwright  king who has sometimes amused himself with writing and never without success produced a musical piece called love at first sight and a farce called wits last stake both at drury lane  andrews a most curious and singular author a kind of dramatic cuckoo with this difference that after he took possession of the nests of other writers and sucked the eggs of their imaginations instead of being able to produce any of his own sat upon the shells expecting to hatch ideas after the substance and the vital speck were gone i thank chance that i have only to speak of three non entities produced by this gunpowder merchant all which have long since flown in fumo the election a trifling interlude which proved him a very unpromising candidate for the public favor the conjuror at which title was levelled the pun of the day to the disadvantage of the author and belphegor the acquaintance of which devil he seems to have courted in order that he might be familiar with damnation  mrs cowley of whose temper we have just now seen a specimen in her squabble with miss more wrote the runaway a comedy and who is the dupe a farce before the time my task expires the comedy was touched a good deal by garrick and being of a sprightly kind and having nothing particular to offend it had the usual success of that description of pieces the farce was a much better thing it was performed with reputable success  holcroft a most extraordinary author has written a great deal has been greatly encouraged and yet has done nothing for literature because perhaps he has done little for morality less for truth and nothing for social order his only dramatic work that comes under my examination is a trifling opera called the crisis which was performed for a benefit  chap ix inferior authors i shall now in a summary way take up those authors that remain just as they come to hand without respect of persons indeed it is impossible for me to be very prolix for they amount to upwards of ninety and i must reserve as much room as possible to bring

said also to have written the seraglio performed at covent garden in      but though this intelligence is reiterated and many circumstances concerning it to my knowledge it is every word false and that the person in question had not seen a single word of the piece when it was put into the hands of mr harris i only mention this to show the wonderful consistency of theatrical historians  rogers

tragedy most shockingly revolting called the mysterious mother nothing can be so dangerous as such employment for men of talents monsters of the mind like all other monsters should be smothered it was greatly to the honor of the theater and its manager that this piece was refused if the theater should get on however the same pace it is now going these sentiments may in a few years be thought mere squeamishness  dow who wrote on oriental subjects produced a tragedy called zingis and another called sethona neither of which had any great success harrod a kentish man produced a tragedy called the patriot it was never acted jeres translated a part of voltaire and published a tragedy called richard in cyprus west wrote for the dublin theater a tragedy called ethelinda horde published according

though a lawyer has piqued himself upon not having in the whole course of his life written a single syllable to the prejudice of his neighbor or the peace of society and to keep up this idea perhaps of being completely a harmless character he has written three tragedies than which nothing can be more perfectly inoffensive for they exercise no other feeling than patience and therefore inculcate a very wholesome doctrine these pieces are called almeyda the siege of tamor and the female gamester  shepherd a clergyman wrote two dramatic pieces neither of which however were performed called hector

craddock brought out at covent garden a tragedy called zobeide this piece is altered from voltaires les scythes for which compliment voltaire gave craddock his thanks a tribrute easily obtained from a

brought out at covent garden cross purposes a very pleasant farce taken from les trois freres of la font and at drury lane a comedy called the duel taken from the philosophe sans les scavoir of sedaine it is remarkable that when the critics read sedaines piece they made exactly the same objections to it which were made in england it was therefore not performed at court the author nevertheless ventured a representation of it at the theater where it received great applause and in particular in those parts where the critics had condemned it this piece was damned hardham whose trade was a diamond cutter his employ a snuffman and his amusement a numberer of drury lane theater caught the cacoethes from the last employ and wrote a piece which garrick prudently advised him to keep in the back ground called the fortune tellers hardham was a great favorite of garrick and was remarkably liberal and benevolent particularly to members of the theater  waldron the actor produced the maid of kent the contrast and the richmond heiress  ascough well known in the gay world brought out a translation of voltaires semiramis which could not possibly have succeeded it was so very weak to make amends however sheridan adorned it with a most exquisitely written prologue chatterton known by his genius and his misfortunes wrote not intended however for the stage the tournament ella goddwyn and the dowager pillon an author who has written with creditable success produced before garricks death the invasion which was a successful farce that answered a temporary purpose  the remaining dramatic efforts which it is within my promise to record are of so tiny a nature that it will be in their favor to make them visible by seeing them in a swarm i shall therefore only notice their titles and their authors the names of some of which are however respectable without any particular comment on purpose to show that i have a pleasure in obliging my readers toosey wrote sebastian

altered the gentle shepherd from ramsay hough wrote second thought is best mrs robinson produced the lucky escape lady craven the sleepwalker hill the gospel shop willet buxom joan and mrs booth the little french lawyer  in addition to these which i can particularise i count twentyseven dramatic pieces which are doubtfully attributed and one hundred and seventynine considered as anonymous so that i have now in the course of this history given an account of more than eight hundred dramatic writers and about three thousand one hundred pieces of different descriptions the number of authors in france during the same period are above nine hundred and fifty and their pieces amount in number to nearly four thousand five hundred so that they have a considerable advantage in point of number but i fancy the warmest admirer of french literature will agree without scruple that when the quality of the manufacture is taken into consideration we shall find an immense balance in our favor in point of value  chap x actors i get now to a critical part of my task i am to show what the merits of those actors were who comprised the school of garrick to see by comparison whether they equalled or excelled the actors before and at the time of betterton and to ascertain by deduction how much the acting of the present day has gradually fallen off since it has been obliged to pick up its intelligence without any acknowledged preceptor  with what ability i shall execute this task let my readers judge i confess i undertake it with a mixture of pleasure and reluctance pleasure because i think it has been almost already proved that the acting of garricks pupils was superior to that of bettertons and reluctance because i am afraid it is but too apparent that when nature shall have destroyed the few remaining traces of that admirable and difficult art the secret will be wholly lost  i know i have to guard myself against early prejudice and to use every caution lest i mistake unqualified admiration for fixed judgment errors imbibed in youth are certainly difficult to irradicate but these are generally single and unconfirmed they have their source in the fancy not in the heart they are beautiful to the sight but shrink at the touch in the absence of reason they excite pleasure but reflection shames us into an acknowledgement of the delusion on the contrary when the senses receive those pleasures which the mind approves when reiterated deliberation confirms that delight which takes possession of the susceptible soul nothing palls nothing satiates repetition reveals new beauties and the enjoyment which was born from admiration bears the test of time and accompanies the mind to maturity  lest however i may be fallible lest this doctrine may be fallible which i cannot easily credit i shall strengthen my own opinions by the opinions of infinitely better judges than myself till it be confessed whatever i may want of ability i want nothing of candor or rectitude  in point of reputation as men and members of society actors in their general estimation have declined from shakespeare onwards to the present hour see how this has happened our immortal bard who was another aeschylus was like aeschylus an actor jonson was an actor the best authors of that time were actors and therefore in emulation of the greeks were the theaters placed under the management of actors what was the consequence actors accumulated fortunes were classed and estimated respectably and when the troubles of charles the first closed the theater its members were considered as loyal and honorable men fit to be trusted with commissions to fight in the kings cause till through the interest of cromwell and the puritans they yielded to the general pressure of the times  from that moment the theater got into extraneous hands and thence may be dated the first step toward the degradation of actors the names of davenant and killegrew gave cold expectation of any professional encouragement to actors in their own right it is true that they were under the immediate protection of the lord chamberlain and could not be otherwise than safely guarded by their privilege of appeal to that nobleman but this subjected them to adverse interests which were sure to have adverse consequences  the progress of this however we have seen we have seen even in davenants time that the two companies dwindled into the size of one and then were glad enough to unite to keep acting upon its legs we have seen the theater after it was split and divided into factions under rich torn and distracted till at length the actors with betterton at their head removed with the permission of king william to lincolns inn fields where inconvenienced as they were they had success and were respected we have seen in what manner from the various ill conduct of rich that he was interdicted by the lord chamberlain with both the patents in his pocket which were granted to davenant and killegrew we have seen the various changes which fixed cibber in the management at which time acting began to grow into fame and reputation we have seen immediately after his secession how low it sunk under the management of persons who were not actors we have seen the miseries of the stage in the time of fleetwood and we have seen it rescued from those miseries by garrick garrick is now lost to us and what we see now and may hereafter see i rejoice it does not come within my province to notice  the inference from these observations naturally is that as the theater has invariably been a source of meritorious emolument to every description of actors as the profession of an actor has been considered as perfectly reputable as the fair privileges of that profession have been accorded and enjoyed as a ight which could not be trenched upon when the property has been confided to actors and as the theater has been without a single deviation plunged into difficulties as the talents by means of which alone a theater can exist for authors are nothing without actors have been misunderstood misapplied slighted and set at naught as salaries have been curtailed mulcts imposed taskmasters employed and other unjust and unfair means resorted to to distress actors when the property has fallen into the hands of mere adventurers or men of fortune so it is evidently proved by circumstances that cannot be controverted and conclusions that cannot be mistaken that the theater can never flourish to any degree of perfection unless confided to the management of actors and regulated by that paramount authority which i have contended throughout this work has ever been and ever ought to be vested in the lord chamberlain  other circumstances corroborate this beyond all possibility of contradiction persons of talents education family have become actors without degradation can this be so when they are to be considered as persons merely employed mercenaries hirelings men with these recommendations would revolt at such an idea it will therefore be seen that at the time of shakespeare of betterton of cibber and of garrick a union of abilities upon an enlarged scale gave a consequence and a respect to the theater and to acting and that at every other period it was chilled and discouraged and hid its diminished head  i come now to consider when acting was in its greatest prosperity and i think it will not be difficult to prove that moment to have been at the time of garrick and upon the whole after his return from italy his great example had been long operating on the minds of others and when pactice had grown into maturity every point of excellence appears to have been attained we are told that betterton was taught by tailor booth by betterton and quin by booth garrick however seems only to have been taught by nature and in spite of all we can gather of the extraordinary merits of shakespeares cotemporary actors of those afterward under betterton and onward to the end of cibbers management there does not appear a demonstrative reason to suppose that acting reached its consummation till the appearance of garrick  that garrick reached perfection as far as it is in the power of a human being to be perfect nothing can controvert nature had given him a most intelligent and comprehensive mind he knew the passions and all their distinctions shades and gradations to infinity he knew all his author expressed all he meant and was frequently equal to a penetration capable of refining upon the sentiment he had to utter so that let the thought be ever so beautiful ever so greatly conceived or admirably written it came mended from his utterance of it  to assist this strong just and profound judgment his person and face were capable of setting off every character and every mode of expression to advantage and so great was his command over his form and his features that the extremes of personification from kingly dignity to driveling idiotism were at his command but it is enough to say for his fame needs no eulogium or if it did is it in the power of words to give it that from the moment he was dressed for a part to the time he laid it down be it what it might he was no longer garrick but the character he assumed but one part of his acting which can be easily explained and which it is not only the duty but within the capacity of every member of the theater to acquire was his correct attention to the business of the scene when others were speaking to him  the meanest performer on the stage in this can copy garrick the rules which he laid down for himself were not to suppose a single auditor present and not only to fancy he was the character he personated but actually to infuse into his mind an idea that every thing he saw heard and felt was real he leered at no ladies in the boxes contemplated no pleasure in any appointment to be kept after the play anticipated no hired panegyric in the papers of the next morning the admiration he received was a tribute from the sensibility of the audience he realized the fiction till at length all idea of a theater vanished and his hearers were willingly deluded into a belief that they were witnessing scenes in real life for critically attentive to these particulars himself which make half the value of the representation the other performers caught the fervor which diffusing itself to all around through the medium of a play the stage exhibited a faithful representation of nature  to enumerate the wonderful and extensive variety in garrick throughout the whole round of different characters he assumed which for number style or kind are beyond credibility would require volumes the task however though the fact is astonishing would not be difficult those who have seen him must remember what they felt and sensations that are imprinted on the mind are easily explained instead therefore of saying what he was as an actor i shall content myself with describing what he was not in his utterance he was not monotonous tedious precise cold unimpassioned nor did he rant bellow flounder hoop or sputter in his deportment he was not affected formal lounging languid or awkward nor did he stride stalk jump kick or shuffle he neither buffetted the air with his arms nor shook his head like a panteen whiffled and fluttered like a butterfly or rolled about like a porpus  his conduct was not disrespectful to the audience nor disreputable to himself he excited attention but he did not exact it though his judgment was consummate he always submitted it with deference he never appeared solicitous to investigate a sentence but went at once to the sentiment it enforced his business was not to methodize words but to express passions he never was pertinacious pedantic or critical he neither whined nor declaimed he acted in a word what he uttered seemed to be without study it seemed to be extemporaneous words arising from the situation conceived at the time upon the spot thus his acting could be no other than nature and thus he excited no cavil upon the meaning of epithets no creation of opinions no deriliction of understanding his power was unequivocally over the heart in proof of this in the course of all that unexampled variety of characters which he personated combining all the situations into which the human passions can possibly be thrown he never for a single moment inflated tragedy into bombast nor degraded comedy into buffoonery  this negative statement shows the requisites which garrick possessed in himself and which he taught to his pupils and i the more readily try him by this ordeal because it gives me opportunity to show that by avoiding those impediments to good acting which if persisted in are completely fatal every member of a theater to that degree of ability which nature and education has given him may be a good actor it is on this account i therefore naturally wish that it might again be the desire of actors to emulate and the determination of the public to tolerate this only plan by which in the most distant degree acting can ever be a representation of nature and reconcilable to truth  i could with pleasure go into every particular excellence in garricks acting but that my limits are so confined as to render it impracticable indeed it could not be done without establishing a broad system equal to a treatise i must leave it therefore to some more able though not more willing pen in the mean time i owe myself the duty to say and i beg it may be so understood that i have not meant to describe in my observations on this extraordinary man an actor completely without faults i only insist that his faults were spots in the sun faults which the most perfect mortal must naturally possess faults to which betterton as well as garrick must inevitably have been liable and having established his perfections which in comparison with his faults were ossa to a wart i think it will be acknowledged let bettertons exclusive merit have been what it might that as the large field which garrick traversed demanded more extensive and more versatile powers and as taking it in a general point of view he was equally excellent every where it cannot be but his merits must have stood higher than those of his great predecessor  next to garrick it will be proper to mention barry an actor of most extraordinary merit which was confined however to tragedy and serious parts in comedies in some few respects it is questionable whether he did not excel every actor on the stage these were in scenes and situations full of tender woe and domestic softness to which his voice which was melifluous to wonder lent astonishing assistance in scenes of an opposite description he threw a majesty and a grandeur into his acting which gave it a most noble degree of elevation these peculiar qualities which he possessed in a very striking degree were greatly manifest in the tender conflicts of the heart wounded othello and the haughty ravings of the high minded bajazet and they were exquisitely blended in the fond yet kingly alexander but certainly beyond these requisites barrys acting did not extend in any eminent degree  the turbulent afflicting and terrible passions were not at the command of barry which those will witness for me who have heard garrick utter the curse in lear and who have watched him through the various vicissitudes which mark the guilty ambition of macbeth barry was wonderfully winning but he was not superlatively great he missed of the first grand requisite in tragedy he excited pity and delight but not terror garrick possessed every quality in the same eminent degree i have noticed already that excessive sensibility conquers too frequently the powers of an actor and thus barry felt himself what garrick transferred to the audience in barry they were interested for the actor in garrick for the character  it cannot be denied however that barry was a noble acquisition to the theater all exquisitely tender and touching writing came mended from his mouth there was a pathos a sweetness a delicacy in his utterance which stole upon the mind and forced conviction upon the memory every sentiment of honor and virtue recommended to the ear by the language of the author were rivetted to the heart by the utterance of barry  holland and powell were great acquisitions to the theater their merits however were as different as possible holland acquired fame by perseverance and industry which therefore grew gradually toward perfection powell burst on the stage with every perfection but experience they had been always intimate friends and their theatrical emulation was creditable to both it is an extraordinary thing that when powell died holland felt a presentiment that he should soon follow him the last time he ever performed he was in unusual spirits during the evening he related in the greenroom a number of anecdotes and it is remarkable that they always contained some allusion to powell he repeated the lines which colman had written and which he had repeated at powells death every thing in short was powell at last he uttered those extraordinary words the first time i ever saw powell was at a spouting club where he and i performed posthumous and jachimo the first characters we performed on the stage together were posthumous and jachimo the last time we played together and added he with a sigh it was the last time he ever played the characters were posthumous and jachimo what makes this matter singular almost beyond belief he was then dressed for jachimo and he died a few days after powells acting was strong nature as luxuriant as a wilderness it had a thousand beauties and a thousand faults he felt so forcibly that in any impassioned scene tears came faster than words and frequently choked his utterance if garrick had not gone to italy but had stayed at home and honestly taught him there is certainly no height of perfection in tragedy to which such abilities could not have reached but he hurried over so many characters in the short time he was on the stage that it was impossible even had his understanding been as great as his conception for him to have digested any of them into any thing like form  holland was extremely different from powell both as an actor and a man though his natural talents were not so strong yet he kept as respectable a situation and through the propriety of his conduct his company was coveted by the wise and the celebrated while powells weakness led him into the society of the vain and the frivolous holland had not nor had powell received a very liberal education but his intellects were of that strong clear and decided kind they performed for him the task of a tutor so well that his decisions upon all occasions were founded in sound judgment and critical experience he was free good natured cheerful and generous nor had he an unkind wish to any human creature he indulged himself as much as any young man reasonably ought to do yet with his purse and his heart ever open though not sprung from an opulent origin which circumstance he had too much sense to conceal at the age i believe of thirty three he left his family six thousand pounds  as to the acting of holland what he wanted of powells natural requisities he made up in strong discrimination one was susceptable the other critical whoever remembers their performing posthumous and jachimo will feel the truth of this observation powell made the strongest first impression holland pleased you best upon repetition powell though he often charmed sometimes disgusted holland even when you could not admire him gave you no pain in short powell owed to nature what holland owed to himself and if after all we are obliged to admit something of preminence on the side of powell and regret his loss as an actor we cannot refrain from heaving a deeper sigh when we reflect that in holland we lost a most valuable member of society before i quit this subject i shall relate an anecdote relative to the funeral of poor holland he was one of footes greatest favourities perhaps in some measure because the world said he was the retailer of his wit but there was no occasion holland had wit enough of his own  besides aristophanes dealt in the retail way himself george garrick being one of hollands executors with his usual good nature for no man possessed more undertook to manage the funeral in a way suitable to his friends circumstances for which purpose he went to chiswick and ordered a decent vault and such other preparations as he thought necessary hollands father was a baker foot was invited to the funeral which he certainly attended with unfeigned sorrow for exclusive of his real concern for the loss of a convivial companion whenever he had a serious moment he felt with very strong susceptibility while the ceremony was performing g garrick remarked to foot how happy he was out of respect to his friend to see every thing so decently conducted you see said he what a snug family vault we have made here  family vault said foot with the tears trickling down his cheeks damme if i did not think it had been the family oven   ross and smith were not immediately garricks disciples which was a misfortune to ross but smiths industry being always alive to his duty he sought every possible opportunity of improving by a correct study of the merit and manner of garrick thus have fools called holland and smith the copyers of garrick the fair liberal principle upon which they copied him was emulation not manner what painter or poet ought to blush for having studied corregio or dryden till he was capable of infusing the grace of the first and the energy of the latter into his picture or poem smith greatly to his credit studied garrick under this liberal idea and the public in consequence in their commendation of perfectness industry attention and gentlemanly demeanor strongly applauded those particular merits in this actor which he possessed and passed by trifling impediments which could not be called faults with the candor due to warm devotion and active exertion  ross was an object of much greater severity his indolence and supineness were intolerable and unpardonable for he certainly possessed very strong requisites as an actor but churchill throughout the rosciad did not write better truth or stronger satire than the two lines applied to this performer yet who shall deny that ross was sometimes and to his disgrace at will captivating and fairly able to stand up to barry whoever has by chance seen him in his best moods perform essex or alexander will agree with me in short he was a voluptuous man and particularly a great eater therefore he had not the perseverence to give the necessary attention to his profession and thus he happened to be admirable or insufferable in proportion as he was more or less plethoric  in comedy as in tragedy garrick led the train nay take it all in all it is difficult to say whether thalia and melpomene possessed him or he either of them with greater ardour for his devotion to each was equally sincere and they were to him equally propitious no wonder then with such a stimulus the actors of his day were emulous to attain the same perfection according to the force of their respective abilities which were so various and extensive that it is difficult to say who merits the first notice i shall therefore take them according to seniority  woodward though indifferently gifted by nature except as to his person which was so complete that he could not throw himself into an inelegant attitude possessed such sound principles of acting that he is for ever to be regretted there are characters in real life which appear out of nature these are fair game for authors and when they are well drawn did we not meet with performers of the admirable description of woodward we should lose the pleasure of seeing such characters well acted these characters are not general but particular nature and therefore it requires strong art and judgment to delineate them the great point is to steer between extravagance and vapidity a knowledge of effect completely understood by woodward  thus in all the coxcombs woodward must greatly have excelled cibber who designed and originally performed them for woodward even in voice which was the worst deduction from his merit by what i could ever understand had the advantage and when we consider that superadded to the experience he had gained by seeing them performed in their original manner he had the opportunity of improving on them by his own observation assisted by the elegance and gracefulness of his deportment there can be no doubt that these particular characters have never been performed to perfection but by him  when we go into a species of parts still more extravagant such as the braggart through all its gradations nothing could have been superior to woodward bobadil parolles bessus and others of a similar kind never had certainly upon the whole any such representative i have already drawn a slight comparison between woodward and the french actor dugazon the superiority however is greatly on the side of woodward the french stage knows nothing of that broad humor strong character and striking situation which characterize ours they have their coups de theater but the general effect is full of frivolity and seldom gets beyond sprightliness their bienseance is but another word for vapidity and then if dugazon had possessed the requisites of woodward which he certainly did not in any eminent degree the extravagance of dancourt well drawn as it was could not have afforded the same opportunity for a display of his talents as woodward found in shakespeare and jonson  yates was one of those meritorious actors who added to chaste nature becoming respectability he had his hardnesses and those who like churchill cavil in parcels and are too acrimonious to be candid may on this account condemn him in the lump but i should not despair of proving that yates had as good an understanding as churchill and that as an actor he accomplished his public duty upon honester and more respectable grounds than the other as an author  i know of no french actor so good as yates though had he been a frenchman the lisimons gerontes and every species of fathers and guardians characterized by humor and caprice would have been exactly in his way he had the best parts of bonneval dessesarts and bellecour on the english stage he resembled underhill but with considerable advantage no actor was ever more chaste more uniform more characteristic and though perhaps sometimes he overshot those particular spots which nature designed him to hit yet upon the whole his acting in an eminent degree was gratifying to the public and exemplary to stage  shuter whose strong nature and irresistible humor were highly and peculiarly captivating must be ranked as a theatrical wonder neither on the french nor on the english stage do we find any one to whom we can compare him his strong conception his laughable manner his perpetual diversity were his own and were displayed in a thousand various forms always extraordinary and yet always in nature the extremes of life were never so critically displayed as by shuter his performance of the miser and master stephen are incontrovertible proofs of this remark has any one seen him in corbaccio and will he tell me that acting ever went beyond it  when he went out of his way so the question was humor could any thing be superior to shuter i look upon him as far as it went to have been one of the best burletta singers in the world nothing upon earth could have been superior to his midas his great fault was indolence but eccentric qualities will naturally be accompanied by eccentric conduct thus we perceive in his acting great inequalities but those parts of it that were sterling were invaluably so and in proof of it see all those vain attempts at an imitation of him from edwin onwards that have degraded acting into buffoonery of which shuter had none through which even actors of good sense have expected to grow into reputation till mistaking the way they have made a sort of josephs coat of their acting and in proportion as they have pursued manner have lost sight of nature  weston was another of natures wonders he seemed as if he had possessed neither idea nor conception yet was he endowed with so many chaste and felicitous gifts that he uttered rather than acted but it was such utterance that the most accomplished acting never excelled the french know nothing of actors such as shuter and weston their naivete bears an implication that deserts simplicity and almost goes to cunning the ideas of the french in any one part of their conduct either on or off the stage are never inartificial they inhale caution wariness and distrust with their earliest breath and the first use they make of their tongues is to reason and this obtains among the very lowest descriptions of that nation therefore if authors fairly depict their manners though they may find and this will be rarely the case naivete they never will find what an ingenuous english mind understands by the word simplicity  nokes and norris as i have noticed already possessed similar gifts to weston whether in an equal degree it will be impossible for us to ascertain in a superior degree it will be impossible for us to allow but many of my readers have seen him in scrub dr last and other characters and i have nothing to do but appeal to their evidence to make out my assertion  foot ranked respectably as an actor a circumstance that has not been always granted for as peoples principles are supposed to be vitiated by keeping bad company so those who have been professedly mimics have been rarely allowed to have been good actors which is more an admitted than a real fact garrick was an incomparable mimic take the circumstance as it really is and the truth will be this mimickry is the easiest thing in the world acting the most difficult for if this were not admitted those who imitate cats dogs and birds as well as all the race of ventriloquists and mummers of every description would naturally be good actors on the contrary acting must have conception soul sensibility and all those mental qualities which mimickry has nothing to do with  foot was by no means a good mimic he knew singularity to be very catching and a strong recommendation with the superficial who admire more that which is merely plausible than that which is really substantial and therefore he put on something of this kind in order to heighten his acting which added to dress an extravagant manner and other artful resources was supposed to convey a likeness of the person represented who had never been seen by one of his auditors perhaps out of five hundred there were characters however where mimickry was totally unnecessary that foot performed admirably and many of those he wrote himself which were not merely calculated to ridicule individuals have not since him found adequate representatives  obrien who was snatched from the theater when he had arrived though young to great reputation would certainly have proved an actor of the first consequence the ease elegance and grace in his deportment were peculiar and his own and spite of his voice which for light characters was not by any means an impediment in the representation of a great variety of parts his acting was critically natural his manner interestingly impressive and his deportment uncommonly attractive  king whom i formerly compared to preville had and i am happy in common with every admirer of good acting to add has much more extensive merit than had that deservedly celebrated performer when we speak of french actors let their intrinsic merit have been what it might we can only give them credit for that which they have manifested preville performed all the valets and similar characters to such a degree of perfection that a revival of moliere and all celebrated authors was demanded to give opportunity for the display of his talents it is impossible to deny that he possessed in the words of his biographer intelligence variety deportment gaiety grace and nature but with all these admirable requisites he could not perform more than what was given him fortunately enough perhaps for as on the french stage it is a proverb that harlequin is always harlequin and crispin always crispin so preville was always preville and indeed so are french actors always french actors and the question is not so much how they would manage if they were trusted with contrast variety and diversity as how they are capable of contrasting varying and diversifying the eternal sameness of sentiment and situation which pervade the most perfect pieces on the french stage  le kain has been compared to garrick so has preville but the historian in fair justice is obliged to confess of the first that however the french actor had taste and knew how to support effect the english actor had the superiority on the side of nature and as to the other that garrick performed with equal celebrity tragedy and comedy which it is impossible to reconcile on the french stage a confession that sufficiently explains the confined ideas of acting on their theater  if preville therefore was to cope with king it could be only as to the valets for in no other way have they performed parts at all similar and when it is given which it easily will be that the french stage knows no characters of that description which require those powers of acting that are necessary in the performance of trapanti brass i am aware that brass is french but dancourts frontin and vanburghs brass are greatly different in point of value tom and various other parts on the english stage the having stronger situation to manage better humor to express and sounder effect to convey calls for greater talents and we are obliged to allow the superiority to incline according as we are biassed by the evidence of our senses  when we go further and point to such characters as touchstone malvolio all the bucks such as squire groom and sir harry beagle to which i could add a prodigious number of others in various ways but shall however content myself with mentioning sir peter teazle sir anthony absolute and lord ogleby which may now be witnessed in as great perfection as ever and to which every actor of the present day ought to bow out of devotion as to a precious relick it would be folly any longer to talk of a comparison between king and preville good english acting is like english punch of which the french know nothing but the lemonade  it is as difficult to liken king to any english actor those who performed characters in his style at the time of cibber seem to have been followed by yates who though he was as i have with pleasure observed an admirable actor had a manner perfectly distinct king is a performer who has thrown novelty into old characters consequence into new and nature into all indeed his leading feature is integrity which quality having been invariably his guide during his whole public and private conduct he has most respectably endeared himself to the world in general by a display of truth and nature from the stage and to a large circle of admiring friends by an exercise of benevolence good humor and every other social virtue  i lament that i cannot dwell more particularly on the merit of actors arthur was an actor of considerable merit havard and berry demand a tribute of respect sparks dyer collins martin and even burton bransby vaughan and many others claim a right to be spoken of as reputable members of the theater  aickin has performed at all times with judgment feeling and nature his information being extensive his knowledge profound and his discrimination critical he has often delighted and never offended and though he has not reached the summit of his profession he has maintained the height at which he arrived by no means a mediocre station firm and unshaken his guide understanding and his support good sense the two palmers were actors of great merit the only drawback on both was manner which in the first was too refined and in the other too vulgar parsons and dodd must be spoken of with warmth both these actors were favorites with garrick the discrimination of parsons in parents and guardians was his own and he went over this walk in a manner perfectly original which was the more admirable coming as he did after yates besides he had treasured up a great fund of knowledge and was capable of speaking with taste and judgment to every question concerning the arts a congenial feeling with those enlarged ideas which particularly belong to acting dodds great merit was altogether singularity which guided by a perfect knowledge of his profession rendered his exertions very respectable  there are also other actors who largely contributed to the reputation of the stage blakes baddeley and even holtam supported the characters of frenchmen with great reputation nor was their merit confined merely to that cast of parts moodys genteel and barringtons blackguard irishmen were excellent and much might be said to show that there was at that time scarcely a wheel in the theatrical machine that was not of material use in contributing toward the regular correct and constant rotation of the whole system  i cannot with any propriety finish this chapter without noticing that reddish wroughton henderson wilson lee lewis and many others were performers of considerable merit and it would give me real satisfaction to go particularly into an account of their various talents but as they do not properly come under my promise and as the earliest parts of an actors exertions are not so favorable to report as those when his reputation becomes more confirmed in which situation all those whom i have mentioned above stand it will be better for them and more becoming in me to let the judgment on their merits rest with the public by whom many of them are now remembered with pleasure  chap xi actresses having spoken of actresses in tragedy who sustained the first situations before garrick went to italy i shall now dwell a little upon those who strove to fill their vacant places after his return  mrs yates was a performer of extraoardinary merit if she had a fault it was an emulation of the best french actresses which gave a declamatory air to her delivery but in her it was less a fault than it could have been in any other actress because her voice was so wonderfully well calculated for this part of acting that what would have appeared monotonous in any other was in her penetrating to admiration in all the complaints of suffering innocence she was pathetically affecting her melancholy and despondency excited generous pity and her grief was repaid with the tear of commiseration  this however was not the boundary to her acting in scenes of animated passion and haughty fierceness her manner was commanding and her expression majestic she had all the grand and noble requisities of tragedy in great perfection if she personated pride she maintained it even in disappointment if greatness she never lost sight of its dignity however fallen her merits were in the nature of those of barry her queens were full of elevation and her lovers of strong sensibility but here we must stop grandeur and tenderness comprised the whole of her talents the intermediate passions had nothing to do with them they entirely consisted of the power to awe her auditors into admiration or melt them into tears  mrs barry had more of garricks merit in tragedy and was equal to quickness passion rage and an exposition of all the terrible and turbulent passions common grief was too tame for her expression she knew not how to insinuate herself into the heart her mode was to seize it admiration was not enough she must beget astonishment this difficult effect it must be confessed her acting very often produced but it seldom happens that such bold and forcible rokes of art are free from inequality it required garricks perfectness in a conception of all the passions to be excellent in these besides turbulent men may be admitted but turbulent women are unlovely and lose something of feminine delicacy  mrs pritchard was perhaps the only actress who had art enough to reconcile these jarring interests she was every where great every where impressive and every where feminine mrs barry was sometimes below and sometimes above the standard sometimes i had almost said vulgar and sometimes i may truly say wonderful to speak truth there could not be two actresses who were so well calculated to set off the perfections of each other as mrs yates and mrs barry the hiatus created by mrs yates the powers of mrs barry were exactly suited to fill and perhaps though i will not allow one to be completely equal taken seperately to mrs pritchard in jane shore or the other to mrs cibber in alicia yet their acting so exactly sorted together and there was by means of contract so peculiar a felicity in its operation that it is difficult to believe the public ever saw better collective effect than in those characters which were so often performed by mrs yates and mrs barry  these two actresses engrossed the principal reputation in their time mrs ward miss macklin mrs hamilton miss bride mrs fitzhenry and others had done the state some service but either at that time had disappeared or were disappearing mrs ward had many excellent requisites but she was unequal almost as unequal as ross she performed however at times to admiration and would have succeeded better had she not been at covent garden where the play was generally neglected for the pantomime and would have been performed to empty benches for the first half of it had not rich established a rule to admit no auditor during any part of the evening at less than full price  miss macklin performed at times respectably but she was a parrot and uttered what had been taught her by her father as a task got by heart which she seemed to have neither taste nor inclination for mrs hamilton the stock covent garden queen had a bustling something in her manner that might have been endured if the public had not been accustomed to mrs pritchard as to miss bride she retired so hastily ftom the stage that there was no forming any judgment of what she would have been had she remained and for mrs fitzhenry she crossed the shannon to exhibit a new species of acting which captivating as it might be in ireland was not relished here the reader will excuse me from mentioning inferior actresses to these in tragedy who however let their natural requisites have been what they might always succeeded best in proportion as they studied in the school of garrick  i must not however forget to notice miss young afterward mrs pope garrick had always what he used to call a bisque in his sleeve which was a stroke of policy useful both to him and to the theater it was no other than to fix upon an object of merit in order to curb other performers when he either knew or fancied their conduct was likely to grow overbearing or in any other way troublesome reddish was produced in this manner to awe powell and miss young was produced to lessen the consequence of mrs barry  with this lady garrick took most uncommon pains it was not however till after a variety of experiments that she gained that hold of the public which she long and deservedly kept it is needless to say what were her particular merits they are too recently in the recollection of the public to be easily forgot they had to the last a spice of her preceptor and even her manner of filling the stage gave a strong idea of stage conduct in use five and thirty years ago  as to actresses in comedy mrs clive maintained an undiminished reputation till she took leave of the public which was in      she had then lived to see her pupils mrs green and miss pope in possession of high public favor both of whom however were by no means mannerists nature had largely furnished them with mental wealth the experience of mrs clive had only shown them how to lay it it out to advantage thus though they were both admirable in chambermaids and hoydens and indeed almost every other comic part they were neither like each other nor like their principal though perfectly and always in nature  mrs green had humor even to drollery she had something of shuter and something of her father these were not exactly the talents of miss pope who however though perfectly unaffected herself exceeded mrs green in assuming finesse and affectation perhaps mrs clive never aped mock gentility better i cannot conceive how the aunt and the niece in the clandestine marriage can ever again be personated to the same degree of perfection but to dwell upon comparative excellence is next to cavilling some of my readers remember mrs clive many mrs green and all miss pope to the first of these classes my remarks will be recognized for truth as they relate to those three performers to the second as they regard the two last and the third in the characters miss pope has now the good sense to perform will have a just and a faithful idea of the manner in which parts of that description were acted before boldness and vulgarity usurped the place of truth and nature  with mrs abington came a species of excellence which the stage seems never before to have boasted in the same perfection the higher parts in comedy had been performed chastely and truly perhaps in these particulars more so than by this actress there was a peculiar goodness gleamed across the levity of mrs pritchard and by what we can learn of mrs bracegirdle who seems to have possessed the same captivating sort of manner which distinguished mrs abington she was in these characters natural and winning but it remained for her successor to add a degree of grace fashion and accomplishment to sprightliness which was no sooner seen than it was imitated in the politest circles  mrs bracegirdle let her merit have been what it might did not perform cibbers coquettes and though that author waited for mrs oldfield before he accomplished lady betty modish yet however admirable she might have been in the representation of those characters they did not appear to be so exactly in her way as lady townly and other parts which had a higher degree of consequence attached to them mrs abington kept critically to coquettes and there can be no doubt take the round of them through and it is pretty extensive that more uniform good acting never was manifested  i have already spoken comparatively of mrs abington and madame bellcour but with no view to associate them in elegance and grace which the characters madame bellcour personated would not in the same degree admit of the french actress personated french coquettes to admiration but i have already observed speaking of king and preville that every thing among the french is underwritten they know nothing of beatrice lady betty modish or millamant the likeness is in those higher kind of chambermaids who aped their mistresses and thus exactly as we have been accustomed to say king and abington instead of tom and phillis so it was impossible to speak of preville without assimilating the idea of bellcour  in addition to the grace the ease and the elegance with which mrs abington personated characters in high life and aped politeness in chambermaids her taste for dress was novel and interesting she was consulted by ladies of the first distinction not from caprice as we have frequently seen in other instances but from a decided conviction of her judgment in blending what was beautiful with what was becoming indeed dress took a sort of ton from her fancy and ladies both on the stage and off piqued themselves on decorating their persons with decency and decorum and captivating beholders by a modest concealment of those charms which in imitation of the french women who never knew the sensation or a blush the result of english feminine rectitude our females now to the disgrace of the age make it their study to expose  miss elliot was a charming actess maria in the citizen certainly never was properly represented but by her indeed the different characters which she performed with woodward after his return from ireland were admirably sustained and a few years would certainly have marked her as a very accomplished actress had not her early death deprived the stage of a most valuable ornament  i might with great propriety speak of other actresses and it would give me pleasure to dwell on their various merits but to mention those who were at the time i am confined to mere novices would be to place them in a disadvantageous point of view and to notice others who though respectable possessed only secondary situations it would be difficult to know where to stop i shall therefore content myself with having given this slight and i must confess inadequate description of those few whose abilities were the most prominent during the time garrick had the management of the theater  chap xii singers though i should conceive that i have said every thing on the subject of music itself and its composers that can be requisite or indeed that ought to occupy a place in this work it still remains for me to speak of singers i shall however confine myself to english singers many of whom have at different periods possessed admitted reputation equal to the italians and real reputation superior to them  though we know of arabella hunt mrs tofts mrs robinson and many other celebrated english female singers we are not so correct as to men and the reason is that nothing in the way of public singing has been considered of consequence enough to record except what related to the opera masks however had been performed with great celebrity and when the beggars opera begat so many musical pieces the theater gave such a tone of simplicity to english music that not only celebrated singers began to be known but those who had before conceived it indispensibly necessary to be musicians professionaly in order to attain reputation as singers were astonished to find that a good voice a correct ear a little feeling and an unaffected utterance embraced the whole mystery  every actor furnished with these materials became presently a singer the public began to feel instead of admire and that admiration which had so disgraced english manliness into effeminacy by lavishing so much money and so much praise on the treble of farinelli turned all at once into applause at the bass of leveridge as however it will better answer my purpose to bring before the readers view those singers whom some of them may remember i shall take the period when beard and mrs cibber were so greatly celebrated and carry the subject as far onward as will elucidate what i think it material to say upon this head  beard was a singer of great excellence his voice was sound male powerful and extensive his tones were natural and he had flexibility enough to execute any passages however difficult which task indeed frequently fell to his lot in some of handels oratorios but with these qualifications where the feelings were most roused he was of course the most excellent if he failed at all it was in acquired taste which i will venture to pronounce was a most fortunate circumstance for him for i never knew an instance where acquired taste did not destroy natural expression a quality selfevidently as much preferable to the other as nature is to art  i have already said that i consider beard taken altogether as the best english singer he was one of those you might fairly try by shakespeares speech to the actors he did not mouth it but his words came trippingly over the tongue he did not out herod herod but he begot a temperance that gave his exertions smoothness he never outstepped the modesty of nature nor made the judicious grieve in short he never did more than was set down for him he never set on a quantity of barren spectators to applaud while some necessary question of the song stood still he let his own discretion be his tutor and held the mirror up to nature well might one apostrophize in imitation of hamlet  oh there be singers that i have listened to and heard others applaud aye and encore too that neither having the accent of eunuch man or beast yet a mixture of all three or possessing a single trait of fancy taste or expression have so soared so sunk and so cantabileed that one would have thought some ventriloquist had made singers and not made them well they imitated braying so abominably beard was the reverse of all this besides he was very valuable as an actor in the jovial crew love in a village comus and artaxerxes he gave proof of this in a degree scarcely inferior to any body  low was a great favorite and perhaps had a more even and mellow voice than beard and in mere love songs when little more than a melodious utterance was necessary he might have been said to have exceeded him but it was in the nature of those particulars in a much inferior degree however that barry excelled garrick low lost himself beyond the namby pamby poetry of vauxhall beard was at home ever where  coming forwarder we get to vernon a most powerful instance of what good sense does for a singer he had no voice without which quality it is difficult to suppose a singer at all and it is impossible that he could have arrived to any degree of reputation had he not been favored by nature with strong conception quick sensibility and a correct taste with these and nothing more he made himself a most respectable favorite and it was impossible to hear him without saying what an admirable singer that man would have been had his voice been equal to his judgment vernon besides this was a good actor  reinhold who did not succeed so well will solve this seeming paradox relative to vernon and show clearly how much natural expression must invariably triumph over acquired taste reinhold was a good musician and not a bad actor he was really possessed of a voice not however of the first rate but taking the road in which so many singers have been bewildered leaving the manly part of singing for the less natural qualification of modulating through all the meanders of falcetto he injured his reputation and rendered those gifts of nature contemptible which in vernon would have commanded respect it is considered as a very curious thing that the best singers in all countries have been generally speaking the worst musicians but nothing can be easier to explain voices utter melodies and melodies are not the science itself but the principle on which it is formed  manzoli and lovatini were the best singers on the italian stage beard vernon and bannister on the english manzoli and guarducci were competitors in italy the public were to determine which sung best manzoli had the voice of the spectators guarducci of the musicians what was the consequence manzoli made a fortune every where guarducci did nothing any where   bannister was in many respects superior to any singer that perhaps ever lived the body and volume of voice which he possessed were only equalled by its sweetness and interest he had as much taste as much playfulness and as extensive power as the most fashionable of those singers who think singing totally consists in flexibility and that a voice cannot be exercised to perfection unless when it is flying to the bridge of the fiddle and sliding back again in chromatics but bannister had too much sense to use this power except when he had an inclination to show how ridiculous it is thus in the sonin law he sung water parted from the sea with as much taste as much sweetness and as much variety as tenducci at the same time that he introduced a degree of burlesque into it that gave the blush to modern singing bannister had no necessity to convey any thing of this extraneous kind into his general singing that was equally creditable to the poet to the musician and to himself instead of surprising he delighted and the fine manly accents he conveyed charmed the ear and interested the heart  female singers in england have been unquestionably superior take them all in all to those of any country in the world and it is little to say that at those several moments the public have disgracefully set themselves up to espouse the cause of italians as if music wholly depended on them and their caprice there were english women clearly of greater capacity every thing that happened at the time of mrs tofts mrs hunt and mrs robinson well pass by though perhaps it might not be difficult to prove that while these were neglected for cuzzoni and faustina and others according to the times when they appeared it was totally unnecessary to import italian singing and italian impertinence when singing in as great perfection was to be found in english women and modesty along with it  i am confirmed in this opinion by a comparative view of the english and italian female singers in my own recollection among the italian perhaps after all sestini was the best i can just remember those who came immediately before the buonna figliola and it has been my uniform remark that the italian women have sung better than the men but their plaintive singers have been the best and and we have never heard any of their cantabile singers who piqued themselves upon a large compass and the execution of difficult passages but their tone has been so nasal that we might have mistaken them for the hautboy or the clarinet that accompanied them scotti was a sweet singer zamperini a graceful singer indeed this last was a kind of female vernon but what were any of them in point of voice delicacy and sweetness compared to mrs arne miss brent or even mrs vincent but when we come forward and speak of mrs sheridan and miss harrop the merit of the italian females sinks to nothing  i regret that i am constrained to notice the different talents of these singers in a short and general way for i should to be glad to make out my position by expatiating largely on them mrs pinto possessing an exquisite voice and being under a master the great characteristics of whose musical abilities were natural ease and unaffected simplicity was a most valuable singer her power was resistless her neatness was truly interesting and her variety was incessant though she owed a great deal to nature she owed a great deal to arne without whose careful hand her singing might perhaps have been too luxuriant  mrs arne was deliciously captivating she knew nothing in singing or in nature but sweetness and simplicity she sung exquisitely as a bird does her notes conveyed involuntary pleasure and undefinable delight it should for ever be reiterated that singers of this description never outrage the poet nor the musician indeed i conceive that there is a species of ingratitude in such violation for without the poet and the musician what would become of the singer  mrs vincent like low depended almost upon her voice which was very charming in short it was that true english voice which has an evenness a fullness a solidity that one might analize so as to show that nothing italian can have she was deservedly a great favorite and sung songs of ease and sweetness with great delicacy  there is a kind of voice i will not say peculiarly english but much more beautiful and perfect and more common in england than any where else such a voice had mrs kennedy who had she have been suffered to keep to parts particularly adapted for her would have augmented that public admiration she so meritoriously excited to astonishment but by having the good nature to personate parts totally unfit for her a left handed policy in a manager by the bye who cannot keep up his real interest without keeping up the consequence of the performer we had perpetually the worst part of her singing in some light characters this conduct was particularly reprehensible in artaxerxes mrs kennedy was allotted the part from which the opera takes its title and in which she was certainly respectable but the songs were not in her voice and in every other respect it did not suit her she ought to have performed arbaces which was exactly in her compass and the different passages in the airs have a peculiar neatness which her voice was remarkably calculated to execute amid a thousand racking woes which is perhaps the most masterly song in the opera she would have sung with prodigious effect for it was extraordinary that her voice had as much flexibility as volume in short mrs kennedy was one of those singers who put us in mind of the heartiness of our national character which after fashion and folly have for a time flattered us out of it we resume just upon the same principle as we cherish a kind and sincere friend who forgetting our wanderings kindly points out the road to comfort and content  i could mention many other female singers of very respectable talents whose names the reader will supply for me among these however i ought to confine myself to theatrical singers i cannot help nevertheless reminding the public of the great and extraordinary merit of miss harrop and mrs sheridan both of whom were just seen and then lost  i own i prefer mrs sheridan before miss harrop and indeed before any singer i ever heard even to this moment but this is no ill compliment to miss harrop because charming and exquisite as they were her talents were confined to concert singing the talents of mrs sheridan had the experiment been made would been found to have been universal but the public were not so far to be obliged  those who have never heard mrs sheridan can be no more able to conceive the force and effect of her merit than i can be capable of describing it i can easily make it understood that if she was possessed of every perfection and free from every fault as a singer she must have been superior to every other but this is theory the practical part of the argument cannot be felt but by those who were fortunate enough to hear her who if they have any recollection and will take the trouble to repeat miltons passage uttered by comus immediately after he has heard the lady sing sweet echo they will find their sensations were at that time delighted equal to that description for indeed she took the prisoned soul and lapped it in elysium  i shall only say farther as to singing that it cannot be excellent except in proportion as it joins in correspondence which some writer has explained to mean intelligence of the heart with the poetry and the music it has to convey every thing extraneous every thing forced every thing in short as shakespeare expresses it overdone or come tardy of though it may surprise cannot delight and if it cannot delight it is from the purpose of singing and though unskilful auditors may applaud it cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of one of which must in the allowance of every man of sense outweigh a whole theater of others  chap xiii recapitulation having by every certain every probable and even every possible circumstance which i have considered necessary to select from those materials i supplied myself with for this undertaking endeavored to draw the readers attention to the antiquity of the stage its operation upon manners both generally and abstractedly its influence over the mind its capability of polishing and refining our social nature and those various ways in which in proportion as it is respectably and worthily conducted it may at all times be considered as an object of national importance i shall now very briefly recapitulate those leading particulars which may serve unerringly to demonstrate by what means it has at any time and in any country lost its consequence by what means that consequence has become irretrievable by what means it has or could have been retrieved and by what means alone it on possibly be kept up and established  the theater is a school of morality or it is nothing its orginal establishment in every country has had this broad feature the exploits of heroes the maxims of philosophers and the good of mankind were the foundation to which the fabric even to the superstructure however fancifully it might have been ornamented tended in all directions and as by one consent a stability of this adamantine kind could not have been confirmed but by the encouragement of workmen of the same description of those who reared the structure who were these authors and actors  every one of the consequences therefore which we are to examine are clearly traceable to this single source and it only remains to see whether at any time there has been such a dearth of good authors and actors as to weaken the theater by the absence of valuable exertions in which case no blame is to be any where imputed whether good authors and actors have expected terms that were unreasonable and such as could not possibly be accorded in which case the blame would be imputable to them or whether their labors have been exacted from them upon unworthy and degrading terms in which case common sense must impute the blame to their employers and lastly to what authority authors and actors ought to be amenable  though neither greece nor rome are exactly cases in point as to the illustration of this argument because in both instances the profligacy of the people brought on the moment which terminated the theater and the country together yet we have enough to go upon to show these positions to be critically right in the earlier periods of greece before comedy was generally established in short before aristophanes the theater was in the hands of poets and actors and under the inspection of government at which time it was as material an object in its place as the areopagus and held as distinguished a reputation it was managed by the great triumvirate but this was not enough judges were appointed and every exhibition underwent an ordeal but when aristophanes the most licentious poet that ever lived became possessed of the stage it soon hastened to destruction for no reason upon earth but because it was uncontrouled  in rome the theater could have no character because the actors had an ascendancy over the poets it was regulated certainly if the word could be properly be allowed me by government but of what nature were the regulations a crooked and even wicked policy by which the theater dictated to the people as a cloak for private treachery even augustus with all his patronage and all his attachment to genius tolerated rope dancers in preference to poets  the spanish theater for the same reason had as little character as the roman those who have read gil blas will see some notable proofs that poets were subservient to actors the portuguese theater was the shadow of the spanish the italian theater was a chaos of greek and roman rubbish and the german theater has as little answered the purpose of the stage owing to the uncontroled license permitted to poets who though not of the breed of aristophanes are nevertheless as dangerous to society for they have tainted the manners of europe and in particular of england with productions which violate probability wound morality terrify instead of delight menace instead of conciliate in short which among every outrageous and monstrous doctrine teach filial ingratitude encourage adultery and circulate such revolting and scandalous tenets as thirty years ago would have been spurned at by an english audience with ineffable indignation  if then we have seen that the conditions upon which alone the theater can stand firmly upon its true basis were only observed for a short time in primitive greece at what time and among what people has it ever enjoyed that reputation which according to the doctrine here laid down a combination of certain reciprocal interests are alone capable to give it i answer from corneille to voltaire almost uninteruptedly in france and from shakespeare to      in england except during the intervals from the restoration to bettertons secession during the fluctuations immediate previous to cibbers management and from cibbers secession to the      when garrick became manager  in france we shall not find any instance when the proprietors of the theater were managers indeed in general they were mere landlords and paid by a certain rent for the rest all which we have particularly seen the managers were actors committees of whom decided upon the reception of plays into the theater which were finally disposed of by the public and in every difference of opinion either concerning authors or actors or in any other possible way that could affect the interest of the theater the parties respectively had a right of appeal to court where all grievances were redressed and that the grand object might be always obtained by stimulating the exertions of actors their various merits were equitably estimated and when at length their labors were creditably ended it became as honorable to retire upon a pension from the stage as from the army or the navy  the face of the english management during those particular periods that i describe wore the same aspect which i have sufficiently gone over in a preceding chapter and which will abundantly prove the position i have here laid down the most material part of which has this tendency that whenever proprietors of theaters are neither actors nor authors and are no further connected with the interest of the concern than relates to the emolument it produces without being responsible for its general fame the exertions of authors and actors will infallibly be disregarded and the theater by receiving all its advantage from gewgaws and spectacle will sink from its reputation its consequence and its honor and lose its influence as a school of morality  i shall shortly state a few circumstances to confirm this last position and go over some particulars relative to the stage during the period between garricks return from italy and the disposal of the drury lane patent after which i shall take my leave of the reader  my arguments go to prove that emolument alone however obtained has been the view of all those who have bought into the theaters that the fame and fortune of those men without whose exertions the stage can have no legitimate pretension to public countenance have never been properly attended to and that therefore those means have been constantly resorted to however destructive to the general interest of the theater which are most likely to produce the fullest houses  when the licentiousness of the stage called for the animadversions of prynne and collier the patents were held by purchasers when cibber came at which time the proprietors only received a rent decency and decorum were restored during the time of highmore fleetwood amber and green and indeed till garrick the real interest of the theater was deserted authors and actors were considered as auxiliaries rather than principals and every species of profligacy and disorder prevailed during the whole management of garrick the theater enjoyed greater repute than ever it had known further than that to be consistent i have no title to investigate but it is nevertheless proper that i make out my position by showing the danger that may arise from extraneous interest  extraneous interest may ruin the theater it may consolidate the two theaters into one general interest that may hold authors and actors at defiance it may stretch the two theaters into the size of four it may pay enormous expenses by laying additional charges on the benefits of authors and actors which benefits after all by the admission of free tickets may at last be cut to nothing it may encourage contemptible performances which by the assistance of the newspapers may be crammed down the throats of the public after being damned on the first night it may import foreign immorality and call in the assistance of show and finery monsters and conjurations to the annihilation of english merit all this and a great deal more it may do now let us see how such consequences must infallibly operate  no theaters in the kingdom except those in london produce the smallest novelty if therefore performances of this description obtain at the two theaters they go through the whole nation and extend to ireland and scotland and therefore are sure the source being contaminated to poison the general taste thus genius for whose support surely the theaters were originally intended may retire unknown and neglected to deplore the ingratitude of the most benevolent country upon earth and therefore let the theater be supported by whatever property it may it can never expect any thing like permament fame or fair reputation unless the primary consideration be the encouragement of authors and actors  there are yet some gleanings relative to the state of the stage it is necessary that i should notice by what means the question came to be decided in relation to full price which having been originally established to reimburse the expense of new pantomimes had grown so enormously into an abuse that managers announced it when they thought proper this at length produced a riot which began at drury lane where garrick with great good sense redressed the grievance covent garden however resisted under an idea that such performances as artaxerxes were even more expensive than pantomimes considerable sums being upon those occasions laid out for extra vocal and instrumental performers the public however persisted and upon beards obstinacy who was very ill advised they completely gutted the house the repairs took a fortnight out of the season and after a few of the ringleaders had been imprisoned and the manager had reflected on his folly it was agreed that full price should only be allowed during the run of a new pantomine this stipulated the house opened with the play of all is well that ends well and nothing has disturbed this question since  nothing material happened after this till the dispute between the covent gardenman agers a few years after their purchase of the parent colman had taken care to invest himself with such power by the instrument of partnership drawn up among them that the court of chancery after a very expensive suit decreed him competent to decide without control upon every subject for said baron smythe who was one of the judges the seals being in commission otherwise the agreement must have meant like trinculo in the play that he was to be king and his partners were to be viceroys over him this dispute was at length amicably adjusted by the secession of colman who sold his share to the rest of the proprietors  the business of footes primitive puppet show which i have already spoken of fieldings left handed interference relative to the beggars opera which he maintained created an additional number of thieves every time it was performed an assertion the public considered as unfounded and a bold innovation on their pleasures macklins mad business about reddishs hissing him which ended by a legal decision in his favor and his discharge from the theater and garricks retirement a most awful moment for the stage are all now which i conceive necessary to notice unless i were to go into such kind of minutie as in no respect regards the general management of the theater or in any respect its credit i shall therefore merely add that in      garrick resigned the concern into the hands of the present proprietor and that on the twentieth of january      the world had to lament the loss of this admirable and very extraordinary man the most natural the most forcible the most correct and the most melancholy memento to whose fame are the words which shakespeare makes hamlet apply to his father and which garrick applied to shakespeare we shall not look upon his like again  to this period i confine myself as the proper boundary to a history of the stage for my own part i will not toil any further i have not the heart the conscience the courage to do it and if any other should choose to risk the consequences of pursuing such a task i heartily wish him well through his fatigue in my idea the catastrophe is accomplished the play is over and therefore i drop the curtain at the death of garrick but as the truth of this position will be questioned it is but fit i give the most satisfactory reasons in my power for this conduct i am but a servant of the public and born for their use i live but to oblige them  because then i will not incur the suspicions of an invidious wish to wound the feelings of men who be their abilities what they may exert that portion of talents with which nature has favored them for the rational amusement of the public and who if they fail have frequently to thank false taste in the encouragement of fanciful experimental and innovating writers to the outrage of probability truth reason and the exclusion of weeping nature and offended morality i drop the curtain at the death of garrick  because in pursuing the truth and fidelity of an historian i will not run a risk of reiterating the miseries and theatrical troubles in the reign of fleetwood i drop the curtain at the death of garrick  because i will not painfully rouse my feelings to deplore that the public will not wake from their supiness rally their pride resume their judgment and even pity their own weakness in permitting the public prints in the place of honest truth and fair candor to set up a corrupt system of puffing of palming off miserable dross for sterling gold and of dictating to audiences prescribed principles by which they are arrogantly required to applaud what their duty to their pride to their understandings to their feelings to their relatives and to society forbids them to tolerate i drop the curtain at the death of garick  lastly because i will not go into the disgracious and hateful task of reprobating in merited terms the conduct of managers in establishing or the want of spirit in the public in permitting coffeerooms lobbies and other receptacles for the avowed purpose of giving opportunity to estrange the affections of young men from their parents and of husbands from their wives and families by an open unmasked and shameless intercourse with prostitutes to which places they are virtually invited by public advertisement as a lounge previous to their admission at half price to the disgust annoyance and terror of modesty for these and many many other cogent and similar reasons i drop the curtain at the death of garrick
