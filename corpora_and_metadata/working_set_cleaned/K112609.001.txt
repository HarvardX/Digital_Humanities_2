anne   the beauties of biography a selection of the lives of eminent men carefully digested from correct and approved pvblications amongst which are the lives of peter abelard joseph addison alfred the great aechylus mark aikenside ali bey dr amory bp atterbury dr arbuthnot ashmole sir george ascue etc   and many more eminent for their abilities as statesmen warriors poets philosophers etc  the whole forming a pleasing assemblage of entertainment and instruction  illustrated with several heads engraved by eminent artists  london printed for g riebau no     strand        preface the importance of history as an object of studious attention has been so frequently illustrated and so generally admitted that to attempt fresh arguments in support of its extensive utility would be as superfluous as it would be skeptical and ridiculous to bring it into question but history when employed in elucidating public concerns and recording national transactions however important to the statesman or amusive to the politician does not come so immediately home to the concerns and feelings of mankind as the particular branch of this literary science which develops the sources of individual action and traces the footsteps of eminent characters from the vale of obscurity to the sublimities of fame or the splendid abodes of opulence and power the fate of brave or injured nations may it is true call forth our sympathetic feelings and the exploits of heroic armies may warm the gratified soul with the enthusiasm of admiration but he who devotes his labors to the narrative of facts like these though he may claim a more unfading laurel as his reward confers not an equal obligation on society with him who dedicating his attention to the minuter but more philosophical branch of history perpetuates the conduct and characters of individuals and preserves in durable colors the mental features of those with whom we might desire to assimulate or whose example it should be our wish to shun the former province of the historian it is true fills the mind with more grand ideas and better serves to produce the speculative pleasures or awakens surprise and admiration it is from the latter we are to seek for the instruction which in every department of life may be found of practical importance  biography does not only rouse to emulation by showing the rewards of genius and application pointing out the proper objects of patronage and renown and holding up to our view the most splendid and attractive examples it furnishes also the means of success by putting us in possession of the experience of former candidates and thus smoothing before us the thorny and intricate paths which conduct to the favored goal to speak by a more familiar figure biography unfolds the motives and sources of human conduct it displays the minute springs which first set the grand machine in action and traces from wheel to wheel the intricate movements by which the whole system is put in motion and the important effects are produced while general history affords only the representation of facts leaving the mind to wander in the regions of uncertainty vaguely conjecturing by what means similar seize are again to be expected in short biography may be called the key of the sanctum sanctorum by means of which we are initiated among the secret mysteries of those apparent miracels which in the grand sphere of human action have contributed to surprise and ennoble mankind while the history of nations and events leaves us awestruck without the temple gazing with wonder at the dazzling phoenomena  the foregoing remarks are applicable to biography in general and would in some respects not only suit the present publication but be equally pertinent as an introduction to the labors of the philosophic plutarch and the light sketches of the playful but penetrating chesterfield but the biographia addenda with which we have enriched our work makes it necessary we should particularly notice the superior advantages of modern biography  man is at all times and in all countries the same that is to say as to the admixture of vices and virtues powers and weakness and therefore the history of man in every age in every country is a serious and instructive object for mans attention but those qualities and endowments those blemishes and perfections are differently called into action at different periods and in different places by means of the prevalence of climate and of habit of customs of accidents and examples so as to produce various and widely dissimilar modulations nay with so much latitude is the general maxim of the uniformity of human nature as a mass to be understood that blind indeed to rationality and experience must be the pretended philosopher who should not admit that the different influences of external causes at different times and in different countries produce not only an infinite diversity of exterior deportment and appearances but also the most material actual differences and changes in human character so far as relates to the state and interests of society and to whatever endowments are necessary for the advancement and happiness of individuals  ages as well as nations have their different complexions nor are the shades of mind less curiously and progressively diversified than those of cutaneous tint and physiognomical expression the same principle of human nature therefore which leads us rather to be delighted with the portraiture of a contemporary friend than with the effigy of long mouldered ancestors or the heroes of distant climes will occasion us to peruse with more pleasure the lives of those who have become famous in our own days and who have distinguished themselves within the sphere we ourselves are to move than the recorded exploits of such as have neither by age nor country any hold upon our prejudices or claim to our affections nor is this the only foundation of preference upon which this species of biography rests pleasure it is true is a useful auxiliary to literature and study whether considered as an object of allurement or a consequent gratification but useless above every rank and order of society are the tribe of writers if to amuse is the only object at which they aim a principle like this would degrade the sons of science to a level with the grasshopper that chirrips in the fields or the fly that flutters his painted wings among the blossoms of the spring  if it be instructive to con over the lessons of policy and valor which our plain rough ancestors taught when policy and valor were in their infant state and to note the rude manner in which these principles were by them exerted how indispensible is it that we call in the aid of biography to conduct us to the camps and the cabinets of those who have entered upon the scene of exertion but shortly before us and who consequently are our more proper guides and our more able instructors  ancient and foreign biography may it is true show us the general principles and grand traits of human nature and tend to the formation of steady character but they are the minutiae which secure a mans prosperity in life and tend to stamp his reputation with the world and he who should attempt the acquirement of these from any but his contemporaries and compatriots would make no better figure in the season of bustle and action than he who with untutored and antiquated courage should twanging the indian bow in the face of an european phalanx defend himself with a breast plate and target against the thunder of modern artillery hence then it is evident not only that the proper study of mankind is man but that the most important lesson in the course of this study is that which teaches us to consider man under all the impressions which the climate and age we live in have stamped upon his character  this branch of study is equally essential whether we consider it as the mean of diving into the hearts and characters of others or of assisting and directing ourselves in the departments of life to which by chance or inclination we are attached in the former case it enables us to detect the fallacy of habitual delusion in the latter it points out the track which we ought in prudence to pursue  as to the particular object to which the study of biography should be directed inclination and caprice may be the directors of many while with others profession or other circumstances of interest or attachment must necessarily determine and though this first volume presents but few examples of this modern cast it is intended in the prosecution of the work to give so ample a collection as to furnish abundance of argument both for the amusement and instruction of the reader by whatever taste or profession he may be directed in his studies  introduction among all the literary pursuits of life none claim a greater attention than the instructive study of biography  it has advantages superior to general history it represents great men detached from the crowd of other actors and by descending into a detail of their actions and characters it throws more light on human nature excites more to imitation and exhibits the human mind in all forms and situations the striking facts of history the rise of states or the fall of kingdoms affect the reader but for a moment the monarch or the statesman alone find opportunities to reduce the knowledge gained from them to practice but when biography shows the effects of vice or folly in an individual or when by the exertion of any virtue we behold a shining character rising to honor or enabled to drive misfortunes far from him  then each person naturally makes the application to himself and if he is possessed of common sense will avoid the vice which may reduce him to the situation of the former and carefully cherish that virtue which has befriended the latter  in depicting the manners of a monarch we may not only admire the shining traits of the character but also learn to imitate him in his domestic virtues in characters of a lower rank we all find ourselves highly interested and may from every recited fact draw some useful instruction  a select system of biography therefore is and ought to be esteemed a most useful as well as entertaining publication and it will be the study of the editor to make choice of such lives only as will instruct the reader without proving tedious  biography life of francis aarsens francis aarsens lord of someldyck and spyck was one of the greatest ministers for negotiation the united provinces could ever boast of his father cornelius aarsens was register to the states and being acquainted with mr plessis mornay at the court of william prince of orange he prevailed upon him to take his son under him with whom he continued some years john olden barnevelt who presided over the affairs of holland and the united provinces sent him afterward agent into france where he learned to negociate under those profound politicians henry iv villeroy silleri rossie jaonnin etc and acquitted himself in such a manner as to attain their approbation soon after he was invested with the character of an ambassador being the first who was recognized as such by the french court at which time henry iv declared that he should take precedence next to the venetian minister he resided in france fifteen years during which time he received great marks of esteem from the king who created him a knight and baron and for this reason he was received amongst the nobles of the province of holland however he became at length so odious to the french court that they desired to have him recalled he was afterward deputed to venice and to several german and italian princes upon occasion of the troubles in bohemia he was the first of three extraordinary ambassadors sent to england in    0 and the second in      in which latter embassy he was accompanied by the lord of brederode as first ambassador and heemsvliet as third to treat about the marriage of prince william son to the prince of orange he was likewise ambassador extraordinary at the french court in      and the cardinal de richlieu having just taken the administration of affairs into his hands and knowing he was an able man made use of him to serve his own purpose he died in a very advanced age and his son who survived him was reputed the wealthiest man in holland  abaris a celebrated sage of antiquity whose history and travels have been the subject of much learned discussion such a number of fabulous stories were told of him that herodotus himself seems to scruple to relate them he tells us only that this barbarian was said to have traveled with an arrow and to have taken no sustenance but does not acquaint us with the mavelous properties which were attributed to that arrow nor that it had been given him by the hyperborean apollo with regard to the occasion of his leaving his native country harpocration tells us that the whole earth being infested with a deadly plague apollo upon being consulted gave no other answer than that the athenians should offer up prayers in behalf of all other nations upon which several countries deputed ambassadors to athens among whom was abaris the hyperborean in this journey he renewed the alliance between his countrymen and the inhabitants of the island of delos it appears that he also went to lacedaemon since according to some writers he there built a temple consecrated to proserpine the salutary it is asserted that he was capable of foretelling earthquakes driving away plagues laying storms etc he wrote several books as suidas informs us himerius the sophist applauds him for speaking pure greek which attainment will be no matter of wonder to such as consider the ancient intercourse there was between the greeks and hyperboreans if the hebrides or western islands of scotland says mr toland were the hyperboreans of diodorus then the celebrated abaris was of that country and likewise a druid having been the priest of apollo suidas who knew not the distinction of the insular hyperboreans makes him a scythian as do some others misled by the same vulgar error though diodorus has truly fixed his country in an island and not on the continent indeed the fictions and mistakes concerning our abaris are infinite however it is by all agreed that he traveled quite over greece and from thence into italy where he conversed familiarly with pythagoras who favored him beyond all his disciples by instructing him in his doctrines especially his thoughts of nature in a more compendious method than he did any other this distinction could not but be very advantageous to abaris the hyperborean in return presented the samian as though he equalled apollo himself in wisdom with the sacred arrow on which the greeks have fabulously related that he sat astride and flew upon it through the air over rivers and lakes forests and mountains in like manner as our vulgar still believe particularly those of the hebrides that wizards and witches fly whithersoever they please on their broomsticks the orator himerius abovementioned though one of those who from the equivocal sense of the word hyperborean seem to have mistaken abaris for a scythian yet describes his person accurately and gives him a very noble character they relate says he that abaris the sage was by nation an hyperborean appeared a grecian in speech and resembled a scythian in his habit and appearance he came to athens holding a bow in his hand having a quiver hanging on his shoulders his body wrapped up in a played girt about the loins with a gilded belt and wearing trowsers reaching from his waist downward by this it is evident continues mr toland that he was not habited like the scythians who were always covered with skins but appeared in the native garb of an aboriginal scot as to what relates to his abilities himerius informs us that he was affable and pleasant in conversation in dispatching great affairs secret and industrious quicksighted in present exigencies in preventing future dangers circumspect a searcher after wisdom desirous of friendship trusting little to fortune and having every thing trusted him for his prudence neither the academy nor the lycaeum could have furnished a man with fitter qualities to travel so far abroad and to such wise nations about affairs no less arduous than important and if we further attentively consider his moderation in eating drinking and the use of all those things which our natural appetites incessantly crave joining the candor and simplicity of his manners with the solidity and wisdom of his answers all which we find sufficiently attested it must be owned that the world at that time had few to compare with abaris  abbadie james an eminent protestant divine born at nay in bern in      first educated there under the famous john la placette and afterward at the university of sedan from thence he went into holland and germany and was minister in the french church at berlin he left that place in    0 came into england was some time minister of the french church in the savoy london and was made dean of killaloe in ireland he died at st mary le bonne near london in      aged    he was strongly attached to the cause of king william as appears in his elaborate defense of the revolution and his history of the assassinationplot he had great natural abilities which he improved by true and useful learning he was a most zealous defender of the primitive doctrine of the protestants as appears by his writings and that strong nervous eloquence for which he was so remarkable enabled him to enforce the doctrines of his profession from the pulpit with great spirit and energy he published several works in french that were much esteemed the principal of which are a treatise on the truth of the christian religion the art of knowing ones self a defense of the british nation the deity of jesus christ essential to the christian religion the history of the last conspiracy in england written by order of king william iii and the triumph of providence and religion or the opening the seven seals by the son of god  abbot george who afterward was elevated to the sea of caerbury possessed extraordinary abilities his high rank in the church and influence in public affairs deserve that the circumstances of his life should be transmitted with accuracy to posterity he was born october      at guilford in surry of worthy parents remarkably disti by their steady zeal for the protestant religion while his m was pregnant with this son she is said to have had a remarkable dream which proved at once an omen and an instrument of his fortune she dreamed she was told if she would eat a jack or pike the child she went with would prove a son and rise to great preferment not long after she accidentally caught a jack in a pail of water taken out of the river way and had an opportunity of fulfilling her dream this story was much talked of and coming to the ears of some persons of distinction they offered to become sponsors to the child which was accepted and they afterward showed many testimonies of their affection to their godson while at school and at the university this is the account given by mr aubrey in his antiquities of surry who seems to have inquired much about it when he was of a proper age he was sent with his elder brother robert to a free school erected by king edward vi in their native town of guilford and having passed through the rudiments of literature he was in      removed to the university of oxford and entered a student in baliol college  november         being then bachelor of arts he was elected probationer fellow of his college and afterward proceeding in the faculty of arts he entered into holy orders and became a celebrated preacher in the university he commenced bachelor of divinity in      and proceeded doctor in that faculty in may      and in the month of september of the same year he was elected master of university college at this time the first differences began between him and doctor laud which subsisted as long as they lived and were the cause of abbot arch bishop  canterbury great uneasiness to both in the year      he published a latin work which did him great honor and was afterward reprinted at frankfort in germany the title questiones sex totidem praelectionibus in scholae theologica oxoniae pro forma habitis discussae et disceptatae anno      in march      he was installed dean of winchester in the room of dr heron who was preferred to the bishopric of ely he was never dean of gloucester as asserted by some writers in   00 he was vice chancellor of oxford and distinguished himself while in that high office by the opinion he gave with respect to refixing the cross in cheapside about which there were great disputes but in the end he carried his point against dr bancroft then bishop of london which gained him great reputation he published the same year his sermons on the prophet jonah which were received with great applause in   0  he was again chosen vice chancellor of the university and discharged that office with general approbation the succeeding year the translation of the bible which is now in use was made by direction of king james dr abbot was one of the eight divines in the university of oxford to whom the care of translating part of the new testament was committed he likewise published this year an answer to dr hills reasons for upholding popery in   0  he was a third time vice chancellor and the succeeding year he is said to have had a share in the troubles of laud who was called to an account by the vice chancellor dr ayrey for a sermon preached before the university that year he lost both his father and mother in   0  dr abbots great patron thomas sackville earl of dorset lord high treasurer of england and chancellor of the university of oxford died suddenly at the council table at whose funeral dr abbot preached a sermon which was afterward printed and generally commended after his decease dr abbot became chaplain to george earl of dunbar treasurer of scotland one of king jamess early favorites and who had long a very high share in his esteem with him he went this year into scotland in order to assist in the execution of an important design for establishing an union between the churches of the two kingdoms in this he behaved with such prudence and moderation as gained him a very high character and is thought to have been the first step to his future preferment while he was at edinburgh a prosecution was commenced against george sprot a notary of aymouth for having been concerned in gowries conspiracy eight years before for which he was tried before sir william heart lord justice general of scotland condemned and executed a large account of this affair was drawn up by the judge and a narrative prefixed thereto by dr abbot who had been eyewitness of all that passed this was published at london in order to settle the minds of the people with regard to that conspiracy which had been hitherto looked upon as a very mysterious affair the king well knew the difficulties to be encountered in those northern parts and it gave him a high opinion of the abilities of the man who was able to overcome them and when another set of men raised apprehensions in the kings mind he had recourse to dr abbot thus when the king was engaged in the mediation of peace between spain and the united provinces he demanded the advice of the convocation then fitting as to the lawfulness of espousing the cause of the states in their claim of independence the convocation instead of satisfying the kings scruples launched at once into the wide sea of politics the king wrote a letter on this subject to dr abbot which is an incontestible proof of the confidence he had in him and the doctor stood so high in favor that on the death of dr overton in april      he was on the kings recommendation promoted to the united sees of litchfield and coventry but this did not appear to his majesty a sufficient recompense and therefore in less than a month he was translated to the bishopric of london vacant by the death of dr ravis  it was but a short time that he possessed these bishoprics and yet he so remarkably distinguished himself by the diligent performance of his function by constant preaching and by expressing the utmost readiness to promote learning and learned men that he obtained a general good character  while the bishop was thus employed a new opportunity offered of the kings testifying his esteem of and confidence in him by the vacancy of the archiepiscopal see of canterbury on the  d of november    0 on the death of dr bancroft the court bishops immediately cast their eyes upon the celebrated dr andrews then bishop of ely and pointed him out to the king as one sufficiently qualified to undertake the government of the church they thought this recommendation joined to the kings known regard for this eminent man enough to secure his promotion to the primacy but without taking the advice of those prelates his majesty preferred bishop abbot to the throne of canterbury on which he was seated on the  th of april      and on the   d of june following was sworn of his majestys most honorable privy council thus we see him before he had arrived at the age of fifty exalted to the highest dignity in the church  at this time he was in favor both with prince and people and appears to have had a considerable hand in all the great transactions in church and state he was never esteemed very fond of power or desirous of carrying his prerogative to an extraordinary height yet as soon as he had taken possession of the archbishopric he showed a steady resolution in the maintenance of the rights of the high commission court and would not submit to lord cokes prohibition he likewise showed his concern for the interest of the protestant religion abroad by procuring his majestys application to the states general against conrade vorstius whom they called to the professorship of leyden in which affair sir ralph winwood was employed and when it was found difficult to obtain from the states that satisfaction which the king desired his grace in conjunction with the lord treasurer salisbury framed an expedient for contenting both parties in all probability this alarmed some of the warm churchmen at home who were by no means pleased with the kings discountenancing abroad those opinions which themselves favored in both universities but whatever their sentiments upon this matter might be archbishop abbot seems to have had as great concern for the church as any one when he thought it really in danger this appears by a short and plain letter of his to sir ralph winwood about one mr ammiot who had been appointed preacher in the congregation at the hague of whom the bishop says that he was very capable to breed up the captains and soldiers there in mutiny and faction and consequently very unfit for his office his great concern for the true interest of religion made him a zealous promoter of the match between the elector palatine and the princess elizabeth and that prince coming here in october      his grace invited the nobility his attendants to an entertainment at his archiepiscopal palace at lambeth where though unexpected the elector himself appeared to show his great respect for the archbishop and was so well pleased with his welcome that when he feasted the members of the privy council at essex house he showed particular respect to the archbishop and those who attended him the festivity occasioned by the arrival of the elector palatine was interrupted for a time by the illness and death of henry prince of wales in the   th year of his age our prelate had the melancholy office of attending that accomplished prince in his dying moments and of preaching his funeral sermon  on the fourteenth of february following the marriage of the elector with the princess elizabeth was solemnized with great splendor the archbishop performing the ceremony on a stage erected in the middle of the royal chapel and his electoral highness before his departure made a present of plate to the archbishop as a proof of the just sense he had of the pains his grace had taken in accomplishing his marriage and as an additional mark of his confidence he wrote to him from canterbury relative to the causes of that discontent with which he left england  the concern his majesty had shown for removing arminius and vorstius had given their followers in holland so much uneasiness that hugo grotius the great champion of their cause was sent over to england to endeavor to mitigate the kings displeasure and if possible to give him a better opinion of the remonstrants as they began to be called and we have a very singular account of the man and of his negotiation from the pen of our archbishop  in the spring of the year      the affair of the charter house was settled his grace and the rest of the trustees took possession of that place pursuant to the will of mr sutton an affair happened about the same time which disturbed the primate not a little  this was the famous case of the divorce between the lady francis howard daughter to the earl of suffolk and robert earl of essex her husband which has been always considered as one of the greatest blemishes of king jamess reign though the part the archbishop of canterbury acted added much to his reputation the circumstances that attended this affair might possibly lessen the kings favor to him in some respects but he still retained a great share of it as appears by the raising of his brother to the sea of salisbury in the year      but with queen anne he stood always on the best terms he made use of his interest with her majesty to engage her to recommend mr george villiers so well known afterward to his majestys favor for which at that time the young man was so grateful as to call him father and desire his advice as to his behavior which the archbishop very freely gave him happy would it have been for him if he had always followed those counsels  toward the close of the next year the famous antonio de dominis archbishop of spalato took shelter here from the persecution with which he was threatened by the pope for discovering his dislike both of the doctrine and discipline of the church of rome and was very kindly received by his majesty who was pleased to order the archbishop to entertain him till he was otherwise provided for by the king  in the spring of the year      our archbishop lost his brother the bishop of salisbury and before his grief was well over for so near a relation he met with fresh disturbance from the kings declaration for permitting sports and pastimes on the lords day this declaration was ordered to be read in church and the archbishop being at croydon when it came thither had the courage to forbid it being read which however the king winked at notwithstanding there were some about him who let no opportunity slip of irritating him against this prelate his grace did a great service this year to the protestant religion by procuring the manuscript of father pauls excellent history of the council of trent the person employed to negociate the affair was mr nathaniel brent who with no small hazard to himself found means to convey the whole copy safe to england the end of this year proved as disagreeable to the bishop as its beginning in autumn the queen his gracious mistress fell ill of that distemper which brought her to her end the archbishop himself began also to grow infirm and finding himself less fit for the affairs of the world resolved to enter upon a great and good design which he had long meditated as a testimony of his regard to his native town of guilford where on the fifth of april      he was present when sir nicholas kemp laid the first stone of his hospital which the archbishop afterward nobly endowed toward the end of this year the elector palatine accepted the crown of bohemia which occasioned great disputes in the councils of king james some desiring that his majesty should not interfere in this matter from a foresight that it would produce a war in germany others again believing that both natural affection to his son and daughter and a just concern for the protestant interest ought to have engaged him warmly to support the new election the archbishop agreed in sentiment with the last mentioned party and not being able at that time to attend the privy council he wrote his mind with great plainness and freedom to the secretary of state the next year was in a great measure spent in debates and negociations upon this subject the archbishops declining state of health making exercise necessary for him he was accustomed to make a tour in summer into hampshire and being invited by the lord zouch to hunt in his park he there met with the greatest misfortune that ever befell him for while hunting he let fly a barbed arrow from a crossbow at one of the deer and it unfortunately struck peter hawkins lord zouchs keeper in the left arm who had been warned more than once to keep out of the way by which wound a large blood vessel being pierced he bled to death in an hours time this unforeseen accident threw the archbishop into a deep melancholy though he was not conscious to himself of the least inadvertency or indiscretion and throughout his whole life he observed a monthly fast on a tuesday the day on which this fatal accident happened he also settled an annuity of twenty pounds on the widow  this affair made a very great noise and there wanted not some to represent it in a sinister light to king james but his majesty gave his judgment of the matter in a short and clear sentence  an angel  said he might have miscarried in this sort when he was afterward informed of the legal penalties which his grace had incurred by this accident he wrote him a consolatory letter in which among other things he told him that he would not add affliction to his sorrow or take one farthing from his chattels which were forfeited by law the archbishop immediately retired to his hospital at guilford there to wait the decision of the great points as to the irregularity which some imagined he had incurred for it happened that at this juncture there were four bishops elected but not consecrated and all except dr davenant scrupled the archbishops capacity to lay hands upon them till he was declared free from all imputation as to this fact the king being informed of this directed a commission to consider and resolve the three following questions   whether the archbishop was irregular by the fact of involuntary homicide the bishop of winchester the two judges and the two civilians were very clear that he was not irregular but the other five thought he was   whether that act might tend to scandal in a churchman the bishop of winchester the lord chief justice hobart and dr steward doubted all the rest agreed that a scandal might be taken though not given   how his grace should be restored in case the king should follow the decision of those commissioners who had found him irregular all agreed that could not be otherwise done than by restitution from the king but they varied in the manner some thought it should be done by the king and by him alone in the same patent with the pardon others were for a commission from the king directed to some bishops judge dodderidge and sir henry martin were desirous it should be done both ways for abundant caution this return was made to his majesty and accordingly a pardon and a dispensation passed the great seal by which his majesty assoiled the archbishop from all irregularity etc if any was incurred and declared him capable of all metropolitical authority such was the close of this business after a great variety of proceedings and many arguments published on both sides yet all this could not satisfy the minds of those who had scrupled his power of laying on hands they petitioned the king that they might not be compelled to wound their consciences by submitting to such consecration and in compliance with their desire the bishop of lincoln was consecrated in king henry the sevenths chapel by the bishops of london worcester etc and the bishop of sarum exeter and st davids in the chapel of the bishop of londons palace by the same  it does not appear that his grace was at all lessened in the kings favor or his courage in any degree abated by the suggestions of his enemies on the contrary we find him in the year      opposing the spanish match a thing the king had set his heart upon with the greatest firmness and even venturing to give his sentiments under his hand on that subject in terms vigorous and emphatic the king however remained fixed in his resolution and the articles agreed on for the said marriage were sworn to in the presence of the archbishop and other great officers of state notwithstanding which they never took effect in the parliament that met on the   th of february       our prelate took an active part in the measures which were then pursued for persuading the king to dissolve his treaties with spain relating to the marriage and the palatinate he delivered both the address and the remonstrance which were presented to his majesty from the two houses on this occasion and introduced the remonstrance with a preamble expressing the joy of the parliament that the king had shown himself sensible of the insincerity of the spaniards and of the indignities offered by them to his son and daughter this part of the preamble appears to have given some offense to james the first indeed dr abbot was remarkably zealous in every thing in which the protestant religion was concerned the archbishop thenceforward assisted seldom at council being hindered chiefly by his infirmities but in the kings last sickness he was called and attended with great constancy received the highest marks of the kings confidence and was near him when he expired  at the coronation of king charles the first the archbishop set the crown upon his head though he was extremely weak and much troubled with the gout but he visibly declined in that monarchs favor and the duke of buckingham who was his declared enemy watched an opportunity to make him feel the weight of his displeasure this was at last taken on his refusing to license a sermon preached by one dr sibthorpe to justify and promote a loan which the king had demanded this sermon was preached at northampton in the lent assizes      before the judges and was transmitted to the bishop with the kings direction to license it which he refused to do and assigned reasons for it the sermon was licensed by the bishop of london dr mountaigne after many things had been corrected it was resolved that he should suffer discourses of this nature were so loud at court that some of his graces friends reported them to him upon which he thought fit to retire to his palace at croydon a month before his usual time on the  th of july lord conway who was then secretary of state made him a visit and intimated to him that the king expected he would withdraw to canterbury which the archbishop declined because he had a lawsuit at that time with the city and desired he might rather have leave to go to his house at ford five miles beyond canterbury which was yielded to and on the  th of october following the king granted a commission to the bishop of london etc to execute archiepiscopal authority the cause assigned being that the archbishop could not at that time in his own person attend those services which were proper for his cognizance and jurisdiction some writers have pretended that his supposed irregularity occasioned by the death of peter hawkins was revived but the commission on record shows the contrary but the archbishop did not remain long in this situation for the necessities of the times rendering a parliament necessary his grace was sent for about christmas and not only restored to his authority and jurisdiction but on his coming to court from his palace at lambeth was received by the archbishop of york and the earl of dorset who conducted him to his majesty where having kissed the kings hand he was desired not to fail being at the council table twice a week he sat in the parliament which began on the seventeenth of march following and continued the full exercise of his office ever after of which it may not be amiss to take notice in this singular instance  on the twentyfourth of august      he consecrated richard montagu to the sea of chichester a man who had been remarkably busy in supporting the pretense of his irregularity and at this consecration dr laud then bishop of london assisted which is the clearest proof that no doubts longer remained as to his irregularity even with those who loved him least in parliament the archbishop maintained his credit in a high degree and it is more than probable that the knowledge of this procured such marks of respect as were at this time afforded him by the court when the petition of right that great pillar of the english liberty was under consideration the archbishop delivered the sense of the house of lords thereupon at a conference with the house of commons and at the same time laid before them such propositions as their lordships had agreed upon for which thanks were returned in a set speech by sir dudley diggs  when dr manwaring was brought before the bar of the house of lords by impeachment of the commons for having maintained in two sermons preached before his majesty and afterward published that the kings royal will and command in imposing loans taxes and other aids upon his people without common consent in parliament did so far bind the consciences of the subjects of this kingdom that they could not refuse the same without peril of damnation and that the authority of parliament is not necessary for the raising of aids and subsidies the archbishop by leave of the king gave the doctor a severe but just admonition and declared that he both disliked and abhorred his two sermons the interest of bishop laud was now so great at court that he drew up a scheme of instructions which having the kings name at the head of them were in the month of december      transmitted to his grace under the pompous title of his majestys instructions to the most reverend george lord archbishop of canterbury containing certain orders to be observed and put in execution by the several bishops in his province these instructions his grace communicated to his suffragan bishops in which he acted ministerially but to show that he still meant to exercise his authority in his own diocese he restored mr palmer and mr unday to their lectureships after the dean and archdeacon of canterbury had suspended them and in other respects softened the rigor of those instructions which were contrived to enforce the particular notions of a prevailing party in the church his conduct in this and other respects is said to have made his presence unwelcome at court and so indeed it seems for upon the birth of charles prince of wales afterward king charles ii which happened on the   th of of may    0 laud then bishop of london had the honor to baptize him as dean of the chapel notwithstanding the archbishop of canterbury is the ordinary of the court and the kings household wherever it is are regarded as his parishioners so that this was as much a slight upon the archbishop as a favor toward his antagonist the archbishop however went on doing his duty without fear or favor and yet one of the last acts of his life plainly shows that he was very far from being so indifferent toward the discipline and ceremonies of the church of england as some have represented him by an order of his dated the  d of july      requiring the parishioners of crayford in kent to receive the sacrament of the lords supper on their knees at the steps ascending to the communion table a month afterward viz on the  th of august in the same year he died at his palace of croydon worn out with cares and infirmities at the age of seventyone he was buried according to his own express direction in the chapel of our lady within the church dedicated to the holy trinity in his native town of guilford soon after his decease a noble monument was erected with the effigies of the archbishop in his robes supported by six marble pillars of the doric order raised on pedestals of books piled on his tomb there is a large latin inscription to his honor  the facts above related clearly evince that he was a man of great natural parts and these sufficiently improved for the worthy performance of what ever his high station in the church required he showed himself in many circumstances of his life a man of great moderation toward all parties a steady friend to the protestant religion an honest though perhaps not an humble courtier and one who was desirous that the clergy should have attracted the reverence and esteem of the laity by the sanctity of their manners and the uprightness of their behavior rather than have claimed them as necessarily annexed to their function these notions of his squaring little with the humors of some writers have drawn upon him many reflections a late writer justly esteemed for his extensive knowledge of the english history and not so much addicted to party has done much more justice to the virtues and abilities of this great prelate his charity and public spirit says he ought certainly to have been set in a clearer light than hitherto they have been by the friends to the church in regard to his learning succeeding ages may judge thereof from his writings upon various subjects it may not be amiss to observe here that there was another writer of both his names who flourished somewhat later this george abbot wrote a paraphrase on job a vindication of the sabbath and a paraphrase on the psalms also another george abbot who was the son of his brother maurice abbot  abbot maurice brother to george was bred to trade and became an eminent merchant in the city of london he more particularly distinguished himself by an application to the direction of the affairs of the east india company and his earnest attention to whatever might promote the extensive commerce of this nation or strengthen the foreign colonies in this quality we find him one of the commissioners employed in the negotiation and conclusion of a treaty with the dutch east india company by which the molucca islands and the commerce to them is declared to be twothirds belonging to the dutch east india company and one to the english this treaty was concluded at london on the   th of july      and ratified by the king the   th of the same month and is as remarkable a transaction as any in that reign it was in consequence of this treaty and in order to recover the goods of some english merchants that sir dudley diggs and maurice abbot were sent over to holland in the succeeding year    0 but with what success does not appear he was afterward one of the farmers of the customs as appears from a commission granted in      to him and to many other persons for administering the oaths to such persons as should either desire to pass the seas from this kingdom or to enter it from foreign countries in the succeeding year      he was appointed one of the council for settling and establishing the colony of virginia with very full powers for the government of that colony as by that commission appears  on the accession of king charles i to the throne mr abbot was the first person upon whom he conferred the honor of knighthood and so great was his interest at that time in the city that we find him chosen to the first parliament called in that kings reign viz in      in conjunction with sir thomas middleton sir heneage finch and mr robert bateman in      he was one of the sheriffs of london with henry garway sir cuthbert hacket being then mayor about the year      he erected a noble monument to the memory of his brother george archbishop of canterbury in his native town of guilford in      he was lord mayor of london and died on the tenth of january    0  he was a great lover and encourager of trade as well as very fortunate therein  abbot robert brother to the two former was also born at guilford anno    0 and bred up under the same schoolmaster from whence he was sent to baliol college oxford in      he took his masters degree in      and became a noted preacher there also a constant lecturer at st martins church in the quadrivium and sometimes at abingdon his preferment was chiefly owing to his excellence in preaching notwithstanding the distinction which some wish to make between the talents and tempers of these two brothers  that george was the more plausible preacher robert the greater scholar george the abler statesman robert the deeper divine that gravity did frown in george and smile in robert such were the qualities of this robert that upon the first sermon he preached at worcester he was made lecturer in that city and soon after rector of all saints there and upon a sermon preached at paulscross he was presented to the rich benefice of bingham in nottinghamshire by one of the auditors john stanhope esquire as dr featly has observed in his life in      he became no less eminent for some of his writings particularly against a certain papist on the sacrament he then took his degrees in divinity that of doctor being completed in      in the beginning of the reign of king james i he was made chaplain in ordinary to him and this king so much esteemed his writings that when the second edition of dr abbots book de antichristo was published in   0  his majesty ordered his own commentary upon part of the apocalypse to be printed an honor which that king did to no other of the great clerks in this kingdom and in truth the doctors pen had now brought him also into general esteem for what he had hitherto published in defense of william perkinss reformed catholic against dr william bishop now a secular but afterward in the popes style a titular bishop of the aerial diocese of chalcedon it is our authors assertion that dr abbot has herein given this william bishop as great an overthrow as jewel to harding bilson to allen or reynolds to heart at the end of this excellent work is added a particular treatise which he soon after wrote entitled the true ancient roman catholic which he dedicated to prince henry to whom it was so acceptable that he returned him many thanks in a letter written with his own hand and promised his assistance upon the next vacancy to advance him higher in the church and though by that princes untimely death the doctor lost some hopes yet in the course of time his deserts found other friends to do him that justice in   0  he was unanimously elected master of baliol college here it is observed of him that he was careful and skilful to set in his nursery the best plants and then took such care to water and prune them that in no plat or knot throughout the university of oxford there appeared more beautiful flowers or grew sweeter fruit than in baliol college while he was master his diligent reading to his scholars and his continual presence at public exercises both countenanced the readers and encouraged the hearers these regulations and improvements he rendered effectual by establishing piety which had been much neglected restoring peace which had been long wanted and making temperance more familiar among them which had been too great a stranger in that society in may    0 we find him nominated by the king among the first fellows of his majestys royal college at chelsea then newly founded and designed as a kind of fortress for controversial divinity being thus as it were engarrisoned with the most able and select champions for the protestant cause against all assertors of popery in november the same year he was made prebendary of normanton in the church of southwell upon his preaching a sermon before the king during his month of waiting at court in      when the news of dr thomas hollands death was brought from oxford his majesty named him successor in the theological chair usually called the kings professor of divinity but he modestly refused the same till his brother procured a mandate from the king for him to hold it some remarkable circumstances we meet with of him in this station and herein he has had the character given him of a profound divine most admirably read in the fathers councils and schoolmen and a more moderate calvinist than either of his two predecessors in the divinity chair holland and humphrey which he expressed by countenancing the sublapsarian way of predestination lastly upon the kings perusal of his antilogia against the apology for garnet and the same of his incomparable lectures in the university upon the kings supreme power against bellarmine and suarez printed after his death his majesty when the sea of salisbury fell void sent his conge delire for him to the dean and chapter  thus as he set forward one foot on the temple of honor though indeed but leisurely which is imputed to his own humility the obstruction of his foes who traduced him for a puritan though cordial to the doctrine of the church of england and to the unwillingness of some friends to adorn the church with the spoil of the university and mar a professor to make a bishop he was consecrated by his own brother the archbishop on december        in his chapel at lambeth herein equalizing the felicity of seffridus some time bishop of chichester who being a bishop himself also saw his brother at the same time archbishop of canterbury other bishoprics were talked of for him but the business of the nullity beforementioned in his brothers life made a nullity for a time says our author in his graces good intentions insomuch that king james when the doctor who was newly consecrated bishop of sarum came to do his homage said pleasantly to him abbot i have had very much to do to make thee a bishop but i know no reason for it unless it were because thou have written against one alluding to the papish priest beforementioned in his way to sarum he made a farewell oration at the university with great applause we have some fragments of it preserved in the original latin by two authors and a translation thereof or epitome in english by a third his brethren the heads of houses and other oxford friends parted with him on the edge of his diocese with tears of grief and the gentry of sarum received him with those of joy he observed the beautiful old cathedral to be much decayed through negligence and the covetousness of those who filled their purses with that money which should have been applied to its repairs he therefore used such means with the prebendaries as drew from them five hundred pounds which he applied to the reparation of this church and then labored to amend the congregation both by doctrine and discipline visiting his whole diocese in person and preaching every sabbath day whilst his health would permit which was not long for that sedentary course to which he had accustomed himself by close application to study brought upon him the gravel and stone but in all the bodily tortures of his last fit his soul was at ease and his heavenly hopes disposed him contentedly to resign all earthly enjoyments  he was so far from needing the advice of patience to make the remainder of life supportable that he gave it to others even to the judges who in their circuit came to visit him on his death bed he spared not his christian admonitions and besides his precepts gave them an example of the comforts that flowed from a clear conscience and for the inhabitants he mourned less to leave the world than they to part with him who had so much endeared himself to them by diligence in his pastoral charge by his hospitality and bounty to the poor and humble carriage to all having summoned his domestics with desire to declare his faith he was persuaded to refrain it being manifest in his writings thus being quite worn out with exhortations benedictions and the pains of disease he lay a while in a slumbering state and at length with eyes and hands uplifted for some space departed this life on march        and not as some have mistaken the year after in the   th year of his age and before he had completely filled this see two years and three months being one of the five bishops which salisbury saw in six years he was buried opposite the bishops seat in the cathedral he was twice married the last time with some displeasure to the archbishop about half a year after his promotion to the said see he left one son or more also one daughter named martha who was married to sir nathaniel brent warden of merton college in oxford their daughter margaret married dr edward corbet rector of hasely in oxfordshire who gave some of the bishops mss to the bodleian library  there was likewise another robert abbot a minister and author also of several devout pieces who though he was scarcely a writer before bishop abbot died is yet here mentioned that some readers may not confound him with this bishop of salisbury as others have divided him into three distinct persons because so many different livings are mentioned to his name in his books never considering that one man might by removal successively enjoy them all as was the case here that robert abbot being first beneficed in kent afterward in hampshire and lastly in london  abelard peter one of the most famous doctors of the twelfth century was born at palais near nantz in britany he was well learned in divinity philosophy and the languages but was particularly distinguished by his skill in logic and fondness for disputations which led him to travel into several provinces in order to give public proofs of his acuteness in that science  after having baffled many antagonists he read lectures in divinity with great applause at paris where he boarded with a canon whose name was fulbert and who had a very beautiful niece named heloise the canon ardently wished to see this young lady make a figure among the learned and abelard was made her preceptor but instead of instructing her in the sciences he taught her to love abelard now performed his public functions very coldly and wrote nothing but amorous verses heloise proving with child abelard sent her to a sister of his in britany where she was delivered of a son to soften the canons anger he offered to marry heloise privately and the old man was better pleased with the proposal than the niece who from a singular excess of passion chose to be abelards mistrese rather than his wife she married however but used often to protest upon oath that she was single which provoked the canon to use her ill upon this abelard sent her to the monastery of argenteuil where she put on a religious habit but did not take the veil heloises relations considering this as a second treachery hired ruffians who forcing into his chamber in the dead of the night emasculated him this infamous treatment made him fly to the gloom of a cloister he assumed the monastic habit in the abbey of st dennis but the disorders of that house soon drove him from thence he was afterward charged with heresy but after several persecutions for his religious sentiments he settled in a solitude in the diocese of troies where he built an oratory to which he gave the name of the paraclet he was afterward chosen superior of the abbey of ruis in the diocese of vannes when the nuns being expelled from the nunnery in which heloise had been placed he gave her his oratory where she settled with some of her sister nuns and became their prioress  abelard mixed the philosophy of aristotle with his divinity and in    0 was condemned by the council of rheims and sens pope innocent ii ordered him to be imprisoned his books to be burnt and forbade him ever teaching again however he was soon after pardoned at the solicitation of peter the venerable who received him into his abbey of clugni where he led an exemplary life he died in the priory of marcellus at chalons april         aged sixtythree his corpse was sent to heloise who buried it in the paraclet he left several works the most celebrated of which are those tender letters that passed between him and heloise with the account of their misfortunes prefixed which have been translated into english and immortalized by the harmony of mr popes numbers  abernethy john an eminent dissenting minister was the son of mr john abernethy a dissenting minister in colraine and was born on the   th of october    0 when about nine years of age he was separated from his parents his father being obliged to attend some public affairs in london and his mother to shelter herself from the mad fury of the irish rebels retiring to derry a relation who had him under his care having no opportunity of conveying him to her took him with him to scotland by which means he escaped the hardships he must have suffered at the siege of derry where mrs abernethy lost all her other children he afterward studied at the university of glasgow till he took the degree of master of arts and in   0  he was chosen minister of a dissenting congregation at antrim where he continued above twenty years about the time of the bangorian controversy a dissension arose among his brethren in the ministry at belfast on the subject of subscription to the westminster confession in which he became a leader on the negative side and incurred the censure of a general synod being in consequence deserted by the greatest part of his congregation he accepted an invitation to settle in dublin where his preaching was much admired he was distinguished by his candid free and generous sentiments and died of the gout in dec    0 in the  0th year of his age he published a volume of sermons on the divine attributes after his death a second volume was published by his friends and these were succeeded by four other volumes on different subjects all of which have been greatly admired  abgarus a name given to several of the kings of edessa in syria the most celebrated of them is one who it is said was cotemporary with jesus christ and who having a distemper in his feet and hearing of jesuss miraculous cures requested him by letter to come and cure him eusebius who believed that this letter was genuine and also an answer our savior is said to have returned to it has translated them both from the syriac and asserts that they were taken out of the archives of the city of edessa the first is as follows abgarus prince of edessa to jesus the holy savior who has appeared in the flesh in the confines of jerusalem greeting i have heard of thee and of the cures thou have wrought without medicines or herbs for it is reported thou make the blind to see the lame to walk lepers to be clean devils and unclean spirits to be expelled such as have been long diseased to be healed and the dead to be raised all which when i heard concerning thee i concluded with myself that either thou wast a god come down from heaven or the son of god sent to do these things i have therefore written to thee beseeching thee to vouchsafe to come unto me and cure my disease for i have also heard that the jews use thee ill and lay snares to destroy thee i have here a little city pleasantly situated and sufficient for us both abgarus to this letter jesus it is said returned an answer by ananias abgaruss courier which was as follows blessed art thou o abgarus who have believed in me whom thou have not seen for the scriptures say of me they who have seen me have not believed in me that they who have not seen may by believing have life but whereas thou writest to have me come to thee it is of necessity that i fulfill all things here for which i am sent and having finished them to return to him that sent me but when i am returned to him i will then send one of my disciples to thee who shall cure thy malady and give life to thee and thine jesus after jesuss ascension judas who is also named thomas sent thaddeus one of the seventy to abgarus who preached the gospel to him and his people cured him of his disorder and wrought many other miracles which was done says eusebius a d     though the above letters are acknowledged to be spurious by the candid writers of the church of rome several protestant authors as dr parker dr cave and dr grabe have maintained that they are genuine and ought not to be rejected  accius a latin tragic poet the son of a freedman and according to st jerome born in the consulship of hostilius mancinus and attilius serranus in the year of rome     but there appears somewhat of confusion or perplexity in this chronology he made himself known before the death of pacuvius a dramatic piece of his being exhibited the same year that pacuvius brought one upon the stage the latter being then eighty years of age and accius only thirty we do not know the name of this piece of acciuss but the titles of several of his tragedies are mentioned by various authors he wrote on the most celebrated stories which had been represented on the athenian stage as andromache andromeda atreus clytemnestra medea meleager philocletes the civil wars of thebes tereus the troades etc he did not always however take his subjects from the grecian story for he composed one dramatic piece wholly roman it was entitled brutus and related to the expulsion of the tarquins it is affirmed by some that he also wrote comedies which is not unlikely if he was the author of two pieces the wedding and the merchant which have been ascribed to him he did not confine himself to dramatic writing for he left other productions particularly his annals mentioned by macrobius priscian festus and nonius marcellus he has been censured for writing in too harsh a style but in all other respects has been esteemed a very great poet he was so much esteemed by the public that a comedian was punished for only mentioning his name upon the stage cicero speaks in great derision of one accius who had written a history and as our author had wrote annals some insist that he is the person censured but as cicero himself horace quintilian ovid and paterculus have spoken of our author with so much applause we cannot think it is him whom the roman orator censures with so much severity  there was also in this age a pretty good orator of the same name against whom cicero defended cluentius he was born in pisaurum and perhaps was a relation of our poet  achilles one of the greatest heroes of ancient greece was the son of peleus and thetis he was a native of phthia in thessaly his mother it is said in order to consume every mortal part of his body used to lay him every night under live coals anointing him with ambrosia which preserved every part from burning but one of his lips owing to his having licked it she dipped him also in the waters of the river styx by which his whole body became invulnerable except that part of his heel by which she held him but this opinion is not universal nor is it a part of his character as drawn by homer for in the iliad b xxi     he is actually wounded in the right arm by the lance of asteropaus in the battle near the scamander thetis afterward entrusted him to the care of the centaur chiron who to give him the strength necessary for martial toil fed him with honey and the marrow of lions and wild boars to prevent his going to the siege of troy she disguised him in female apparel and hid him among the maidens at the court of king lycomedes but ulysses discovering him persuaded him to follow the greeks achilles distinguished himself by a number of heroic actions at the siege being disgusted however with agamemnon for the loss of briseis he retired from the camp but returning to avenge the death of his friend patroclus he slew hector fastened his corpse to his chariot and dragged it round the walls of troy at last paris the brother of hector wounded him in the heel with an arrow while he was in the temple treating about his marriage with philoxena daughter to king priam of this wound he died and was interred on the promontary of sigaeum and after troy was taken the greeks sacrificed philoxena on his tomb in obedience to his desire that he might enjoy her company in the elysian fields it is said that alexander seeing this tomb honored it by placing a crown upon it at the same time crying out that achilles was happy in having during his life such a friend at patroclus and after his death a poet like homer achilles is supposed to have died      years before the christian era  acidalius valens would in all probability have been one of the greatest critics in these latter ages had he lived longer to perfect those talents which nature had given him he was born at witstock in brandenburg and having visited several academies in germany italy and other countries where he was greatly esteemed he afterward took up his residence at breslaw the metropolis of silesia here he remained a considerable time in expectation of some employment but nothing offering he turned romancatholic and was chosen rector of a school at niessa it is related that about four months after as he was following a procession of the host he was seized with a sudden phrenzy and being carried home expired in a very short time but thuanus tell us that his excessive application to study was the occasion of his untimely death and that his sitting up at night in composing his conjectures on plautus brought upon him a distemper which carried him off in three days on the   th of may      being just turned of    he wrote a commentary on quintus curtius also notes on tacitus on the twelve panegyrics besides speeches letters and poems his poetical pieces are inserted in the deliciae of the german poets and consist of epic verses odes and epigrams a little piece printed in      under the title of mulieres non esse homines that women were not of the human species was falsely ascribed to him but the fact was that acidalius happening to meet with the manuscript and thinking it very whimsical transcribed it and give it to the bookseller who printed it the performance was highly exclaimed against insomuch that the bookseller being seized he discovered the person who gave him the manuscript and a terrible outcry was made against acidalius a story goes that being one day to dine at a friends house there happened to be several ladies at table who supposing him to be the author were moved with so much indignation that they threatened to throw their plates at his head acidalius however ingeniously diverted their wrath in his opinion he said the author was a judicious person the ladies being certainly more of the species of angels than of men  mr baillet has given him a place among his enfans celebres and says that he wrote a comment upon plautus when he was but    or    years old and composed several latin poems at the same age  acropolita george one of the writers of the byzantine history was born at constantinople in the year    0 and brought up at the court of the emperor john ducas at nice he was employed in the most important affairs of the empire being sent ambassador to larissa to establish a peace with michael of epirus and was constituted judge to try michael comnenus suspected of engaging in a conspiracy theodorus lascaris the son of john whom he had taught logic appointed him governor of all the western provinces in his empire in      he was taken prisoner in a war with michael angelus but gaining his liberty in    0 by means of the emperor palaeologus he was sent by him ambassador to constantine prince of bulgaria and was employed in several other negociations he wrote a continuation of the greek history from the taking of constantinople by the latins till it was recovered by michael palaeologus in      which makes part of the byzantine history a treatise concerning faith virtue and the soul an exposition of the sermons of st gregory nazianzen and other pieces gregory cyprian patriarch of constantinople in his encomium upon him prefixed to acropolitas history is perhaps somewhat extravagant in his praise when he says he was equal to aristotle in philosophy and to plato in the knowledge of divine things and attic eloquence  acuna christopher de a spanish jesuit born at burgos he was admitted into the society in      being then but    years of age after having devoted some years to study he went to america where he assisted in making converts in chili and peru in    0 he returned to spain and gave the king an account how far he had succeeded in the commission he had received to make discoveries on the river of the amazons and the year following he published a description of this river at madrid acuna was sent to rome as procurator of his province he returned to spain with the title of qualificator of the inquisition but soon after embarked again for the west indies and was at lima in      when father southwell published at rome the bibliotheque of the jesuit writers acunas work is entitled nuevo descubrimento del gran rio de las amazonas i e a new discovery of the great river of the amazons he was ten months upon this river having had instructions to inquire into every thing with the greatest exactness that his majesty might thereby be enabled to render the navigation more easy and commodious he went aboard a ship at quito with peter texiera who had already been far up the river and was therefore thought a proper person to accompany him in this expedition they embarked in february      but did not arrive at para till the december following it is thought that the revolutions of portugal by which the spaniards lost brazil and the colony of para at the mouth of the river of the amazons were the causes that the relation of this jesuit was suppressed for as it could not be of any advantage to the spaniards they were afraid it might prove of great service to the portuguese the copies of this work became extremely scarce so that the publishers of the french translations at paris asserted that there was not one copy of the original extant excepting that in the possession of the translator and perhaps one in the vatican library m de gomberville was the author of this translation it was published after his death with a long dissertation an account of the original may be seen in the paris journal in that of leipsic and in chevereaus history of the world  adams thomas citizen and lord mayor of london was a man highly esteemed for his prudence and piety his loyalty and sufferings and his acts of munificence he was born at wem in shropshire educated in the university of cambridge and fuller says bred a draper in london in   0  he was chosen sheriff when he gave a striking proof of his public spirit he immediately gave up his business and applied himself wholly to public affairs  this shows he must have been opulent he made himself complete master of the customs and usages rights and privileges of the city of london and succeeded to every honor his fellowcitizens had it in their power to bestow he was chosen master of the drapers company alderman and president of saint thomass hospital which institution he probably saved from ruin by discovering the frauds of a dishonest steward he was often returned member of parliament but the violent politics of the times would not permit him to sit there in      he was elected mayor of london in which office he gave a shining example of disinterestedness by declining the advantages usually made by the sale of places which become vacant his loyalty to charles i was so well known that his house was searched by the republican party to find the king there mr adams was the next year committed to the tower by the same party and detained there some time however at length he became the oldest alderman upon the bench and was consequently dignified with the honorable title of father of the city his affection for his prince was so great that during the exile of charles ii he remitted him  0000l  when the restoration of the king was agreed on mr adams then seventyfour years of age was deputed by the city to accompany genesis monk to breda in holland to congratulate and accompany the king home for his signal services the king knighted him at the hague and soon after the restoration advanced him to the dignity of a baronet on the   th of june       his merit as a benefactor to the public is highly conspicuous he gave the house of his nativity at wem as a free school to the town and liberally endowed it he founded an arabic professorship at cambridge both which took place before his death by desire of his friend mr wheelock fellow of clarehall he was at the expense of printing the gospels in persian and sending them into the east he was equally benevolent in private as in public life his hands were open to all objects in want and although he suffered great losses in his estate he gave liberally in legacies to the poor of many parishes to hospitals and ministers widows he was particularly distinguished for his christian patience and fortitude in adversity  in his latter years he was much afflicted with the stone which hastened his end he died the   th of feb      at eightyone years of age the stone was taken from the body and was of such extraordinary magnitude as to weigh twentyfive ounces and is preserved in the laboratory at cambridge he felt no reluctance at the approach of his dissolution and seemed perfectly prepared for death often saying solum mihi supeest sepulchrum all my business is to fit me for the grave  his funeral sermon was preached at saint catharine cree church before his children and many of his relations his descendants enjoyed the title down to the late sir thomas adams who died a captain in the royal navy  adamson patrick archbishop of st andrews was born march         in the town of perth of mean but honest parents who gave him all the learning they were able having him educated at a grammar school where they dwelt and sent him from thence to st andrews where he acquired the degree of master of arts their circumstances not permitting them to keep him longer there he removed to a little village of fife where he taught a school with reputation and continued four years when he accompanied the son of mr mgill of rankellar one of the senators of the college of justice to paris in      to study the civil law here he published a congratulatory poem on the birth of a son to mary queen of scots wherein he styles henry lord darnley king of scotland england and france the giving the title of king of france and england to his own prince so much alarmed the french court that he was thrown into prison and would not easily have escaped had not his queen and the first nobility of the kingdom interested themselves in his behalf as soon as he was at large he retired with his pupil to bourges where they both entered students at law he was in that city during the massacre of paris and as the same scene was transacting there he was obliged to conceal himself at a public house for seven months here he wrote two excellent pieces in latin verse which are still extant in      he returned to scotland and married finding no encouragement in the law he entered into holy orders and became minister of paisley  in a general assembly held the succeeding year at edinburgh he with mr david lindsay were appointed to report their proceedings to the earl of morton then regent and was by that nobleman in the same year appointed one of his chaplains who in the same year on the death of bishop douglas raised him to be archbishop of st andrews a dignity in which he experienced nothing but trouble and uneasiness  on october         the general assembly sat and required mr adamson to submit himself to their examination and to receive the office of bishop with such limitations as they thought fit this he refused and they forbad the chapter of st andrews to proceed to any election the chapter however after the assembly rose elected mr adamson next year the assembly appointed commissioners to summon the archbishop before them to examine the validity of the election and to take cognizance of various charges brought against him the presbyterian party ran high against him and the unfortunate prelate to soothe the passions of these angry men composed a catechism in latin verse this they saw and approved but still continued to persecute him in      he submitted himself to the general assembly but next year a new commission was issued to inquire into fresh charges against him when he retired to st andrews and continued disputing with them for some years being preserved from destruction by the power of the court  in      he was seized with a distemper which his physicians could not find out and therefore could not afford him relief he applied then to an old woman who did him some service but so infatuated were his enemies that they accused the poor woman of witchcraft who was committed to prison but made her escape four years after she was taken at edinburgh and was absolutely burned for what she ought to have been rewarded the saving the archbishops life  in      he preached and disputed before king james when he went to st andrews and the king was so well satisfied with his wisdom and loyalty that he sent him as his ambassador to london to queen elizabeth in which quality he resided some years his conduct while there has been variously spoken of however by his preaching he drew such large congregations and raised in the minds of the people such an idea of the young king his master that elizabeth prohibited his entering the pulpit two things he principally endeavored to effect to recommend the king his master to the nobility and gentry of england and to procure some support for the episcopal party in scotland in both which he in some degree succeeded but his want of economy prevented his full success this drew on him the reflections of his enemies as to his being concerned in throgmortons conspiracy no substantial proof of it has been brought  soon after gouries conspiracy he was recalled and sat in the parliament at edinburgh in      the act therein made for settling the peace of the kingdom and establishing the kings authority in ecclesiastical affairs had but little effect the ministers refused obedience and because the archbishop preached before the king libels were published against him and notwithstanding a declaration published by the king setting forth the reasons which induced him to enact those laws the kirk faction were so obstinate and indefatigable as to oblige the king to disavow his declaration  at a provincial synod in      the archbishop was accused and excommunicated he appealed to the king and states of the kingdom and in return excommunicated mr melvil the moderator the mob were so enraged at this that he dared not appear as moderator at the next assembly in the same year he submitted and was absolved  in      complaint was made to the general assembly and he was actually put to the horn that is outlawed because he did not pay his debts in      he was accused of marrying the earl of huntley without requiring him to subscribe a confession of faith he published soon after the lamentations of the prophet jeremiah in latin verse and a translation of the apocalypse also in latin verse but neither those or a copy of verses written to the king when in deep distress could procure him any favor on the contrary the king finding him no longer of use to him granted the revenue of his see to the duke of lenox this reduced him to greater distress and the brethren taking advantage of it procured his subscription to a most abject submission by giving him a poor collection for the immediate support of his family in this state he lingered till      when death put a period to his misfortunes  addison lancelot was the son of a clergyman and born at mouldismeaburne near crosby ravensworth in westmoreland in      he received the first tincture of letters at the grammar school at appleby and in    0 was sent to queens college oxford where he became first a poor child on the foundation but quickly distinguishing himself by his lively parts and strict application to learning in      he was admitted bachelor and in      master of arts and being then much noticed for his sprightly wit was made choice of for one of the terrae filii for the act celebrated in      but his loyalty getting the better of his prudence in his oration he was so severe on the pride hypocrisy ignorance and avarice of those in power that he was compelled to make a recantation and ask pardon on his knees shortly after he left the university he chose for his retreat the village of petworth and spent his time in visiting gentlemen of known loyalty who had seats in the county of sussex where he endeavored to promote among the youth principles of loyalty  on the restoration the gentlemen of that county recommended him to dr king bishop of chichester as a man of a sound head and honest heart and one who had suffered much for the constitution in church and state the bishop probably would have provided for him if mr addison had not accepted the post of chaplain to the garrison of dunkirk contrary to his lordships inclination when that place was delivered up to the french in      he returned to england and was soon after made chaplain to the garrison of tangier whither he went in the next year here he resided seven years and was in great favor with the famous earl of tiviot the governor and col norwood the deputy governor and employed by them in matters of great importance having settled every thing relative to his garrison he returned to england in    0 and was well received  soon after his arrival he was made chaplain in ordinary to king charles ii but the chaplainship of tangier was taken from him and given to another by which mr addisons circumstances were much straitened however a knight of the county of wilts bestowed on him the rectory of milston in that county worth about one hundred and twenty pounds per annum he also obtained one of the prebendaries of sarum and in      took the degrees of bachelor and doctor of divinity in oxford the preferments he now enjoyed enabled him to live decently and hospitably in the country where he discharged his duty with a conscientious diligence and lived on terms of friendship with the most eminent persons in the neighborhood  in      the commissioners for ecclesiastical affairs to reward his services at tangier and to make good some losses he sustained by fire at milston bestowed on him the deanery of litchfield and in      he was collated to the archdeaconry of coventry he sat in the convocation in      and enjoyed for the remainder of his days a just and general reputation for the uprightness of his life and the many learned treatises he had published he departed this life april  0   0  at the age of seventy having been twice married first to a daughter of nicholas gulston esquire and secondly to a daughter of john danvers esquire of leicestershire who survived him by her he had no issue but by the former he had several children among them joseph addison esquire the subject of the next article one of the greatest ornaments to human nature and his country that ever existed  dr addisons works were   an account of west barbary   the present state of the jews   a seasonable discourse on catechizing   a modest defense of the clergy   the state of mahometism   an introduction to the catechism   a discourse of tangier   the cathechumen    or an historical account of the heresy denying the godhead of christ  0 the christians daily sacrifice duty performed and    an account of the millenium  addison joseph son of dean addison the subject of the last article he was born at milston near ambresbury in wiltshire on the   th of may      and not being thought likely to live was baptized the same day he received the first rudiments of his education at the place of his nativity under the reverend mr naish but was soon removed to salisbury under the care of mr tailor and from thence to the charter house where he commenced his acquaintance with sir richard steel about fifteen he was entered at queens college oxford where he applied very closely to the study of classical learning in which he made a surprising proficiency  in the year      dr lancaster dean of magdalen college having by che seen a latin poem of mr addisons was so pleased with it that he immediately got him elected into that house where he took his degrees of bachelor and master of arts his latin pieces in the course of a few years were exceedingly admired in both universities nor were they less esteemed abroad particularly by the celebrated boileau who is reported to have said that he would not have written against perrault had he before seen such excellent pieces by a modern hand he published nothing in english before the twentysecond year of his age when there appeared a short copy of verses written by him and addressed to mr dryden which procured him great reputation from the best judges this was soon followed by a translation of the fourth georgic of virgil omitting the story of aristaeus much commended by mr dryden he wrote also the essay on the georgics prefixed to mr drydens translation there are several other pieces written by him about this time amongst the rest one dated the  d of april      addressed to h s that is dr sacheverell who became afterward so famous and with whom mr addison lived once in the greatest friendship but their intimacy was some time after broken off by their disagreement in political principles in the year      he wrote a poem to king william on one of his campaigns addressed to sir john summers lord keeper of the great seal this gentleman received it with great pleasure took the author into the number of his friends and bestowed on him many marks of his favor  mr addison had been closely pressed while at the university to enter into holy orders and had once resolved upon it but his great modesty his natural diffidence and an uncommonly delicate sense of the importance of the sacred function made him afterward alter his resolution and having expressed an inclination to travel he was encouraged thereto by his patron abovementioned who by his interest procured him from the crown a pension of  00l per annum to support him in his travels he accordingly made a tour to italy in the year      and in   0  he wrote a poetical epistle from italy to the earl of halifax which has been universally esteemed as a most excellent performance it was translated into italian verse by the abbot antonio maria salvini greek professor at florence in the year   0  he published an account of his travels dedicated to lord summers which though at first but indifferently received yet in a little time met with its deserved applause  in the year   0  he was about to return to england when he received advice of his being appointed to attend prince eugene who then commanded for the emperor in italy but the death of king william happening soon after put an end to this affair as well as his pension and he remained for a considerable time unemployed an unexpected incident at once raised him and gave him an opportunity of exerting his fine talents to advantage for in the year   0  the lord treasurer godolphin happened to complain to lord halifax that the duke of marlboroughs victory at blenheim had not been celebrated in verse in the manner it deserved and intimated that he would take it kindly if his lordship who was the known patron of the poets would name a gentleman capable of doing justice to so elevated a subject lord halifax replied somewhat hastily that he did know such a person but would not mention him adding that long had he seen with indignation men of no merit maintained in luxury at the public expense whilst those of real worth and modesty were suffered to languish in obscurity the treasurer answered very coolly that he was sorry there should be occasion for such an observation but that he would do his endeavor to wipe off such reproaches for the future and he engaged his honor that whoever his lordship named as a person capable of celebrating this victory should meet with a suitable recompense lord halifax thereupon named mr addison insisting however that the treasurer himself should send to him which he promised accordingly he prevailed on mr boil afterward lord carlton then chancellor of the exchequer to make the proposal to mr addison which he did in so polite a manner that our author readily undertook the task the lord treasurer had a sight of the piece when it was carried no farther than the celebrated simile of the angel and was so pleased with it that he immediately appointed mr addison a commissioner of appeals vacant by the promotion of mr lock chosen one of the lords commissioners for trade the campaign is addressed to the duke of marlborough it gives a short view of the military transactions in   0  and contains a noble description of the two great actions at schellemberg and blenheim in   0  he attended lord halifax to hanover and the ensuing year was appointed undersecretary to sir charles hedges secretary of state in which office he acquitted himself so well that the earl of sunderland who succeeded sir charles in december continued mr addison in his employment  a taste for operas beginning at this time to prevail in england and many persons having solicited mr addison to write one he complied with their request and composed his rosamond this however whether from the defect of the music or from the prejudices in favor of the italian taste did not succeed upon the stage but the poetry of it has and always will be justly admired about this time sir richard steel composed his comedy of the tender husband to which mr addison wrote a prologue sir richard surprised him with a dedication of this play and acquainted the public that he was indebted to him for some of the most excellent strokes in the performance the marquis of wharton being appointed lord lieutenant of ireland in   0  took mr addison with him as his secretary her majesty also made him keeper of the records of ireland and as a farther mark of her favor considerably augmented the salary annexed to that place whilst he was in this kingdom the tatler was first published and he discovered his friend sir richard steel to be the author by an observation on virgil which he had communicated to him he afterward assisted considerably in carrying on this paper which the author acknowledges the tatler being laid down the spectator was set on foot and mr addison furnished great part of the most admired papers the spectator made its first appearance in march      and was brought to a conclusion in september       his celebrated cato appeared in      he formed the design of a tragedy upon this subject when he was very young and wrote it when on his travels he retouched it in england without any intention of bringing it on the stage but his friends being persuaded it would serve the cause of liberty he was prevailed on by their solicitations and it was accordingly exhibited on the theater with a prologue by mr pope and an epilogue by dr garth it was received with the most uncommon applause having run thirtyfive nights without interruption the whigs applauded every line in which liberty was mentioned as a satire on the tories and the tories echoed every clap to show that the satire was unfelt when it was printed notice was given that the queen would be pleased if it was dedicated to her but as he had designed that compliment elsewhere he found himself obliged says tickell by his duty on the one hand and his honor on the other to send it into the world without any dedication it was no less esteemed abroad having been translated into french italian and german and was acted at leghorn and several other places with vast applause the jesuits of st omers made a latin version of it and the students acted it with great magnificence  about this time another paper called the guardian was published by steel to which addisn was a principal contributor it was a continuation of the spectator and was distinguished by the same elegance and the same variety but in consequence of steeles propensity to politics was abruptly discontinued in order to write the englishman  the papers of addison are marked in the spectator by one of the letters in the name of clio and in the guardian by a hand many of these papers were written with powers truly comic with nice discrimination of characters and accurate observation of natural or accidental deviations from propriety but it was not supposed that he had tried a comedy on the stage till steel after his death declared him the author of the drummer this however he did not know to be true by any cogent testimony for when addison put the play into his hands he only told him it was the work of a gentleman in the company and when it was received as is confessed with cold disapprobation he was probably less willing to claim it tickell omitted it in his collection but the testimony of steel and the total silence of any other claimant has determined the public to assign it to addison and it is now printed with his other poetry steel carried the drummer to the playhouse and afterward to the press and sold the copy for  0 guineas to steeles opinion may be added the proof supplied by the play itself of which the characters are such as addison would have delineated and the tendency such as addison would have promoted  it is said that mr addison intended to have composed an english dictionary upon the plan of the italian della crusca but upon the death of the queen being appointed secretary to the lords justices he had not leisure to carry on such a work when the earl of sunderland was appointed lord lieutenant of ireland mr addison was again made secretary for  affairs of that kingdom and upon the earls being removed from the lieutenancy he was chosen one of the lords of trade  not long afterward an attempt was made to revive the spectator at a time indeed by no means favorable to literature when the succession of a new family to the throne filled the nation with anxiety discord and confusion and either the turbulence of the times or the satiety of the readers put a stop to the publication after an experiment of  0 numbers which were afterward collected into an eighth volume perhaps more valuable than any of those that went before it addison produced more than a fourth part  in      he began the freeholder a political paper which was much admired and proved of great use at that juncture he published also about this time verses to sir godfrey kneller upon the kings picture and some to the princess of wales with the tragedy of cato  before the arrival of king george he was made secretary to the regency and was required by his office to send notice to hanover that the queen was dead and that the throne was vacant to do this would not have been difficult to any man but addison who was so overwhelmed with the greatness of the event and so distracted by choice of expression that the lords who could not wait for the niceties of criticism called mr southwell a clerk in the house and ordered him to dispatch the message southwell readily told what was necessary in the common style of business and valued himself upon having done what was too hard for addison  in      he married the countess dowager of warwick whom he had solicited by a very long and anxious courtship he is said to have first known her by becoming tutor to her son the marriage if uncontradicted report can be credited made no addition to his happiness it neither found them nor made them equal she always remembered her own rank and thought herself entitled to treat with very little ceremony the tutor of her son it is certain that addison has left behind him no encouragement for ambitious love the year after      he rose to his highest elevation being made secretary of state but is represented as having proved unequal to the duties of his place in the house of commons he could not speak and therefore was useless to the defense of the government in the office he could not issue an order without losing his time in quest of fine expressions at last finding by experience his own inability for public business he was forced to solicit his dismission with a pension of   00l a year such was the account of those who were inclined to detract from his abilities but by others his relinquishment was attributed to declining health and the necessity of recess and quiet  in his retirement he wrote his evidences of the christian religion which he had begun long before part of which scarce finished has been printed in his works he intended also to have given an english paraphrase of some of davids psalms but his ailments increased and cut short his designs he had for some time been oppressed by an asthmatic disorder which was now aggravated by a dropsy and he prepared to die conformably to his precepts and professions he sent as mr pope relates a message by the earl of warwick to mr gay desiring to see him gay who had not visited him for some time before obeyed the summons and found himself received with great kindness the purpose for which the interview had been solicited was then discovered addison told him that he had injured him but that if he recovered he would recompense him what the injury was he did not explain nor did gay ever know but supposed that some preferment designed for him had by addisons interention been withheld  another deathbed interview of a more solemn nature is recorded lord warwick was a young man of ver irregular life and perhaps of loose opinions addison for whom he did not want respect had very diligently endeavored to reclaim him but his arguments and expostulations had no effect one experiment however remained to be tried when he found his life near its end he directed the young lord to be called and when he desired with great tenderness to hear his last injunctions told him i have sent for you that you may see how a christian can die what effect this aweful scene had on the earls behavior is not known he died himself in a short time having given directions to mr tickell for the publication of his works and dedicated them on his deathbed to his friend mr craggs he died june         at hollandhouse leaving no child but a daughter who is still living  addisons course of life before his marriage has been detailed by pope he had in the house with him budgell and perhaps philips his chief companions were steel budgell philips carey dant and colonel brett with one or other of these he always breakfaed he studied all morning then dined at a tavern and went afterwads to buttons from the coffeehouse he went again to the tavern where he often sat late and drank too much wine  dr johnson in delineating the character of addison observes with tickell that he employed wit on the side of virtue and religion he not only made the proper use of wit himself but taught it to others and from his time it has been generally subservient to the cause of reason and truth he has dissipated the prejudice that had long connected gaiety with vice and easiness of manners with laxity of principles he restored virtue to its dignity and taught innocence not to be ashamed this is an elevation of literary character above all greek above all roman fame no greater felicity can genius attain than that of having purified intellectual pleasure separated mirth from indecency and wit from licentiousness of having taught a succession of writers to bring elegance and gaiety to the aid of goodness and to use expressions yet more aweful of having turned many to righteousness as a delineator of life and manners he must be allowed to stand perhaps the first of the first rank his humor which as steel observes is peculiar to himself is so happily diffused as to give the grace of novelty to domestic scenes and daily occurrences he never outsteps the modesty of nature nor raises merriment or wonder by the violation of truth his figures neither divert by distortion nor amaze by aggravation he copies life with so much fidelity that he can be hardly said to invent yet his exhibitions have an air so much original that it is difficult to suppose them not merely the product of imagination as a teacher of wisdom he may be confidently followed his religion has nothing in it enthusiastic or superstitious he appears neither weakly credulous nor wantonly skeptical his morality is neither dangerously lax nor impracticably rigid all the enchantment of fancy and all the cogency of argument are employed to recommend to the reader his real interest the care of pleasing the author of his being truth is shown sometimes as the phantom of a vision sometimes appears halfveiled in an allegory sometimes attracts regard in the robes of fancy and sometimes steps forth in the confidence of reason she wears a thousand dresses and in all is pleasing  the doctor however has related the following anecdote which every admirer of addison every man of feeling must be reluctant to believe steel says the doctor whose imprudence of generosity or vanity of profusion kept him always incurably necessitous upon some pressing exigence in an evil hour borrowed an hundred pounds of his friend probably without much purpose of repayment but addison who seems to have had other notions of an hundred pounds grew impatient of delay and reclaimed his loan by an execution steel felt with great sensibility the obduracy of his creditor but with emotions of sorrow rather than of anger it is much to be wished says dr kippis that dr johnson had produced his authority for this narration it is very possible that it may be only a story the doctor had somewhere heard in conversation and which is entirely groundless and this i am rather inclined to believe as i have been assured by one of the most respectable characters in the kingdom that the fact has no foundation in truth mr potter in a late publication has informed us that he is told by the best authority that the story is an absolute falsehood  mr tyers in an historical essay on mr addison printed but not published has mentioned some facts concerning him with which we were not before acquainted these are that he was laid out for dead as soon as he was born that when he addressed his verses on the english poets to henry sacheverell he courted that gentlemans sister that whenever jacob tonson came to him for the spectator bayles french historical and critical dictionary lay always open before him that upon his return to england after his travels he discharged some old debts he had contracted at oxford with the generosity of good interest that he was put into plentiful circumstances by the death of a brother in the east indies that having received encouragement from a married lady of whom he had been formerly enamoured he had the integrity to resist the temptation that he refused a gratification of a three hundred pounds banknote and afterward of a diamondring of the same value from a major dunbar whom he had endeavored to serve in ireland by his interest with lord sunderland and that his daughter by lady warwick is still alive and unmarried residing at bilton near rugby and possessing an income of near twelve hundred a year  the following letter which probably relates to the case of major dunbar reflects great honor on mr addisons integrity  june         sir i find there is a very strong opposition formed against you but i shall wait on my lord lieutenant this morning and lay your case before him as advantageously as i can if he is not engaged in other company i am afraid what you say of his grace does not portend you any good and now sir believe me when i assure you i never did nor ever will on any pretense whatsoever take more than the stated and customary fees of my office i might keep the contrary practice concealed from the world were i capable of it but i could not from myself and i hope i shall always fear the reproaches of my own heart more than those of all mankind in the mean time if i can serve a gentleman of merit and such a character as you bear in the world the satisfaction i meet with on such an occasion is always a sufficient and the only reward to sir your most obedient humble servant j addison  the anecdote which follows was told by the late dr birch addison and mr temple stanyan were very intimate in the familiar conversations which passed between them they were accustomed freely to dispute each others opinions upon some occasion mr addison lent stanyan five hundred pounds after this mr stanyan behaved with a timid reserve deference and respect not conversing with the same freedom as formerly or canvassing his friends sentiments this gave great uneasiness to mr addison one day they happened to fall upon a subject on which mr stanyan had always been used strenuously to oppose his opinion but even upon this occasion he gave way to what his friend advanced without interposing his own view of the matter this hurt mr addison so much that he said to mr stanyan either contradict me or pay me the money  in tickells edition of mr addisons works there are several pieces hitherto unmentioned viz the dissertation on medals which though not published till after his death yet he had collected the materials and began to put them in order at vienna in   0  a pamphlet entitled the present state of the war and the necessity of an augmentation considered the late trial and conviction of count tariff the whig examiner came out on the   th of september      there were five of these papers attributed to mr addison and they are the severest pieces he ever wrote he is said also to have been the author of a performance entitled dissertatio de insignioribus romanorum poetis and of a discourse on ancient and modern learning  adrian or hadrian publius aelius the roman emperor was born at rome the   th of january in the   th year of christ his father left him an orphan at ten years of age under the guardianship of trajan and coelius tatianus a roman knight he began to serve very early in the armies having been tribune of a legion before the death of domitian he was the person chosen by the army of lower moesia to carry the news of nervas death to trajan successor to the empire he accompanied trajan in most of his expeditions and particularly distinguished himself in the second war against the daci and having before been quaestor as well as tribune of the people he was successively praetor governor of pannonia and consul after the siege of atra in arabia was raised trajan who had already given him the government of syria left him the command of the army and at length when he found death approaching it is said adopted him adrian who was then in antiochia as soon as he received the news thereof and of trajans death declared himself emperor on the   th of august     no sooner had he arrived at the imperial dignity than he made peace with the persians to whom he yielded up great part of the conquests of his predecessors and from generosity or policy he remitted the debts of the roman people which according to the calculation of those who have reduced them to modern money amounted to    00000 golden crowns and he burnt all the bonds and obligations relating to those debts that the people might be under no apprehension of being called to an account for them afterward there are medals in commemoration of this fact in which he is represented holding a flambeau in his hand to set fire to all those bonds which he had made void he went to visit all the provinces and did not return to rome till the year     when the senate decreed him a triumph and honored him with the title of father of his country but he refused both and desired that trajans image might triumph no prince traveled more than adrian there being hardly one province in the empire which he did not visit in   0 he went into gaul from thence he went to britain in order to subdue the caledonians who were making continual inroads into the provinces upon his arrival they retired toward the north he advanced however as far as york where he was diverted from his intended conquest by the description some old soldiers he found there who had served under agricola gave him of the country in hopes therefore of keeping them quiet by enlarging their bounds he delivered up to the caledonians all the lands lying between the two friths and the tyne and at the same time to secure the roman province from their future incursions built the famous wall which still bears his name having thus settled matters in britain he returned to rome where he was honored with the title of restorer of britain as appears by some medals he soon after went into spain to mauritania and at length into the east where he quieted the commotions raised by the parthians after having visited all the provinces of asia he returned to athens in     where he passed the winter and was initiated in the mysteries of eleusinian ceres he went from thence to sicily chiefly to view mount aetna contemplate its phenomena and enjoy the beautiful and extensive prospect afforded from its top he returned to rome the beginning of the year     and according to some went again the same year to africa and after his return from thence to the east he was in egypt in the year     revisited syria the year following returned to athens in     and to rome in     the persecution against the christians was very violent under his reign but it was at length suspended in consequence of the remonstrances of quadrat bishop of athens and aristides two christian philosophers who presented the emperor with some books in favor of the christian religion he conquered the jews and by way of insult erected a temple to jupiter on calvary and placed a statue of adonis in the manger of bethlehem he caused also the images of swine to be engraven on the gates of jerusalem at last he was seized with a dropsy which tormented him to such a degree that he became almost raving mad a great number of physicians were sent for and to the multitude of them he ascribed his death he died at baiae in the   d year of his age having reigned    years the latin verses he addressed to his soul have been much criticized and variously interpreted there are some fragments of his latin poems extant and there are greek verses of his in the anthology he also wrote the history of his own life to which however he did not choose to put his name but that of phlegon one of his freedmen a very learned person was prefixed to it he had great wit and an extensive memory he understood the sciences perfectly well but was very jealous of others who excelled in them he was also cruel envious and lascivious antoninus his successor obtained his apotheosis and prevented the rescission of his acts which the senate once intended  adrian iv pope the only englishman who ever had the honor of sitting in the papal chair his name was nicholas brekespere and he was born at langley near st albans in hertfordshire his father having left his family and taken the habit of the monastery of st albans nicholas was obliged to submit to the lowest offices in that house for daily support after some time he desired to take the habit in that monastery but was rejected by the abbot richard upon this he resolved to try his fortune in another country and accordingly went to paris where though in very poor circumstances he applied himself to his studies with great assiduity and made a wonderful proficiency but having still a strong inclination to a religious life he left paris and removed to provence where he became a regular clerk in the monastery of st rufus he was not immediately allowed to take the habit but passed some time by way of trial in recommending himself to the monks by a strict attention to all their commands this behavior together with the beauty of his person and prudent conversation rendered him so acceptable to those religious that after some time they entreated him to take the habit of the canonical order here he distinguished himself so much by his learning and strict observance of the monastic discipline that upon the death of the abbot he was chosen superior of that house and we are told that he rebuilt that convent pope eugenius iii being apprised of the great merit of nicholas and thinking he might be serviceable to the church in a higher station created him cardinalbishop of alba in      in      his holiness sent him legate to denmark and norway where by his fervent preaching and diligent instructions he converted those barbarous nations to the christian faith and erected upsal into an archiepiscopal see when he returned to rome he was received by the pope and cardinals with great marks of honor and pope anastasius who succeeded eugenius happening to die at this time nicholas was unanimously chosen to the holy see in november      and he took the name of adrian when the news of his promotion reached england king henry ii sent robert abbot of st albans and three bishops to rome to congratulate him on his election upon which occasion adrian granted very considerable privileges to the monastery of st albans particularly an exemption from all episcopal jurisdiction excepting to the sea of rome adrian in the beginning of his pontificate boldly withstood the attempts of the roman people to recover their ancient liberty under the consuls and obliged those magistrates to abdicate their authority and leave the government of the city to the pope in      he drove the heretic arnaud of bresse and his followers out of rome the same year he excommunicated william king of sicily who ravaged the territories of the church and absolved that princes subjects from their allegiance about the same time frederic king of the romans having entered italy with a powerful army adrian met him near sutrium and concluded a peace with him at this interview frederic consented to hold the popes stirrup whilst he mounted on horseback after which his holiness conducted that prince to rome and in st peters church placed the imperial crown on his head to the great mortification of the roman people who assembled in a tumultuous manner and killed several of the imperialists the next year a reconciliation was brought about between the pope and the sicilian king that prince taking an oath to do nothing farther to the prejudice of the church and adrian granting him the title of king of the two sicilies he built and fortified several castles and left the papal dominions in a more flourishing condition than he found them but notwithstanding all his success he was extremely sensible of the disquietudes attending so high a station and declared to his countryman john of salisbury that all the former hardships of his life were mere amusement to the misfortunes of the popedom that he looked upon st peters chair to be the most uneasy seat in the world and that his crown seemed to be clapped burning on his head he died september        in the fourth year and tenth month of his pontificate and was buried in st peters church near the tomb of his predecessor eugenius there are extant several letters and some homilies written by pope adrian  aeacus in fabulous history the son of jupiter by aegina when the isle of aegina was depopulated by a plague his father in compassion to his grief changed all the ants upon it into men and women who were called myrmidons from  an ant the foundation of the fable is said to be that when the country had been depopulated by pirates who forced the few that remained to take shelter in caves aeacus encouraged them to come out and by commerce and industry recover what they had lost his character for justice was such that in a time of universal drought he was nominated by the delphic oracle to intercede for greece and his prayer was answered the pagans also imagined that aeacus on account of his impartial justice was chosen by pluto one of the three judges of the dead and that it was his province to judge the europeans  aegeus in fabulous history was king of athens and the father of theseus the athenians having basely killed the son of minos king of crete for carrying away the prize from them minos made war upon the athenians and being victorious imposed this severe condition on aegeus that he should annually send into crete seven of the noblest of the athenian youths chosen by lot to be devoured by the minotaur on the fourth year of this tribute the choice fell on theseus or as others say he himself entreated to be sent the king at his sons departure gave orders that as the ship sailed with black sails it should return with the same in case he perished but if he became victorious he should change them into white when theseus returned from crete after killing the minotaur and forgot to change the sails in token of his victory according to the agreement with his father the latter who watched the return of the vessel supposing by the black sails that his son was dead cast himself headlong into the sea which afterward obtained the name of the aegean sea the athenians decreed aegeus divine honors and sacrificed to him as a marine deity the adopted son of neptune  aegineta paulus a celebrated surgeon of the island of aegina from whence he derived his name according to mr le clercs calculation he lived in the fourth century but abulpharagius the arabian who is allowed to give the best account of those times places him with more probability in the seventh his knowledge in surgery was very great and his works are deservedly famous fabricius ab aquapendente has thought fit to transcribe him in a great variety of places indeed the doctrine of paulus aegineta together with that of celsus and albucasis make up the whole text of this author he is the first writer who takes notice of the cathartic quality of rhubarb and according to dr milward is the first in all antiquity who deserves the title of a manmidwife  aeginhard the celebrated secretary and supposed soninlaw of charlemagne he is said to have been carried through the snow on the shoulders of the affectionate and ingenious imma to prevent his being tracked from her apartments by the emperor her father a story which the elegant pen of addison has copied and embellished from an old german chronicle and inserted in the third volume of the spectator  this happy lover supposing the story to be true seems to have possessed a heart not unworthy of so enchanting a mistress and to have returned her affection with the most faithful attachment for there is a letter of aeginhards still extant lamenting the death of his wife which is written in the tenderest strain of connubial affliction  it does not however express that this lady was the affectionate princess and indeed some late critics have proved that imma was not the daughter of charlemagne  but to return to our historian he was a native of germany and educated by the munificence of his imperial master of which he has left the most grateful testimony in his preface to the life of that monarch aeginhard after the loss of his lamented wife is supposed to have passed the remainder of his days in religious retirement and to have died soon after the year   0 his life of charlemagne his annals from     to     and his letters are all alfred inserted in the second volume of duchesnes scriptores francorum but there is an improved edition of this valuable historian with the annotations of hermann schmincke in  to       aegisthus in ancient history was the son of thyestes by his own daughter pilopeia who to conceal her shame exposed him in the woods some say he was taken up by a shepherd and suckled by a goat whence he was called aegisthus he corrupted clytemnestra the wife of agamemnon and with her assistance slew her husband and reigned seven years in mycenae he was together with clytemnestra slain by orestes pompey used to call julius caesar aegisthus on account of his having corrupted his wife mutia whom he afterward put away though he had three children by her  aelfrid or alfred the great by some called elfred and by others alred was the youngest son of aethelwolf king of the west saxons he was born anno     his father a wise and religious prince believing that he saw in him a brighter and a more promising genius than in his other children sent him when in his fifth year to rome where he was adopted by pope leo iv and anointed by him this some conceive to have been a regal unction others think he was only confirmed his father in the decline of life paying a visit to the holy see took this favorite son with him which afforded him an opportunity to make great improvement  on his return to england his parents were as fond of him as ever but this tenderness was not of service to aelfrid since it estranged him from learning and caused him to indulge idleness and a pursuit of youthful pleasures on his fathers death he had an appanage left him by will but his brothers who succeeded to the throne deluded him with fair promises and limited his possessions however his grave and philosophic turn of mind induced him to think of recovering the time he had lost in his nonage which made him the more readily admit these excuses and he would have been well contented with his books and ease but he was not long permitted to enjoy even these small comforts for the danes invading the kingdom he was obligated to quit a contemplative life for an active one he served his brothers both with his advice and person till their deaths when he became king in his own right a d     at the age of twentytwo he assumed this dignity with much reluctance not only from his love of a retired life but because he was well convinced that a crown though adorned with jewels was lined with cares and often proved a heavy burden to the wearer he had scarcely buried his brothers ere he was obliged to fight for that crown he had so unwillingly accepted he engaged the danish army at wilton and had the advantage on the first onset but the danes perceiving his weakness rallied in the pursuit and drove him out of the field this cannot be wondered at when we consider that exclusive of their inferiority in numbers the saxons had fought eight or nine battles that year and must have been harrassed excessively soon after this a treaty was concluded which the danes paid little attention to as they continued roaming about the country and plundering wherever they came they at length destroyed the kingdom of mercia and forced its monarch to leave his dominions and the island the next year they acted in a manner that gave aelfrid to understand he had nothing to trust to but arms for this reason he fitted out a fleet to guard the coasts and keep these rovers from landing this design produced in some degree the desired effect for a squadron of danish ships coming on the coast one was taken but a large army of danes commanded by several of their kings marched as far as grant bridge and quartered there the best part of the year the next summer they advanced to werham where king aelfrid met them with all the forces he could raise but finding himself too weak to encounter them concluded a peace which if some historians are to be credited was not done without the assistance of money however the peace was made and the danes swore never to invade his dominions this oath according to their usual custom they broke in a very few months and the year following     committed fresh and great hostilities which caused the king to march against them with all the forces he could get together he found them at exeter where he kept them besieged for some time in the mean while his fleet successfully engaged the enemy at sea for notwithstanding theirs consisted of an hundred and twenty sail many were sunk and the rest dispersed which in attempting to gain some of the english ports were driven by a storm on the coasts and all perished the barbarians were so discouraged at this that they made peace once more and gave hostages but in     having gained fresh supplies they revisited wiltshire in such numbers that the saxons could not be prevailed on to make head against them many to avoid them fled from the kingdom others submitted themselves and the rest suffering their fear to supersede their duty fled to the most likely place of security aelfrid no longer conceiving himself a king laid aside all signs of royalty and to secure his person took shelter in the house of a peasant who kept his cattle while he continued in this retreat a trifling adventure occurred which is noticed by several historians the good woman of the house having made some cakes put them before the fire to toast and seeing aelfrid sitting by trimming his bow and arrows she made no doubt but he would take care of them but he it seems intent on what he was about let the cakes burn which so enraged the woman that she scolded him severely telling him that he would be glad to eat them and therefore ought to have looked after them the king however did not long remain in this deplorable situation for observing that a part of somersetshire was so enclosed by the waters of the perrot and the the one as to form a morass which it was almost impracticable to force he built a fort in the center where there were about two acres of firm ground for the security of himself his family and a few faithful servants who repaired thither to him this place he named aethelingey or rather aethelingaigge that is the isle of nobles now called athelney he continued there some months frequently sallying out upon the danes with incredible secresy and success when he had spent almost a year in this manner he learnt that some of his subjects had routed a great army of danes killed their chiefs or kings and taken their magical standard he then issued out letters to acquaint them with the place where he was and to invite the nobility to come and consult with him this they did and were much pleased when the king proposed taking the field with an army and not to act any longer by stealth with the enemy but before they came to a final resolution aelfrid that his subjects might not hazard too much exposed his own person in an extraordinary manner  he went in the habit of a harper into the enemys camp and was admitted every where about it without suspicion he even had the honor to play before their princes having furnished himself with an exact knowledge of their situation he returned with great secresy to his friends whom he directed to go to their several homes and each of them to draw together as great a force as he possibly could with which on a day prefixed he was to come to the great wood now called selwood in wiltshire this they punctually performed and the danes were not a little surprised when they heard that king aelfrid whom they looked upon as a fugitive was preparing to attack them with a royal army the king took advantage of their confusion fell upon and totally defeated them at aethendune now called eddington those who escaped took possession of a ruined castle in the neighborhood which they fortified but they were soon besieged by the victorious saxons after a long and close siege the danes were obliged to surrender at discretion aelfrid behaved to them like a merciful prince by giving up the kingdom of the east angles to such as would embrace the christian religion on condition that they would oblige the rest of their countrymen to quit the island and prevent as far as was in their power the landing of any more foreigners for the performance of these articles he took hostages and when in pursuance of the treaty guthrum the danish captain or king came with thirty of his chief officers to aelfrid who then lay encamped at aalre now auler a small village in somersetshire to be baptized the king answered for him at the fort gave him the name of aethelstan and adopted him for his son he then entertained him and his friends twelve days at his house at wedmore or wetmore and then dismissed them with noble presents by the danes turning christians the saxons gained this great advantage that they now kept their oaths and for the present remained very quiet some time after this a fresh set of danes came up the river thames and wintered at fulham but finding aelfrid well prepared to receive them thought proper to go off and try their fortunes in france the saxon fleet being very successful at sea the king spared neither pains nor expense to keep it in good order in     the danes landed in kent and laid siege to rochester but it was so bravely defended by the inhabitants that the king came in time to relieve them forced the enemy to raise the siege and return once more to france soon after his fleet had the good fortune to beat a very considerable one of the danes destroyed thirteen ships and according to the kings orders gave no quarter to any of the men on board in a short time after this the saxons themselves were defeated but this was an advantage to them as it caused them to be more vigilant for the future aelfrid having some leisure time now resolved to repair refortify and repeople the city of london which he had lately recovered from the danes and meant to keep as a frontier accordingly he reedified it placed a garrison in it and established aethered as the governor he created him earl of mercia and gave him his daughter aethelfleda in marriage this earl was a gallant officer and great statesman for which reason the saxons that had submitted to the danes and the danes that had began to learn the saxon manners were obedient to him and settled in london and the other places under his jurisdiction after a peace of some years aelfrid was again called into the field for the danes who had been severely beaten in the west of france came with a fleet of two hundred and sixty sail on the east coast of kent and landing fixed themselves at appletree shortly after another fleet came up the thames consisting of eighty vessels they landed the soldiers and built a fort at middleton aelfrid on finding himself in this situation drew together a considerable army but before he marched against the enemy he obliged the danes that were settled in northumberland and essex to give hostages for their good behavior he then moved toward the invaders and very prudently chose a camp between their armies by which means he prevented their junction a great body of them moved into essex and from thence crossing the river came into surrey the kings forces met and defeated them at farnham in the midst of these confusions the danes who were settled in northumberland broke their faith and notwithstanding the hostages they had given equipped two fleets the one of a hundred and the other of forty vessels after plundering the northern and southern coasts they sailed round came to exeter and besieged it as soon as the king heard of their perfidious behavior he resolved to march immediately to exeter leaving behind him a great body of welsh the danes had got possession of the place before he arrived however he shut them up in it and notwithstanding they made many desperate sallies kept them effectually blocked up the body of welsh he had left behind him thinking it neither their interest nor duty to be idle marched to london and joined the citizens they had not been long in london before news came that haesten one of the danish kings with most of his forces was marched out to forage and had left his family and riches at beamfleet where he had built a fort they resolved to attack it in his absence and succeeded in their enterprise not only taking the place with his wife and children but also all the riches they had collected by many years rapine haesten when he received the news was so much grieved that he sent to aelfrid who was then before exeter to beg a peace which the good king granted upon very reasonable terms and which he like a true dane broke as soon as it was concluded he plundered the district belonging to earl aethered though he had stood godfather to one of this princes sons and after all joining the other danish army marched with them to shobury in essex where they built another castle then passing the thames with those who joined them from northumberland and the territories of the east angles they marched on to the severn laying waste all in their way on the banks of this river viz at the buttington in montgomeryshire aelfrids generals gave them a check and on the opposite side of the river hindered them from passing for many weeks in the mean time the king had kept such a close siege at exeter and drove the people to such extremities that having eaten their horses they were ready to devour one another rendered desperate by despair they sallied on the kings forces but were beaten though with great loss on the kings side the remains of this body of the danes fled to their ships and to their fort they had built in essex before the king had time to recruit another danish leader whose name was laf came with a great army out of northumberland and destroyed all before them marching on to the city of werheal or chester there they remained the rest of that year the next they invaded north wales which they plundered and destroyed and when there was nothing more to be taken they divided one party returning into northumberland and the other into the territories of the east angles whence proceeding into essex they seized upon a small island called meresig they parted soon after this some sailing up the river thames and others up to lee road where drawing up their ships they built a fort twenty miles from london which proved a great curb upon the citizens the londoners unable to bear this restraint with any patience went in a large body and attacked the fort but were repulsed with considerable loss which obliged the king about harvesttime to encamp in the neighborhood of that city in order to cover the reapers from the incursions of the danes aelfrid one day riding by the river lee formed an opinion that by cutting certain trenches the danish ships might be laid quite dry this he attempted and succeeded in so well that the danes abandoned their fort and marched away to the banks of the severn where having built a fortress at a place called quatbrig they wintered there such of the danish ships as could be got off the londoners carried in triumph into their own road and destroyed the rest during three years the english were not only vexed with the continual irruptions of these barbarous people but suffered greatly by a dreadful plague which affected both people and cattle the danes ever restless began again to invade the territories of the west saxons both by land and sea having acquired the art of building long and large ships they were in a manner masters of that element and of course depopulated all the coast aelfrid having long ruminated on the best method to prevent those evils contrived larger and better ships than the danes and sent them on the coasts of the isle of wight and of devonshire which were at that time infested by pirates aelfrids squadron succeeded as well as could be expected driving two of their ships on shore sinking three and suffering only one to escape this was not executed without great loss on the kings side particularly among the officers such of the danes as landed when their ships ran on shore were taken prisoners and brought to the king at winchester where he passed sentence upon them to be hanged as pirates and murderers in the subsequent part of the kings life viz in the years     and     nothing remarkable happened except that the king employed the peace and leisure he then enjoyed in establishing effectually that government which he had been at such pains to frame not more for the security of himself and successors than for the benefit of his subjects in general  before the reign of aelfrid there were many kings who took the title but none who could with propriety be called monarch of the english nation for though there always remained after the time of egbert a prince who held a kind of preeminence over the rest yet he had not the direct dominion over his subjects this aelfrid had in the latter part of his reign to him all parts of england not in possession of the danes submitted and a great part of wales this great power was attained more by his wisdom and mildness than his sword or ambition of ruling we have already mentioned the laws he made and though there are few remaining which we can ascertain to be his yet we are well informed that to his regulations we owe many advantages which render our constitution dear to us for instance trials by juries his institutions were what is called the common law so styled says a great author either on account of its being the common law of all the saxons without respect to the kingdoms where they lived or because it was common both to the saxons and danes it is indeed a disputed point whether he was the first who divided the kingdom into shires but that he settled those boundaries and lesser distinctions that remain to this day admits of no doubt on this subject he formed a book which contained a survey of the kingdom and of which the doomesday book is in some respect a second edition he also made use of those divisions for the proper distribution of justice so happily that though he found the kingdom in the utmost confusion and the people in it so indigent and given to rapine that it was equally difficult to acquire wealth or to keep it when acquired yet by his prudent government he so effectually cured the covetous spirit which induces one man to take from another that authors tell us money and jewels might be left on the public roads with the greatest safety in the direction of state affairs he followed the customs of his ancestors the kings of the west saxons he made use of the great council of the kingdom consisting of bishops earls the kings aldermen and his chief thanes or barons whom in the first part of his reign he convoked as occasion required but when things were better settled he made a law that twice in the year an assembly or parliament should be held at london to provide for the wellgoverning of the commonwealth as to extraordinary affairs and such emergencies as would not admit of calling great councils the king then acted by the advice of his bishops earls and officers of the army who happened to be near his person with respect to military concerns there has been so much said already that it renders it almost unnecessary to add much here let it however be observed that though this nation could never boast of a greater soldier he was neither cruel bloodthirsty or ambitious he never made war willingly with any or refused to grant peace when it was desired he fought fiftysix set battles by sea and land eight of which happened in one year by degrees he rendered his troops invincible by a just and regular discipline and appointed such methods of raising recruiting and distributing them in winter quarters that his subjects and militia were synonymous terms every man who could bear arms was a soldier and no one served out of his turn his coasts he secured by guardships his frontiers were covered with castles well fortified which before his time the saxons had never raised added to all this his instructions and example raised numbers of abl officers whose abilities the king constantly cherished by proportionable rewards in other affairs aelfrid was equally great and industrious as appears by his repairing the cities throughout his dominions which were demolished by the danes erecting new ones and adorning and embellishing such as were in a mean and low condition we may judge of the great things he perormed in this way since it is affirmed that one sixth part of his clear revenus was applied to the payment of his workmens wages this prince was extremely remarkable for his piety with respect to religious foundations and excelled most of his predecessors in this point for besides reedifying and restoring almost every monastery in his dominions which the prevailing poverty of the times or the sacrilegious fury of the danes had brought to ruin he built many and improved more besides other acts of munificence toward the church as to his founding the university of oxford it is a matter that has been so warmly disputed that we shall only say what is certainly due to him on that head he restored and settled it endowed it with revenues and placed there the most celebrated professors of several sciences a king who was so careful of his people might well allow something to his royal magnificence especially as he was ever mindful of his subjects honor and attentive to their ease he repaired all the royal palaces which the confusion of the times before his reign had brought to decay adorned the houses of pleasure in the country and built many from the ground where the situation was tempting he had always a very numerous court and above all things took great pleasure in seeing his nobility about him to do this without prejudice to the public he fell upon a method which ought not to be forgotten he framed three different households each under a separate lord chamberlain these waited in their turns a month every quarter so that in the year each of the kings menial servants was four months at court and eight at home in all other respects he was extremely careful to keep up both the dignity and luster of his court but whether he made use of an imperial crown enriched with jewels as some affirm is a point which may admit of dispute to conclude his character as a king and there is not a brighter in the english or perhaps any chronicles we shall take notice of the manner in which he settled his revenue and to which he strictly adhered throughout his life he first divided it equally assigning one part to sacred the other to civil uses the former he divided into four parts one to be bestowed in alms upon the poor in general another he destined for the support of religious houses which he had founded a third was given to the public schools and the fourth employed in rebuilding or relieving monasteries and other public foundations at home and abroad the other moiety of his revenue was divided into three parts one for the support of his household another for the payment of his workmen and a third for the entertainment and relief of strangers  in his private life he was the most worthy the most industrious and the most amiable man in his dominions of so equal a temper that after he had once taken the crown he never suffered either sadness or unbecoming gaiety to enter his mind but appeared always of a calm yet cheerful disposition familiar with his friends and just even to his enemies kind and tender to all he watched over his time with great care and gave strong evidences of much learning with all these qualifications so many virtues and so few vices we need not wonder that he died universally lamented by his subjects this happened after a glorious reign of upwards of twentyeight years on the  0th of october a d  00 this king had to wife aelswith or aethelwith daughter to earl aethelred by whom he had two sons and three daughters edward the eldest succeeded him on the throne and is by most historians called edward the elder to distinguish him from the confessor his second son was aetheward the youngest of all his children and bred a scholar his eldest daughter aethelfleda was a woman of more than feminine spirit and possessed such a share of her fathers virtues as enabled her to be very useful to her brother edward by giving him good advice she married aethered earl of mercia and together with him had the care of her nephew aethelstan aelfrids second daughter was called aethelgeow or aethelgora and was abbess of her fathers new foundation at athelney his youngest daughter called aelfreda married baldwin earl of flanders when we consider the fame of this great king we need not be surprised that all our historians have been particular in transmitting the memory of his exploits to posterity or that many considerable persons should compose special memoirs of his life amongst these the first was asserius menevensis who wrote in the kings lifetime and dedicated his book to aelfrid himself in later times sir john spelman composed in english the life of this great prince which he deposited in manuscript in the bodleian library where it remained a long time before it was given to the public at last it appeared in a latin translation by the ingenious mr christopher wise this only served to raise a desire of seeing sir john spelmans life as he left it which after much expectation was gratified by mr thomas hearne besides these is a life or rather a parallel between the life of aelfrid and that of charles i written by a mr powell with great ingenuity and learning it would be doing this nation infinite service if a person equal to the task would from these and other helps which might be met with compose a new life of aelfrid inserting his laws and other things in their proper places and illustrating them as well as whatever passages might require it with copious dissertations this would place one of the most glorious periods of our history in a proper light and give us a very pleasing view of our ancient constitution which the better it is understood will appear to have been the best conducted for promoting the glory of the monarch and the good of the subject that ever the world saw or in all probability ever will unless some future aelfrid arise and reform all the errors that time and accidents have brought into our system  there was another aelfrid an illegitimate son of oswy king of northumberland and a third whom we find distinguished in english history viz  aelfred son to king aethelred by emma of normandy was halfbrother to king edmund ironside and brother of the whole blood to edward the confessor his fathers misfortunes being heavy it was judged proper anno  0   to send him and his brother edward into normandy to be bred up at the court of their uncle duke richard the norman historians say that aethelred himself was obliged to fly into normandy from the fury of the danes and left his two sons there after this kings death his widow queen emma marrying the danish king canute her sons remained there duke robert was kind to them and when they were grown up he made such preparations for invading england as alarmed the danish monarch and induced him to surrender a part of england to them but their protector robert going to the holy land the dane thought no more of the treaty however aelfred resolved to venture something to recover his birthright and embarking with a considerable body of norman troops arrived in england he probably would have succeeded against harold hatefoot canutes son had he not been prevented by treachery  godwin earl of kent pretended to join him but perfidiously drew him into an ambuscade near guilford where after a slight resistance he and his normans were made prisoners his troops were decimated and himself carried prisoner to the isle of ely his eyes were put out and he was committed to the care of the monks of that monastery where he soon after died some suspect by a violent death his abilities are said by our historians to be very great he had more spirit than his brother edward which was the cause of his ruin for earl godwin having offered him his daughter he rejected it with scorn and showed too great a confidence in the normans this the crafty earl took advantage of to prejudice the english against him some suspicions respecting his sudden death fell on his mother who was certainly too much in the interest of the danes  aelian claudius born at praeneste in italy he taught rhetoric at rome according to perizonius under the emperor alexander severus he was surnamed  honeymouth on account of the sweetness of his style he was likewise honored with the title of sophist an appellation in his days given only to men of learning and wisdom he loved retirement and devoted himself to study he greatly admired and studied plato aristotle isocrates plutarch homer anacreon archilochus etc and though a roman gives the preference to the writers of the greek nation his two most celebrated works are his various history and history of animals he composed likewise a book on providence mentioned by eustathius and another on divine appearances or the declarations of providence there have been several editions of his various history  aemilius paulus the son of lucius paulus who was killed at the battle of canhae was twice consul in his first consulate he triumphed over the ligurians and in the second subdued perseus king of macedonia and reduced that country to a roman province on which he obtained the surname of macedonicus he returned to rome loaded with glory and triumphed for three days he died     years before christ  aemilius paulus a celebrated historian born at verona who obtained such reputation in italy that he was invited into france by the cardinal of bourbon in the reign of lewis xii in order to write the history of the kings of france in latin and was given a canonry in the cathedral of paris he was near thirty years in writing that history which has been greatly admired he died at paris on the  th of may       aeneas a famous trojan prince the son of anchises and venus at the destruction of troy he bore his aged father on his back and saved him from the greeks but being too solicitous about his son and household gods lost his wife creusa in the escape landing in africa he was kindly received by queen dido but quitting her coast he arrived in italy where he married lavinia the daughter of king latinus and defeated turnus to whom she had been contracted after the death of his fatherinlaw he was made king of the latins over whom he reigned three years but joining with the aborigines was slain in a battle against the tuscans virgil has rendered the name of this prince immortal by making him the hero of his poem  aeschines a socratic philosopher the son of charinus a sausagemaker he was continually with socrates which occasioned this philosopher to say that the sausagemakers son was the only person who knew how to pay a due regard to him it is said that poverty obliged him to go to sicily to dionysius the tyrant and that he met with great contempt from plato but was extremely well received by aristippus to whom he showed some of his dialogues and received from him a handsome reward he would not venture to profess philosophy at athens plato and aristippus being in such high esteem but he set up a school to maintain himself he afterward wrote orations for the forum phrynieus in photius ranks him amongst the best orators and mentions his orations as the standard of the pure attic style hermogenes has also spoken very highly of him  he also wrote several dialogues of which there are only three extant   concerning virtue whether it can be taught   eryxias or erasistratus concerning riches whether they are good   axiocus concerning death whether it is to be feared mr le clerc has given a latin translation of them with notes and several dissertations entitled sylvae philologicae  aeschylus the tragic poet was born at athens authors differ in regard to the time of his birth some placing it in the   th others in the  0th olympiad but according to stanley who relies on the arundelian marbles he was born in the   d olympiad he was the son of euphorion and brother to cynegirus and aminias who distinguished themselves in the battle of marathon and the sea fight of salamis at which engagements aeschylus was likewise present in this last action according to diodorus siculus aminias the younger of the three brothers commanded a squadron of ships and behaved with so much conduct and bravery that he sunk the admiral of the persian fleet and signalized himself above all the athenians to this brother our poet was upon a particular occasion obliged for saving his life aelian relates that aeschylus being charged by the athenians with certain blasphemous expressions in some of his pieces was accused of impiety and condemned to be stoned to death they were just going to put the sentence into execution when aminias with a happy presence of mind throwing aside his cloak showed his arm without a hand which he had lost at the battle of salamis in defense of his country this sight made such an impression on the judges that touched with the remembrance of his valor and with the friendship he showed for his brother they pardoned aeschylus our poet however resented the indignity of this prosecution and resolved to leave a place where his life had been in danger he became more determined in this resolution when he found his pieces less pleasing to the athenians than those of sophocles though a much younger writer some affirm that aeschylus never sat down to compose but when he had drank liberally he wrote a great number of tragedies of which there are but seven remaining and notwithstanding the sharp censures of some critics he must be allowed to have been the father of the tragic art in the time of thespis there was no public theater to act upon the strollers driving about from place to place in a cart aeschylus furnished his actors with masks and dressed them suitably to their characters he likewise introduced the buskin to make them more like heroes  the ancients gave aeschylus also the praise of having been the first who removed murders and shocking sights from the eyes of the spectators he is said likewise to have lessened the number of the chorus m le fevre has observed that aeschylus never represented women in love in his tragedies which he says was not suited to his genius but in representing a woman transported with fury he was incomparable longinus says that aeschylus has a noble boldness of expression and that his imagination is lofty and heroic it must be owned however that he affected pompous words and that his sense is too often obscured by figures this gave salmasius occasion to say that he was more difficult to be understood than the scripture itself but notwithstanding these imperfections this poet was held in great veneration by the athenians who made a public decree that his tragedies should be played after his death he was killed in the   th year of his age by an eagle letting fall a tortoise upon his head as he was walking in the fields he had the honor of a pompous funeral from the sicilians who buried him near the river gela and the tragedians of the country performed plays and theatrical exercises at his tomb  the best edition of his plays is that of london      fol with a latin translation and a learned commentary by thomas stanly  aesculapius in the heathen mythology the god of physic was the son of apollo and the nymph coronis he was educated by the centaur chiron who taught him physic by which means aesculapius cured the most desperate diseases but jupiter enraged at his restoring to life hippolitus who had been torn in pieces by his own horses killed him with a thunderbolt according to cicero there were three deities of this name the first the son of apollo worshipped in arcadia who invented the probe and bandages for wounds the second the brother of mercury killed by lightning and the third the son of arisippus and arsinoe who first taught the art of toothdrawing and purging at epidaurus aesculapiuss statue was of gold and ivory with a long beard his head surrounded with rays holding in one hand a knotty stick and the other entwined with a serpent he was seated on a throne of the same materials as his statue and had a dog lying at his feet the romans crowned him with laurel to represent his descent from apollo and the phaliasins represented him as beardless the cock the raven and the goat were sacred to this deity his chief temples were at pergamus smyrna trica a city in ionia and the isle of coos in all which votive tblets were hung up showing the diseases cured by his assistance but his most famous shrine was at epidaurus where every five years games were instituted to him nine days after the isthmian games at corinth  aesop the phrygian lived in the time of solon about the  0th olympiad under the reign of croesus the last king of lydia he was greatly indebted to nature for his genius and abilities but little else as he was born a slave and very much deformed in his person however his great genius enabled him to support his misfortunes with patience in the course of his servitude he composed those fables which are so generally and deservedly admired he is supposed by many to have been the first writer of that kind but this is contested by others particularly by quintilian who seems to think hesiod was the first author of fables aesop however excelled in this art to a very great degree  the first master whom aesop served was one carasius demarehus a inhabitant of athens and in all probability he there acquired his purity in the greek tongue after serving many masters he was enfranchised by a philosopher named idmon when he had gained his liberty he soon acquired great reputation among the greeks the report of hi wisdom having reached croesus he sent after him and engaged him i his service he traveled through greece and passed by athens soon after pisistratus had assumed the sovereign power finding the athenians very impatient under their yoke he told them the fable of the frogs who petitioned jupiter for a king aesop was certainly happy in his inventions to instruct mankind the images he makes use of are all that is necessary to perfect a precept and are both useful and agreeable he may be justly esteemed wise since he wrote in an entertaining and persuasive style which charms and captivates the human mind aesop suffered death at delphi plutarch says he came thither with a large sum of money sent by croesus to offer a sacrifice to apollo and to distribute among the inhabitants but a quarrel arising between him and the inhabitants he sent the money back to croesus for this they contrived an accusation of sacrilege against him and pretending they had convicted him threw him headlong from a rock for this cruel action we are told they were visited by a famine and pestilence and on consulting the oracle they received for answer that the god designed this as a punishment for the treatment of aesop they endeavored to make an atonement by erecting a pyramid to his honor  aesop clodius a celebrated actor cotemporary with roscius the first excelling in tragedy the latter in comedy cicero put himself under their tuition to perfect his action the luxury and extravagance of the romans were in his time so great that this man although an actor lived in the most expensive manner yet did the folly of the age enable him to support such extravagance and die immensely rich when he was on the stage he is said to have entered so warmly into his part as to be seized almost with phrensy  aetion a celebrated painter who has left us an excellent picture of roxana and alexander which he exhibited at the olympic games it represents a magnificent chamber where roxana is sitting on a bed of a most splendid appearance which is rendered still more brilliant by her beauty she looks downwards in a kind of confusion being struck with the presence of alexander standing before her a number of little cupids flutter about some holding up the curtain as if to show roxana to the prince whilst others are busied in undressing the lady some pull alexander by the cloak who appears like a young bashful bridegroom and present him to his mistress he lays his crown at her feet being accompanied by ephestion who holds a torch in his hand and leans upon a youth who represents hymen several other little cupids are represented playing with his arms some carry his lance stooping under so heavy a weight others bear along his buckler upon which one of them is seated whom the rest carry in triumph another lies in ambush in his armor waiting to frighten the rest as they pass by this picture gained aetion so much reputation that the president of the games gave him his daughter in marriage  aetius one of the most zealous defenders of arianism was born in syria and flourished about the year     after being servant to a grammarian of whom he learned grammar and logic he was ordained deacon and at length bishop by eudoxus patriarch of constantinople st epiphanius has preserved    of his propositions against the trinity his followers were called aetians  afer domitius a celebrated orator born at nismes who flourished under the emperor tiberius and three of his successors he is highly applauded by quintilian but disgraced his talents by practicing the infamous trade of an informer quintilian in his youth cultivated the friendship of domitius he tells us that his pleadings abounded with pleasant allusions and mentions two books of his on witnesses  domitius was a proof how dangerous it is for a man to exercise his humor too constantly he had put an inscription on a statue of caligula declaring him to have been a second time consul at the age of    this was intended as an encomium but caligula thinking it was meant by domitius as a sarcasm on his youth and his infringement of the laws raising a process pleaded against him himself domitius instead of attempting a defense repeated a part of the emperors speech with the highest degree of admiration fell on his knees implored pardon of the emperor and declared he dreaded his eloquence more than his imperial power this artful flattery succeeded so well that he was not only pardoned but raised to the consulate  afranius a latin poet who flourished about the   th olympiad he wrote latin comedies in imitation of menander which are much praised by cicero and quintilian  africanus julius an historian of repute who wrote a chronicle which was much esteemed the only remains of this work are to be found in eusebius and which ended at the    st year of the vulgar era his letter to aristides in which he reconciles the seeming contradictions in the two genealogies of our savior recorded by the apostles matthew and luke  agamemnon the son of atreus by aerope was commander in chief of the grecian forces against troy his wife clytemnestra proved unfaithful to him in his absence and on his return he was slain by her lover aegistus who by her means assumed the government  agard arthur a learned and industrious antiquary was born    0 and educated for the practice of the law in process of time he became a clerk in the exchequer office and in    0 deputy chamberlain of the exchequer under sir nicholas throgmorton which place he held fortyfive years the great love he had for english antiquities led him to make large and laborious collections and the office he held afforded him an opportunity to acquire great skill in the most intricate part of the antiquarys study a conformity of studies brought him acquainted with the elder sir robert cotton with whom he ever had a strict friendship indeed anthony wood tells us he received all his knowledge in antiquities from him which is not very probable as he came into the exchequer office the same year sir robert cotton was born besides sir robert cotton mr agard had the most learned and eminent men in the kingdom for his friends and acquaintance there existed in his time a most illustrious assembly of learned persons who styled themselves a society of antiquaries mr agard was one of the principal members as appears from some discourses read in that society and since printed and published by mr hearne besides five discourses in this collection and another of much older date it is not known that our author had more in print these however show that in antiquities he had few equals and no superiors  in the business of his office he was particularly expert as is evident from his discovering richardus filius nigelli to be the author of the dialogue of the exchequer which generally goes under the name of giraldus tilburiensis mr madox who published the history of the exchequer owned that this had been discovered by our author agard who communicated it to the famous seldom the doomesday book our author had made his chief and particular study and published a large and learned work on purpose to explain it which was preserved in the cotton library he likewise employed three years in composing a book for the case of his successors containing a catalogue of such records as were in the four treasuries and an account of all leagues treaties of peace etc with foreign nations this treatise he deposited with the officers of the receipt for the use of succeeding officers  by his will he directed that eleven other manuscript treatises relative to exchequer matters should be delivered up to the office all the rest of his valuable collections he bequeathed to his old friend sir robert cotton in whose library as many as remain are still to be found for notwithstanding his making so much use of his pen his modesty would not permit him to publish any thing after having thus spent his days in learned tranquillity he thought of death before it came and caused a monument to be erected in the cloister westminster abbey near the chapeldoor he died august  0      mr camden styles him a most excellent antiquary mr seldom says he was most painful and industrious in things of that nature from these testimonies we must conceive a high opinion of mr agards merit  agatho a tragic poet much applauded by plato for his virtue and beauty he obtained the prize at the olympic games in the  th year of the  0th olympiad we have nothing extant of his except a few quotations in aristotle athenius and some others  agathocles the celebrated tyrant of sicily who from being the son of a potter commenced thief turned common soldier was promoted to be a centurion then a general and afterward turned a pirate all in regular succession he defeated the carthaginians several times in sicily was made king or tyrant of syracuse and then of all sicily and made war with success on the above people both in sicily and africa but meeting with a reverse of fortune and being in arrears with his soldiers they mutinied and compelled him to fly from his camp they then cruelly destroyed his children whom he left behind gaining strength again he returned to sicily and put to death first the wives and children of the soldiers who had murdered his and afterward the soldiers themselves he was at length poisoned at the age of    having reigned    years  agelnoth in latin achelnotus archbishop of canterbury in the reign of canute the great this prelate surnamed the good was son of earl agilmer and at the time of his election dean of canterbury after his promotion he went to rome and received his pall from pope benedict viii in his way thither he passed through pavia and there purchased for a hundred talents of silver and one of gold st augustins arm which was kept there as a relic and sent it over to england as a present to leofric earl of coventry on his return he is said to have raised the sea of canterbury to its former luster he was much in favor with king canute and employed his interest with that monarch to good purposes by his advice the king remitted large sums for the support of foreign churches and was led by him to many other acts of charity when canute died agelnoth refused to crown harold alleging that the late king had enjoined him to set the crown on the head of none but the issue of queen emma after which declaration he laid the crown upon the altar with an imprecation against those bishops who should perform the ceremony harold endeavored both by menaces and offers to prevail upon the archbishop but in vain and whether he was afterward crowned by any other person is uncertain agelnoth after he had been sixteen years archbishop died october     0    agrippa herod the son of aristobolus was grandson of herod the great and born in the year of the world      after the death of his father herod his grandfather completed his education and sent him to rome to pay his court to tiberius the emperor professed a great regard for agrippa and placed him in a situation under his son drusus whose affection he soon gained but the sudden death of drusus caused all those who had been much esteemed by him to be removed from rome by the command of tiberius who was fearful their presence might add to his affliction agrippa after having indulged his inclination almost to excess found himself under the necessity of quitting rome involved in debt and very indigent he abandoned the idea of returning to jerusalem being conscious he could not make a figure there suitable to his birth for this reason he retired to the castle of massada where he lived for some time by the assistance of his uncle herod more like a prince than what he really was he made him principal magistrate of tiberias and gave him a large sum of money but the expenses of agrippa were so enormous that his uncle grew weary of assisting him and reproached him with his extravagance agrippa took offense at this and resolved to return to rome when he arrived there he was received favorably by tiberius and commanded to attend the son of drusus but agrippa preferring caius the son of germanicus and grandson of the empress antonia whose favor he had formerly enjoyed attached himself to him with great assiduity the behavior and abilities of agrippa made such an impression on this prince that he kept him constantly about his person  eutyches a slave whom agrippa had made free overheard him one day express a wish for the death of tiberius and advancement of caius which he made known to the emperor in consequence of this agrippa was committed to the custody of an officer and loaded with fetters but was soon released from his confinement by the death of tiberius who was succeeded by caius caligula the new emperor bestowed many favors upon agrippa gave him a chain of gold in exchange for his iron fetters placed a crown upon his head and granted him the tetrarchy which philip the son of herod the great had possessed that is batanaea and trachonitis and added to this that of lysanias agrippa soon went to judea to take possession of his new kingdom  caius was soon after killed and agrippa being then at rome advised claudius to keep possession of the imperial dignity to which he had been advanced by the army agrippa in this affair showed more cunning and address than sincerity and honesty for while he pretended to be in the interest of the senate he secretly prevailed upon claudius to be resolute and not abandon his good fortune for this advice the emperor gave him all judea and the kingdom of chalcis which had been possessed by his brother herod thus agrippa became suddenly one of the greatest princes of the east and possessed of as many territories if not more than herod the great had ever held agrippa now returned to judea and reigned with great satisfaction to the jews but through too great a desire of pleasing them and a mistaken zeal for their religion he committed an action the injustice of which is related in scripture acts xii     etc for about the feast of passover in the year of jesus christ    st james major the son of zebedee and brother to st john the evangelist was seized by his order and put to death he also laid hands on st peter and imprisoned him with an intent to execute him when the festival was over but god having miraculously delivered st peter from his confinement frustrated the designs of agrippa after the passover this prince went to cesarea and had games performed there in honor of claudius the inhabitants of tire and sidon waited on him here to sue for peace agrippa came early in the morning to the theater with a design to give them audience and seated himself on his throne dressed in a robe of silver tissue embroidered in an elegant style the rays of the rising sun darting on it gave it such a luster that the eyes of the spectators were dazzled with looking on it and when the king spoke to the tyrians or sidonians the parasites around said it was the voice of a god and not that of a man instead of rejecting these impious flatteries agrippa received them with an air of complacency but at the same time observed an owl above him on a cord he had seen the same bird before when he was in bonds by order of tiberius and it was then told him that he should be soon set at liberty but that whenever he saw the same thing a second time he should not live above five days afterward he was therefore extremely terrified and died at the end of five days racked with tormenting pains in his bowels and devoured with worms such was the death of herod agrippa after a reign of seven years in the year of christ     agrippa marcus vespanius soninlaw to augustus of low birth but one of the greatest generals rome ever had the victory gained by augustus over pompey and mark anthony was owing to his counsel he adorned the city with the pantheon baths aqueducts etc  agrippa cornelius a man of great learning born at cologne in      and reported to be a great magician by the monks of that time who pronounced every thing which they did not understand to be sorcery or heresy to ingratiate himself into the favor of margaret of austria he composed his treatise on the excellence of women which did not fail in its effect for that princess gave him the place of historiographer to the emperor in    0 he published the treatise of the vanity of the sciences which greatly enraged his enemies as did that of occult philosophy which he printed soon after at antwerp he wrote something against francis is mother which occasioned him to be imprisoned in france but he was soon liberated and went to grenoble where he died in       agrippina the daughter of gcrmanicus and mother of nero a woman of great art and lewdness she was married thrice the last time to claudius her uncle whom she poisoned to make way for her son nero to ascend the throne nero afterward caused her to be murdered  ajax the son of telamon was next to achilles the most valiant general among the greeks at the siege of troy he commanded the troops of salamis and performed many great actions of which we have an account in the iliad the greeks paid great honors to him after his death and erected a monument to his memory upon the promontory of rhetium  aidan son of goran king of scotland his father was murdered by conspirators in the year     at which time this prince was very young eugenius nephew to the last king succeeded to the throne he was a good officer and a wise prince having gained much experience in the service of the celebrated arthur king of the britons whom he long served under but at the same time very artful he laid aside all thoughts of revenging his uncles murder and even took into his favor donald of athol who was chief promoter of it the queen dowager was so much alarmed at this that notwithstanding his pretended friendship for her and her family she took the first opportunity of quitting the kingdom and retiring with her two sons reginans and aidan into ireland the latter was then about seven years of age they were very kindly received by tauthalius the reigning king the queen and her eldest son died there aidan continued there fortyeight years great part of which time eugenius reigned and after him his brother congallus this last mentioned king being conscious of the wrong done to the right heir of the crown ordered aidan to be brought home which was undertaken and performed by the celebrated st columb but on their arrival in scotland they were informed the king was dead and that his brother kennatillus was by the scots put in possession of the throne after the burial of the deceased prince columb went to court with aidan and to the surprise of all people was received by the new king with much kindness and respect he telling aidan he should assist him in governing the kingdom which would become his very shortly to whom of right it pertained the king being old and infirm died soon after and was succeeded by aidan according to boethius in the year     he was crowned king of scotland by columb who in an elegant oration made for the occasion excited the prince to justice and the people to obedience aidan went into galloway immediately after his coronation and suppressed certain robbers who had infested that country and committed great outrages in it he instituted annual assizes there at lochaber and caithness but some of the young nobility quarrelling at a hunting match suddenly interrupted these works of peace this affray ending in bloodshed caused several of them to retire into the dominions of the british king aidan in virtue of a treaty with this prince often demanded them and was constantly refused incensed at this treatment he entered his country took a great number prisoners and carried off a quantity of cattle brudeus resenting this made an attack upon galloway and did much mischief at length a general engagement ensued the picts were routed with great slaughter the scots lost a number of men and amongst them arthur the kings son st columb hearing of this war came to the king and charged him with showing too much willingness to shed blood this made so strong an impression on the mind of the prince that he would not suffer this excellent man to depart till he undertook to negociate a peace which he executed with great success the saxons having driven the britons into wales were now in possession of england ethelfrid who then reigned in northumberland was an artful and ambitious prince he wished to make a conquest of the pictish kingdom but finding himself too weak to accomplish it prevailed on brudeus to break the peace with the scots thinking by this means to weaken and obtain a victory over him aidan hearing of these negociations concluded a treaty offensive and defensive with maelgwyn the british king as soon as the saxons were informed of this they determined to invade the british territories in order to draw the scots from their own country this maneuver succeeded for aidan instantly marched to assist his allies and joining the british army offered battle to ethelfrid and brudeus which for two reasons they chose to decline first that they were weary of the scots next to give ceuline king of the west saxons an opportunity of joining them aidan and his associates being apprised of their intention resolved to attack ceuline before his junction should render them too powerful they performed this with great bravery and by forcing their camp cut to pieces and destroyed a great number of their armies and among them cutha son to the king of the west saxons notwithstanding this the remainder joined their friends and offered battle a second time to aidan who behaved very gallantly in this engagement but was so unfortunate as to lose his son griffin and his nephew brennius earl of man the saxons and picts had a great number of private men killed and both their princes wounded ethelfrid lost one of his eyes and brudeus received a deep wound on his hip ethelfrid joined the picts early the next summer and with a numerous army invaded galloway aidan was better prepared to receive them than they had reason to suppose and taking the advantage of their straggling about the country he cut off several of their parties but finding that these losses obliged them to keep close in camp he resolved to march silently by it on a dark night to join the britons and encamped in a narrow valley in annandale where the saxons and picts with a great army surrounded them and flattered themselves that seizing all the passages they should easily rout their enemies but aidan consulting his generals they agreed to make great preparations by fortifying their camp and to appear as if they waited for an attack when they had completed this they lighted up a number of fires and decamped in the night by passing certain rivers deemed not fordable by the saxons they entered northumberland destroying the country with fire and sword this obliged the saxons and picts to follow them a pitched battle ensued the saxons and picts after an obstinate engagement were totally routed with prodigious slaughter ceuline king of the west saxons was killed on the spot aidan having gained this great victory caused all the spoil which they had brought out of galloway to be restored to the right owners a tenth of the remaining booty he gave to be distributed in alms the rest was divided equally amongst the scottish and british soldiers all the trophies of this conquest he sent to st columb in the island of columbkill to be deposited in his abbey  he reigned quietly after this for about eleven years when ethelfrid prevailed on the picts to renew the war aidan though very old marched to the place where he expected the british army to have joined him but his allies failing gave his enemies such an advantage over him that they cut to pieces the chief of his forces the king himself had a narrow escape the fall of theobald the kings brother proves this to have been a hardfought battle the consequences of which and the news of the death of st columb hastened the end of the good old king and brought him to the grave in the year  0  he reigned thirtytwo years and was when he died seventyeight years old  aidan in the seventh century was bishop of lindisfarne or holy island and was originally a monk in the monastery of hii or jona one of the islands of the hebrides at the request of oswald king of northumberland he came into england in the year     and undertook to instruct that princes subjects in the knowledge of the christian religion he prevailed upon the king to remove the episcopal see from york to lindisfarne he was very successful in his preaching in which he was greatly assisted by the pious zeal of the king who had lived a considerable time in scotland where he acquired a competent knowledge of the language he undertook to be himself aidans interpreter and explained his discourses to the nobility oswald was slain in battle and aidan continued to govern the church of northumberland under his successors oswin and oswi till oswin was treacherously murdered and aidan survived him but twelve days he sat sixteen years and died in august     he was buried in his church of lindisfarne and part of his relics were carried by his successor colman into scotland in the year      ailmer or aethelmare earl of cornwall and devonshire he was great in authority and riches and in his appearance of piety it is not known of what family he was he founded the abbey of cerne in dorsetshire and had so great an esteem for eadwald brother to st edmund the martyr that with the assistance of archbishop dunstan he removed his relics to the old church of cernel he founded the abbey of eyresham in oxfordshire and the priory of bruton in somersetshire in  00  both for the bendictine monks in  0   when swene king of denmark infested england and obliged aethelred to shut himself up in winchester ailmer submitted himself to the conqueror and gave him hostages when canute the son of swene invaded england in  0   earl ailmer with eadric streone earl of mercia and earl of algar joined the danes against their natural prince which was one great cause of the saxons ruin he died soon after this and we find only one son of his mentioned in history whose name was aethelward earl of cornwall he followed his fathers principles and was properly rewarded for it by canute who after reaping the benefit of their treason and finding the traitors no longer useful ordered eadric streone and earl aethelward both to be put to death  ailred abbot of ravesby was born of noble parents in the year   0  and educated in scotland upon his return into england he took the habit of the cistertian monastery of revesby in lincolnshire his extraordinary piety and learning soon raised him to the dignity of abbot his attachment to retirement and study induced him to decline all offers of ecclesiastical preferment he was particularly fond of reading st austins works and a strict imitator of st bernard in his writings words and actions he left behind him several monuments of his learning in the writing of which he was assisted by walter daniel a monk of the same convent  he died january         aged fiftyseven years and was buried in the monastery of revesby under a tomb adorned with gold and silver  ainsworth henry an eminent nonconformist divine who flourished in the latter end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century  it is much to be regretted that it is not in our power to give a more minute detail of the origin of this great man but we cannot so much as say when or where he was born however he distinguished himself about the year    0 amongst the brownists and endured a share in their persecutions his great knowledge of hebrew and his celebrate commentaries on the holy scriptures gained him much reputation but his sect being at that time in discredit it drew upon him suc troubles that after struggling with them some years he quitted t country and retired into holland where most of the eminent nonconformists who had incurred the displeasure of queen elizabeth h before resorted ainsworth in conjunction with mr johnson erecte a church at amsterdam of which the former was doctor they aftewards jointly published a confession of faith of the people calle brownists but both being men of warm tempers they differed i opinion about some points of discipline and divided into partie johnson after having rejected the mediator of the presbytery of asterdam excommunicated his father and brother on some triflin matters this caused such a division in the congregation that m ainsworth with one half of them excommunicated mr johnso who a short time after returned the compliment to mr ainsworth the contest now grew so warm that johnson and his followers left asterdam and removed to embden where he soon died and his congregation were dissolved notwithstanding this mr ainsworth an his followers did not live long in peace which caused him to leav them soon after and retire to ireland where he remained some time but returned to amsterdam when the spirits of the people were quieted and continued with them till his death which by some historians i strangely accounted for his demise was sudden and not without suspicion of violence for it is reported that having found a diamon of considerable value in the streets of amsterdam he advertised it i the public prints it was claimed by a jew who when he came t demand it offered him any acknowledgement he would desire ainsworth though poor would not accept any thing but a conferenc with some of his rabbis concerning the prophecies of the old testament relating to the messiah which the other promised but no having interest enough to obtain it it is strongly suspected he was the occasion of the death of ainsworth by poison his learned writing were received with respect even by his adversaries who while they refuted his singularities paid a proper regard to his abilities particularly that worthy bishop of exeter dr hall who wrote with great strength of reason against the brownists but nothing could reclaim him or incline him to return home for as he lived so he died in exile it was certainly a misfortune that the obstinacy of his own spirit and the rigorous administration in the church excluded so able a man from the public exercise of his ministry he had a strong understanding quick penetration and wonderful diligence but these qualities were somewhat allayed by the hastiness of his temper his contempt for ecclesiastical governments his proneness to maintain disputes about trifling things and his rashness in separating from the church and the nonconformists in holland mr ainsworth was much esteemed in his lifetime in his own country and several of his books were more than once reprinted after his death yet through a prevailing contempt for men of his sentiment and too cold a reception of that kind of learning which rendered him famous his works are more known and valued abroad than here we seldom find an english author oftener quoted or with greater testimonies of his merit than dr ainsworth a higher character of the veneration he has acquired cannot well be expected than that which occurs in all the late editions of moreris dictionary when with great pains and much gravity they caution us to distinguish between henry ainsworth the able commentator of the scriptures and henry ainsworth the heresiarch who was one of the chief brownists in the reign of queen elizabeth nevertheless nothing is more certain than that these two were the same man  there was another writer whose works bore some affinity to his and are sometimes ascribed to him whose christian name was william and besides him there was a mr samuel ainsworth a nonconformist minister in northamptonshire  ainsworth robert a noted grammarian in the latter end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the present century was born in september    0 at woodgate in lancashire four miles from manchester he received his education at bolton in the same county and afterward taught a school in that town from thence he removed to london and was master of a considerable boardingschool at bethnalgreen during his residence at that place he wrote and published a short treatise of grammatical institution after quitting bethnalgreen he carried on a school at hackney and successively at other villages in the neighborhood of the metropolis by which he acquired a moderate fortune retired from business and lived in a private manner in the latter part of his life he used to employ himself very much in ransacking the shops of obscure brokers in order to pick up old coins and other valuable curiosities at a small expense he died in the eightythird year of his age at london on the  th of april      and was buried at poplar  mr ainsworth had a talent for latin and english poetry some of his poems have been printed but as they have not fallen in our way we cannot specify their character or merit but it is certain they have never occasioned him to be ranked among the poets of this country h gained his reputation from his thesaurus an excellent performanc which is in general use and estimation about the year      a prposal was made to some eminent book sellers for compiling a latin ditionary and mr ainsworth was easily prevailed upon to undertake the laborious task it went slowly on for a long time and for some yea was entirely

calvinist and a great supporter of his party who gave him the character of a person of great holiness becoming gravity and assiduity in the discharge of his ministerial function  there was also an airay who was vicar of milford in hampshire who wrote a work called fasciculus praeceptorum logicalium in gratiam juventutis academiae compositus or a collection of the rules of logic for the use of students in the universities  akenside mark an eminent poet and physician was born at newcastle upon tyne on the  th of november      he was the second son of a substantial butcher of that town  at the free school of newcastle he received the first part of his grammatical education and was afterward put under the care of mr wilson a dissenting minister who kept a private academy at newcastle at eighteen he was sent to the university of edinburgh with a view to be brought up for a dissenting minister his parents and relations in general being of the presbyterian persuasion he prosecuted his studies on this plan for one year only during which time he received some assistance from the funds which the english dissenters employ in educating young men of no fortune but his views as to the ministry altering he turned his thoughts to physic and scrupulously repaid his benefactors the money they had advanced him which having been contributed to a different purpose he thought it dishonorable to retain whether in relinquishing his design to be a dissenting minister he ceased to be a dissenter is not certainly known  his genius and taste for poetry displayed themselves when he was at the schools at newcastle and it is said that his pleasures of imagination and several other pieces were first written by him at morpeth while he was upon a visit to his relations before he went to the university of edinburgh at edinburgh he distinguished himself by his poetical compositions his ode on the winter solstice was certainly composed at that place after staying three years at edinburgh he removed to leyden where he studied two years and there in may      took his degree of doctor in physic in his inaugural dissertation he is said to have displayed his medical sagacity by attacking some opinions of leuwenhoek and other writers at that time very generally received but which have since been discarded by the best physicians and philosophers and by proposing an hypothesis which is now considered as founded in truth  the same year his poem on the pleasures of imagination appeared which was in general received with great applause and raised his reputation high in the poetical world but mr warburton so much celebrated for his learning and afterward bishop of gloucester being dissatisfied with a note in the third book concerning the nature and objects of ridicule thought proper in a preface to certain remarks on his antagonist to make some severe strictures on our author in which he attacked him as a philosopher only and not as a poet dr akenside in return was warmly vindicated by an anonymous friend who was the late jeremiah dyson esquire  in this pamphlet which is entitled an epistle to the reverend mr warburton there are several sensible observations but the style is unpleasant the review of the controversy whether ridicule be the touchstone of truth will be more suitably introduced when we come to the life of lord shaftsbury the noble author of the characteristics the poem on the pleasures of imagination was quickly followed by an epistle to curio containing a warm invective under that name against the right honorable william pulteney earl of bath whom he stigmatizes as the betrayer of his country dr akenside was afterward so dissatisfied with this piece that he altered it greatly changing it into the form of an ode and reducing it to half the number of lines it then contained in      he published ten odes on different subjects written as he tells us with a view to vary different manners of expression and versification the merit which he chiefly pretended to was that of being correct and of carefully attending to the best models these different productions appeared before he was twentyfour years of age but he was afterward more slow in his publications his ode to the earl of harrington came out in      and in      he expressed his desire of rouzing his countrymen by an ode to the country gentlemen of england few of his other poetical pieces were published separately except an ode to thomas edwards esquire on the late edition of mr popes works which had been written in      but was not printed till      with a view to show the authors dislike to dr warburton the rest of dr akensides poems have been printed in dodsleys collection  his principal work as a physician was a treatise on the dysentery written in latin and published in       to return to the circumstances of dr akensides private life  soon after his quitting leyden he settled for some time in northampton while here he carried on with dr dodderidge an amicable debate concerning the opinions of the ancient philosophers with regard to a future state of rewards and punishments in which dr akenside supported the opinion of cicero in this important article of natural religion but he either not meeting with sufficient encouragement or being ambitious of moving in a larger field removed to hampstead where he resided two years and an half and then settled in london he had but little practice when he first began and in order to enable him to make a proper figure in the world his generous and intimate friend mr dyson allowed him three hundred pounds a year  it is uncertain whether mr dyson had any bond or security from him on this account but it appears that this gentleman at his decease possessed his effects particularly his books and prints the last he took great pleasure in collecting  dr akenside in a short time gained great reputation came into full practice and arrived at most of the honors incident to his profession he was chosen fellow of the royal society became physician to st thomass hospital was admitted by mandamus to the degree of doctor in physic in the university of cambridge and was elected a fellow of the royal college of physicians in london upon the settlement of the queens household he was appointed one of the physicians to her majesty he died on the   d of june    0 of a putrid fever in the   th year of his age and was buried in the parish of st jamess westminster dr akenside was particularly attached to ancient literature and was a great admirer of plato cicero and the best philosophers of antiquity his taste and judgment in this respect are conspicuous in his poems and in his notes and illustrations annexed to them that he entertained a sincere reverence for the great and fundamental principles of religion is strikingly apparent in several of his writings especially in his ode to the author of the memoirs of the house of brandenburgh in short dr akensides high veneration for the supreme being his noble sentiments of the wisdom of divine providence and his love of virtue shine through all his poems in his ode to william hall esquire with the works of chalieu he justly condemns the licentiousness of that poet his strong attachment to the cause of civil and religious liberty bears a distinguished feature in the character of his poetical writings he embraces every opportunity of displaying his zeal concerning this subject two of his principal odes are devoted entirely to it one of which is to the earl of huntingdon the other to the bishop of winchester he and his friend mr dyson in early life were such strenuous advocates for liberty in its most extensive sense that they were suspected to possess some tincture of republicanism but dr akensides poems are by no means a sufficient proof of this for when he celebrates the cause of freedom with a reference to our own country he does it in no other light than that of a zealous whig who was warmly attached to the revolution and to the great men who effected it he is remarkable in testifying his veneration and regard for william iii and if there be any truth in the supposition that he and his friend possessed republican ideas in their youth it is more than probable that they softened if not quite relinquished the rigor of their sentiments the alteration of some lines in the ode on leaving holland and in that to the earl of huntingdon have been taken notice of in this light mr dyson in      published a beautiful and complete edition of dr akensides poems with his last corrections and amendments the first poem in this collection is the pleasures of imagination as it had originally appeared we have before observed that it in general met with great applause and raised the authors reputation high in the poetical world mr cooper in his fourth edition of letters concerning taste has spoken of him in the following strain of commendation for my part i am of opinion that there is now living a poet of as genuine a genius as this kingdom ever produced shakespeare alone excepted the gentleman i mean is dr akenside the worthy author of the pleasures of imagination the most beautiful didactic poem that ever adorned the english language mr cooper in the first edition of his work carried his praise of the doctor to a ridiculous height of extravagance on the other hand the late eminent poet mr gray in a letter to dr wharton treats this poem with great severity you desire to know says he what character the poem of your young friend dr akenside bears here i wonder you ask the opinion of a nation where those who pretend to judge do not judge at all and the rest the wiser part wait to catch the judgment of the world immediately above them that is dicks and the rainbow coffeehouses your readier way would be to ask the ladies who keep the bars in those two theaters of criticism however to show you that i am a judge as well as my countrymen i will tell you though i have only turned it over any more than them that it appears to me above the middling and now and then for a little while equal to the best particularly in description it is often obscure and often unintelligible and too much infected with the hutchinson jargon in short its great fault is that it was published nine years too soon and so methinks in a few words i have very pertly dispatched what perhaps might for several years have employed a very ingenious man worth fifty of myself these observations being delivered before the poem had been maturely examined we may be allowed to think them too severe and steer a middling course between mr gray and mr cooper the obscurity of the pleasures of imagination is most conspicuous in the allegory of the second book it might likewise have been better if the peculiar language of hutchinson or rather shaftsbury had sometimes been omitted nevertheless we cannot but regard it as a noble and beautiful poem displaying great genius and fancy and holding out sublime views of nature providence and morality we entirely agree with mr gray in supposing it came out too early the author himself afterward entertained the same sentiments he was convinced that the poem was defective in some respects and redundant in others his editor says he was perfectly sensible that it wanted revision and correction but the demand was so quick for several successive republications that it would have been impossible to have completed the whole of this correction and to have gone on from time to time making fresh improvements in every edition would he thought have at least the appearance of abusing the favor of the public on this account he continued to print it without alterations for several years with a view of giving at once his corrections and improvements complete to the public he meant to review and correct this poem at his leisure but he found the task grow so much upon his hands that he abandoned the purpose of correcting and determined to write it over again upon a more enlarged and somewhat different plan dr akenside did not live to finish his plan he designed at first to comprise the whole of his subject in four books but he afterward changed his purpose and resolved to distribute the pleasures of imagination into a greater number it is impossible to say how far his scheme would have carried him if he had lived to execute it for at his death he had only finished his first and second books a considerable part of the third and the introduction to the last the first book of the new edition bears a stronger resemblance to the first book of the former than any of the rest do there are however perceptible corrections alterations and additions dr akenside has introduced a tribute of respect to his friend mr dyson he has referred the pleasures of imagination to two sources only greatness and beauty his delineation of beautiful objects is greatly enlarged and his first book seems to have received much improvement the second book differs essentially from the former editions indeed so much that they will not bear a comparison the author enters into a display of truth and its three classes matter of fact experimental or scientifical truth and universal truth he treats also of virtue as exciting in the divine mind of human virtue of vice and its origin of ridicule and of the passions what he says upon the subject of ridicule is greatly reduced from what it was in the preceding copies the allegorical vision which constituted a principal part of the second book in his first poem is likewise omitted the character of the second book as it now stands is that it is correct moral and noble the third book is an episode in which solon the athenian lawgiver is the chief subject this part is entirely new and would have proved a beautiful addition to the poem if dr akenside had lived to finish it it is greatly to be regreted that he died before he completed his design we should notwithstanding have been sorry to have had the original poem entirely superseded for whatever may be its faults we find in it a certain brightness of imagination and a degree of enthusiasm which seem to have forsaken the doctor in the latter part of his life  alan william a cardinal priest of the roman church was the son of john a of westby in yorkshire and was born at rossal in lancashire in     his father was a gentleman of good family and some fortune who se him to oxford in his fifteenth year where in      he was entered oriel college and had for his tutor morgan phillips or phillips morgan very famous man and a zealous papist under whom he studied wi great success attaching himself particularly to logic and philosophy which he became so great a proficient that he was unanimously elect fellow of his college in    0 in which year he also took the degree bachelor of arts in an act celebrated july the sixteenth he went o junior of the act having completed his degree of master of arts wi great reputation he was esteemed an honor to the university on acount of his great abilities learning and eloquence in      he bcame principal of st marys hall and in that and the following ye one of the proctors of the university being then but twentyfour years  age in      he was made canon of york but in consequence of bing a zealous catholic he lost all hopes of preferment when quee elizabeth came to the crown in    0 he withdrew out of his nativ country and retired to louvain in the spanish netherlands where a english college was erected of which he became the chief support a this time several persons of great learning and some of the bolde champions of the popish cause resided in this place with whom ala associated by his natural politeness great strength of genius and the gracefulness of his person he soon introduced himself into favor for with a majestic presence he possessed an easy affable deportment an with the greatest severity of manners a mildness of speech which dre the affections of all whom he conversed with here he began to wri in support of the catholic cause and his first piece was against a wo written by the learned bishop jewel on the subject of purgatory an prayers for the dead the method he made use of in this wo was very proper to captivate the judgment of the reader and h style which was remarkably pure and flowing made his performance the more dangerous the chiefs of the party then abroad had as a man of their confidence placed under his care a young man of an honouable family who was come to louvain to study his attention to the young pupil and a close application to his other studies had so much impaired his health that his physicians were of opinion that nothin could restore it but the enjoying for a season his native air on the account our author ventured over about      though his coming into england was attended with great danger he went first as the doctors ha advised into lancashire where he was born and there without any regard to his own safety exerted himself to the utmost in making converts and dissuading such as were already catholics from going to heretical conventicles in order to carry his point the more effectually he wrote and distributed several little pieces which were afterward printed but rendered himself so obnoxious to the government by these endeavors that a strict search was made after him by the magistrates which forced him to quit that country and to seek an asylum in the neighborhood of the city of oxford where he concealed himself for some time in this retreat he wrote a kind of apology for his party under the title of brief reasons concerning the catholic faith some indeed say this was written at the house of the duke of norfolk in norfolk where it is certain alan was concealed some time though he returned again into the neighborhood of oxford where he distributed copies of the work to fix the minds of those who wavered between the two religions and to draw over such as already doubted their safety while remaining in the established church such success attended his endeavors that he refused to take the opportunity of a ship going to the netherlands and chose to stay in that dangerous situation promoting as far as lay in his power the doctrine of popery and the jurisdiction of his holiness and such as derived their authority from him with this view he ventured to establish a correspondence with some of his old friends in the university and among the rest with a person who was formerly a papist but then of the established church and one of whose preferment his family had great hopes our author by his unwearied applications drew back this man to his former opinions which exasperated his relations so much that they persecuted alan with unremitted diligence this obliged him to fly toward london and not long after with some difficulty he made his escape into flanders in      having remained in england three years it is more than probable he had some great friends here who in respect to their former acquaintance with him were well pleased at his withdrawing a second time beyond sea amongst whom we may reckon sir christopher hatton afterward chancellor who received part of his education in st marys hall at oxford while our author was principal thereof on this account sir christopher had a great regard for alan and alan entertained so high an opinion of him that he raised his reputation to the greatest height abroad which caused some invidious reflections at home after alan came a second time into the spanish low countries he went to mechlin in the duchy of brabant and read a divinity lecture in a monastery there with great applause he went from thence to douay where he became doctor in divinity and took great pains to establish a seminary there for the support of english scholars this being looked upon with an evil eye by the government in england caused him to write a book in defense of such institutions while he was thus employed he was made canon of cambray a very considerable and honorable preferment conferred on him purely to reward his zeal for the catholic church in this seminary of douay many books were wrote to justify the popish religion and to answer the books wrote in defense of the church of england which occasioned queen elizabeth to issue a proclamation forbidding such books to be either sold or read in      our author alan appointed one bristow who became afterward a very eminent man moderator of studies at douay this bristow in all probability was the man whom alan drew over to his opinions when he was in england as is before mentioned not long after dr alan was appointed canon of rheims through the interest of the guises and to this city he transferred the seminary which had been settled at douay his motive for making this alteration was because don lewis de requesens the then governor of the netherlands had obliged the english fugitives to withdraw out of his government from this time dr alan was esteemed the chief of his party and indeed he labored incessantly to do it service by writing various treatises in defense of the doctrines and several by way of apology for the practices of the papists by licensing and recommending many books written by others and by journies into spain and italy by his diligence he procured a seminary to be established at rome and two others in spain where english students were not only educated but were also maintained and provided for at home dr alan was justly reputed a capital enemy of the state all correspondence with him was looked upon as the highest kind of treason and thomas alfield a jesuit was actually executed for bringing certain books of his writing into england the celebrated robert parsons the jesuit was dr alans great friend and counselor and very probably put him upon that desperate project which if it had succeeded would have overwhelmed the english and which as it miscarried did in a manner enervate the spanish monarchy for many years there had been differences discontents and even actual injuries committed between the english and the spaniards but now dr alan and the fugitive noblemen from england prevailed upon king philip the second openly to undertake the conquest of their native country to facilitate this sixtus the fifth who was then pope was persuaded to renew the excommunication thundered against queen elizabeth by his predecessor pope pius v while this was in agitation sir william stanley who commanded a considerable garrison of english and irish in the important town of daventer basely betrayed it and went with his whole regiment of twelve hundred men into that service rowland york who had been likewise entrusted with a strong fort in the same country acted in the like infamous manner to the great astonishment of the states general of the united provinces and brought much scandal on the english nation dr alan wrote a treatise in defense of this base proceeding and sent several priests to stanley in order to instruct those he had drawn over to the king of spains service to add to the weight of those writings the dr on the twentyeighth of july      was created cardinal by the title of st martin in montibus and soon after the king of spain gave him an abbey of great value in the kingdom of naples with strong assurances of much greater preferment which was afterward performed in april      he composed that work which rendered him famous abroad and infamous at home it consisted of two parts the first explaining the popes bull for the excommunication and deprivation of queen elizabeth the second exhorting the nobility and people of england to desert her and take up arms in favor of the spaniards of this book it is sufficient to say that it was by far the severest piece ever written against an english prince and very capable of producing mischievous effects many papists are inclined to believe that the cardinal was compelled to take this book upon himself and that in reality it was either written or altered by father parsons and other jesuits many thousand copies were printed at antwerp in order to have been put on board the spanish armada that they might have been distributed by the papists all over england upon the first landing of the spaniards but this enterprise failing these books were so carefully destroyed that very few were preserved one of the printed copies was transmitted by some of the lord treasurers spies to the english council and queen elizabeth sent dr dale into the low countries to make a complaint of such a proceeding to the prince of parma who pretended to have much friendship for her majesty he heard this account with a great deal of phlegm and answered that as he knew of no such book he could not say any thing to its contents after the armada was destroyed philip howard earl of arundel who had been three years in prison under the charge of high treason was brought to his trial and the great charge upon him was his corresponding with cardinal alan which being proved he was found guilty by the peers in the same year the king of spain promoted the cardinal as he had promised him to the archbishopric of mechlin in flanders where he would have wished him to have constantly resided in order to his more effectually cherishing the popish and spanish interests in england but the pope entertained so high an opinion of the cardinals merit and found him of such great service in consistories that he would not suffer him to leave rome where he continued to labor as earnestly as ever in the service of his countrymen and the catholic faith it has been asserted by some that he and sir francis englefield assisted father parsons in composing his traitorous book concerning the succession which he published under the name of doleman and which was of such dangerous consequence that it was made capital by law for any person to have it in his custody others affirm that he had no hand in it and was greatly displeased with this treatise as it tended to perpetuate those dissentions which had for so many years torn and distracted his nativ country the remainder of his life he spent at rome in great honor and reputation living in much splendour and using all his interest for the comfort and maintenance of such poor catholics as fled out of england the administration here had many spies upon him and it appeared by the papers of the treasurer burleigh that he had constantly very distinct accounts of every step the cardinal took in the last years of his life he is said to have changed his sentiments as to government and to have been heartily sorry for the pains he took in promoting the invasion of england by the spaniards and we are told by a very eminent popis writer that when he perceived the jesuits intended nothing but desolating and destroying his native land he wept bitterly not knowing how to remedy it much less to bridle their insolence this conduc drew upon him the ill will of that powerful society who notwithstanding all the books he had written all the reputation and rewards he ha acquired gave out that he was a good simple man but not of any esteem or use in state affairs a man of weak judgment shallow wit and smal advice never consulted except for matters of learning and that i positive only not in any school point on his deathbed he was very desirous of speaking to the english students then in rome but was prevented by a jesuit who was father rector and was fearful he should have persuaded them to a loyal respect for their prince and a tender regard for their country he is generally said to have died of a retentio of urine but it was shrewdly suspected that he was poisoned by the jesuits which suspicion was attended with such probable circumstances that the reverend fathers themselves admitted it and charged it o his antagonist the bishop of cassana whom they had a great dislike to and who it was thought on his demise would have been made a cardinal the death of our author happened on the sixth of october      i the sixtythird year of his age he was buried with great pomp in the chapel of the english college at rome where a monument is erecte to his memory upon the death of this memorable person the jesuit as a priest of the church of rome tells us openly triumphed and isulted over the dead corpse giving out among other calumnies again him that he was well gone for if he had lived but a little longer he would have disgraced himself shamed his country and lost the credit he had gained yet they shortly after for many reasons altered their tone and when they found how little credit these discourses met with they magnified the cardinals memory as if he lived a saint and died a confessor but in order to give the reader a proper idea of this behavior we must observe that before the spanish invasion in      it was thought necessary to have some englishman promoted to the rank of cardinal the candidates were dr lewis bishop of cassana and dr alan and much interest was made on both sides but the jesuits being apprehensive of bishop lewiss coming to the honor it was procured for him of whom we are writing when they found he would not go these lengths they treated him as ill as ever they had done any of their greatest enemies they were still fearful that bishop lewis might put on that hat which alan had left and began to observe in all companies that the cardinal was a perfect saint that he was justly admired by several popes respected by all the princes of europe who either knew or heard of him that his whole study was for the good of his country and the maintenance of the catholic religion that notwithstanding all this the bishop of cassana had made it the business of his life to persecute and disturb this holy man we shall no doubt find it a difficult task to give this eminent person his true character however since it is absolutely necessary we shall attempt to do it with as much truth as possible and from the best authority if we consider him as an english subject writing advising and acting against his prince we must look upon him as a busy enterprizing and dangerous rebel laboring continually the destruction of his prince and her people equally ready to persuade foreigners to invade or subjects to rise up in arms and if on the other hand we look on him as a zealous papist and as one convinced in his conscience that what he did was agreeable to the doctrines of the church we cannot then deny him the title of a learned active and industrious person and far from being an enemy in the latter part of his life particularly either to his country or to his lawful sovereign queen elizabeth lastly taking him merely as an author he was unquestionably for matter method wit learning and language one of the most considerable writers of the age it is strange that many of our writers of controversy and some not unlearned have treated our author as a jesuit whereas in all controversies between that order and the secular priests the latter always gloried in cardinal alan as a man to whom no jesuit could be justly compared in any respect before we close this life it will be necessary to remark that at rome and every where abroad cardinal alan was styled cardinal of england regarded as the protector of the nation and honored with extraordinary respect he had about him several persons of some distinction particularly mr fitzherbert who wrote a large account of his life which was never printed to maintain his magnificence he had   000 crowns per annum then computed   00 pounds of our money  aland sir john fortescue never before published aland sir john fortescue lld rss baron of the exchequer puisne judge of both benches to king george the first and a peer of ireland in the

charms or large fortune to suffer any name to supersede that of fortescue in the honor of his descent from which ancestor he seems to have gloried very much  whether our judge was educated at a public school or privately at home we have not been able to learn but that he was at college seems not to admit a doubt because oxford complimented him with the honorary degrees of doctor of laws as a member

probably took their degree as sergeants merely as a qualification for which the sergeant considers as a turnpike to the bench and in those cases their respective promotions will point out the times of their calls with tolerable precision see the above observation etc   0      it is surprising that a lawyer should make use of the word bench as a general description of courts of justice when it peculiarly and emphatically denotes the court of common pleas sir co pr to viii rep hogarths celebrated print of the bench and our article sir john popham  our baron on   th may      easter term   geo

justice and our judge was succeeded in the baronship of the exchequer by sir francis page  the learned sergeant william win seems to have mistaken the appointment of sir john fortescue aland in the exchequer for that in the kings bench if we may presume to make the observation from the date viz      which by the concurrent testimony of respectable authorities was the year our baron was promoted

was guilty of murder because when the deceased said to him though we have had hot words and you was the aggressor yet i think we may pass it over and at the same time offered his hand to the major to

ex officio by the attorney general in the court of kings bench against edmund curl of notorious memory for infamous publications mr justice aland differed from the other three judges viz sir robert raymond chief justice james reynolds esquire and sir edmund probyn on that prosecution  our judge owned the charge against curl which was for printing and publishing venus in the cloister or the nun in her smock stra rep xi     to be a very great offense but knew of no law by which the court could punish it that common law is common usage and where there is no law there can be no transgression he observed that at common law drunkenness or cursing and swearing were not punishable and yet he did not find the spiritual court take notice of them that curls offense was but a general solicitation of charity and not inditable that the lady purbecks case was for procuring men and women to meet at her house and held not inditable unless there had been particular facts to make it a bawdyhouse that to make it inditable there should be a breach of the peace or something tending to it of which there was nothing in curls case that libel is a technical word at common law and he owned he much doubted of the case o the king and read for there was a rule to arrest the judgment nisi and in sir charles sidleys case was a force in throwing out the bottle upon peoples heads he thought the book was rather published o purpose to expose the romish priests the fathers confessors and the popish religion  perhaps if our judge had risen to the fur previous to popes publication of his imitations of horace the poet would not have paid that compliment to alands judicial capacity which he did to his legal as we have observed of pope in the former part of this article especially when the reader is informed that the poet was of the roman catholic persuasion  after the accession of his late majesty king george the second all the judges had new patents see wynn serj at law  0  except mr justice fortescue aland whose commission was superseded lord raym rep ii    0  one jewel was taken on an escape warrant made by our judge and the court of kings bench was moved to discharge the defendant and the warrant because he was taken on   jan       and sir john fortescue aland was removed from his office of judge of the said court of kings bench in october      his patent being determined on the demise of the late king george the first and accordingly the prisoner was discharged and the warrant also r raym ii       sir francis page was removed out of the court of common pleas into that of the kings bench in the place of our judge  sir john fortescue aland was the only judge removed and the reason generally assigned was his opinion on the following grand question viz  whether the education and care of his majestys king george the first grandchildren in england and of prince frederie late father to his present majesty eldest son of his royal highness the prince of wales late grandfather to king george the third when his majesty should think fit to cause him to come into england and the ordering the places of abode and appointing their governors governesses and other instructors attendants and servants and the care and approbation of their marriages when grown up belonged of right to his majesty as king of the realm or not  ten of the judges viz thomas lord parker chief justice of england afterward lord chancellor  sir peter king chief justice of the bench afterward lord chanellor and a peer  sir thomas bury lord chief baron  sir littleton powys senior judge of the kings bench  sir john pratt late father of the present lord camden puisne justice there afterward one of the commissioners of the greatseal and chief justice  the hon robert tracy senior judge of the bench and afterward commissioner of the seal  robert dormer second judge there  sir john blencowe puisne judge of the same court  sir james montague second baron of the exchequer afterward one of the commissioners of the seal and chief baron  sir john fortescue aland puisne baron afterward justice of both benches  the two dissenting judges were sir robert air second justice of the kings bench afterward lord chief baron and lord chief justice of the bench and  robert price senior baron afterward a judge of the bench  the opinions of all the judges with their reasons are inserted at large in our article of the lastmentioned judge viz sir robert price  ten judges were of opinion which with the reasons at large may be seen in our judges reports that their education and the approbation of their marriages did belong to his majesty but we very much doubt the authenticity of the said general assertion of the cause for removing sir john fortescue aland because his majesty king george the second has immortalized his fame as the first magistrate of the world in three memorable instances viz of major oneby above mentioned admiral byng and earl ferrers names that will ever secure his majesty in full possession of that transcendant character for though the king admired the valor of his army honored the bravery of his navy and revered the exalted rank of the nobility yet his majesty at the same time abhorred the cruelty of a soldier in the person of major oneby detested a dastard seaman in that of admiral byng and execrated the baseness of a peer in the person of earl ferrers and therefore the first was to have been executed had he not committed suicide the next was shot for cowardice and the third though a baron of the realm hanged for murder at tyburn but yet though his majesty was pleased to execute the law with roman strictness he did it also with roman justice for he gave the two honorable delinquents an opportunity not only to vindicate their innocence but also to avail themselves of every circumstance in point of law and that too after judgment condemnation and sentence for he respited the execution of the admiral in order that he might have the opinion not only of the twelve judges but also of the high court of parliament which he had the judges were unanimous in confirming the sentence of the court martial and the parliament declined impeaching it or otherwise to interfere in their public capacity on his behalf  earl ferrers being tried before the house of lords where all the twelve judges attended during the whole trial the justice the integrity the abilities and the candor of the judicature rendered it the most honorable and fairest trial that man could possibly have here on earth  nothing appearing on these very extraordinary proceedings in favor of either the illustrious prisoners they were both executed in the manner above related as to all private intercession his majesty told the friends of the admiral that he could show him no mercy as a king and to the latter none as a man and asked whether if the earls steward had murdered his lordship the servant would have found even a single friend at court  could a prince thus eminent for his regard to public justice remove a judge merely for giving his opinion in his judicial capacity for executing his office faithfully impartially honestly and according to the best of his skill and knowledge without fear or affection prejudice or malice because his opinion happened to counteract the wishes of the heir apparent to the crown incredible especially since his predecessor sir william gascoigne chief justice of england has been universally admired for his courage in committing such heir in the time of king henry the fourth besides his royal highness well knew that the point was a public matter a national concern and therefore that it would have been highly indecent in our judge to have suffered his own private personal satisfaction to have interfered in that such conduct would militate against some of the most approved as well as ancient maxims of the law such as for instance salus populi suprema lex esto privatum commodum publico cedat ne respub periat aut quid detrimenti capiat lex citius tolerare vult privatum damnum quam publicum incommodum and the like and this is not all for the prince of wales could not but consider that in time he might himself become king and a grandfather in the lifetime of the father so that taking our judges opinion in this point of view it was really asserting and supporting the princes future authority in a business of the very like nature  if the prince when sovereign did supersede our judge actually for the reason assigned by the lord chief justice raymond he must and deservedly too have incurred the odium of an unjust tyrannical despot for it ought to be recollected that sir john fortescue aland was the youngest of the twelve judges at the time the opinion in question was given which was in the year      and that the prince did not accede to the throne till the year      ten years after the supposed displeasure for no abuse of language no misconstruction of actions can torture our judges opinion into an offense  george the second was pleased not only to continue sir peter king who was one of the ten judges that gave his opinion on the said question which was called the grandest prerogative of the royal family in favor of king george the first in his office of chief justice of the bench but also made him lord high chancellor  so that george the second must have conceived an insuperable personal antipathy to sir john fortescue aland and that too for ten years together tantaene animis coelestibus irae and have acted therein in direct opposition to the great example of his royal sire on the very same occasion of affront it cannot be for a king of the disposition of george the second would on the contrary revere a judge of such roman fortitude and blessed with all the cardinal virtues of his office courage integrity and abilities and who gave so convincing a proof of his being possessed of every qualification requisite for forming the complete character of a judge but be our arguments well founded or not and whether his late majesty did act from the unjust motive above suggested he soon satisfied mankind and the judge that all resentment had subsided and that he was resolved to pay to our judge the tribute due to his merit for upon the death of spencer cowper which happened the very next year after sir john fortescue alands removal his majesty was pleased to constitute him one of the justices of his court of common pleas viz    january      hilary term   geo ii and what is rather a singular circumstance he succeeded spencer cowper who succeeded our judge on being superseded in manner and for the cause abovementioned  viner has inscribed the nineteenth volume of his abridgement to mr justice fortescue aland and his name appears to the imprimatur in the professional rank of a judge of the court of common pleas  we by no means approve of holding up characters in derision by reason of natural or accidental corporeal defects and therefore hope the humor of the bench and bar in the story we are about to relate for the momentary smile of the reader may be offered in apology sir john fortescue aland was remarkable for a very small short flat nose a sergeant who had the misfortune of having lost one of his arms arguing a cause rather aukwardly before our judge the former observed to the latter that he seemed to handle the cause somewhat lamely whereupon the coifed advocate replied however lamely i may handle my client cause i trust i shall be able by your lordships patience to convinc you before i have done that it is as plain as the nose on your lordships face both these severe reflections we have been assured were mad without any particular allusion or malevolent intention by either the one or the other  the above personal deformity in our judge escaped the notice of si godfrey kneller the painter of his portrait and consequently of fabe and virtue perhaps we should be rather more correct in saying w designedly omitted by instead of escaped the notice of for painters as wel as the rest of mankind think it their duty when it becomes their interest to misrepresent sir john stranges reports are the only juridical annal to which we can refer the reader for the resolutions and opinions of ou judge while he sat in this court and we fear he will find very few  any of them there  sir john fortescue aland continued on the bench of the court o

iii the preface above mentioned this is prefixed to each of the above forensic works  alban saint famous for having been the first christian who suffered martyrdom in great britain for which reason he is usually styled the protomartyr was born at verulam of pagan parents and flourished toward the end of the third century in his youth he made a journey to rome and served seven years as a soldier in the armies of the emperor diocletian he then returned home and settled in the town of verulam where he was highly esteemed by his countrymen till the persecution under the emperor through the example and instructions of amphibalus he renounced the errors of paganism in which he had been educated and became a thorough convert to the christian religion he was put to death in the year of christ  0  during the tenth and last general persecution of the church the story of his martyrdom as related by bid is as follows  the roman governor being informed that he entertained in his house amphibalus who was a christian and not knowing that alban had become one sent a party of soldiers to apprehend his guest but alban putting on the habit of his visitor presented himself to the officers in his stead and was carried before the magistrate the firmness with which he behaved and the declaration he made of his conversion to christianity so enraged the judge that he ordered him to be beheaded immediately he had to pass over a bridge in his way to execution which was so thronged with spectators that his passage was impeded the saint impatient for the crown of martyrdom approached the brink says the historian and lifting up his eyes to heaven the stream was miraculously divided and afforded a passage for himself and a thousand people this miracle converted the executioner who threw away his drawn sword and falling at st albans feet desired he might have the honor to die with him or rather for him this sudden conversion of the executioner occasioning a delay in the execution st alban walked up to a neighboring hill where praying for water to quench his thirst a fountain sprung up under his feet here he received the crown of martyrdom on the tenth of the kalends of july the executioner was a signal example of divine vengeance for at the instant that the stroke was given to the saint his eyes dropped out of his head the behavior of st alban at his death and the miraculous circumstances attending it were instrumental in converting many of the spectators to christianity between four and five hundred years afterward offa king of the mercians built a very large and stately monastery to the memory of st alban in the place where he suffered martyrdom  st albans viscount see bacon francis  albuquerque alphonso a native of portugal  little is known of this great commander before he was appointed by his king emanuel to the command of a squadron destined for india where by his exploits he raised the arms of his country to the highest pitch of glory  emanuel ad   0  dispatched six ships to india under the command of albuquerque and the same year three more under his cousin francis albuquerque the latter arrived in india some time before the other with two ships only the other having perished by the way arriving at the islands of anchedive he found some portugueze officers from whom he learned the distressed situation of their ally trimumpar king of cochin and sailed to vipian where the king then was the arrival of the portugueze so alarmed the garrison that then had possession of cochin that they precipitately left it here one of the ships that had sailed from portugal with alphonso joined him francis restored trimumpar to his capital and subdued some islands near it  having rendered the king such essential service he desired leave to build a fort as a mutual defense against their enemies this was granted and the fort immediately begun four days after it began alphonso joined him and with the additional number of hands he brought with him it was soon completed  a consultation was then held among the portugueze officers when it was resolved to attack some towns belonging to the prince of repelsin about twenty miles distant from cochin the portugueze set out in boats and surprised the towns but were soon after attacked by a large army and obliged to retreat they returned to cochin and the same night made an attack on some other villages when alphonso being advanced with a fresh party was attacked by some of the enemy who lay in ambush and in this dangerous situation signalized himself by his courage having fought with great intrepidity till break of day when his brother francis came to his assistance the portugueze then put the enemy to flight pursued and slew a great number of them  the fame of the portugueze being spread every where alphonso albuquerque sailed to coulon to load three ships which he completed without opposition made an alliance with the people and returned to cochin on his return he found the zamorin ready to enter into a a treaty of peace with him which was concluded  the two brothers soon after sailed to cananor and thence proceeded for portugal alphonso arrived safe at lisbon but it is most probable francis perished at sea as he was never more heard of  in   0  alphonso was appointed to succeed to the government of india and dispatched with five ships he sailed in company with cugna another portugueze officer having plundered and taken some towns on the coast of arabia they sailed to zocatora and made themselves masters of the fort there after which cugna returned to portugal and albuquerque began to act alone  he immediately formed the design of attacking ormuz island situated at the mouth of the persian gulf and subject to a king of its own who had extended his dominions over several cities in arabia with small army of   0 men he proceeded along the arabian coast too many towns and proceeded to the island itself he found several ship fitted for war in the harbor these it was determined to burn however he first offered peace to the king who entered into a treaty wit a view to gain time until a reinforcement arrived the expected forc came and an engagement ensued in which the portugueze were victorious albuquerque then pressed the city and the king finding no resource solicited peace on condition of becoming tributary to the kin of portugal this was agreed to albuquerque went on shore ha an interview with the king and knowing the persidy of the arabian began to build a fortress while this was carrying on some deputy arrived from the king of persia to demand tribute of the king o ormuz the latter consulted albuquerque who with great spirit tol the deputies that his master paid no tribute but arms albuquerque wa however forced to desist by the perfidy of his officers and to repair o board his fleet he then renewed the war but receiving a letter from the governor almeed blaming his conduct he proceeded for indi when after some hesitation almeed resigned the government to him an sailed to europe  being now invested with the supreme command he prepared a fleet an sailed against calicut where in a desperate and imprudent attack i was dangerously wounded and forced to retreat  albuquerque being recovered went to sea with twentythree ship two thousand portugueze and several indian auxiliaries designed for ormuz but by the persuasion of timoia a pyratical prince change his intention and proceeded to attack goa the forts near it on the continent were taken and destroyed and learning that the city wa in the greatest consternation he sent deputies to offer the people his protection and the enjoyment of their religion the citizens accepted the conditions and albuquerque entered goa the following day being the    february    0 this city has long been the head of the portuguez dominions in india here albuquerque fixed his winter quarters an behaved himself in such a manner as to merit the esteem of every on but while he was thus employed some of the chief portugueze began  murmur against him however by seizing and imprisoning the leader he quieted the disturbance the enemy being informed of the dissertions among the portugueze made an attack upon the island and landing men laid siege to the city pressing it hard the situation of abuquerque became now truly distressing an enemy vastly superior without discontent among his officers within and his troops greatly dimnished these circumstances determined him to embark on board h ships and evacuate the city which he effected after a fierce combat having first set fire to the magazines  he then steered to a place called rapander to winter but the enemy soon obliged him to remove and take shelter between the continent and the island of divar where he was informed his enemies were also preparing to make an attack upon him in this extremity being also very scare of provisions he determined to make a desperate effort on a strong castle called pangin accordingly having stationed a force to prevent succors being sent to it he proceeded under cover of the night and succeeded in surprising both the fort and camp of the enemy both which were taken without much resistance  such an unexpected turn of good fortune determined him not only to object to offers of peace but also to make an attack on goa in this he succeeded having in the attack killed  000 of the enemy  such success induced him to aim at greater enterprises having collected his forces he sailed from goa for the island of sumatra and in every voyage made many captures there having concluded a treaty with the princes of this island he proceeded to the city of malacca and made himself master of it having settled affairs there he returned to goa laid seige to the city of benastar and having been unsuccessful consented to a peace with the zamorin he then built a fort at calicut and sailed to aden in hopes of making himself master of it but was disappointed and obliged to return soon after he fell sick and died having first had the mortification to hear of his being recalled by the king  to this great man the portugueze owe the foundation of the immense power they once possessed in india and had they pursued the maxims he laid down might possibly have enjoyed to this day he was a man of great humanity dreaded for his bravery and beloved for his benevolent disposition his death was most sincerely felt by all the people of goa where he was buried with great funeral honors  alcibiades in elevation of birth yielded to none of the greeks he was the son of clinias nephew of pericles and lineally descended from ajax in his person while a youth he was beautiful and when a man remarkable for his comeliness his fortune was large beyond most of the nobility of athens his abilities were so great that an ancient author c nepos has asserted that nature in him had exerted her utmost force since whether we consider his virtues or his vices he was distinguished from all his fellow citizens he was learned eloquent indefatigable liberal magnificent affable and knew exactly how to comply with the times that is he could assume all those virtues when he thought proper for when he gave a loose to his passions he was indolent luxurious dissolute addicted to women intemperate and even inclined to profaneness socrates had a great friendship for him corrected in some degree his manners and brought him to the knowledge of many things of which he would otherwise have remained ignorant he also prevented the athenians from resenting many of those wanton acts of pride and vanity which he committed when a lad his family had always been on good terms with the lacedaemonians clinias his father indeed disclaimed their friendship but aleibiades renewed it and affected to show great respect to people of that country until he observed the ambassadors of lacedemon applied themselves wholly to nicias his rival and his dependants he then resented it very much and used every influence to work on the minds of the athenians to the prejudice of that people  the first public affair of any material consequence in which he embarked was soon after the peace for fifty years was concluded between the athenians and lacedaemonians some discontents still prevailed the people of athens had complied with the terms of the peace but the lacedaemonians having got possession of and demolished the town of panactus made them uneasy these discontents were heightened by alcibiades who began now to rival nicias who with his party at that time ruled in athens alcibiades declaimed that the spartans were now taking measures for humbling argos that they might afterward attack the athenians he artfully put them in mind of nicias having declined making a descent on spacteria and drew conclusions from thence very much against him when the ambassadors from sparta arrived and were introduced into the senate by nicias as they retired alcibiades as the old friend of their nation invited them to his house assured them of his friendship and persuaded them to declare that they were not vested with full powers although they had in the senate declared they were to avoid making unreasonable concessions when therefore they first appeared in the forum alcibiades addressed himself to the people saying you see my countrymen what credit ought to be give to thse lacedaemonians who deny to you today what they affirmed yesterday the people actually refused to hear them  alcibiades next promoted a league with the argives in order to keep the war at a distance in case the feuds between sparta and athens were revived this happened in the twelfth year of the peloponnesian war the next summer he was invested with the command of a considerable army passed into the territory of argos and to patrae at both places he labored to persuade them to build walls toward the sea to enabl them to receive succors from athens but jealousy of the athenian power prevented them no action took place this year  two years after some dissensions taking place at argos alcibiades sailed with a fleet of twenty ships into their territories to assist his friends and put an end to their disputes to effect this he caused three hundred of the inhabitants who were suspected of favoring the lacedaemonians to be seized and carried away after this he sailed to the island of melos which although small and of inconsiderable force had always acted with inflexible obstinacy against the athenians alcibiades laid siege to it but finding the siege attended with difficulties he turned it into a blockade and leaving a considerable body of forces there returned to athens the place afterward surrendered at discretion  the athenians in the sixteenth year of the war determined to send a fleet into sicily to the assistance of the egistines nicias was appointed to command alcibiades and lamachus as his colleagues during the preparations for this expedition an accident happened which put the whole city of athens into confusion the hermae or statues of mercury of which there were a multitude in the city and neighborhood were all defaced in one night nor could the authors of this fact be discovered notwithstanding a proclamation was issued offering impunity and a reward for the informer yet in consequence of a clause therein inviting any person of what condition soever to discover any former sacrileges some servants and slaves deposed that a long time before certain young men heated by wine had ridiculed some religious mystery and that alcibiades was among them his enemies caught at this and commenced a prosecution against him to which alcibiades offered to answer asserting his innocence and protesting against accusations brought against him while he should be absent his enemies determined to attempt his destruction procured others to move that he should have liberty to depart on his command and that after his return a day of trial should be assigned him to this proposition he was unwillingly obliged to consent  the fleet sailed but they had not been long in sicily before orders from athens arrived directing alcibiades to return and take his trial the whole city being in a confusion on the old affair of defacing the hermae this was a state trick played by the enemies of alcibiades to ruin his mighty interest which his birth fortune and accomplishments had gained him in athens to effect their purpose they also reported that he had entered into a conspiracy to betray the city to the acedemonians and that he had persuaded the argives to undertake something to their prejudice it was therefore determined to put him to death on his return but it being apprehended that the attempt to arrest him in fight of the army might produce great commotions those who were sent to bring him home were ordered to treat him with great decency and not to discover by any means the severe resolution taken against him they executed their commission very exactly so that neither he nor his army who were likewise accused had any suspicion but in the course of the voyage gathering from the seamen something of what was intended and being informed that a person out of fear of death had acknowledged himself guilty and impeached them they wisely determined not to trust an enraged and superstitious multitude but to provide for their own safety by withdrawing as soon as they had an opportunity this offered quickly after they gave their convoy the ip and retired to such parts of greece as out of hatred to athens were most likely to give them shelter  alcibiades went to sparta where he was well received in the spring when agis king of sparta invaded attica he gave him advice to seize and fortify dicelea this was a severe stroke on the athenians but their misfortunes fell much heavier on them in sicily and their allies began to waver they afterward had some slight successes at sea which discouraged the peloponnesians but alcibiades exerted his eloquence to persuade them to continue the war he advised them to send a small fleet to ionia promising to engage the cities to revolt from the athenians and to negociate a league between sparta and the king of persia the advantages of which he pointed out to them the lacedaemonians entering into his measures he passed over into ionia and there actually effected what he had promised he also found means to draw tissaphernes the king of persias lieutenant into a league with them the spartans however were displeased with the terms of it and seeking to have them altered the persians likewise grew displeased alcibiades did not long continue in favor with the spartans and having debauched the wife of agis that prince conceived the most inveterate hatred against him and persuaded the lacedaemonians to send orders to their general in ionia to put the athenian to death alcibiades gained some intelligence of this retired to tissaphernes and laying aside the lacedemonian as he had before done the athenian became a perfect persian by the politeness of his address he gained so much on tissaphernes although a professed enemy to all greeks that he gave his name to his gardens of pleasure after he had spent immense sums in adorning them they were afterward called alcibiades when the athenian saw that tissaphernes placed a confidence in him he gave him great information respecting the affairs of greece told him that it was not the interest of the persian monarch that athens should be destroyed but that she and sparta should be supported as rivals to each other and that then the greeks would never have an opportunity to turn their united arms against his master but added that if it should become necessary to rely on one of them he advised him to trust to athens because she would be content with the dominion of the sea but that the pride of the spartans would always stimulate them to new conquests and excite in them a desire of setting the greek cities in asia at liberty  tissaphernes approving of these councils alcibiades wrote privately to some officers of the athenian army at samos intimating that he was treating with the persian on their behalf but would not return to his native country until the democratical form of government was abolished the reasons he advanced for this measure were that the persian king hated a democracy but would immediately assist athens if the government was put into the hands of a few these fickle people the athenians prone to novelty dissolved the democracy and sent deputies to treat with alcibiades and tissaphemes and in case the terms offered by the persian were reasonable they were to declare that the athenians would vest the sovereignty in the hands of a few before the deputies arrived alcibiades had discovered that tissaphernes did not incline to keep the athenians on any terms therefore he set up such high terms in the name of the persians that the athenians themselves broke off the treaty the democracy of athens was however destroyed and a new form of government was set up this did not give general satisfaction the army at samos declared for the democracy and at the request of their general thrasybulus recalled alcibiades  on his return he made a most eloquent speech to the army showing them the true source of his misfortunes the injustice of his countrymen and the danger attending the state the soldiers pleased with his harangue created him general with full power and proposed sailing immediately to athens to restore the ancient form of government alcibiades opposed this extravagant measure and told them that since they had chosen him general he must return to tissaphernes to prepare things to make a speedy end of the war accordingly with the consent of the army he departed when he came to tissaphernes he extolled the great power of the athenians and by this means made himself formidable to the one party and necessary to the other  on his return to the army the deputies from athens were by his request received the army declared to them they would not acknowledge the present government but would fail to athens and restore the democracy this he opposed and persuaded them to remain where they were and told the deputies to return and demand of the tyrants to resign their authority on their return every thing was in confusion at athens a new form of government was proposed and alcibiades recalled and the favorers of an oligarchy withdrew to the enemy alcibiades mean time sailed with thirteen galleys to arpendus where he had frequent conferences with the persian lieutenant in his return he took nine galleys belonging to the peloponnesian fleet with this addition to his own squadron he constrained the halicarnassans to pay a large sum of money and fortified cos an engagement soon after took place between the athenian and peloponnesian fleets and while the event was doubtful alcibiades came in sight with twenty galleys and secured the victory  the athenians after this dividing their fleet into three parts alcibiades with his squadron fell in with the enemys fleet under mindarus and fled from them till he came in fight of the other divisions and then pursued them in his turn toward claros sinking and taking their ships when the enemy approached the shore they were joined by the persians a second battle ensued and a second victory was obtained thus to his immortal honor alcibiades gained two victories in one day  his fame now rose high among his countrymen they sent  000 foot  00 horse and  0 galleys to reinforce him he sailed and did good service in the hellespont afterward sat down before byzantium then well fortified and defended by a lacedemonian garrison some of the inhabitants betrayed the city and let in alcibiades and his army the garrison made so brave a defense that he was on the point of being driven out but making a proclamation that the byzantines should be safe in their persons and effects they joined him the garrison was almost all put to the sword  alcibiades and his colleague theramenes returned in triumph to athens they brought with them such immense spoils as had not been seen at athens since the persian war the people almost deserted the city to behold alcibiades when he landed after he had made his harangue in the assembly they directed the record of his banishment to be thrown into the sea ordered him to be absolved from the curses he lay under created him general and conferred many other favors upon him the sweetness of his temper his complacence and his applying the riches he brought home to the discharge of taxes made the most virtuous of the citizens confess he deserved the honors that were paid him he did not long remain in a state of inactivity but put to sea again with a fleet of one hundred ships for the hellespont to assist some cities which still kept firm to the athenians he left part of his fleet under antiochus with strict orders not to engage but the latter disregarded his instructions and was defeated on this news alcibiades returned but met with another stroke of ill fortune for his enemies had found means to persuade the athenians that the defeat was owing to his inattention and that he held a correspondence with the lacedaemonians they instantly deprived him of his command and appointed ten new generals to conon one of the ten he delivered the fleet but refused to return to athens and in his own ship passed into thrace built a castle there for his own security and founded a little principality in the sight of his many and powerful enemies  alcibiades though an exile endeavored to restore the power of his country of which the spartans having intelligence procured him to be assassinated he was a man of admirable accomplishments but indifferently principled of great parts and of an amazing versatility of genius  alcock john bishop of rochester worcester and ely successively in the latter end of the fifteenth century was born at beverly in yorkshire and educated at the university of cambridge where he took the degree of doctor of laws in the year    0 he was collated to the church of st margarets new fishstreet and in the same year was advanced to the deanery of st stephens college westminster he was appointed master of the rolls in      six years after he obtained two prebends one in the church of sarum the other in that of st pauls london in    0 he was made a privy counselor and one of the ambassadors to the king of castile and the next year was among the commissioners who treated with the commissioners of the king of scotland about the same time he was appointed by edward the fourth to be of the privy council to his son edward prince of wales in      he was promoted to the bishopric of rochester and in      constituted lord high chancellor of england which great post he did not hold longer than ten months in      he was translated to the sea of worcester and appointed lord president of wales while he was bishop of worcester he greatly enlarged the collegiate church of westbury the protector richard duke of york removed him from his office of preceptor to edward the fifth on account of his having incurred his displeasure by his strong attachment to the prince soon after the accession of henry the seventh to the throne he again held the great seal for a short time in      he was raised to the bishopric of ely in the room of dr john morton translated to canterbury in      he preached a sermon in st marys church at cambridge which lasted from one oclock in the afternoon till past three he was a prelate of great learning and piety a considerable writer and an excellent architect which accounts for his being made comptroller of the royal works and buildings under henry the seventh he founded a school at kingston upon hull and a chapel on the south side of the church in which his parents were buried he built the beautiful and spacious hall belonging to the episcopal palace at ely and made great improvements in all his other palaces lastly he founded jesus college in cambridge for a master six fellows and as many scholars this prelate wrote several works which have been published he died the first of october   00 at his castle of wisbich and was buried in the middle of an elegant chapel which he had built for himself at the east end of the north isle of the presbytery of his cathedral church  alcred alcredus or alredus king of northumberland was lineally descended from the king of bernicia and was born about the year   0 when he attained to mans estate he found his country miserably distracted partly by the vices of the kings and partly through the madness of the people osulph who was the lawful heir to the kingdom of northumberland perished by a conspiracy of his own family in     to him succeeded aethelwold otherwise called moll by a popular election this displeased many of the great lords who under the command of oswin took arms against him but with little success their army being routed and oswin slain alcred then asserted his right to the throne in which he proved successful aethelwold had reigned six years  alcred soon after his accession married osgerna he took pains to live on good terms with his neighbors but was far from pleasing his subjects for in     they compelled him to fly from york with a small number of attendants he retired to the strong city of bebba thought to be the town now called bamborrough in northumberland and thinking himself not safe here he sought protection of cynoth king of the picts who treated him kindly the historians affirm that alcred was deposed by the unanimous consent of all the princes of the royal family and other great lords of the kingdom this circumstance led the earl of stamford who was lord lieutenant of the county of leicester in      to introduce into a speech he made at leicester to prove the legality of the revolution the right the people of this country had to expel a king for maladministration it is not certain when he died  alcuinus flaccus an ecclesiastic of the eighth century born according to the most probable opinion in yorkshire it is pretty certain he was educated at york under the direction of archbishop egbert as we learn from his own letters in which he frequently calls that great prelate his beloved master and the clergy of york the companions of his youthful studies as he survived venerable bede about  0 years it is hardly possible that he could have received any part of his education under him as some writers of literary history have affirmed and it is worthy of observation that he never calls that great man his master though he speaks of him with the highest veneration it is not well known to what preferments he had attained in the church before he left england though some say he was abbot of canterbury the occasion of his leaving his native country was by his being sent on an embassy by offa king of mercia to the emperor charlemagne who contracted so great an esteem and friendship for him that he earnestly solicited and at length prevailed upon him to settle in his court and become his preceptor in the sciences alcuinus accordingly instructed that great prince in rhetoric logic mathematics and divinity which rendered him one of his greatest favorites he was treated with so much kindness and familiarity says a cotemporary writer by the emperor that the other courtiers called him by way of eminence the emperors delight charlemagne employed his learned favorite to write several books against the heretical opinions of felix bishop of urgil in catalonia and to defend the orthodox faith against that heresiarch in the council of francfort a d     which he performed to the entire satisfaction of the emperor and council and even to the conviction of felix and his followers who abandoned their errors the emperor consulted chiefly with alcuinus on all things relating to religion and learning and by his advice did many great things for the advancement of both an academy was established in the imperial palace over which alcuinus presided and in which the princes and prime nobility were educated and other academies were established in the chief towns of italy and france at his instigation and under his inspection france says one of our best writers of literary history is indebted to alcuinus for all the polite learning it boasted of in that and the following ages the universities of paris tours fulden soissons and many others owe to him their origin and increase those of whom he was not the superior and founder being at least enlightened by his doctrine and example and enriched by the benefits he procured for them from charlemagne after alcuinus had spent many years in the most intimate familiarity with the greatest prince of his age he at length with great difficulty obtained leave to retire from court to his abbey of st martin at tours here he kept up a constant correspondence by letters with charlemagne from which it appears that both the emperor and his learned friend were animated with the most ardent love to learning and religion and constantly employed in contriving and executing the noblest designs for their advancement he composed many treatises on a great variety of subjects in a style much superior in purity and elegance to that of the generality of writers in the age in which he flourished charlemagne often solicited him with all the warmth of an affectionate friend to return to court and favor him with his company and advice but he still excused himself and nothing could draw him from his retirement in the abbey of st martin at tours where he died a d  0  his works were collected and published by andrew du chesne in one volume folio paris      they consist of   tracts upon scripture   tracts upon doctrine discipline and morality   historical treatises letters and poems since that edition there has been published an incredible number of tracts poems etc ascribed to this author most of which in all probability were not his  alcyonius peter a learned italian who flourished in the sixteenth century he was well versed in the greek and latin tongues and wrote some pieces of eloquence which met with great approbation he was corrector of the press a considerable time for aldus manutius and is entitled to a share in the praises given to the editions of that learned printer he published a treatise concerning banishment which contained so many fine passages intermixed with others quite the reverse that it was thought he had tacked to somewhat of his own several fragments of a treatise of cicero de gloria and that afterward in order to save himself from being detected in this theft he burnt the manuscript of cicero the only one extant paulus manutius in his commentary upon these words of cicero librum tibi celeriter mittam de gloria  i will speedily send you my treatise on glory has the following passage relating to the affair he means says he his two books on glory which were handed down to the age of our fathers for bernard justinian in the index of his books mentions cicero de gloria this treatise however when bernard had left his whole library to a nunnery could not be found though sought after with great care nobody doubted but peter alcyonius who being physician to the nunnery was entrusted with the library had basely stole it and truly in his treatise of banishment some things are found interspersed here and there which seem not to favor of alcyonius but of some higher author the two orations he made after the taking of rome wherein he represented very strongly the injustice of charles v and the barbarity of his soldiers were excellent pieces there is also an oration ascribed to him on the knights who died at the siege of rhodes  aldhelm saint bishop of shereburn in the time of the saxon heptarchy he is said to have been the son of kenred brother to ina king of the west saxons but in the opinion of william of malmsbury his father was no more than a distant relation to the king having received the first part of his education in the school which one macduff a learned scot had set up in the place where malmsbury now stands he traveled into france and italy for his improvement at his return home he studied for some time under adrian abbot of st augustines in canterbury the most learned professor of the sciences who had ever been in england in these different seminaries he acquired an uncommon stock of knowledge and became famous for his learning not only in england but in foreign countries whence several learned men sent him their writings for his perusal and correction particularly prince arcivil a son of the king of scotland who wrote many pieces which he sent to aldhelm entreating him to give them the last polish by rubbing off their scots rust he was the first englishman who wrote in the latin language both in prose and verse and composed a book for the instruction of his countrymen in the prosody of that language besides this he wrote several other treatises on various subjects some of which are lost and others published by martin delrio and canisius venerable bede who flourished in the end of this and the beginning of the next century gives the following character of aldhelm he was a man of universal erudition having an elegant style and being wonderfully well acquainted with books both on philosophical and religious subjects in fact considering the cloud of ignorance by which he was surrounded and the great difficulty of obtaining knowledge without proper instruction aldhelm was a very extraordinary man from one of his letters to hedda bishop of winchester concerning the nature of his studies whilst at canterbury he appears to have been indefatigably determined to acquire every species of learning in his power for a copy of this curious epistle see henrys history vol ii p   0 king alfred the great declared that aldhelm was the best of all the saxon poets and that a favorite song which was universally sung in his time near  00 years after its authors death was of his composition when he was abbot of malmsbury having a fine voice and great skill in music as well as poetry and observing the backwardness of his barbarous countrymen to listen to grave instructions he composed a number of little poems which he sung to them after mass in the sweetest manner by which they were gradually instructed and civilized after this excellent person had governed the monastery of malmsbury of which he was the founder about  0 years he was made bishop of shereburn where he died a d  0   he wrote   de octo vitiis principalibus this treatise is extant in bibliotheca patrum of canisius   aenigmaticum versus mill this with several others of his poems was published by martin delrio at mentz  vo   0    a book addressed to a certain king of northumberland named alfrid on various subjects   de vita monahorum   de laud sanctorum   de arithmetica   de astrologia   a book against the mistake of the britons concerning the celebration of easter printed by sonius        de laud virginitatis manuscript in bennetcollege cambridge published among bedes opuscula besides many sonnets epistles and homilies in the saxon language  aldred abbot of tavistock was promoted to the bishopric of worcester in the year  0   he was so much in favor with king edward the confessor and had so much power over his mind that he obliged him to be reconciled with the worst of his enemies particularly with swane son of the earl goodwin who had revolted against him and came with an army to invade the kingdom aldred also restored the union and friendship between king edward and griffin king of wales he took afterward a journey to rome and being returned into england in the year  0   he was sent ambassador to the emperor henry ii he staid a whole year in germany and was very honorably entertained by herman archbishop of cologn from whom he learned many things relative to ecclesiastical discipline which on his return he established in his own diocese in the year  0   he went to jerusalem which no archbishop or bishop of england had ever done before him two years after he returned to england and kinsius archbishop of york dying the   d of december  0 0 aldred was elected in his stead on christmas day following and thought fit to keep his bishopric of worcester with the archbishopric of canterbury as some of his predecessors had done aldred went soon after to rome in order to receive the pallium from the pope he was attended by toston earl of northumberland giso bishop of wells and walter bishop of hereford the pope received toston very honorably and made him sit by him in the synod which he held against the simonists he granted to giso and walter their request because they were tolerably well learned and not accused of simony but aldred being by his answers found ignorant and guilty of simony the pope deprived him very severely of all honors and dignities so that he was obliged to return without the pallium on his way home he and his fellowtravellers were attacked by some robbers who took from them all that they had though they did not offer to kill them this obliged them to return to rome and the pope either out of compassion or by the threatenings of the earl of northumberland gave aldred the pallium but he was obliged to resign his bishopric of worcester however as the archbishop of york had been almost entirely ruined by the many invasions of foreigners king edward gave the new archbishop leave to keep twelve villages or manors which belonged to the bishopric of worcester edward the confessor dying in  0   aldred crowned harold his successor he also crowned william the conqueror after he had made him take the following oath viz that he would protect the holy church of god and its leaders that he would establish and observe righteous laws that he would entirely prohibit and suppress all rapines and unjust judgments he was so much in favor with the conqueror that this prince looked upon him as a father and though imperious in regard to every body else he yet submitted to obey this archbishop john bromton gives us an instance of the kings submission which at the same time shows the prelates haughtiness it happened one day as the archbishop was at york that the deputy governor or lord lieutenant going out of the city with a great number of people met the archbishops servants who came to town with several carts and horses loaded with provisions the governor asked to whom they belonged and they having answered they were aldreds servants the governor ordered that all these provisions should be carried to the kings storehouse the archbishop sent immediately some of his clergy to the governor commanding him to deliver the provisions and to make satisfaction to st peter and to him the saints vicar for the injury he had done them adding that if he refused to comply the archbishop would make use of his apostolic authority against him intimating thereby that he would excommunicate him the governor offended at this proud message used the persons whom the archbishop had sent him very ill and returned an answer as haughty as the message was aldred thereupon went to london to make his complaint to the king but in this very complaint he acted with his wonted insolence for meeting the king in the church of st peter at westminster he spoke to him in these words hearken o william when thou wast but a foreigner and god to punish the sins of this nation permitted thee to become master of it after having shed a great deal of blood i consecrated thee and put the crown upon thy head with blessings but now because thou have deserved it i pronounce a curse over thee instead of a blessing since thou art become the persecutor of gods church and of his ministers and have broken the promises and oaths which thou made to me before st peters altar the king terrified at this discourse fell upon his knees and humbly begged the prelate to tell him by what crime he had deserved so severe a sentence the noblemen who were present were enraged against the archbishop and loudly cried out he deserved death or at least banishment for having offered such an injury to his sovereign and they pressed him with threatenings to raise the king from the ground but the prelate unmoved at all this answered calmly good men let him lie there for he is not at aldreds but at st peters feet let him feel st peters power since he dared to injure his vicegerent having thus reproved the nobles by his episcopal authority he vouchsafed to take the king by the hand and to tell him the ground of his complaint the king humbly excused himself by saying he had been ignorant of the whole matter and begged of the noblemen to entreat the prelate that he might take off the curse he had pronounced and to change it into a blessing aldred was at last prevailed upon to favor the king thus far but not without the promise of several presents and favors and only after the king had granted him to take such a revenge on the governor as he thought fit since that time adds the historian none of the noblemen ever dared to offer the least injury it may be questioned which was more surprising here whether the archbishops haughtiness who dared to treat his sovereign after so unbecoming a manner or the kings stupidity who suffered such insolence and audaciousness from a priest  the danes having made an invasion in the north of england in the year  0   under the command of harold and canute the sons of king swane aldred was so much afflicted at it that he died of grief in the   th of september in that same year having besought god that he might not see the desolation of his church and country  aldrich dr henry an eminent english divine and philosopher born at london in      was educated at westminster school under the famous dr busby and admitted of christchurch college oxford he had a great share in the controversy with the papists in the reign of james ii and bishop burnet ranks him among those who examined all the points of popery with a solidity of judgment clearness of argument depth of learning and vivacity of writing far beyond any who had before that time written in our language he rendered himself so conspicuous that at the revolution when massey the popish dean of christchurch fled his deanery was conferred on him in this station he behaved in an exemplary manner and that fabric owes much of its beauty to his ingenuity it was aldrich who designed the beautiful square called the peckwaterquadrangle which is esteemed an excellent piece of architecture in imitation of his predecessor dr fell he published yearly a piece of some ancient greek author as a present to the students of his house he published a system of logic with some other pieces and the revising clarendons history of the rebellion was entrusted to him and bishop spratt but it does not appear that they made any additions or considerable alterations as has been asserted by mr oldmixon besides his preferments above mentioned dr aldrich was also rector of wem in shropshire he was chosen prolocutor of the convocation in   0  this worthy person died at christchurch on the   th of december    0 as to his character he was a most universal scholar and had a taste for all sorts of learning especially architecture sir john hawkins has favored the public with several particulars relative to dr aldrichs skill in music and on account of the doctors eminence in this respect sir john has given his life with his head prefixed his abilities as a musician rank him we are told amongst the greatest masters of the science he composed many services for the church which are well known as are also his anthems nearly to the number of twenty he adapted with great skill and judgment english words to many of the notes of palestrina carissimi victoria and other italian composers for the church some of which are frequently sung in our cathedrals as anthems by the happy talent which dr aldrich possessed of naturalizing the compositions of the old italian masters and accommodating them to an english ear he increased the stores of our own church though the doctor chiefly applied himself to the cultivation of sacred music yet being a man of humor he could divert himself by producing pieces of a lighter kind there are two catches of his the one hark the bonny christchurch bells the other entitled a smoking catch to be sung by four men smoking their pipes which is not more difficult to sing than diverting to hear his love of smoking was it seems so excessive as to be an entertaining topic of discourse in the university such was dr aldrichs regard for the advancement of music and the honor of its professors that he had formed a design of writing a history of the science and the materials from which he proposed to compile it are yet extant in the library of his own college it appears from these materials that he had marked down every thing he had met with concerning music and musicians but that he had wrought no part of them into any kind of form  dr aldrich is of some note as a latin poet in the musae anglicaae we find two elegant copies of verses by him one on the accession of king william iii and the other on the death of the duke of gloucester  he was a man of a very cheerful and pleasant turn of mind indeed he is always spoken of as having been a man of wit and as one who to his great talents and virtues joined those amiable qualities which rendered him the object of general affection as well as of general esteem and respect having never been married he appropriated his income to works of hospitality and beneficence and in encouraging learning to the utmost of his power of which he was a mos munificent patron as well as one of the greatest men in england i considered as a christian or a gentleman he had always the interest of his college at heart whereof he was an excellent governor and as he was remarkable for modesty and humility concealing his name to those several learned tracts he published so at his death he appointed to be buried without any memorial in the cathedral which his thrifty nephew complied with depositing him on the south side of bishop fells grave december    eight days after his decease which happened in the   d or   th year of his age  there was also a robert aldrich bishop of carlisle from the years      to      who wrote some latin poems  aldulph king of northumberland during the saxon heptarchy was inaugurated a d     ethelred during his reign to secure himself on the throne banished several lords among the rest aldulph but the party who were in opposition to the throne succeeding ethelred was assassinated and oswald elected in his room in twentyseven days he was driven out and aldulph placed on the throne two years after his accession a conspiracy was formed against him at the head of which was one wada the king engaged wadas army and routed them in  0  aldulph led an army against kenulph king of the mercians who had afforded shelter to his enemies but through the interposition of the bishops and nobles on both sides the monarchs were reconciled and made a league of firm friendship notwithstanding two powerful factions then existed in northumberland aldulph had the address to maintain himself on the throne yet many attempts were made by one of the parties at the head of which was alcmund son of alcred who had formerly reigned in that kingdom this prince beginning to grow formidable aldulph who judged it necessary to sacrifice him to his own safety procured him to be privately murdered his death was looked on by some as a martyrdom and under that pretense some of the kings enemies took up arms they were overcome and slain but soon after the party in opposition to the king became so powerful that he was forced to save himself by flight and take refuge in the court of charlemagne where the english were always well received aldulph never after recovered his crown for two years after the kingdom of northumberland submitted to the power of egbert king of wessex  alembert john le rond d an eminent french philosopher was born at paris in      he derived the name of john le rond from that of the church near which after his birth he was exposed as a foundling his father informed of this circumstance listened to the voice of nature and duty took measures for the proper education of his child and for his future subsistence in a state of ease and independence  he received his first education in the college of the four nations among the jansenists where he gave early marks of capacity and genius in the first year of his philosophical studies he composed a commentary on the epistle of st paul to the romans the jansenists considered this production as an omen that portended to the party of port royal a restoration to some part of their ancient splendour and hoped to find one day in m dalembert a second pascal to render this resemblance more complete they engaged their rising pupil in the study of mathematics but they soon perceived that his growing attachment to this science was likely to disappoint the hopes they had formed with respect to his future destination they therefore endeavored to divert him from this line but their endeavors were fruitless  at his leaving the college he found himself alone and unconnected in the world and sought an asylum in the house of his nurse he comforted himself with the hope that his fortune though not ample would better the condition and subsistence of that family which was the only one that he could consider as his own here therefore he took up his residence resolving to apply himself entirely to the study of goemetry and here he lived during the space of forty years with the greatest simplicity discovering the augmentation of his means only by increasing displays of his beneficence concealing his growing reputation and celebrity from these honest people and making their plain and uncouth manners the subject of goodnatured pleasantry and philosophical observation his good nurse perceived his ardent activity heard him mentioned as the writer of many books but never took it into her head that he was a great man and rather beheld him with a kind of compassion  you will never said she to him one day  be any thing but a philosopher  and what is a philosopher  a fool who toils and plagues himself during his life that people may talk of him when he is no more  as m dalemberts fortune did not far exceed the demands of necessity his friends advised him to think of a profession that might enable him to augment it he accordingly turned his views to the law and took his degrees in that line but soon abandoned this plan and applied to the study of medicine geometry however was always drawing him back to his former pursuits and after many ineffectual efforts to resist its attractions he renounced all views of a lucrative profession and gave himself over entirely to mathematics and poverty  in the year      he was admitted member of the academy of sciences for which distinguished literary promotion at such an early age he had prepared the way by correcting the errors of a celebrated work which was deemed classical in france in the line of geometry he afterward set himself to examine with deep attention and assiduity what must be the motion of a body which passes from one fluid into another more dense in a direction not perpendicular to the surface separating the two fluids every one knows the phenomenon which happens in this case and which amuses children under the denomination of duck and drakes but m dalembert was the first who explained it in a satisfactory and philosophical manner  two years after his election to a place in the academy he published his treatise on dynamics the new principle developed in this treatise consisted in establishing equality at each instant between the changes that the motion of a body has undergone and the forces or powers which have been employed to produce them or to express them otherwise in separating into two parts the action of the moving powers and considering the one as producing alone the motion of the body in the second instant and the other as employed to destroy that which it had in the first  so early as the year      m dalembert had applied this principle to the theory of the equilibrium and the motion of fluids and all the problems before solved by geometricians became in some measure in corollaries the discovery of this new principle was followed by that of a new calculus the first trials of which were published in a discourse on the general theory of the winds to which the prizemedal was adjudged by the academy of berlin in the year      and which was a new and brilliant addition to the fame of m dalembert this new calculus of partial differences he applied the year following to the problem of vibrating chords whose solution as well as the theory of the oscillation of the air and the propagation of sound had been given but incompletely by the geometricians who preceded him and these were hi masters or his rivals  in the year      he furnished a method of applying his principle a the motion of any body of a given figure and he solved the problem o the precession of the equinoxes determined its quantity and explaine the phenomenon of the nutation of the terrestrial axis discovered by d bradley  in      m dalembert published a treatise on the resistance of fluid to which he gave the modest title of an essay but which contains a multitude of original ideas and new observations about the same time he published in the memoirs of the academy of berlin researches concerning the integral calculus which is greatly indebted to him for the rapid progress it has made in the present century  while the studies of m dalembert were confined to goemetry he was little known or celebrated in his native country his connections were limited to a small society of select friends he had never seen any man in high office except messrs dargenson satisfied with an income which furnished him with the necessaries of life he did not aspire after opulence or honors nor had they been hitherto bestowed upon him as it is easier to confer them on those who solicit them than to look out for men who deserve them his cheerful conversation his smart and lively sallies a happy knack at telling a story a singular mixture of malice of speech with goodness of heart and of delicacy of wit with simplicity of manners rendered him a pleasing and interesting companion and his company consequently was much sought after in the fashionable circles his reputation at length made its way to the throne and rendered him the object of royal attention and beneficence he received also a pension from government which he owed to the friendship of count dargenson  the tranquillity of m dalembert was abated when his fame grew more extensive and when it was known beyond the circle of his friends that a fine and enlightened genius for literature and philosophy accompanied his mathematical genius our authors eulogist ascribes to envy detraction and to other motives nearly as ungenerous all the disapprobation opposition and censure that m dalembert met with on account of the publication of the famous encyclopedical dictionary of arts and sciences in conjunction with diderot none surely will refuse the just tribute of applause to the eminent displays of genius judgment and true literary taste with which m dalembert has enriched the great work now mentioned among others the preliminary discourse he has affixed to it concerning the rise progress connections and affinities of all the branches of human knowledge is perhaps one of the most capital productions of which the philosophy of the present age can boast nor will it be disputed that the master builders of this new and stupendous temple of science for the worship of nature had also really in view the advancement of human knowledge and the improvement of the arts and sciences this no true no candid philosopher will call in question but that in the inner court of this temple there was a confederacy formed against all those who looked higher than nature for the principal object of their veneration and confidence is a fact too palpable nay too boldly avowed to stand in need of any proof  some time after this dalembert published his philosophical historical and philological miscellanies these were followed by the memoirs of christina queen of sweden in which m dalembert showed that he was acquainted with the natural rights of mankind and was bold enough to assert them his essay on the intercourse of men of letters with persons high in rank and office wounded the former to the quick as it exposed to the eyes of the public the ignominy of those servile chains which they feared to shake off or were proud to wear a lady of the court hearing one day the author accused of having exaggerated the despotism of the great and the submission they require answered slyly if he had consulted me i would have told him still more of the matter  m dalembert gave very elegant specimens of his literary abilities in his translations of some select pieces of tacitus but these occupations did not divert him from his mathematical studies for about the same time he enriched the encyclopedie with a multitude of excellent articles in that line and composed his researches on several important points of the system of the world in which he carried to a higher degree of perfection the solution of the problem of the perturbations of the planets that had several years before been presented to the academy  in      he published his elements of philosophy a work extolled as remarkable for its precision and perspicuity in which however are some tenets relative both to metaphysics and moral science that are far from being admissible  the resentment that was kindled and the disputes that followed it by the article geneva inserted in the encyclopedie are well known m dalembert did not leave this field of controversy with flying colors voltaire was an auxiliary in the contest but as in point of candor and decency he had no reputation to lose and as he weakened the blows of his enemies by throwing both them and the spectator into fits of laughter the issue of the war gave him little uneasiness i fell more heavily on dalembert and exposed him even at home to much contradiction and opposition  it was on this occasion that the king of prussia offered him an honorable asylum at his court and the place of president of his academy an was not offended at his refusal of these distinctions but cultivated an intimate friendship with him during the rest of his life he had refused some time before this a proposal made by the empress of russia to entrust him with the education of the grand duke a proposal accompanied with all the flattering offers that could tempt a man ambitious o titles or desirous of making an ample fortune but the objects of his ambition were tranquillity and study  in the year      he published his dissertation on the destruction of the jesuists this piece drew upon him a swarm of adversaries who confirmed the merit and credit of his work by their manner of attacking it  beside the works already mentioned he published nine volumes of memoirs and treatises under the title of opuscules in which he has solved a multitude of problems relative to astronomy mathematics and natural philosophy of which our panegyrist gives a particular account more especially of those which exhibit new subjects or new methods of investigation  he published also elements of music and rendered at length the system of rameau intelligible but he did not think the mathematical theory of the sonorous body sufficient to account for the rules of that art he was always fond of music which on the one hand is connected with the most subtle and learned researches of rational mechanics while on the other its power over the senses and the soul exhibits to philosophers phenomena no less singular and still more inexplicable  in the year      he was chosen secretary to the french academy he formed soon after this preferment the design of writing the lives of all the deceased academicians from   00 to      and in the space three years he executed this design by composing  0 eulogies  m dalembert died on the   th of october      there were many amiable lines of candor modesty disinterestedness and beneficence in his moral character which are described with a diffusive detail in his eulogium by m condorcet hist de lacad royale des sciences       alexander the great king of macedon his father philip laid the plan of that extensive empire which his son afterward executed philip having made himself master of greece began to cast his eyes upon persia with a view to retaliate upon that haughty empire the injuries of former times it was the popular topic of the day but this prince was cut off in the midst of his enterprise such however was the influence of alexander in the assembly of the grecian states that he was created general of their combined forces in the room of his father having made every needful preparation at the head of a veteran army he invaded asia the lieutenants of darius who was then king of persia opposed him at the river granicus where alexander obtained a complete victory after which he pursued his march through asia at issus near scanderoon he was met by darius in person at the head of a prodigious army here he obtained a second victory and took the camp of darius together with his family whom he treated with the utmost humanity contrary to all the maxims of war instead of pursuing darius he made an excursion into egypt and as far as appears through no better motives than those of vanity here he was acknowledged to be the son of jupiter ammon in the mean time darius recruited his strength and got together an army superior to what he brought into the plain of issus alexander having finished his egyptian expedition traversed asia and passed the euphrates at arbella a town in assyria he met darius here a decisive battle was fought which put all persia into the hands of alexander his ambition not being satisfied with the conquest of that vast country he projected an expedition into india here he met with great opposition from porus a gallant prince whom in the end he reduced beyond the ganges lay a country still unsubdued he notified it to his army that he proposed to pass the river but these veterans harassed with the fatigues and seeing no end of their labor mutinied and refused to march further the disappointed chief was therefore obliged to return at babylon he proposed to receive ambassadors appoint governors and settle his vast monarchy but his excesses put an and to his life in the midst of his designs and in the flower of his age  the character of this hero is so familiar to every body that it is almost needless labor to draw it all the world knows says mr bail that it was equally composed of very great virtues and very great vices he had no mediocrity in any thing but his stature in his other properties whether good or bad he was all extremes his ambition rose even to madness his father was not at all mistaken in supposing the bounds of macedon too small for his son for how could macedon bound the ambition of a man who reckoned the world too small a dominion he wept at hearing the philosopher anaxarchus say that there was an infinite number of worlds his tears were owing to his despair of conquering them all since he had not yet been able to conquer one livy in a short digression has attempted to inquire into the events which might have happened if alexander after the conquest of asia had brought his arms into italy doubtless things might have taken a very different turn with him and all the grand projects which succeeded so well against an effeminate persian monarch might easily have miscarried if he had to do with rough hardy roman armies and yet the vast aims of this mighty conqueror if seen under another point of view may appear to have been confined in a very narrow compass since as we are told the utmost wish of that great heart for which the whole earth was not big enough was after all to be praised by the athenians for it is related that the difficulties which he encountered in order to pass the hydaspes forced him to cry out o athenians could you believe to what dangers i expose myself for the sake of being celebrated by you but bail affirms that this was quite consistent with the vast unbounded extent of his ambition as he wanted to make all future time his own and be an object of admiration to the latest posterity yet did not expect this from the conquest of worlds but from books he was perfectly in the right says bail for if greece had not furnished him with good writers he would long ago have been as much forgotten as the kings who reigned in macedon before amphitryon  alexander has been praised upon the score of continency yet his life could not surely be quite regular in that respect indeed the fire of his early youth appeared so cold toward women that his mother suspected him to be impotent and to satisfy herself in this point did with the consent of philip procure a very handsome courtezan to lie with him whose caresses however were all to no purpose his behavior afterward to the persian captives shows him to have had a great command over himself in this particular the wife of darius was a finished beauty her daughters likewise were all beauties yet this young prince who had them in his power not only bestowed on them all the honors due to their high rank but managed their reputation with the utmost delicacy they were kept as in a cloister concealed from the world and secured from the reach of every dishonorable not only attack but imputation he did not give the least handle to scandal either by his visits his looks or his words and for other persian dames his prisoners equally beautiful in face and shape he contented himself with saying gaily that they gave indeed much pain to his eyes the amazon thalestris could not obtain from him a compliance with her gallant request till after a delay of thirteen days in the mean time what are we to conclude from his causing his favorite mistress pancaste to be drawn naked by apelles though it is true he gave her to the painter who fell in love with her what of that immoderate love of boys which athenaeus relates of him what of that prodigious number of wives and concubines which he kept  his excesses with regard to wine were notorious and beyond all imagination and he committed when drunk a thousand extravagancies it was owing to wine that he killed clytus who saved his life and burnt persepolis one of the most beautiful cities of the east he did this last indeed at the instigation of the courtezan thais but this circumstance made it only the more heinous it is generally believed that he died by drinking immoderately and even plutarch who affects to contradict it owns that he did nothing but drink the whole day he was taken ill  in short to sum up the character of this prince we cannot be of opinion that his good qualities did in any wise compensate for his bad ones heroes make a noise their actions glare and strike the senses forcibly while the infinite destruction and misery they occasion lies more in the shade and out of sight one good legislator is worth all the heroes that ever did or will exist  alexander noel an indefatigable writer of the   th century born at roan in normandy      after finishing his studies at roan he entered into the order of dominican friars and was professed there in      soon after he went to paris to go through a course of philosophy and divinity in the great convent where he distinguished himself so that he was appointed to teach philosophy there which he did for twelve years mr colbert showed him many marks of his esteem and being determined to omit nothing to perfect the education of his son afterward archbishop of roan he formed an assembly of the most learned persons whose conferences upon ecclesiastical history might be of advantage to him father alexander was invited to this assembly where he exerted himself with so much genius and ability that he gained the particular friendship of young colbert who showed him the utmost regard as long as he lived these conferences gave rise to alexanders design of writing an ecclesiastical history for being desired to reduce what was material in these conferences to writing he did it with so much accuracy that the learned men who composed this assembly advised him to undertake a complete body of church history this he executed with great assiduity collecting and digesting the materials himself and writing even the tables with his own hand he at last completed his work in      toward the latter part of his life he was afflicted with the loss of his fight a most inexpressible misfortune to one whose whole pleasure was in study yet he bore it with great patience and resignation he died merely of a decay of nature      in the   th year of his age  alexander severus emperor of rome succeeded heliogabalus about a d     when but    years of age his mothers name was mammaea and by her advice he in a great measure regulated his conduct he applied himself to the reformation of abuses the state having been greatly disordered by the vicious conduct of his predecessor he was a most strict lover of justice an encourager of learning and learned men and favorable to the christians he made a successful expedition against the persians but endeavoring to reform his troops which had grown very licentious under the late bad government they murdered him at the instigation of maximinus in the   th year of his age together with his mother a d      alexander bishop of lincoln in the reigns of henry i and stephen was a norman by birth and nephew of the famous roger bishop of salisbury who first made him archdeacon of salisbury and afterward by his interest with the king raised him to the mitre alexander was consecrated at canterbury july         having received his education under his uncle the bishop of salisbury and been accustomed to a splendid way of living he affected show and state more than was suitable to his character or consistent with his fortunes this failing excepted he was a man of worth and honor and every way qualified for his station the year after his consecration his cathedral church at lincoln having been accidentally burnt down he rebuilt it and secured it against the like accident for the future by a stone roof this prelate increased the number of prebends in his church and augmented its revenues with several manors and estates in imitation of the barons and some of the bishops particularly his uncle the bishop of salisbury he built three castles one at banbury another at sleaford and a third at newark he likewise founded two monasteries one at haverholm for regular canons and nuns together the other at tame for whitefriars he went twice to rome in the years      and      the first time he came back in quality of the popes legate for the calling a synod in which he published several wholesome and necessary canons in august      he took a third journey to the pope who was then in france where he fell sick through the excessive heat of the weather and returning with great difficulty to england he died in the   th year of his prelacy  alexander william an eminent statesman and poet of scotland in the reigns of james i and charles i his surname is said to have been taken from the proper name of his predecessor alexander macdonald who under the family of argyle held the lands of menstris andrew alexander in the reign of james v is the first of the name mentioned in the records of scotland from him our william is descended he was born in    0 he soon discovered conspicuous parts which made his friends desirous to improve them to the utmost by a liberal education and was so much distinguished for both that he was recommended as tutor or rather companion to the earl of argyle after some time spent in foreign parts he returned to scotland and betook himself a while to a rural retirement here he finished his poetical complaint of the unsuccessful address he had made to his first mistress which he entitled aurora after his return this courtship was revived and he wrote above an hundred sonnets upon it the lady marrying soon after he removed to the court of king james vi and lived there in the capacity of a private gentleman but with the character of a learned and accomplished one here he still found occasion to exercise his poetical talents as they recommended him much to the king the poetry alexander now turned his mind to was of a more sublime kind than that which he had formerly wrote he now held the mirror up to kings and princes endeavored to animate the precepts of philosophy and to render its gravest lessons affecting he formed his works on the plan of the greek and roman tragedies and in   00 he published at edinburgh a tragedy upon the story of darius in this and in his other plays his measure is alternate rhyme his style is not always sound for which in his preface he pleads his country this was the year after reprinted at london without the preface but with two poems of our authors one congratulating the king upon his entry into england the other written after an inundation which happened at dover a place where his majesty used to amuse himself with hawking  in the same year his paraenesis to prince henry was also published in this poem he shows how the happiness of the prince depends on the choice of his counselors he shows also the use of history and how the lives of great men are to be read with profit whether our author had yet arrived in england does not appear or whether he published any thing more before the year   0  we have not learned but in that year came out his three other plays which with that beforementioned are entitled the monarchy tragedies croesus darius the alexandrian julius caesar by william alexander gentleman of the princes privychamber and with them are bound the abovementioned poems they are dedicated to king james in a poem of thirteen stanzas king james is said to have been delighted with these plays and with our authors conversation many authors have spoken highly of these tragedies  not long after mr alexander published a supplement to sir philip sidneys celebrated romance which is to be found in the fourth and subsequent editions of that work with the initials of his name to it this was a proper exercise for his muse in the same year      we find him mentioned to have been sworn in one of the gentlemen ushers of the presence to prince charles  his muse now labored with a poem of a different kind he brought forth a sacred poem called doomsday or the great day of the lords judgment it was first printed at edinburgh in  to in      and afterward in the folio edition of his works it is divided into twelve books or hours as the author calls them the first book was reprnted by a mr johnstoun who tells us the work had received the approbation of mr addison in the year abovementioned the king made him master of the requests and conferred on him the honor of knighthood  from this time he commenced a man of business and became ambitious of possessing a spacious estate he projected the settlement of a large clony in nova scotia at the expense of such adventurers as should be engaged in the undertaking his majesty made him a grant of that country and intended to create an order of baronets for the encouragement and support of so great a work but the jealousies which existed in the latter part of this reign suspended the execution of it king charles i on his coming to the crown was very forward to countenance it as it appeared from a pamphlet published by sir william entitled an encouragement to colonies to promise great advantages to the nation the king made sir william alexander lieutenant of nova scotia and founded in the first year of his reign the order of knights baronets of scotland whose aid was appropriated for the said plantation and settlement upon consideration of each having a liberal portion of land allotted him there their number was not to exceed   0 and they were endowed with certain privileges as that their title should be hereditary that they should take place before all knights ll lesser barons and all gentlemen except sir william alexander who and his heir have an express exemption they are also entitled to  place in the armies near his majestys standard and their wives have itle and their children precedence before their creation they were o fulfill the condition designed for the good of the plantation these atents were ratified in parliament and registered by the lord lion ing at arms and the heralds but after sir william sold nova scotia to he french they were drawn up and granted in more general terms it is now an honorable title conferred at the kings pleasure without mitation of numbers  sir william had also bestowed on him a grant and privilege to coin mall copper money which as well as most of sir williams schemes was eighed against with great bitterness the king however continued  encourage him and was pleased in      to make him secretary of state for scotland in the room of the earl of haddington and afterward in september    0 a peer of that kingdom by the title of viscount sterline or stirling in less than three years viz   th june      he was raised to the dignity of earl of

work was published in      but few more of his publications appear in print for he died soon after  alfred see aelfrid  ali bey a man who has acted a most distinguished part against the ottoman empire in this century was born in natolia in      and received at his birth the name of joseph his father was a greek priest of a distinguished family who educated him with great care designing him to succeed him but at thirteen years of age joseph being hunting in a neighboring forest robbers fell on his company and carried him off to grand cairo here he was sold to ibrahim a lieutenant of the janisaries who had him circumcised clothed him in the dress of the mamalukes and called him ali he gave him masters in the turkish and arabic languages and in horsemanship and by kind treatment made him by degrees satisfied with his new station in a course of years he succeeded in these languages showed wonderful dexterity in the use of his arms and became so dear to his master that he raised him rapidly in his household and created him a cachef or governor at the age of twentytwo  in this station he manifested his equity and good administration of justice improved the discipline of the mamalukes and laid the foundation of his future greatness here he gained the favor of the pacha rahiph who discovering his merit became his protector he remained several years in this station until his patron ibrahim was elected emir al hagi or prince of the caravan who took him with him to escort the pilgrims in their march they were attacked by the arabs ali fell upon them at the head of the mamalukes repulsed the enemy and killed a great number on the spot on his return several tribes being collected were determined to avenge their defeat the young cachef gave them battle and obtained a signal victory ibrahim did justice to the services of his lieutenant in full council and proposed to create him a sangiak ibrahim the circassian opposed it with all his might but the emir al hagi prevailed ali was nominated by the divan the pacha confirmed this choice clothed him with a caftan and gave him the firmaun of bey  become now one of the members of the republic he never forgot his obligations to his patron in      the emir al hagi was murdered by the party of ibrahim the circassian from this moment ali meditated vengeance he concealed his resentment and employed all the resources of his mind to arrive at the post of scheik elbalad the first dignity of the republic in      he attained that post and soon after revenged the blood of his patron by sacrificing ibrahim the circassian with his own hand this action raised him up numerous enemies the sangiaks attached to the party of the circassian conspired against him he was on the point of being murdered but saved himself by flight and repaired to jerusalem having gained the esteem of the governor of that city he thought himself in safety but his enemies fearing him even in exile wrote to the port to demand his death and orders were immediately sent to the governor to strike off his head fortunately rahiph his old friend was one of the divan and gave him notice to fly from erusalem ali therefore anticipated the arrival of the capigi bachi and took refuge with scheik daker prince of st john of acre  this respectable old man received him with open arms he was not long in discovering the merit of his new guest and from that moment loaded him with caresses he exhorted him to bear adversity with courage flattered his hopes soothed his sorrows and made him taste of pleasures even in his disgrace ali bey might have passed his days happily with scheik daker but ambition would not permit him to remain inactive he carried on a secret correspondence with some of the sangiaks attached to his interest the prince of acre on his part wrote to his friends at grand cairo and urged them to hasten the recall of the scheik elbalad while this was going on rahiph now grand vizier procured him to be invited to return to grand cairo and resume his dignity he set off immediately and was received with the acclamations of the people on all sides the storm was gathering around him all those who were offended at the murder of ibrahim the circassian were constantly laying snares for him they only waited a favorable opportunity the death of rahiph which happened in      furnished them with it they threw off the mask and declared openly against him he escaped into arabia felix visited the coasts of the red sea and once more took refuge with the scheik of acre who received him with the same tenderness whilst he was there the sangiaks of the party of the circassian persecuted those who were devoted to the interests of ali this imprudence opened the eyes of the majority they perceived that they were the dupes of a few ambitious men and to strengthen their party recalled the scheik elbalad and promised to support him with all their power he set off immediately on his return to grand cairo in      ali held a council he represented to them that moderation had only excited the friends of ibrahim to revenge that nothing but flight would have saved him from their plots and that to secure the common safety these turbulent spirits must be sacrificed the whole assembly applauded this resolution and the next day they took off the heads of four of them this execution insured the tranquillity of ali he saw himself at the head of the government and in the space of six years raised sixteen of his mamalukes to the dignity of beys and one of them to that of aga of the janisaries  supreme chief of the republic he adopted every measure to render his power durable not content with increasing his mamalukes to six thousand he took into pay ten thousand mograbi he caused his troops to observe the most rigid discipline and by continual exercise made them good soldiers he attached the young men of his household to him by the paternal attention he paid to their education and above all by bestowing favors and rewards on those who were the most worthy his party became so powerful that such of his colleagues as were not his friends dreaded his power nor dared to thwart his projects believing his authority established on a solid basis he turned his attention to the welfare of his people the arabs dispersed over the deserts and on the frontiers of egypt committed ravages not to be suppressed by a ctuating government he declared war and sent against them bodies of cavalry which beat them every where and drove them back into the depth of their solitudes egypt began to respire and agriculture encouraged flourished once more in that rich country having rendered the chief of each village responsible for the crimes of the inhabitants he punished them until the authors of the offense were delivered into the hands of justice in this manner the principal citizens looked after the public safety and for the first time since the commencement of the turkish empire the traveller and merchant could pass through the whole extent of the kingdom without the apprehension of an insult  the scheik elbalad unfortunately accumulated favors on mahomed abou dahab a traitor who secretly aspired to the sovereign power the sangiaks bribed him to put the scheik out of the way but fearing for his own life he deferred it and kept the gold to increase the confidence of his friend he discovered the conspiracy  in      the russians declared war against the port the scheik sent twelve thousand men to serve in the turkish army even this circumstance of duty was made use of to his disadvantage and it was represented at constantinople that these troops were designed to serve in the russian army the calumny was credited and a capigi with four attendants sent to take off his head ali had intelligence by his friends and dispatched a confident with twelve mamalukes who seized the capigi and his attendants took from them their order and put them to death the whole will show us by how precarious a tenure life is held in the ottoman empire the scheik possessed of this order assembled the chiefs and laid before them the despotism of the ottoman court this had the desired effect sixteen of the beys exclaimed that war ought to be declared against the grand signior the turkish pacha was ordered to quit egypt and the scheik secured the assistance of the prince of acre  ali levied two armies of one he gave the command to his brother abou dahab to attack arabia felix and the interior provinces the other to ismael to attack the maritime towns he also equipped a good fleet for the red sea mean time he remained at home attentive to the internal police of the kingdom he reformed the customhouse granted immunities to the european merchants encouraged commerce protected the caravans and the inland merchants he was not long before he reaped the fruits of his wise administration egypt was relieved the public safety established and agriculture encouraged  mean time abou dahab conquered yemen deposed the scheriff of mecca and substituted in his place emir abdalla who to pay his court to ali gratified him with the title of sultan of egypt ismael made himself master of all the towns on the eastern shore of the arabian gulf  in      ali sent abou dahab with forty thousand men to attempt the conquest of syria and wrote to count orlow the russian admiral then at leghorn making him large offers to form an alliance with him the count in return thanked him wished him success and made him great promises which were never realized he also negociated with venice promising to assist her to retake her possessions from the turks but the republic declined this bold enterprise  abou dahab took some towns of syria and drove the ottomans before him this wretch had long meditated the ruin of ali his patron and his friend he had accepted the command of the army in order to gain it to his interest having secured them he erected the standard of rebellion withdrew the garrisons from the conquered places and reentered egypt not daring to attack the capital he kept along the red sea crossed the deserts and entered upper egypt his revolt was now manifest he gained the beys who commanded there and marched toward cairo  ali repented his placing the command in the hands of a traitor he collected an army which he entrusted to ismael bey who likewise betrayed him and joined abou dahab  ali by the advice of his friends determined to retire to st john of acre he wrote to count orlow for assistance and in the middle of the night accompanied by the beys his friends and  000 troops he left cairo and fled across the deserts he reached gaza but from agitation of mind was taken very ill in this situation the venerable scheik daher came to visit him consoled him that his situation was not desperate and that the russian squadron was at hand with this consolation and the assistance of a russian physician in a few weeks he recovered  a russian squadron appearing before acre he wrote again to count orlow for assistance and sent also an ambassador to the empress in august      ali took jaffa and rama these successes inspired him with the hope of returning to cairo the chiefs of the janisaries in that capital also invited him to do so therefore collecting the garrisons of the conquered towns he began his march with    0 mamalukes   00 mograbi and   0 horse  abou dahab met him with   000 men and was defeated abou by instilling into the minds of the mahomedans that ali designed to abolish their religion and introduce christianity procured an army of  0000 men the janisaries however refused to join him  ali was unprepared for this event he abandoned himself to despair and fell dangerously ill his friends advised him to retire to st john of acre but he declared he would sooner perish than retreat an inch  on the   th of april      the armies met both parties charged with fury and notwithstanding the inferiority of alis troops they had at first the advantage but the mograbi corrupted by the promises of abou dahab deserted and the fortune of the day was changed most of alis friends fell round him the survivors pressed him to retire but he replied that his hour was come the mamalukes bravely perished with their arms in their hands ali slew two soldiers who attempted to seize him and the lieutenant of abou dahab advancing ali though wounded with two balls shot him with a pistol he fought like a lion but being beat down by the back stroke of a sabre was seized and carried to the tent of the conqueror where he died of his wounds eight days after  ali was of the middle size his carriage noble and his character open and generous he possessed an insurmountable courage and a lofty genius he died the victim of an illplaced friendship had russia availed herself of his offers she might have secured to herself the commerce of arabia he was only    years of age when he died the egyptians long mourned his loss and saw

of a work entitled notitia ecclesiae anglicanae but death prevented his completing it  allatius leo keeper of the vatican library a native of scio and a celebrated writer of the   th century he was of great service to the gentlemen of port royal in the controversy they had with m claude touching the belief of the greeks with regard to the eucharist no latin was ever more devoted to the sea of rome or more inveterate against the greek schismatics than allatius he never engaged in matrimony nor was he ever in orders and pope alexander vii having asked him one day why he did not enter into orders he answered because i would be free to marry the pope rejoined if so why do you not marey  because replied allatius i would be at liberty to take orders thus as mr bail observes he passed his whole life wavering betwixt a parish and a wife sorry perhaps at his death for having chosen neither of them when if he had fixed upon one he might have repented his choice for  0 or  0 years  if we believe john patricius allatius had a very extraordinary pen with which and no other he wrote greek for  0 years and we need not be surprised that when he lost it he was so grieved that he could scarce forbear crying he published several manuscripts several translations of greek authors and several pieces of his own composing in his compositions he is thought to show more erudition than judgment he used also to make frequent digressions from one subject to another he died at rome in      aged     allegri antonio called corregio from the place of his birth an eminent historical painter was born in the year      being descended of poor parents and educated in an obscure village he enjoyed none of those advantages which contributed to form the other great painters of that illustrious age he saw none of the statues of ancient greece or rome nor any of the works of the established schools of rome and venice but nature was his guide and corregio was one of her favorite pupils to express the facility with which he painted he used to say that he always had his thoughts ready at the end of his pencil  the agreeable smile and the profusion of graces which he gave to his madonas saints and children have been taxed with being sometimes unnatural but still they are amiable and seducing an easy and flowing pencil an union and harmony of colors and a perfect intelligence of light and shade give an astonishing relief to all his pictures and have been the admiration both of his cotemporaries and successors annibal caracci who flourished  0 years after him studied and adopted his manner in preference to that of any other master in a letter to his cousin louis he expresses with great warmth the impression which was made on him by the first sight of corregios paintings every thing which i see here says he astonishes e particularly the coloring and the beauty of the children they live  they breathe  they smile with so much grace and so much reality that it is impossible to refrain from smiling and partaking of their enjoyment my heart is ready to break with grief when i think on the unhappy fate of poor corregio  that so wonderful a man if he ought not rather to be called an angel should finish his days so miserably in a country where his talents were never known  from want of curiosity or of resolution or from want of patronage corregio never visited rome but remained his whole life at parma where the art of painting was little esteemed and of consequence poorly rewarded this concurrence of unfavourable circumstances occasioned at last his premature death at the age of  0 he was employed to paint the cupola of the cathedral at parma the subject of which is an assumption of the virgin and having executed it in a manner that has long been the admiration of every person of good taste for the grandeur of design and especially for the boldness of the foreshortenings an art which he first and at once brought to the utmost perfection he went to receive his payment the canons of the church either through ignorance or baseness found fault with his work and although the price originally agreed upon had been very moderate they alleged that it was far above the merit of the artist and forced him to accept of the paultry sum of  00 livres which to add to the indignity they paid him in copper money to carry home this unworthy load to his indigent wife and children poor corregio had to travel six or eight miles from parma the weight of his burden the heat of the weather and his chagrin at this villainous treatment immediately threw him into a pleurisy which in three days put an end to his life and his misfortunes  for the preservation of this magnificent work the world is indebted to titian as he passed through parma in the suite of charles v he run instantly to see the chef doeavre of corregio while he was attentively viewing it one of the principal canons of the church told him that such a grotesque performance did not merit his notice and that they intended soon to have the whole defaced have a care of what you do replied the other if i were not titian i would certainly wish to be corregio  corregios exclamation upon viewing a picture by raphael is well known having long been accustomed to hear the most unbounded applause bestowed on the works of that divine painter he by degrees became less desirous than afraid of seeing any of them one however he at last had occasion to see he examined it attentively for some minutes in profound silence and then with an air of satisfaction exclaimed i am still a painter julio romano on seeing some of corregios pictures at parma declared they were superior to any thing in painting he had yet beheld one of these no doubt would be the famous virgin and child with mary magdalene and st jerome but whether our readers are to depend upon his opinion or upon that of lady millar who in her letters from italy gives a very unfavourable account of it we shall not presume to determine this lady however speaks in a very different style of the no less famous notte or night of corregio of which she saw only a copy in the dukes palace at modena the original having been sold for a great sum of money to the king of poland it surprises me very much says she to see how different the characters are in this picture from that which i already have described to you the subject is a nativity and the extraordinary beauty of this picture proceeds from the clair obscure there are two different lights introduced by means of which the personages are visible namely the light proceeding from the body of the child and the moonlight these two are preserved distinct and produce a most wonderful effect the childs body is so luminous that the superficies is nearly transparent and the rays of light emitted by it are verified in the effect they produce upon the surrounding objects they are not rays distinct and separate like those round the face of a sun that indicates an insuranceoffice nor linear like those proceeding from the man in the almanac but of a dazzling brightness by their light you see clearly the face neck and hands of the virgin the rest of the person being in strong shadow the faces of the pastori who crowd round the child and particularly one woman who holds her hand before her face lest her eyes should be so dazzled as to prevent her from beholding the infant this is a beautiful natural action and is most ingeniously introduced the straw on which the child is laid appears gilt from the light of his body shining on it the moon lights up the background of the picture which represents a landscape every object is distinct as in a bright moonlight night and there cannot be two lights in nature more different than those which appear in the same picture the virgin and the child are of the most perfect beauty there is a great variety of character in the different persons present yet that uniformity common to all herdsmen and peasants in short this copy is so admirable that i was quite sorry to be obliged to lose sight of it so soon but i never shall forget it the duke of modena for whom corregio did the original picture gave him only  00 livres of france for it a great sum in those days but at present what ought it to cost this great painters death happened in       allein richard the son of a clergyman of the same name rector of ditchet somersetshire for fifty years his son richard was born at that place in      the first part of his education under his father fitted him for the university in      that year he entered a commoner of st albans hall in oxford where he took the degree of bachelor of arts thence he removed to new inn where he took his masters degree and entering into holy orders became an assistant to his father the old gentleman being inclined to puritanism the son fell into the same opinions and being a man of great zeal and learning he was soon considered as a man fit to be followed in march      he succeeded to the living of batcomb in dorsetshire the duty of which he performed with much industry and fidelity and being a zealous covenanter had some disturbances with the kings forces in those parts he was however a great enemy to that enthusiastic spirit which prevailed in this country on the ruin of the episcopal church this appears by his subscribing a representation entitled the testimony of the ministry of somersetshire to the truth of jesus christ and to the solemn league and covenant printed in      his industry and affection to the cause procured himself and his father to be constituted assistants to the commissioners appointed by parliament for ejecting scandalous ministers this was in      and mr wood tells us they acted with severity enough however on the restoration mr allein showed a disposition to yield obedience to the government but could not come up to the terms of conformity which occasioned his being ejected from his living after he had held it upwards of twenty years after this he continued to exercise his function privately preaching sometimes in his own house at others in the houses of gentlemen in the neighborhood he was once apprehended at the seat of mr moore who had been a member of parliament and who had invited him thither to preach to his family and some of his neighbors mr moore paid the fine which was five pounds for him he still went on in the way of his profession notwithstanding he was often summoned to the quarter sessions and severely reprimanded as the keeper of a conventicle he however escaped imprisonment as his great learning piety and exemplary life had gained him so high a reputation that it would have been very unpopular to have sent him to gaol after the five miles act passed he was obliged to leave batcomb and retire to from selwood where he continued in the constant exercise of his ministry notwithstanding the dangers he was exposed to he died the   d of december      being upwards of sixtyfour years of age he was distinguished for his plain practical manner of preaching and for the delight he took in the pastoral office his writings which were mostly small tracts on religious subjects were much esteemed and often printed although a nonconformist he was not tinctured either with spleen to the church or disloyalty to his prince on the contrary he lived in a fair correspondence with the clergy of his neighborhood and the gentry paid him great respect although of opposite sentiments  allein joseph was the son of mr tobias allein and born at the devizes in wiltshire      he discovered an extraordinary tincture of religion even in his childhood at eleven years of age he was much addicted to private prayer and on the death of his brother edward who was a worthy minister of the gospel he entreated his father that he might be educated for that profession in four years he acquired a competent knowledge of greek and latin and was declared by his master fit for the university he was however kept some time longer at home where he was instructed in logic and at sixteen was sent to lincoln college oxford in      he was removed to corpus christi college a wiltshire scholarship being there vacant while at college he was remarkably assiduous in his studies grave in his temper but cheerfully ready to assist others he might in a short time have obtained a fellowship which he declined for the sake of the office of chaplain being pleased with the opportunity this gave him of exerting his gift in prayer in july      he was admitted bachelor of arts and became a tutor in this arduous employment he behaved himself with equal skill and diligence several of his pupils became very eminent nonconforming ministers and not a few attained to good preferment in the established church in      he became assistant in the ministry to mr g newton of taunton in somersetshire where he married the same year his income was small but that was assisted by the profits of a boardingschool which mrs allein kept during seven years that he lived in this manner he discharged his pastoral duty with incredible diligence for besides preaching and catechizing in the church he spent several afternoons in a week in visiting the people of the town and exhorting them to a religious life these applications were at first far from being welcome to many families but his meekness moderation and unaffected piety made him by degrees the delight of his parishioners he was deprived in      for nonconformity he preached however privately his zeal and industry in this course brought him at length into trouble so that on the   th day of may      he was committed to ivelchester gaol and was with seve ministers and fifty quakers confined in one room where they suffere great hardships however they still continued to preach till the assize these were held before mr justice foster and at them he was indite for preaching on the   th of may preceding of which indictment h was found guilty and sentenced to pay a hundred marke and to remain in prison till his fine was paid at the time of his receiving sentence h said that he was glad that it had appeared before his country that whatever he was charged with he was guilty of nothing but doing his duty and all that did appear by the evidence was that he had sung a psalm and instructed his family others being there and both in his own house he continued in prison a year which broke his constitution however when he was at liberty he applied himself to his ministry as earnestly as ever which brought him a grievous sickness the five miles act taking place he retired from taunton to wellington where he continued but a short time mr mallack a merchant inviting him to lodge at a house of his some distance from taunton in the summer of      he was advised to drink the waters near the devizes for his health but before he left mr mallacks house viz on the  0th of july in that year some friends came to take their leaves of him they were surprised praying together and for this were sentenced to sixty days imprisonment which himself seven ministers and forty private persons suffered in the county gaol this hindered his going to the waters and his disease returning he lost another summer at length in      he went but was far from receiving the benefit he expected after some time he went to dorchester where he grew better but applying himself again to preaching catechizing and other duties his distemper returned with such violence that he lost the use of his limbs his death was then daily expected but by degrees he grew somewhat better and at length went to bath where his health altered so much that his friends were in hopes he would have held out several years but growing suddenly worse again he finished his life there in the month of november      being somewhat above    years old he was a man of great learning and greater charity zealous in his own way of worshipping god but not in the least bitter toward any christians who worshipped in another manner he preserved a great respect for the church notwithstanding all his sufferings and was eminently loyal to his prince notwithstanding the severities of the times his writings breathe a true spirit of piety for which they have been always and deservedly esteemed anthony wood has treated his memory very rudely and betrayed that spleen he had against the nonconformists in speaking ill of one who spoke ill of no man the body of our allein lies in the chancel of the church of st magdalen of taunton and on his gravestone are the following lines  here

there or in some other university of italy after his return he was appointed chaplain to cardinal wolsey and was commissary and judge of his court as legate a latere in the exercise of which office he was suspected of great dishonesty and even purjury he assisted the cardinal in visiting and afterward suppressing forty of the smaller monasteries for the erection of his colleges at oxford and ipswich the cardinal procured him the living of dalby in leicestershire although it belonged to the masters and brethren of burtonlazars he was incorporated doctor of laws in the university of oxford and on the   th of march      was consecrated archbishop of dublin in the room of hugh inge deceased about the same time he was made chancellor of ireland he wrote some few pieces relating to the

of his age  allen or alleyn thomas a famous mathematician of the sixteenth century was born at utoxeter in staffordshire the   st of december      being descended for six generations from allen the lord of the manor of buckenhall in that county he was admitted scholar of trinity college oxford the th of june      fellow in      and two years after master of arts being much inclined to a retired life and averse from entering into oly orders he quitted the college and his fellowship and retired to gloucester hall in    0 where he pursued his studies many years and t length became an eminent antiquary philosopher and mathematician being thus accomplished he was countenanced by the princes and nobles not only of this country but of others the earl of leicester favorite of queen elizabeth had a particular esteem for him and would have procured him a bishopric but his love of a retired life made him decline the offer he was also highly respected by many other celebrated men of his time whose names do honor to this country as sir thomas bodley sir henry saville mr camden sir robert cotton sir henry spelman mr seldon etc his great skill in the mathematics made the ignorant and vulgar look upon him as a magician and conjuror he was remarkably assiduous in collecting scattered mss relating to every faculty particularly history antiquity astronomy philosophy and mathematics these collections have been quoted by several learned authors but are now lost his work are   claudii ptolomaei pelusiensis de astrorum judiciis aut ut vulgo vocant quadripartitae constructionis liber secundus cum expositione thomae allen angli oxoniensis or the second book of claudius ptolemy of pelusium concerning the stars or as it is commonly called of the quadriparti construction with the exposition of thomas allen of oxford   claudii ptolomaei de astrorum judiciis lib ter cum expositione thomae alleyn he likewise wrote notes on lillys book and some on john bales book de scriptoribus magnae britanniae he lived to a great age and died at worcester hall september  0th      there was another thomas allen born in      a learned divine who wrote observations on st chrysostoms book on isaiah  alleyn edward a celebrated comedian in the reigns of elizabeth and james i and the founder of a college at dulwich in the county of surrey which flourishes to this day he was of respectable parents who lived in good fashion and credit his father who it appears was of the household to queen elizabeth is said to have possessed an estate in yorkshire our mr alleyn was born in the parish of st botolph bishopsgate london september        as we learn from a memorandum in his own hand writing dr fuller expressly says near devonshire house the spot where devonshire square now stands where in his time was the sign of the pie the same author says he commenced stage player very young which is not improbable notwithstanding his fathers easy circumstances as he might be averse to any more serious course of life he is said to have applied to the study of literature but by what he has left of his writing it does not appear he ever engaged himself deeply in scholastic study from various testimonies which have been given of him it appears he was a man of excellent natural parts he possessed a flexible genius great corporal agility a lively temper faithful memory and fluent elocution and was in person as appears by a picture preserved at dulwich of a stately mien and appearance all this might induce a young man to engage himself in that gay and popular profession and there are also some other authorities which affirm he applied early to that vocation it appears from some of the papers of the lord keeper pickering still in being that alleyn acted in several of the tragedies of christopher marlow the poet and was arrived at great excellence therein now as marlow died in      he must have been on the stage before that time he had then so captivated the town and monopolized the favor of the public by his ready command of voice countenance and gesture and so judiciously adapted them to the characters he played that he could animate and improve the most lifeless compositions as wholly to engage his audience so that in the perfection of the player they forgot the defects of the poet haywood in his prologue to marlows jew of malta calls him proteus for shapes and roscius for a tongue his character we have in a little tract written by mr nash a celebrated satirist of those times thus we see mr alleyn was early famous upon the stage he usually played in the best dramatic pieces and the most capital parts in them he was certainly one of the original actors in the plays of our immortal shakespeare as also in some of ben jonsons but what characters he performed is difficult now to ascertain as the editors of those times did not distinguish the character each actor played we find his celebrity as an actor mentioned not only in prose but in verse many writers for and concerning the stage have bestowed some fine general characters on him and sir richard baker says he was as famous for his honesty as his acting but any particulars of his own life except what may be gleaned from detached notes and minutes he has left of his own affairs we have none it is strange and rather an instance of ingratitude in his cotemporaries that no one should have collected sufficient materials to have compiled some monument to his memory however by help of his papers still extant and by other antiquities of his college some part of the obscurity with which his actions have been hidden has been done away and his biographers have been enabled to discharge him of some misrepresentations with which he has been unjustly accused and to show him in a fairer and stronger light than has been hitherto done  how he accumulated a fortune sufficient to lay the foundation and endow such a large and commodious edifice was naturally one of the first objects of inquiry besides his paternal inheritance which would lay a foundation for his fortune the advantages he must make by acting plays to a man of his provident disposition would considerably improve it he was not only an actor but manager and owner of a theater and had a company of comedians of his own by whom he is said to have amassed a good fortune this was the fortune playhouse near whitecrossstreet moor fields he was also keeper of the kings wild beasts and master of the bear garden situated at bankside southwark both which places were much resorted to and must yield him a great profit it is said not less than  00l per annum a little before his death he sold his share and patent by marriages also for he was twice if not thrice married and into good families he gained something handsome thus his riches were derived from various sources  the motives which have been ascribed to mr alleyn for founding his college and which have been readily believed by many who should have had sense enough to reject them are too ridiculous to need repetition the story of the devil appearing in a dance and frightening mr alleyn so much as to induce him to quit his profession and build this college as an atonement is sufficiently refuted by an entry in his own diary by which it appears that he continued his connection with the stage some time after he had built his college to ascribe such a motive to an action which seems to have arisen only from a due sense of piety and benevolence is highly reprehensible a perusal of mr alleyns private papers show him to be a man habituated to devotion for at the end of his quarterly account he concludes with a pious ejaculation acknowledging all he was possessed of to be from god indeed the stage seems rather to have inspired him with a principle of goodness from the lessons of virtue he had there imbibed when mr alleyn had resolved on his foundation he did not like others postpone it until his death but immediately set about the execution of it while in health and strength and before he was fortyeight years of age he began therefore to build his college at dulwich in surrey about five miles from london after a design of mr inigo jones who was a witness to the deed of settlement and it appears it was in good forwardness in      he designed it for the residence of six poor men six poor women and twelve poor children between the age of four and six to be there kept taught and maintained a schoolmaster to be provided for them who was to have his diet lodging and a stipend the children to be maintained there until they are fourteen or sixteen years of age the edifice consists of the college and chapel which with the fitting up of the gardens cost him betwixt   and  0000l it was finished in      as appears by a diary which he kept of all his college accounts proceedings and occurrences and which afford his successors an opportunity of seeing how this noble foundation was begun and carried on after he had built the college he found some difficulty to obtain a charter to settle his lands in motmain as he proposed to endow it with  00l per annum for the support of the above objects of charity and of a master warden and four fellows three of which were to be ecclesiastics and the other a skilful organist this obstruction arose from the lord chancellor bacon but at length he was allowed to settle his lands his own way and obtained a patent in      by virtue whereof mr alleyn on the  st of june that year in the chapel of the college called the chapel of gods gift did execute a proper deed of settlement in presence of many persons of distinction his diary he kept for five years longer we find no book of accounts of his kept after his wife lived with him until      when she died and in about a year or two after he married his last wife who survived him he died the   st of november      in the   st year of his age and was buried in the chapel of his college and has a tombstone over his grave with an inscription  by his will dated november         he bequeathed his wife   00l chargeable on an inn in southwark and some tenements in st saviors parish and all his jewels he also gave his seal ring with his arms to be worn by the master and his successors to the college and appointed a common seal to be made for it he also wills that his executors should build ten almshouses in the parish of st botolph bishopsgate and the like number in the parish of st savior southwark for the poor of these respective parishes to be likewise members of the said college  having said thus much of the founder we must now enter further into the account of his college by the deed he assigned several parcels of land to the amount of  00l per annum for the maintenance of a master a warden both which must be unmarried and always of the name of alleyn or allen and four fellows in these the government of the college is invested of six poor brethren and six poor sisters and twelve poor children in the deed is recited of what degree the fellows brothers and sisters and of what condition the scholars are to be the form of election and admittance the oaths to be respectively taken and the duties of each office the master or fellows are not to be absent but by leave of all the government is conducted with great decorum the persons in the college assemble at prayers twice a day in the chapel by one of the clergymen belonging to the foundation when the master dies the warden succeeds the old men and women must be single and of undoubted character the front of the building is occupied by the chapel and the masters apartments in the wings the inhabitants have apartments the right wing was rebuilt in      and by the care and attention of the present members of the college money is now accumulating to rebuild the left wing a part of which is at present occupied by a gallery of pictures among which are the portraits of queen elizabeth fair rosamond etc etc  mr cartwright whose portrait and also some of his family are in the gallery has increased the library with a good collection of plays  in addition to the above information we have been favored with the following particulars repecting the college of gods gift and its worthy founder for which we are indebted to the kind communication of the gentleman who is now and has been for thirty years master  in the letters patent granted by james i that monarch styles mr alleyn our trusty and well beloved edward alleyn esquire of dulwich in our county of surrey chief master ruler and overseer of all and singular our games of bears and bulls and mastiff dogs and mastiff bitches by this we may perceive that bullbaiting was in great vogue in those days and may conclude as the mastiff was at that time in great repute mr alleyn must have made great profit by the sale of them  the manor of dulwich is given among other things to the master warden etc and their successors for ever and for no other intent or purpose whatsoever yet mr alleyn before his death was so ill advised as to make an addition to the foundation by directing that there should be six chaunters for music and singing and thirty members but lord chancellor king on its being heard before him declared that mr alleyn could not by his order or statute of      add any persons to the corporation or make any new members he having in      conveyed all his effects to the sole and only use of the master warden etc and their successors for ever  allestry or allestree richard provost of eton college in the reign of king charles i was son of mr richard allestry of an ancient family in derbyshire and born in march      at uppington in shropshire he was educated first at a country free school in the neighborhood and afterward at one of greater note at coventry where philemon holland the translato taught in      being then seventeen years of age he was carried by his father to oxford and entered a commoner in christ church under the tuition of mr richard busby six months after his settlement in the university dr fell dean of christ church observing the parts and industry of young allestry made him a student of that college where he applied himself to academical learning with uncommon success after he had taken the degree of bachelor of arts he was chosen moderator in philosophy which office he continued to discharge till the disturbances of the kingdom interrupted the studies and repose of the university in      mr allestry among other oxford scholars engaged in the kings service and continued therein till sir john biron who was sent with a party of horse to countenance and support the scholars in arms withdrew from oxford upon which he returned with many others to his gown and studies soon after a party of the rebels having entered oxford and plundered the colleges mr allestry narrowly escaped being severely handled by them in october following he took arms again and was present in the battle fought by king charles and the rebels under the command of the earl of essex in keinton field in warwickshire after which understanding that the king designed immediately to march to oxford and to take up his residence at the deanery of christ church he hastened thither to prepare for his majestys reception but in his way was taken prisoner by a party of horse from broughton house which was garrisoned by the lord say for the parliament his confinement was very short the garrison surrendering itself to the kings forces who summoned it in their march and now mr allestry settled himself again to his studies and in the next spring took his degree of master of arts and the same year his life was greatly endangered by a pestilential distemper which raged in the garrison of oxford soon after his recovery he entered a third time into his majestys service in a regiment formed out of the oxford cholars in this service he continued till the end of the war and then went into holy orders at a time when he had no prospect of worldly advantage he was tutor to several young gentlemen and students and discharged the office of censor of the college he bore a part in that signal test of loyalty which the university of oxford gave in their decree and judgment against the solemn league and covenant for which in july      he was proscribed and expelled the university by the parliament visiters being thus driven from oxford he retired into shropshire and was entertained as chaplain to the honorable francis newport and upon the death of his father lord newport he was sent over into france to take care of that noblemans effects having dispatched this affair with good success he came back to his employment and continued in it till king charles ii marched into england with his scotch army and until his wonderful escape at worcester at which time the managers of the kings affairs wanting an intelligent and faithful person to send over to his majesty mr allestry was desired to undertake the journey which he did and having attended the king at rouen and received his dispatches he returned to england here he found his friends mr dolben and mr fell who had likewise been banished the university residing privately and performing the offices of the church of england for the loyalists upon which he joined them and continued with them till sir anthony cope a loyal gentleman of considerable quality and fortune in oxfordshire prevailed upon him to live in his family where he continued several years with liberty of going or staying as occasion required and by this means he was enabled without being taken notice of to convey messages to the king from his friends after several difficult journies successfully performed he was sent over in the winter before his majestys restoration into flanders from whence returning with letters he was seized upon his landing at dover by a party of soldiers but had the address to secure his letters by conveying them to a faithful hand being guarded up to london he was examined by a committee of the council of safety and sent prisoner to lambeth house where he contracted a dangerous sickness after six or eight weeks confinement he was set at liberty and returned into oxfordshire from whence after a short stay he went into shropshire to visit his relations soon after the restoration mr allestry was made a canon of christ church and readily concurred in repairing the injuries and decays that church and college had suffered during the usurpation at the same time he undertook one of the lectureships of the city of oxford with a view to instill principles of loyalty into the minds of the citizens yet he never received any part of the profits but constantly distributed it among the poor he took the degree of doctor of divinity on the  d of october    0 and was appointed one of the kings chaplains in ordinary and soon after upon a vacancy of the divinity chair he was chosen regis professor in      the king conferred upon dr allestry the provostship of eton college which he held to his death in      finding his health and particularly his sight much impaired he resigned the professorship of divinity and had the satisfaction to be succeeded therein by dr jane of whose abilities he had perfect knowledge and now the decay of his constitution terminating in a dropsy he removed to london to be nearer the advice of physicians but medicines proving ineffectual he died in january    0 and was buried in eton chapel under a monument of white marble we shall give his character from the account of his life contained in the preface to his sermons he was a considerable benefactor to eton college and raised the credit and reputation of the school which he found in a very low condition there are extant forty sermons of dr allestrys the greatest part of which were preached before the king and upon solemn occasions it is much to be regretted that he could not be prevailed upon to publish his lectures which when first delivered were heard with the greatest satisfaction and applause mr wood mentions a small tract written by dr

the republic of letters for his many and excellent writings he was born at alencon in the year      and having received an excellent education which highly improved his natural parts he became minister to a reformed church at rouen where he published many learned and curious pieces by which he acquired a great reputation he was called from rouen to charenton which was the principal reformed church in france the village in which it stood lying a little more than a league from paris we must therefore consider this removal as the highest testimony of respect his brethren could show him being now in the zenith of his preferment and in a condition to do good service to the church he applied himself to the task with the utmost zeal and preached many excellent sermons in defense of the faith against the archbishop of meaux who was then laboring to overturn the reformed religion by seeming concessions to its professors some of his sermons were afterward printed in holland and are

england here on account of his extensive learning and great knowledge of ecclesiastical history he met a very favorable reception he applied himself closely to learn the english language and soon attained to a surprising perfection as appeared by a book he published in defense of the christian religion which he dedicated to king james in very respectful terms acknowledging at the same time not only his personal obligations to that prince but also his kindness to the distressed refugees in general he was soon complimented with the degree of doctor in divinity and in    0 had the treasurership of the church of salisbury bestowed on him it was proposed he should have published an authentic history of the councils but this miscarried for want of encouragement he wrote however several treatises on ecclesiastical history equally learned and entertaining which were very useful to the protestant cause and attacked warmly both by the romish priests and princes these pieces

piece of great value with respect to hebrew literature he wrote likewise several other learned and ingenious treatises on curious and important subjects he continued for upwards of thirty years an active member of the republic of letters and an able and affectionate defender of the established church some of his pieces have been severely censured particularly by mr bail and his orthodoxy has by many been called in question our author however continued steady in his principles and was so well known to be a zealous defender of the church of england that mr whiston thought proper to consult him

consulted by the greatest men of the age and acknowledged as a man of the first abilities by the most esteemed critics his attention was given to the whole circle of sciences which fall under the cognizance of a scholar or divine all these he had well digested and his sermons evince him to be an admirable orator and a profound scholar the ancient authors which he published testify his skill in criticism and his perfect knowledge of antiquity his treatises on ecclesiastical history discover a prodigious fund of reading an exact comprehension of his subject and his sincere zeal for the protestant religion his thorough acquaintance with the hebrew and rabbinical learning was displayed in his laborious performance respecting the trinity our author continued his application to the last

particularly by his taste for letters he caused the best works of the greek philosophers to be translated into arabic and placed in his library which he had collected at a prodigious expense he loved learned men rewarded them well and was himself very learned he established a kind of academy at which he sometimes assisted himself whatever religion a man might profess provided he possessed talents almamoun was his friend this alarmed the narrow jealousy of the mussulmen doctors who for this liberality of disposition treated him as a heretic posterity however has done justice to his merit he died in      almanzor there have been many mahomedan princes of this name but the three who have most distinguished themselves are the following the first was king of cordova and died in  00  after having taken barcelona and made the christians in several rencounters feel the strength of his arms the second joseph almanzor was king of morocco and was defeated by the spaniards in      the third jacob almanzor son of joseph made himself master of morocco fez tremecen and tunis and gained the famous battle of alarcos in castile pope innocent iii addressed a brief to him in      to facilitate the redemption of some christian captives  almeida francis a portugueze and the first governor of india to which place he was dispatched in   0  by king emanuel with the high character of viceroy his fleet had a bad passage out and almost continual storm off the cape of good hope without being able to make it at la they reached quiloa the king of that place having given some cause to suspect his conduct almeida resolved to besiege the city when it wa high water he landed five hundred men on which the natives fled the portugueze entered and plundered it the plunder was however deposited in one house and shared among the soldiers almeida taking as hi own share only one arrow almeida then began to build a fort an offering the people the protection of the portugueze they accepted it and received a king from them who promised to be obedient to kin emanuel  from hence they sailed to mombassa and immediately attacked that place a shot from the portugueze set fire to the powder magazine which so terrified the inhabitants that they abandoned the fort having caused the port to be sounded and finding water sufficient he entered the harbor and then sent a message to require the king to submit himself to the king of portugal but the messenger was refused admittance almeida endeavored to seize some of the natives and took prisoner a domestic of the king from whom he had intelligence that the king had received into his pay  000 auxiliaries and expected more on this intelligence he resolved to besiege the place and set fire to a part of the city the natives attacked the portugueze although at the same time employed in extinguishing the flames which however proved their best friends and obliged the enemy to retire next day when the flames abated the portugueze again entered the city and were much annoyed by the narrowness of the streets and the darts of the enemy flung from the houses however almeida soon having secured the palace the portugueze joined their strength and obliged the natives to seek their safety by flight and make off to a wood to which the king had retreated the city was plundered but most of the valuable effects had been carried away the portugueze writers tell us they killed in this action   00 and took  000 prisoners with the loss only of five men killed and several wounded  from hence he sailed with his fleet for melinda but by tempestuous weather was driven three leagues beyond from thence they proceeded to the island of anchidive where he built a fort and sent some of his ships out to cruize here he received deputies from the king of onor to treat of peace and also the submission of a pyratical chief of the name of timoia however a circumstance soon happened to show the former was not sincere and the viceroy sailed to onor and burned some ships in the harbor a day or two after he sent his son to burn the other ships a smart action ensued and the portugueze were obliged to retreat almeida sailed next day to cananor where he found it necessary to build a strong fort to protect his countrymen against the arabians who jealous of the portugueze did them every injury in their power  while almeida remained here he had the happiness to receive an embassy from the king of narsinga offering friendship and his daughter as a wife for john the son of emanuel he had also a visit from the king of cananor from whom he obtained liberty to build his fort from this place he dispatched his son on an expedition to caulan  on the arrival of cugna with a reinforcement from portugal and  receiving intelligence of several arabian ships richly laden being in the port of panama about  0 miles off escorted by a fleet of ships of war of calicut he resolved to attack them in the harbor he sailed for that purpose with twelve ships of war on his passage he was informed that the ships were not yet afloat but lay in the docks under cover of a rampart and a strong garrison of  000 men almeida had only  00 and with these he resolved to attack the enemy he attempted to land and burn the ships and after a violent conflict succeeded a strong proof of the superiority of the portugueze at this time in war for the enemy sought with desperate courage there being many among them who had taken an oath to conquer or die these devotees had all their heads shaven and were destroyed to a man almeida having made good his landing advanced to the city and set it on fire being fearful of the consequences of permitting his men to plunder it the men murmured at being deprived of such a rich booty but this the viceroy disregarded and to keep them employed dispatched his son with a squadron to cruize against the arabians who in an engagement with the enemys fleet lost his life almeida who had often shown that he possessed great fortitude now gave a striking proof of it and those who lamented the death of young almeida with too much sorrow he told them that he had never wished a long but a glorious life for his son and for his part he thanked god for honoring him with so glorious a death  while he commanded in india albuquerque was making conquests for his country to the northward but as he did not act under almeidas instructions the latter was offended and even wrote to some of the enemys chiefs that albuquerque acted without his orders however the exploits of the latter drew the attention of the court of portugal and be was appointed to supersede almeida in his viceroyship when the order for the viceroys return was brought he was employed in fitting out a fleet to revenge the death of his son this furnished him with an excuse for not delivering up his government and he sailed on an expedition to dabul landed there defeated the enemy and made a most dreadful slaughter not sparing even the infants the next day the city was given up to be plundered and afterward burned this was the fate of many other places on these coasts he then cruized along the coast until he fell in with the enemys fleet engaged and totally defeated it killing  000 men the sultan had taken great pains in fitting out this fleet and it is supposed had engaged europeans of several nation to act on board it as books in the italian german french and spanish languages were found on board the captured ships this victory procured a peace  mean while a set of men who had their own advantage in vie inflamed the animosity between almeida and albuquerque and the former not only still refused to deliver up his government but ordered albuquerque to be confined but coutigna another commander arriving from portugal reconciled them to each other and almeida to the surrender of his government the viceroy immediately embarked and soon after saled for portugal unfortunately stopping at a place not far from the cape of good hope a slight quarrel arose between the portugueze and natives and in an action with them almeida received a wound in his throat with a javelin and died immediately thus expired this brave honest and renowned commander by his own imprudence before he went to india he had distinguished himself greatly in the wars of granada in india his exploits have been spoken of  as soon as he fell the rest of the portugueze fled two officers who saw him fall endeavored to persuade their countrymen to recover his body but finding entreaties ineffectual they rushed upon the enemy were soon overpowered by numbers and fell  almeida lawrence son of the former and who had he been blessed with longer life would probably have equalled him in same his first exploit was against culan in india whither he was dispatched by his father to destroy all the ships in that harbor he executed his orders with so much expedition that he came in sight of the town before they were apprized of his arrival and destroyed twentyseven ships soon after he was sent on a cruize against the maldive islands to intercept all arabian ships the strength of the currents in those seas drove him as far south as cape comorin and the island of ceylon and he put into a port in the latter the king hearing of his arrival and having before heard of the fame of the portugueze in those parts treated him with great respect and entered into a treaty by which he agreed to pay a yearly tribute to the king of portugal on condition of receiving protection and defense the tribute was to be   0000 pounds weight of innamon and the first years payment was immediately put on board on his return he was ordered to the anchidive islands when being informed of a large fleet fitting out at calicut lawrence immediately sailed to that place engaged it and after a fierce conflict gave them a total defeat he then returned to cananor where he was received by the king of that place who was a friend of the portugeze with great honor he afterward continued with his father until he sailed on the fatal expedition in which he lost his life he was dispatched with eight ships to annoy the arabians and at first was successful he put into the port of chaul a large and opulent ity adjoining to the kingdom of cambaya here he received advice that the sultan of egypt had fitted out a considerable force manned with his bravest soldiers it consisted of five large ships and six galleys to which the king of cambaya joined thirty sloops of war when they appeared off chaul the portugueze concluded they were the ships of albuquerque and made no preparation to engage the egyptian admiral entered the river but his allies remained out at sea  the next day lawrence almeida weighed anchor and attacked the admirals ship in this action almeida was wounded his officers finding they were becalmed and could not come to close quarters with the enemy advised him to return this he declined and soon received another desperate wound in the face with a dart the action continued at a distance almeida not being able to get near his enemy other captains were more fortunate they boarded and took two ships the next day the fleet from sea came in and joined the enemy the portugueze held a council and were almost unanimously of opinion that they ought to put to sea in the night this they endeavored to effect but the enemy pursued and came up with the admirals ship which was in the rear and surrounded her an unfortunate shot rendering it impossible to steer her she ran aground the portugueze captains had a strong desire to assist their admiral but the violence of the tide prevented them however they sent a boat to bring almeida away but he refused to quit his fellow soldiers in this distress hoping also that he should be able to defend himself until the tide returned the enemy did not dare to board his vessel but continued a fierce cannonade at a distance which was returned with spirit almeida at last received another wound in his thigh which quite disabled him but being placed in a chair which was lashed to the mast he still continued to animate his men until a shot in the breast killed him the portugueze on board this unfortunate ship were now reduced to twenty who still continued to defend themselves but the enemy attempting to board her succeeded much to their honor they treated the few brave survivors with great humanity  almeloveen thomas jansson d there were two literati of this name the first a dutch physician wh flourished in the latter end of the last century and has given a description of the plants on the coast of malabar in the hortus malabaricus published at amsterdam in      and the following years and also the flora malabarica in      the other was professor of history the greek language and physic at harderwicke and died at amsterdam in      he has left us some commentaries on many authors of antiquity and other works  almarus elmarus elmerus or aelmerus was abbot of the monastery of saint austin in canterbury at the time when alphage the archbishop was barbarously murdered by the danes in  0   almarus was suffered by those plunderers to go at liberty and in the year  0   was made bishop of sherborne in dorsetshire which bishopric was afterward translated to salisbury goodwin mentions him as a bishop but declares that he knows nothing of him but his name almarus was not inclined either to leave his abbey or to become a bishop but was however at last prevailed on to take upon him that dignity which he discharged with great constancy and vigor until he became quite blind on this he resigned his bishopric with more alacrity than he had accepted it returning back to his abbey where he lived in a cell in the infirmary in great innocence and devotion to his last hour when he was near his death he directed that he should be buried not as a bishop but as a monk which was complied with he was interred in the church of the monastery before the altar of saint john and his memory held in great veneration  aloadin commonly called the old man of the mountain prince of the arsacides or assassins from whence our word assassin or murderer is said to be derived he lived between antioch and damascus in a castle where he bred up a number of young people in all sorts of pleasures telling them that after their death if they obeyed him in all he commanded them they should be transported to the most delicious abodes these unhappy beings were so much devoted to this wretch that they blindly obeyed him and went with the greatest alacrity to execute such sentences of death as he chose to pronounce against the princes who were his enemies they seldom missed their blow and the kings were very careful not to offend him he and his subjects professed mahomedanism  alphery mikipher born in russia and of the imperial line when that country was torn to pieces by intestine quarrels in the latter end of the sixteenth century and the royal house particularly was so severely persecuted by impostors this gentleman and his two brothers were sent over to england and recommended to the care of mr biddell a russia merchant when of age for the university mr biddell sent the three brothers to oxford where the smallpox unhappily prevailing two of them died of it we know not if this surviving brother took any degrees or not but it is probable he did since he entered into holy orders and in the year      had the rectory of wooley in huntingdonshire here he performed his duty with great cheerfulness and alacrity and notwithstanding he was twice invited back to his native country by some who would have ventured their utmost to have placed him on the throne of russia yet he preferred remaining with his flock and serving god in the humble station of a parish priest yet in      he underwent the severest trials from the rage of the fanatics who not satisfied with depriving him of his living insulted him in a most barbarous manner and having sent a file of musketeers to pull him out of the pulpit as he was preaching on sunday they turned his wife and children out of doors and threw his goods into the street in this distress he raised a tent under some tree in the churchyard near his house where he and his family lived for a week one day having procured a few eggs and picked up some rotten wood and dried sticks with which he made a fire in the church porch to boil them his implacable adversaries came and kicked out his fire and destroyed his eggs after this as he still possessed a little property he made a small purchase in that neighborhood built a house and lived there for some years he was enabled to do this in some degree by the presbyterian minister who succeeded him who honestly paid him a fifth part of the income of the living being the allowance made by parliament to ejected ministers treated him with great humanity and did him all the services in his power it is a pity this mans name is not preserved his conduct in this respect being more laudable as it was singular afterward probably on the death or removal of this gentleman mr alphery left huntingdonshire and resided at hammersmith until by the restoration he was restored to his living he then returned to huntingdonshire where he did not remain long for being then near eighty years of age and very infirm he could not perform the duty of his function he therefore appointed a curate and returned to his sons house at hammersmith where he shortly after died full of years and honor the life of this worthy man does not admit of variety to form a very entertaining article of biography but the singular circumstance of a foreign prince being a country minister in england is too remarkable an event to be omitted  alphonsus x king of leon and castile surnamed the wife was author of the astronomical tables called alphosn reading of quintus curtius gave him such delight that it recovered him out of a dangerous illness he read the bible fourteen times with several comments on it he is said to have found fault with the structure of the mundane system and has been charged with impiety on that score but unjustly for he only found fault with the involved system of some astronomers he was dethroned by his son sancho and soon afterward died of grief a d       alpini prospero a famous physician and botanist born in the venetian territory in      he traveled in egypt to acquire a knowledge of exotic plants and was the first who explained the fructisication and generation of plants by the sexual system upon his return to venice in      andrea doria prince of melfi appointed him his physician and he distinguished himself so much in this capacity that he was esteemed the first physician of his age the republic of venice began to be uneasy that a subject of theirs of so great merit as alpini should continue at genoa when he might be of so much service and honor to their state they therefore recalled him in      to fill the professorship of botany at padua and he had a salary of  00 florins which was afterward raised to   0 he discharged this office with great reputation but his health became very precarious having been much broke by the voyages he had made according to the register of the university of padua he died the  th of february      in the   th year of his age and was buried the day after without any funeral pomp in the church of st anthony  alpini wrote the following works in latin   of the physic of the egyptians in four books printed at venice      in quarto   a treatise concerning the

english historian he is said to have had his education in the university of cambridge where he acquired not only great skill in divinity but also became a good philosopher and historian he returned afterward into his native country yorkshire where he became a secular priest one of the cnons and treasurers of the church of st john of beverly some historians positively affirm that he flourished under king stephen and continued his annals to the year      but others with more appearance of truth tell us that he flourished under henry i and died in the year      in which year they assert that he ended his annals his history however contradicts this as it is continued to the twentyninth of henry i consequently he died in      or   his preface to his work informs us that he was a man devoted to his studies and rather in narrow circumstances he intended at first no more than an abridgement of the history of the ancient britons but when he had gone thus far a desire of pursuing the thread of his story led him to add the saxon and then the norman history down to his own time this was the only piece he wrote notwithstanding the assertions of several great men this abridgement of our history from brutus to henry i is one of the most valuable pieces that has escaped the rage of time it is written in a concise elegant latin style with great perspicuity and a more than ordinary attention to dates and authorities he may with great propriety be called the english florus his plan being nearly the same and equally happy in the execution it seems wonderful that leland does not give him a place among our english writers as it is clear he had seen our authors history the reason seems to have been that leland considered him only as the author of an abridgement of jeffery of monmouths history in this he was mistaken for our author is by no means a mere transcriber of the british history but went much further than the author he is said to have copied besides it is doubtful whether he ever saw jeffery of monmouths history if he had it is difficult to assign a reason why he did not mention the author as he is very exact in other places if he had really been jeffery of monmouths translator why should he have concealed it  the mss of his work are very scarce and very few who mention it have seen it mr josselin in his catalogue of english historians assures us the ms was in the hands of mr nettleton the ms from whence mr hearne published it at oxford in      belonged to t rawlinson esquire and mr hearne acknowledges it was the only one he ever saw he calls it the annals of alured of beverly which as the dates are constantly preserved it may with propriety be called john withamsted a very ancient writer speaking of our author says that he wrote a chronicle of what happened from the settlement of brutus to the time of the normans this authority is much to the honor of our historian for withamsted was a critic this work therefore and the history of st john of beverly are all that fall from our authors pen the history of st john of beverly is in being in the cotton library but it appears by the title to be a collection of records rather than a history  mr hearne has added some notes to his edition and a preface wherein he endeavors to vindicate our author from the charge of plagiarism and we may affirm that if any epitome of english history deserved well of the public in general we would say this history of altedus is it for in point of accuracy and elegance he is superior to huntingdon hovedon malmsbury and others  alsop anthony was educated at westminsterschool and from thence elected to christ church oxford where he took the degree of m a in march    0 and b d in december   0  on his coming to the university he was soon distinguished by

care his merit recommended him to sir jonathan trelawney bishop of winchester who appointed him his chaplain and soon after made him a prebend in his own cathedral and rector of brightwell in the county of berks these promotions afforded him ample provision for a learned retirement from which he could not be drawn by the repeated solicitations of those who judged him qualified for a more public character and a higher station in      an action was brought against him by mrs astrey of oxford for a breach of a marriage contract and a verdict obtained against him for  000l which probably occasioned him to leave the kingdom for some time his death which happened june  0      was occasioned by falling into a ditch that led to his garden door a quarto volume was published under the title

convert to his principles he received ordination in the presbyterian way not being satisfied with that of the bishop he settled at wilbee in the county of northampton whence he was ejected in      for nonconformity after which he ventured to preach sometimes at oakham and at wellingborough where he lived and was once committed to prison for six months for praying with a sick person a book he wrote against dr sherlock in a humorous style made him known to the world and induced mr cawton an eminent nonconformist in westminster to recommend him to his congregation as his successor on receiving this invitation he quitted northampton and came to london where he preached constantly and wrote several pieces which were extremely well received by the public his living in the neighborhood of the court exposed him to many inconveniences however he had the good fortune to escape imprisonment and fines by an odd accident the informers not knowing his christian name which he studiously concealed his sufferings however ended with the reign of charles ii at least in the beginning of the next reign when his son engaging in treasonable practices was freely pardoned by king james after this mr alsop went frequently to court and is generally supposed to have been the person who drew up the presbyterians address to that prince for his general indulgence after the revolution mr alsop gave very public testimonies of his affection for the government but on all occasions spoke in the highest terms of respect and gratitude of king james and retained a very high sense of his clemency in sparing his only son the remainder of his life he spent in the exercise of the ministry preaching once every lords day besides which he had a thursday lecture and assisted at pinners hall he lived to be a

amauri the first of this name king of jerusalem in      after the death of baldwin iii his brother when he succeeded him he was a young man of twentyseven years of age who possessed many good qualities and some great faults avarice induced him to undertake a war against egypt which was fortunate in the beginning but very destructive in the end he drove gyraco twice out of egypt took damietta and might have taken cairo with the same facility if the fear that his army would have taken to themselves the plunder of that city had not induced him to attend to the sultans proposals the mahomedan general informed of amauris mean passion amused him so long under pretense of collecting two millions of gold for him that he gained time for the army of noradin to arrive who forced him to raise the siege amauri was obliged to return home with the shame of having lost his trouble his honor and the tribute the egyptians had paid him saladin successor and nephew to gyraco united with noradin and pressed the christians vigorously amauri neglected nothing to break their measures and supported by a powerful fleet belonging to the greek emperor he laid siege to damietta but heavy rains and a famine compelled him to raise the siege meantime saladin entered palestine took gaza and committed horrible ravages while noradin was doing the same at antioch amauri who was opposing with an invincible courage the efforts of so many enemies was taken out of the world the   th july      in the   th year of his age the second amauri de lusignan king of cyprus succeeded guy his brother as king of jerusalem in      isabella second daughter of amauri i disputed with him the title of king of jerusalem which her third husband henry ii earl of champagne assumed but henry dying in      of a

abortive he died in   0  having in vain implored the succor of the princes of europe  amauri de chartres a clergyman a native of bonne a village in the diocese of chartres professed philosophy with distinction about the middle of the thirteenth century adopting the metaphysics of aristotle led him into dangerous errors he formed to himself a new system of religion which according to the abbe pluguet he thus explained aristotle supposes that all beings are composed of matter which has in itself neither form nor shape this he calls the first matter this amauri called god because it is a necessary and infinite being he acknowledged in god three persons father son and holy ghost to whom he attributed the empire of the world and whom he regarded as the object of religious worship but as this matter was endowed with a property of continual motion it necessarily followed that this world must some time have an end and that all the beings therein must return to that first matter which was the supreme of all beings  the first existing and the only one eternal religion according to amauris opinion had three epochas which bore a similitude to the reign of the three persons in the trinity the reign of god had existed as long as the law of moses the reign of the son would not always last the ceremonies and sacrifices which according to amauri constituted the essence of it would not be eternal a time would come when the sacraments should cease and then the religion of the holy ghost would begin in which men would have no need of sacraments and would render a spiritual worship to the supreme being this epoch was the reign of the holy ghost which according to amauri was foretold by the scripture and which would succeed to the christian religion as the christian religon had succeeded to that of moses the christian religion therefore was the reign of jesus christ in the world and every man under that law ought to look on himself as one of the members of jesus christ amauri had many proselytes and his opinions were condemned by pope innocent iii his disciples added other extravagances as that the sacraments were useless and that no action dictated by charity could be bad they were condemned by the council of paris in   0  and many of them burned amauri appealed to the pope who also condemned his doctrines for fear of a rigorous punishment he retracted his opinions retired to st martin des champs and died there of chagrin and disappointment dizant was his chief disciple  amboise george d of the illustrious house of amboise in france so called from their possessing the seignory of that name was born in    0 being destined at a very early age for the church he was elected bishop of montauban when only fourteen he was afterward made one of the almoners to lewis xi to whom he behaved with great prudence after the death of this prince in    0 he entered into some of the intrigues of the court with a design to favor the duke of orleans with whom he was closely connected but those intrigues being discovered damboise and his protector were both imprisoned the duke of orleans was at last restored to his liberty and this prince having negociated the marriage of the king with the princess anne of britanny acquired great reputation and credit at court of this his favorite damboise felt the happy effects for soon after the archbishopric of narbonne was bestowed on him but as that was at too great a distance from the court he changed it for that of rouen to which a chapter elected him in      as soon as he had taken possession of his new see the duke of orleans who was governor of normandy made him lieutenant general with the same power as if he had been governor in chief this province was at that time in great disorder the noblesse oppressed the people the judges were all corrupted or intimidated the soldiers who had been licentious since the late wars infested the high ways plundering and assassinating all travelers they met but in less than a year damboise by his care and prudence established public tranquillity in the province committed to his care the king dying in      the duke of orleans ascended the throne by the name of lewis xii and damboise became his prime minister by his first operation in that office he conciliated the affection of the whole nation it had been a custom when a new monarch ascended the throne to lay an extraordinary tax on the people to defray the expenses of the coronation but by the counsel of damboise this tax was not levied and the imposts were soon reduced one tenth his virtues coinciding with his knowledge he made the french nation happy and endeavored to preserve the glory they had acquired by his advice lewis xii undertook the conquest of the milanese in      lewis the moor uncle and vassal of maximilian was then in possession of that province i revolted soon after the conquest but damboise brought it back to its duty some time after he was received at paris with great magnificence in quality of legate from the pope during his legation he labored to reform many of the religious orders as the jacobins the coreliers and those of saint germain des pres his disinterest edness was equal to his zeal he never possessed more than one benefice two thirds of which he employed for the relief of the poor an the support of the churches contenting himself with his archbishopri of rouen and his cardinals hat he was not like his cotemporarie desirous to add abbeys to it a gentleman of normandy having offered to sell him an estate at a very low price in order to portion b daughter he made him a present of a sum sufficient for that purpos and left him the estate he obtained the purple after the dissolution o the marriage between lewis xii and joan of france to which he greatly contributed and after he had procured for caesar borgia son of pope alexander the vi the duchy of valentinois with a considerable pension his ambition was to be pope but he said only with a view to labor at the reform of abuses and the correction of manners after the death of pius iii he might have succeeded in his wishes if he had possessed as much cunning as the italian cardinals he took measures to procure the tiara but cardinal julian de rovera afterward julius ii found means to circumvent him the venetians had contributed greatly to his exclusion he therefore took the first opportunity to excite lewis xii to make war on them this celebrated cardinal died in    0 in the convent of the celestines at lions of the gout in his stomach aged  0 years they say that he often repeated to the friar who attended him in his illness  brother john why have i not during my whole life been brother john this minister has been greatly praised for having labored for the happiness of france but he has been much censured for having advised his master to sign the treaty of blois in   0  by which france ran the risk of being dismembered he governed both the king and the state laborious kind honest he possessed good sense firmness and experience but he was not a great genius nor were his views extensive the desire he had to ease the people in their taxes procured him during his life but much more after his death the title of father of the people he merited this title still more by the care he took to reform the administration of justice most of the judges were venal and permitted themselves either to be corrupted or intimidated the poor and those who had no support could never obtain justice when their opposers were either powerful or rich another evil not less enormous troubled the kingdom lawsuits were spun out to such a length were so expensive and accompanied by so much trick and chicanery that most people rather chose to abandon their right than engage in the recovery of them by suits which had no prospect of coming to an end damboise resolved to remedy this abuse he called to his assistance many lawyers and civilians the most learned and of the greatest integrity and charged them to form a plan by which justice might be administered without partiality the duration of lawsuits abridged and rendered less ruinous and also to prevent the corruption of the judges when these commissioners had made their report damboise undertook the laborious task of examining into the changes they had proposed in the old laws and the new regulations they designed to establish and after having made some changes these new regulations were published throughout the kingdom as he was governor of normandy he made a progress through that province for the express purpose of seeing his new code properly established  there were several other distinguished men of this name as aimery damboise a brother of the former who was grand master of the order of st john of jerusalem the great naval victory he obtained over the sultan of egypt near montenegro in    0 made his name celebrated not only among his own order but throughout europe he died about two years after abbe vertot has drawn his character as a wise prince able in government and happy in all his enterprises who enriched his order with the spoils of the infidels without appropriating any to himself   francis damboise surgeon to charles ix of france who died about the year    0 he is said to have been the editor of abelards works in quarto in      and the author of a lively comedy called les neapolitains   adrian damboise brother of the latter who was author of a tragedy called holoferne   james damboise a doctor of physic and rector of the university of paris was brother to the two last under his rectorate the university of paris swore allegiance to henry iv   michel damboise sieur de chevillon a natural son of michel damboise admiral of france whose family reared and supported him he was alive in      and there are still many poems from his pen extant  ambrose st one of the most eminent fathers of the christian church in the fourth century born in gaul while his father was praefectus praetorio of that province the birth of saint ambrose is said to have been followed with a remarkable presage of his future eloquence for we are told that a swarm of bees came and settled upon his mouth as he lay in his cradle he soon made himself master of several parts of secular learning and pleaded causes before probus with so much eloquence that he was appointed his successor and soon after governor of the provinces of liguria and emilia he settled at milan where in the year     upon the death of auxentius bishop of that city there being a great contest between the catholics and arians concerning the choice of a new bishop ambrose thought it his duty as governor to go to church in order to compose the tumult he accordingly addressed himself to the people in a gentle pathetic speech exhorting them to proceed in their choice in a calm and friendly manner while he was speaking to them the whole assembly cried out let ambrose be bishop such a sudden and unexpected incident surprised him exceedingly so that he retired immediately and used every method to divert them from their resolution of choosing him but at last he was obliged to comply and was baptized being before only a catechumen and ordained bishop toward the latter end of the year     about the year     the barbarous nations making an incursion into the roman empire he fled to illyricum and afterward to rome in the year     he was sent to the tyrant maximus who had usurped the empire and prevailed upon him not to pass into italy the heathens encouraged by these intestine commotions in the empire attempted to restore their religion and employed aurelius symmachus a man of great eloquence to plead their cause but symmachus having lost his cause was expelled the city and commanded not to approach within an hundred miles of it the petition which he presented to the emperor valentinian the younger is still extant st ambrose wrote a confutation of this petition st ambrose met with great opposition from the arians against whom he acted with great spirit and intrepidity justinia the empress and mother of valentinian who was an arian and desirous to restore that religion in milan demanded of st ambrose one of the churches there which he refused and the people taking his part she was obliged to desist and even to ask his interest with the people to pacify them  ambrose was sent a second time to the tyrant maximus for valentinian found no person so proper to negociate with him he spoke to him with great courage and boldness but could obtain nothing for maximus soon after marched into italy and made himself master of the western empire so that valentinian was obliged to retire with his mother justinia and his sister galla to thessalonica in illyricum in order to desire theodosiuss assistance who defeated maximus and restored valentinian to the empire  while theodosius continued in italy after the defeat of maximus an insurrection happened at thessalonica in which several of the magistrates were stoned and their bodies dragged along the streets theodosius being informed of this rashly commanded a certain number to be put to death promiscuously by which means the city was filled with the blood of many innocent persons and amongst the rest several strangers who had but just come there no regard was paid to any distinction of persons no form of trial was observed but they were cut down like corn in the harvest as theodoret expresses it to the number of  000 at this time an assembly of bishops was held at milan who all expressed an abhorrence of such cruelty in the emperor ambrose wrote a letter to him in which he represented the enormity of his crime and exhorted him to make satisfaction by a sincere submission and repentance some time after theodosius coming to milan went to receive the sacrament at the great church where ambrose meeting him at the door denied him entrance and represented his guilt in the most forcible and pathetic terms the emperor was struck with his words and with great uneasiness of mind returned to his palace but about a year after ambrose being convinced of the sincerity of his repentance admitted him into the church in     valentinian the emperor being assassinated by the contrivance of argobastes and eugenius usurping the empire ambrose was obliged to leave milan but he returned the year following after eugenius was defeated  he died at milan the  th of april     being    years of age according to m du pin and some other writers but dr cave and olearius say that he was    years old at his death he was buried in the great church at milan he wrote several works the most considerable of which is that de officiis he is concise and sententious in his manner of writing and full of turns of wit his terms are well chosen and his expressions noble he diversifies his subject by an admirable copiousness of thoughts and language he is very ingenious in giving an easy and natural turn to every thing which he treats of and is not without strength and pathos when there is occasion for it this is the character which du pin gives him as a writer but erasmus observes that he has many quaint and affected sentences and frequently very obscure ones and it is certain that his writings are intermixed with many strange and peculiar opinions paulinus wrote his life and dedicated it to st augustine this life is prefixed to st ambroses works the best edition of which is reckoned to be that published by the benedictine monks in two volumes in folio at paris in      and    0  ambrose isaac a noted presbyterian teacher in the times of the usurpation he was son of a clergyman and descended from the ambroses of ambrosehall in lancashire in the beginning of the year      he was admitted a bachelor of brazennose college in oxford where he took the degree of bachelor of arts afterward he went into holy orders and officiated in some little cure in his own county being in very low circumstances he was often obliged to the bounty of william earl of bedford for the relief of himself and family mr wood thinks that lord procured him to be inserted in the list of his majestys preachers appointed for the county of lancaster afterward when the times changed in      he left the church of england and went over to the presbyterian party took the covenant and became a preacher at garstang and afterward at preston in his own county he was very zealous and very active against the clergy of the established church especially after he was appointed assistant to the commissioners for ejecting such whom they called scandalous and ignorant ministers and schoolmasters it is said that he died of an apoplexy he wrote several pieces as   prima media and ultima   looking upon jesus   war with angels  ambrosius aurelianus or aurelius a celebrated general of the ancient britons and afterward king was of roman extraction and commonly supposed to be the son of one of their kings elected by the britons after the romans had left the island he was educated at the court of aldroen king of armorica who at the request of the britons sent him with an army to assist against the saxons whom vortigern their king had invited into britain ambrosiuss success against the saxons was so considerable that the britons chose him for their king obliging vortigern to yield to him all the western part of the kingdom divided by the roman highway called watlingstreet some time after the britons being discontented with vortigern and having withdrawn their allegiance from him that unhappy prince retired into wales where being besieged by ambrosius and the castle taking fire he perished in the flames and left his rival sole monarch of britain he now took upon him the imperial purple after the manner of the roman emperors geoffrey of monmouth asserts that he built stonehenge near salisbury in memory of three hundred british lords who were massacred by the saxon general hengist ambrosius distinguished himself highly by his valor and conduct against the enemies of his country and took occasion to regulate the affairs of the church which were then in great disorder occasioned by those wars the monmouth historian gives this prince a very advantageous character and tells us he was poisoned at winchester by one eopa a saxon disguised as a physician and hired for that purpose by pascentius one of the sons of vortigern but the generally received opinion is that he was killed in a battle anno  0  against the saxons a modern antiquary mr whitaker has shown and with a great degree of probability that ambrosius was the pendragon or rex maximus of the british provinces and chief of the damnarii  ames william a divine in the reign of king james and king charles i famous for his casuistical and controversial writings but much more abroad than in his native country for he lived many years in foreign parts and there ended his days he was descended from the ancient family of that name which remains in norfolk and somersetshire and was born in the year      he was educated at christs college in cambridge under the famous mr william perkins from whom probably imbibing some calvinistical tenets he afterward distinguished himself in maintaining the same and gave great disgust to certain persons in that university one instance of this is mentioned by dr fuller who informs us that mr ames preaching at st marys took occasion to inveigh against the liberty taken at that time and proceeded to condemn all playing t dice his sermon gave much offense it is not improbable but that upon archbishop bancroft pressing conformity on the puritans many of them retired into the low countries where english churches were erected after the presbyterian model and maintained by the states according to the treaty with queen elizabeth as the french and dutch churches were in england mr ames soon after went to the hague and from thence was invited by the states of friesland to the divinity chair in the university of franeker which he filled with reputation for many years he was at the synod of dort in      and informed king jamess ambassador from time to time of their debates he resigned his professorship at franeker after having had it twelve years and accepted an invitation to the english congregation at rotterdam during this time he was very popular and published several things after his removal to rotterdam he wrote a book called a fresh suit against ceremonies but he lived not to publish it for his constitution was so shattered that the air of holland did him no service an asthma put an end to his life in the beginning of the winter      at rotterdam his wife and children embarked soon after for new england and carried with them his library of books a very valuable present to the colony  americus vesputius born at florence of a very ancient family in      he discovered very early a taste for philosophy mathematics and seavoyages as soon as he was informed of columbuss return from the discovery of the west indies he burned with impatience to be partaker of his glory he applied to ferdinand king of spain who supplied him with four ships with which he departed from cadiz in      he fell in with the coast of paria and ran along it and also the coast of terra firma as far as the gulf of mexico returning to spain in about eighteen months he did not dispute with columbus the glory of having discovered the west india islands but pretended that he first discovered the continent of america for this the spanish writers are very severe and charge him with having falsified dates to support his claim a year after his first voyage vesputius performed a second with six ships still under the auspices of ferdinand and isabella in this voyage he proceeded to the antilla islands and from thence to the coast of guiana and vennezuela and returned safe to cadiz in the month of november   00 bringing with him many valuable stones and other commodities he met with but a cool reception from the spaniards for all his services and their ingratitude sensibly affected him emanuel king of portugal jealous of the success of the catholic sovereign had taken great pains to share in the new discoveries and being informed of vesputiuss disconnt invited him to portugal and gave him the command of three ships to undertake a third voyage on discovery vesputius sailed from lisbon in may   0  he ran down the coast of africa as far as sierra leon and the coast of angola he then stood over for the coast of america and fell in with brazil which he discovered entirely south as far as patagonia and north to the river of plata this illustrious navigator then sailed back to sierra leon and keeping along the coast of guinea returned to portugal arriving at lisbon in september   0  king emanuel highly satisfied with this success equipped six ships with which our navigator made a fourth voyage in this voyage he designed to stand along the coast of america to the south until he discovered a passage to the molucca islands to the westward he ran along the coast from the bay of all saints as far as the river of curabado but having only provisions for twenty months and being detained on the coast he had discovered five months by contrary winds he returned to portugal americus died at the island of tercera in      leaving his name to half the globe a celebrated author speaking of these voyages says that in the eighth and ninth centuries the barbarians attacked the cultivated nations but now the latter in their turn crossed the atlantic to make war on the barbarians americus has left us relations of his four voyages in which he has described the original inhabitants of america in lively colors the king of portugal caused some remains of his ship the victory to be preserved in the metropolitan church of lisbon  amelot de la hensaye abr nicholas was born at orleans in      and died at paris   0  in a state but little above indigence he was a man of a rough and austere temper but is well known for his political talents he was bred under the president of saint andre who was the french ambassador at venice and took him as his secretary we have still many of his works extant among which the most distinguished are   his translation of father pauls history of the council of trent in great reputation before courayers appeared this work made him many enemies who propagated calumnies against him   the prince of machiavel in this he endeavors to clear his author from the reproaches which have been cast on him as an encourager of assassination and poisoning   a version of balth gratians man of the court with moral and political remarks   the annals of tacitus dry and plain but esteemed for the political notes with which he has overwhelmed as it were his author to these fr bruyere has added six volumes but very inferior to the former   the history of the government of venice with an inquiry respecting the original liberty of venice translated from the italian this history compiled with truth gave offense to the state of venice who complained to the court of france and it is said that the author was for some time shut up in the bastile   the morality of tacitus extracted from his annals this work is still in much esteem amelot had meditated much on this writer but if this study formed his genius to politics it did not contribute to the smoothness of his style some other works of his are still extant but of little note  amhurst nicholas a man who has been greatly distinguished as a poet and a poetical writer of the present century was so much talked of for a time and so closely connected with the leaders of the grand opposition to sir robert walpoles administration that although we have but few materials with regard to the circumstances of his life he cannot be entirely omitted he was born at marden in kent but in what year is uncertain under the protection and care of his grandfather who was a clergyman he received his grammatical education at merchanttaylors school in london and from thence was removed to st johns college oxford where his behavior was such as occasioned his expulsion what the particular and specific charges against him were we are not informed but in general he is said to have been expelled for the libertinism of his principles the irregularity of his conduct and some offense which he had given to the heads of the college from his own account of the matter in the dedication of his poems to dr delaune president of st johns and in his terrae filius we may collect that he wished to have it understood he was solely persecuted for the liberality of his sentiments and his attachment to the cause of the revolution and of the hanover succession but he had probably been guilty of real misbehaviour whatever were the causes of his expulsion his resentment on the account of it was very great he made it therefore his business to fatirize the learning and discipline of the university of oxford and to expose the characters of several gentlemen who were deemed a part of its most respectable members this he did in a poem which he called oculus britanniae and again in his terrae filius a work in which there is a considerable portion of wit intermixed with much abuse and scurrility soon after mr amhurst quitted oxford he seems to have settled in london as a writer by profession he published a volume of miscellanies which had principally been written at the university the miscellanies are upon a variety of subjects both sacred and profane they are partly originals and partly paraphrases imitations and translations and consist of tales epigrams epistles love verses elegies and satires they begin with a beautiful paraphrase on the mosaic account of the creation and with a very humorous tale on the discovery of that useful utensil a bottlescrew mr amhurst was the author likewise of an epistle to sir john blount bart one of the south sea company in    0 of the british general a poem sacred to the memory of his grace john duke of marlborough and of strephons revenge a satire on the oxford toasts our poet who had a great enmity to the exorbitant demands and domineering spirit of the high church clergy and who had early at oxford displayed his zeal against priestly power discovered this particularly in a poem entitled the convocation in five cantos which is a kind of satire against all the writers who had opposed the bishop hoadley in the famous bangorian controversy he translated also mr addisons resurrection and some other of his latin poems but his principal literary undertaking was conducting the celebrated political paper called the craftsman which was written against sir robert walpoles ministry and was carried on for a number of years with great spirit and success  this paper was more read and attended to than any production of the kind which had hitherto been published in england ten or twelve thousand were sold in a day and the effect which it had in raising the indignation of the people and in controlling the power of administration was very considerable this effect was not entirely or chiefly owing to the abilities of mr amhurst he was assisted by lord bolinbroke and mr pulteney and probably by other leaders of the opposition their fame and their writings were the grand support of the craftsman nevertheless mr amhursts own papers are allowed to have been composed with ability and spirit and he conducted the craftsman in the very zenith of its prosperity with no small reputation to himself on the  d of july      there appeared in that publication an ironical letter written in the name of colley cibber the design of which was to ridicule the act which had just passed for licensing plays in this letter the laureat proposes himself to the lord chamberlain to be made superintendant of the old plays as standing equally in need of correction with the new ones and produces several passages from shakespeare and other poets in relation to kings queens princes and ministers of state which he says are now fit to be brought on the stage the printer etc having been taken up by order of government mr amhurst voluntarily surrendered himself in their stead and after having been kept in custody ten days was obliged to bring his habeas corpus for his liberty before he could obtain it because he refused to give bail for his good behavior as well as his appearance the ministry we believe prudently dropped the prosecution notwithstanding mr amhursts merit with his party he was totally neglected by them when they made their terms with the crown and he died soon after of a fever at twickenham his death happened on the   th of april      his disorder was probably occasioned in a great measure by the ill usage he had received mr ralph in his case of authors speaks with a just feeling and indignation upon the subject poor amhurst after having been the drudge of his party for the best part of twenty years was as much forgotten in the famous compromise of      as if he had never been born and died of what is called a broken heart which happened a few months afterward he was indebted to the charity of a bookseller for a grave not to be traced now because then no otherwise to be distinguished than by the freshness of a turf borrowed from the next common to cover it a very late writer in the character of mr pulteney expresses himself concerning the treatment of mr amhurst in the following terms but if the earl of bath had his list of pensioners how comes it that amhurst was forgotten the fate of this poor man is singular he was the able associate of bolinbroke and pulteney in writing the celebrated weekly paper called the craftsman his abilities were unquestionable he had almost as much wit learning and various knowledge as his two partners and when these great masters chose not to appear in public themselves he supplied their

see and collector general of this kingdom being a man of singular genius and learning he soon became acquainted with the principal literati of those times particularly with erasmus colet grocin and others for the sake of whose company he resided some time at oxford the advice which erasmus gives him in regard to pushing his fortune has a good deal of humor in it and was certainly intended as a satire on the artful methods generally practiced by the selfish and ambitious part of mankind in the first place says he throw off all sense of shame thrust yourself into every ones business and elbow out whomsoever you can neither love nor hate any one measure every thing by your own advantage let this be the scope and drift of all your actions give nothing but what is to be returned with usury

england he drew his first breath at taunton in somersetshire where his father was a grocer and eminently conspicuous for piety and benevolence the son early distinguished himself by a religious turn of mind and by his inclination to literary pursuits he learned the classics at his native town under mr chadwik a dissenting clergyman from taunton he was removed to exeter for instruction in the french language which when he had obtained he returned again to mr chadwick at lady day      he with his schoolfellow mr towgood who has since made so distinguished a figure among the dissenters were put under mr james and mr grove who had been long employed before the schism bill in educating young men for the ministry but had desisted from that employment until george the first was firmly established on the throne under these gentlemen mr amory went through his learning and in      was examined and approved of as a candidate for the ministry the usual examination for the dissenting ministers is to deliver a sermon maintain a thesis and submit to such other exercises as are thought proper but our student being desirous of further improvement removed to london and attended a course of experimental philosophy he afterward returned to taunton and preached at several places in the neighborhood until upon the death of mr james in      mr amory was fixed as an assistant

the gentlemen and clergy of the established church he was honored when very young with the friendship of the celebrated mrs row and held a correspondence with her  his conduct in a dispute which the baptist society in taunton had with their pastor reflects high honor upon him they offered to quit their minister and join mr amory but he dissuaded them from it as it would bring a scandal upon them in      he was induced to quit taunton and remove to london to assist as afternoon preacher at the meeting in the old jury belonging to the learned dr chandler hi motive in quitting his old flock was to have a better opportunity to provide for his children in this station he did not shine as a preacher his sermons although good did not strike the generality of his hearers and he was too liberal in his sentiments to please the bigots and enthusiasts he had however the happiness to possess the esteem of the most judicious part of the dissenters in      he was chosen one of the trustees to dr williams charities and next year the university of edinburgh conferred on him the degree of doctor in divinity and the same year he was elected a lecturer at salters hall he had been some time before

obedience we owe him the evidences of a future state the excellency of the gospel and the duties of a christian life he seldom entered on any disputed point if he did it was to expose calvinism of which he much disapproved his sentiments of religion coincided with dr samuel clarke his learning was solid and extensive he diligently studied the scripture and was well acquainted with theology ethics experimental philosophy and the writings of the ancients the following is an account of his works    a letter to a friend published in the literary journal         a dialogue on devotion after the manner of xenophon    forms of devotion for the closet  vo         an account of the life of dr groves from which the life in the biographia britannica is taken    a preface to dr grovess sermons in      he published a collection of mr grovess sermons and in      he published in two volumes  vo from an unfinished manuscript mr grovess system of moral philosophy he also wrote the life of the rev george benson edited four volumes of dr chandlers sermons and was the author of some poetical pieces  a volume of his sermons has been published since his death  amyot james bishop of auxerre and great almoner of france one of the mo celebrated men for learning of the sixteenth century he was born at melun the  0th of october      and studied philosophy at paris in the college of cardinal le moine he was naturally dull and heavy but his diligence and application made amends for these natural defects having taken his degree of master of arts at the age of nineteen he pursued his studies under the royal professors established by francis i viz james tusen who explained the greek poets peter dones professor of rhetoric and oonce fine professor of mathematics he left paris at the age of twentythree and went to bourges with the sien colin who had the abbey of st ambrose in that city at the recommendation of this abbot a secretary of state took amyot into his house to be tutor to his children the great improvements they made under his direction induced the secretary to recommend him to the princess margaret duchess of berry only sister of francis i and by means of this recommendation amyot was made public professor of greek and latin in the university of bourges he read two lectures a day for ten years a latin lecture in the morning and a greek one in the afternoon it was during this time he translated into french the amors of theagenes and chariclea which francis i was so pleased with that he conferred upon him the abbey of bellosane the death of this prince happening soon after amyot thought it would be better to try his fortune elsewhere than to expect any preferment at the court of france he therefore accompanied morvillier to venice on his embassy from henry ii to that republic when morvillier was recalled from hi embassy amyot would not repass the alps with him choosing rather to go to rome where he was kindly received by the bishop of mirepoix at whose house he lived two years it was here that looking over the manuscripts of the vatican whither he was allowed a free access by romulus amaseiis keeper of that famous library he discovered that heliodorus bishop of tricca was the author of the amors of theagenes he found also a manuscript of this work more correct and complete than that which he had translated and took care to enable himself thereby to give a better edition of this work his labors however in this way did not engage him so as to divert him from pushing his fortune he insinuated himself so far into the favor of cardinal de tournon that the cardinal recommended him to the king to to be preceptor to his two younger sons while he was in this employment he finished his translation of plutarchs lives which he dedicated to the king he afterward undertook that of plutarchs morals which he ended in the reign of charles ix and dedicated to that prince charles conferred upon him the abbey of st cornelius de compiegne and made him great almoner of france and bishop of auxerre and that of curator of the university of paris happening to be vacant at the same time he was also invested in both these employments which thuanus greatly complains of henry iii perhaps would have yielded to the pressing solicitations of the bishop of st flour who had attended him on his journey into poland and made great interest for the post of great almoner but the duchess of savoy the kings aunt recommended amyot so earnestly to him when he passed through turin on his return from poland that he was not only continued in his employment but a new honor was added to it for his sake for when henry iii named amyot commander of the order of the holy ghost he decreed at the same time as a mark of respect to him all the great almoners of france should be of course commanders of that order amyot did not neglect his studies in the midst of his honors but revised all his translations with great care compared them with the greek text and altered many passages he designed to give a more complete edition of them with the various readings of diverse manuscripts but died before he had finished that work the  th of feb      in his seventyninth year  amyraut moses an eminent french divine minister and professor of divinity at saumur he was born in september      at bourgueil a small town of touraine of an ancient family originally from orleans having gone through his course of philosophy he was sent to poictiers to read law to which he applied himself with great assiduity and is said to have spent fourteen hours a day in that study at the end of his first year he took his degree of licentiate but mr bouchereau minister of saumur having advised him to study divinity and the reading of calvins institutions having strongly inclined him to follow this advice he acquainted his father that he earnestly desired to be a clergyman and obtained his assent though not without a great deal of difficulty he went to study at saumur where he continued a considerable time as student of divinity upon his admission into orders he was presented to the church of st agnau in the country of main where after having lived eighteen months he was invited to saumur to succeed mr daille appointed minister of charenton about the same time that the church of saumur desired him for their minister the academic council fixed upon him for professor of divinity his admission to the professorship with his previous examination and his inaugural thesis de sacerdotio christi redounded much to his reputation  in      mr amyraut was sent deputy to the national council at charenton and by this assembly was appointed to address the king and lay before his majesty their complaints concerning the infraction of the edicts he was particularly charged not to deliver his speech upon his knees as the deputies for the former national synod had done he managed this affair with so much address that he was introduced to the king according to the ancient custom and in the manner that was agreeable to the assembly it was on this occasion that he became acquainted with cardinal richlieu who conceived a great esteem for him about this time he published a piece wherein he explained the mystery of predestination and grace according to the hypothesis of camero which occasioned a kind of civil war amongst the protestant divines of france those who disliked the hypothesis derided it as a novelty especially when they saw themselves joined by the great du moulin who accused amyraut of arianism the authority of this famous divine to whom the people paid a great respect and veneration on account of the many books of controversy he had published made so deep an impression in the minds of many ministers that though mr amyraut had published a piece wherein he maintained that calvin had held universal grace yet many deputies at the national synod of alencon came charged with instructions against him and some were even for deposing him the deputies of the provinces beyond the loire were the most violent against him however the synod after having heard mr amyraut explain his opinion in several sessions and answer the objections made thereto honorably acquitted him and enjoined silence in respect to questions of this nature but this was not justly observed by either side for complaints were made against mr amyraut in the national synod of charenton for having acted contrary to the regulations concerning that silence and he in his turn complained of infractions of the same nature the assembly by an holy amnesty suppressed these mutual complaints and having renewed the injunction of silence sent back amyraut to his employment and permitted him to oppose foreigners who should attack him in what manner the synod of anjou should think proper this synod allowed him to publish an answer to the three volumes of spanhemius upon universal grace which occasioned the writing of several others  when the national synod was sitting in the year      mr amyraut was desired to enter into a conference with mr de la milletiere i order to bring him over to his opinion the conference continued several days but they could no more agree in verbal disputation than in their writings the doctrine of mr de la place concerning original sin being attacked in this synod mr amyraut appeared before the assembly to plead the cause of his colleague and he made it appear that the doctrine complained of was no ways dangerous his conduct in this affair was highly commended on account of the excellent defense he made in favor of mr de la places opinion and because he had no other motive than the interest of his colleague his own opinion as to original sin being different from that of mr de la place amyraut being a man well acquainted with the world wa very entertaining in conversation which contributed no less than the reputation of his learning to render him esteemed by so many persons of quality though of opposite principles in religious matters among those who particularly distinguished him were the marshals de breze and de la meilleraic mr le goux de la berchere first president of the parliament of burgundy and cardinal mazarin what gained him the favor of this cardinal was in all probability his openly declaring in favor of the obedience due to sovereigns which proved very advantageous to the court of france during the troubles of the league against cardinal mazarin called de la fronde in his apology published in      in behalf of the protestants he excuses as well as he can the civil wars of france but he declares at the same time that he by no means intends to justify the taking up of arms against ones lawful sovereign upon any pretense whatsoever and that he always looked upon it as more agreeable to the nature of the gospel and the practice of the primitive church to use no other arms but patience tears and prayers but notwithstanding his attachment to this doctrine he was not for obeying in matters of conscience which plainly appeared when the seneschal of saumur imparted to him an order from the council of state enjoining all those of the reformed religion to hang the outside of their houses on corpus christi day the seneschal notified this order to him the eve of this holiday entreating him at the same time to persuade the protestants to comply with it to this mr amyraut made answer that on the contrary he would go directly and exhort his parishioners not to comply with it as he himself was resolved not to obey such orders that in all his sermons he had endeavored to inspire his hearers with obedience and submission to superior powers but not when their consciences were concerned having thus acquainted the seneschal with his resolution he went from house to house laying before his parishioners the reasons why he thought they ought not to obey the order of the council the kings lieutenant however not thinking it proper to support the seneschal this prevented any tumult on that occasion amyraut was a man of such charity and compassion that he bestowed on the poor his whole salary during the last ten years of his life without distinction of catholic or protestant he died the  th of february in      and was interred with the usual ceremonies of the academy  anacreon a greek poet born at teos a seaport of ionia madam dacier endeavors to prove from plato that he was a kinsman of solons and consequently allied to the codridae the noblest family in athens but this is not sufficiently supported the time when he flourished is uncertain eusebius placing it in the   d suidas in the   d and mr le fevre in the   d olympiad he is said to have been eighteen years of age when harpagus the general of cyrus came with an army against the confederate cities of the ionians and aeolians the milesians immediately submitted themselves but the phocaeans when they found they were unable to withstand the enemy chose rather to abandon their country than their liberty and getting a fleet together transported themselves and families to the coast of france where being hospitably received by nannus the king of the country they built marseilles the teians soon followed their example for harpagus having made himself master of their walls they unanimously went on board their ships and sailing to thrace fixed themselves in the city abdera where they had not been long when the thracians jealous of their neighbors endeavored to give them disturbance and in these conflicts it seems to be that anacreon lost those friends whom he celebrates in his epigrams this poet had certainly a delicate wit as may be judged from the many beauties which shine throughout his works but he was rather too fond of pleasures for love and wine had the disposal of all his hours  anacreon left abdera and went to the court of polycrates at samo where he was received with great marks of friendship and it was here he became enamoured with the handsome bathyllus  he had another favorite named smerdias the son of a thracian prince who had been given as a present to polycrates by some grecian pirates  he is said to have been in love with the fair cleobulus whom he had like to have killed when a child in the arms of his nurse by rudely jostling her as he reeled one day through the streets when he was in liquor and not content with this he abused the child with scurrilous language the nurse whed he might one day commend him as much as he had the abused him her wishes were fulfilled for cleobulus grew to be a beautiful youth and anacreon falling in love with him wrote several verses in his praise aelian has endeavored to clear anacreon of the suspicion of entertaining any dishonorable passion for these youths but the general charge against him in this respect is so strong that the imptation lies heavy upon his memory how long anacreon continued at samos is uncertain but it is probable he remained there during the greatest part of the reign of polycrates which seems to be confirmed by herodotus who assures us that anacreon was with that prince in his chamber when he received a message from oraetes governor of sardys by whose treachery polycrates was soon after betrayed and inhumanly crucified it seems to have been a little before this that anacreon left samos and removed to athens having been invited thither by hipparchus the eldest son of pisistratus one of the most virtuous and learned princes of his time who as plato assures us sent an obliging letter with a vessel of fifty oars to convey him over the aegean sea after hipparchus was slain by the conspiracy of harmodius and aristogiton anacreon returned to teos where he remained till the revolt of histiaeus when he was obliged once more to remove to abdera where he died the manner of his death is said to have been very extraordinary for they tell us that he was choked with a grapestone which he swallowed as he was regaling on some new wine  there is but a small part of anacreons works which remain besides his odes and epigrams he composed elegies hymns and iambics his poems which are extant consist chiefly of bacchanalian songs and lovesonnets how much he was the delight of both ancients and modern appears from the praises they have bestowed upon him  the verses of anacreon says scaliger are sweeter than indian sugar his beauty says madam dacier and chiefest excellence lay in imitating nature and in following reason so that he presented to the mind no images but what were noble and natural the odes of anacreon says rapin are flowers beauties and perpetual graces it is familiar to him to write what is natural and to the life he having an air so delicate so easy and so graceful that among all the ancients there is nothing comparable to the method he took nor to that kind of writing he followed he flows soft and easy every where diffusing the joy and indolence of his mind through his verse and tuning his harp to the smooth and pleasant temper of his soul  ancillon david a minister of the reformed church at metz where he was born the   th of march      he studied from the ninth or tenth year of his age in the jesuits college where he gave such extraordinary and striking proofs of his genius that the heads of the society tried every means to draw him over to their religion and party but he continued firm against their attacks and took a resolution of studying divinity he went to geneva in      and went through a course of philosophy under mr du pan and his divinity studies under spanheim diodati and tronchin who conceived a very great esteem for him he left geneva in april      and offered himself to the synod of charenton in order to take upon him the office of a minister his abilities were greatly admited by the examiners and the whole assembly was so highly pleased with him that they gave him the church of meaux the most considerable then unprovided for here he acquired a vast reputation for his learning eloquence and virtue and was even highly respected by those of the roman catholic communion he returned to his own country in the year      where he remained till the revocation of the edict of nantz in      he retired to francfort after this fatal blow and having preached in the french church at hanau the whole assembly was so edified by it that they immediately called together the heads of the families in order to propose that he might be invited to accept of being minister there the proposition was agreed to and they sent deputies to him who obtained what they desired he began the exercise of his ministry in that church about the end of the yea      his preaching made so great a noise at hanau that the professors of divinity and the german and dutch ministers attended his sermons frequently the count of hanau himself who had never been seen in the french church came thither to hear mr ancillon they came from the neighboring parts and even from francfort people who understood nothing of french flocked together with great eagerness and said they loved to see him speak this occasioned a jealousy in the two other ministers who were piqued at the esteem and affection shown to their new colleague they were displeased at it and obliged him by a thousand uneasy circumstances to abandon voluntarily a place which they could not force him from he returned to francfort where he would have fixed if the circumstances of his family which was very numerous had not obliged him to go to some other plac where he might settle himself he chose berlin where he received kind reception from his highness the elector of brandenburg he wa made minister of berlin and had the pleasure of seeing his eldest so made judge and director of the french in that city and his other son rewarded with a pension and entertained at the university of francfo upon the oder he had likewise the satisfaction of seeing his brothe made judge of all the french in the states of brandenburg and m cayart his soninlaw engineer to his electoral highness he enjoye these agreeable circumstances and several others till his death which happened at berlin the  d of september      when he was seventyfive years of age  mr ancillon having got a good deal of money by marriage was enabled thereby to gratify his passion for books his library was accordingly very curious and large and he increased it every day with all that appeared new and important in the republic of letters so that at last it was one of the noblest collections in the hands of any private person in the kingdom such foreigners as were curious visited it when they passed through the city of metz as the most valuable curiosity there mr ancillon published at sedan a volume in quarto in the year      in which the whole dispute concerning traditions is amply and solidly examined this is a faithful account of all that passed in the conference which he had with mr bedacier doctor of sorbonne bishop of auguste and suffragan of the bishop of metz he disputed with him before several persons at first in his own house and afterward before a large audience in the bishops palace mr bedacier thought proper to break off the dispute alleging it was much better to continue the argument by writing than personal disputation it was agreed however that neither party should publish the particulars of this conference there was a monk notwithstanding who took upon him to print a false account of it whose impudence was so flagrant that although mr ancillon had managed this contest with great honor to himself yet he attempted to persuade the public that it was very fatal to him and to his party and that he lost the victory in it irrecoverably this occasioned mr ancillon to publish the book abovementioned when the method of cardinal richlieu appeared ancillon wrote a full and excellent answer to it but he understood that mr martel professor at montauban had written one which was ready to be published and that mr claude who had the same design had desisted from executing it for the same reason as appears from the third letter of his collection of letters in the fifth tome of his posthumous works he suppressed therefore what he had done and published only some sheets which contain an answer to the sixth chapter of that method or an apology for luther zuinglius calvin and beza which was the title of this piece in the edition published at hanau in      he published also the life of william farel or the idea of a faithful minister of jesus christ the famous mr conrart who was one of his intimate friends read this and approved it and wrote with his own hands several remarks in the margin of the manuscript though mr ancillon explained several entire books of the holy scripture and wrote all his sermons yet he never could be persuaded to print them all that we have of him of that kind is a sermon preached at metz on a fast day the consistory used some sort of authority to make him print it which was done at paris in      this sermon his upon the   th and   th verses of the third chapter of st pauls epistle to the philippians and is entitled the tears of st paul he wrote at last an excellent answer to the pastoral advice the circular letters and the method which the clergy addressed to the reformed of france in the year      we cannot form a truer idea of the variety of learning which enlivened his conversation than from a book entitled melange critique de litterature recuilli des conversations de feu mr ancillon it was published at basil in school in two volumes in duodecimo by mr ancillon the advocate the eldest son of the minister a gentleman well known in the republic of letters  ancourt florentcarton d an eminent french actor and dramatic writer born at fontainble october      he studied in the jesuits college at paris under father de la rue who discovering in him a remarkable vivacity and capacity for learning was extremely desirous of engaging him in their order but ancourts aversion to a religious life rendered all his efforts ineffectual after he had gone through a course of philosophy he applied himself to the civil law and was admitted advocate at seventeen years of age but falling in love with an actress this induced him to go upon the stage and in    0 he married this woman as he had all the qualifications necessary for the theater he soon greatly distinguished himself and not being satisfied with the applause only of an actor he began to write pieces for the stage many of which had such prodigious success that most of the players grew rich from the profits of them his merit in this way procured him a very favorable reception at court and lewis xiv showed him many marks of his favor his sprightly conversation and polite behavior made his company agreeable to all the men of figure both at court and in the city and the most considerable persons were extremely pleased to have him at their houses having taken a journey to dunkirk to see his eldest daughter who lived there he took the opportunity of paying his compliments to the elector of bavaria who was then at brussels this prince received him with the utmost civility and having retained him a considerable time dismissed him with a present of a diamond valued at a thousand pistoles he likewise rewarded him in a very generous manner when upon his coming to paris ancourt composed an entertainment for his diversion ancourt began at length to grow weary of the theater which he quitted in let      and retired to his estate of courcelles le roy i erry where he applied himself wholly to devotion and composed a translation of davids psalms in verse and a sacred tragedy which were never printed he died the  th of december      being sixtyfive years of age  anderson sir edmund a younger brother of a good family in lincolnshire descended originally from scotland he received the first part of his education in the country and went afterward to lincoln college in oxford from thence he removed to the inner temple where he read law with great assiduity and in due time was called to the bar and in the nineteenth year of the reign of queen elizabeth he was appointed one of the queens sergeants at law some time after he was made a judge and in      being upon the norfolk circuit at bury he exerted himself against the famous brown who was the author of those opinions which were afterward maintained by a sect called from him brownists for this conduct of judge anderson the bishop of norwich wrote a letter to treasurer burleigh desiring the said judge might receive the queens thanks in      he was made lord chief justice of the common pleas and took his place thee the  th of may with great formality and ceremony the year following he received the honor of knighthood in      he was appointed one of the commissioners for trying mary queen of scots on the   th of october the same year he sat in judgment upon her and on the   th of the same month he sat again in the star chamber when sentence was pronounced against that unhappy queen in      he sat in the star chamber on secretary davison who was charged with issuing the warrant for the execution of the queen of scots contrary to queen elizabeths command and without her knowledge after the cause had been heard sir roger manwood chief baron of the exchequer gave his opinion first wherein he extolled the queens clemency which he said davison had prevented and therefore he was for fining him ten thousand pounds and imprisonment during the queens pleasure chief justice anderson spoke next he said that davison had done justum non just that is he had done what was right not in a due manner  in the proceedings against those who endeavored to set up the geneva discipline lord hief justice anderson greatly distinguished himself and as he showed great zeal on these occasions so in the case of udal a puritan minister who was confined in the year      and tried and condemned in the year following we find this judge is severely censured by mr pierce it is highly probable the judge himself was sensible of the ill will his proceedings against the dissenters from the established church drew upon him but it does not appear that it gave him any great pain since in      we have an account of his going to the northern circuit where he behaved with the same rigor declaring in his charges that such persons as opposed the established church opposed her majestys authority and were in that light enemies to the state and disturbers of the public peace wherefore of such he directed the grand juries to inquire that they might be punished he was indeed a very strict lawyer who governed himself entirely by statutes this he showed on many occasions particularly at the trial of henry cuffe secretary to the earl of essex where the attorney general charging the prisoner syllogistically and cuffe answering him in the same style lord chief justice anderson said smartly i sit here to judge of law and not of logic and directed mr attorney to press the statute of edward iii on which mr cuffe was indicted he was reputed severe and strict in the observation of what was taught in courts and laid down as law by reports but this ought to be considered a vulgar opinion for we have his express declaration to the contrary and that he neither expected precedents in all cases nor would be bound by them where he saw they were not founded upon justice but would act as if there were no such precedents of this we have a proof from the reports in his time published by mr goldesborough the case of resceit was moved again and shuttleworth said that he cannot be received because he is named in the writ and said that he had searched all the books and there is not one case where he which is named in the writ may be received what of that said judge anderson shall we not give judgment because it is not adjudged in the books before we will give judgment according to reason and if there be no reason in the books i will not regard them his steadiness was so great that he would not be driven from what he thought right by any authority whatever as appeared in the case of cavendish a creature of the earl of leicesters who had procured by his interest the queens letters patent for making out writs of supersedeas upon exigents in the court of common pleas and a message was sent to the judges to admit him to that office with which as they conceived the queen had no right to grant any such patent they did not comply upon this mr cavendish by the assistance of his patron obtained a letter from the queen to quicken them which however did not produce what was expected from it the courtier however pursued his point and obtained another letter under the queens signet and sign manual this letter was delivered in presence of the lord chancellor and the earl of leicester in the beginning of easter term and the judges desired time to consider it and then answered that they could not comply with the letter because it was inconsistent with their duty and their oaths of office the queen upon this appointed the chancellor the lord chief justice of the queens bench and the master of the rolls to hear this matter and the queens sergeant having set forth her prerogative it was shown by the judges that they could not grant offices by virtue of the queens letters where it did not appear to them that she had a power to grant that as the judges were bound by their oaths of office so her majesty was restrained by her coronation oath from such arbitrary interpositions with which her majesty was satisfied he concurred also with his brethren in remonstrating boldly against several acts of power practiced in elizabeths reign as appears in that memorable remonstrance recorded by him in his reports on the accession of king james i he was continued in his office which he held upwards of twentyfour years to

sebastian sent him as one of his divines he preached before the assembly the second sunday after easter in      nor was he contented with the service he did in explaining those points upon which he was consulted but he employed his pen in defense of the canons of the council in a treatise entitled orthodoxarum explicationum lib x which is a reply to a book published by chemnitius against the doctrine of the jesuits before the close of the council of trent and as chemnitius took this opportunity of writing a very large work entitled examen concilii tridentini andrada thought himself obliged to defend his first piece against this learned adversary he composed therefore a book which his two brothers published after his death at lisbon in      entitled defensio tridentinae fidei catholicae quinque libris comprehensa adversus haereticorum calumnias et praesertim martini chemnitii these pieces of andrada have been printed several times yet they are difficult to be met with there is scarce any catholic author who has been more quoted by the protestants than he because he maintained some opinions a little extravagant concerning the salvation of the heathens andrada was esteemed an excellent preacher his sermons were published in three parts the second of which was translated into spanish by benedict de alarcon the bibliotheque of the spanish writers does not mention all his works the book he wrote concerning the popes authority during the council in the year      is omitted the popes legates being very well pleased with this work sent it to cardinal borromeo the court of rome liked it extremely and the pope returned the author thanks in a very obliging manner many encomiums have been bestowed upon andrada osorius in his preface to the orthodox explanations of

absent upon these affairs augustus elector of saxony wrote letters to lewis duke of wirtemberg to desire the assistance of andreas because he found that the divines of wirtemberg had introduced the zuinglian doctrines and propagated them among the youth andreas therefore went to torga in april following and was present at the assembly of divines held there to settle a form of agreement and put

friends of his constancy in the faith which he had asserted and showed the most undoubted signs of a sincere devotion till he expired on the  th of january    0 being sixtyone years and nine months old the following character is given him by melchior adam he was says this author an excellent preacher had an easy manner of instructing the people and delivered the most obscure points in such a perspicuous style that they were understood by the generality of the audience when he exhorted them to the reformation of their lives or emonstrated against vice he made use of great energy of language and elevation of voice being extremely well qualified both by nature and art for moving the passions and when there was occasion for it his eloquence was forcible like thunder and he spoke with such vehemence that he would sweat all over his body even in the midst of winter in executing the several branches of his duty he spared no labor and was deterred by no fatigue he was perpetually engaged in composing some work or other or in writing letters upon various subjects to persons of all ranks who consulted him these things he dispatched with admirable quickness and success there was hardly a day passed but he gave advice to several persons being always ready to gratify those who solicited his assistance he was in great favor with princes and men of the highest rank his conversation being very agreeable and facetious he had a warm zeal for the religion which he professed and was extremely sorry whenever he heard that any person had abandoned it he wrote a great number of books the most remarkable of which was his book on concord and some treatises he had wrote on the ubiquity of christ  andreas john a famous canonist of the fourteenth century born at mugello near florence he was very young when he went to bologna to pursue his studies here he would have found great difficulty to maintain himself had he not got a tutors place by which means he was enabled to apply himself to the study of the canon law in which he mad great progress under the professor guy de baif he had always a particular respect for this professor paying as great deference to his glosses as the text itself guy de baif perceiving that andreas for want of money could not demand his doctors degree procured it him gratis which andreas himself acknowledges the same professor pushed him on to stand for a professorship which he obtained andreas was professor at padua about the year    0 but he was recalled to bologna where he acquired the greatest reputation we are told wonderful things concerning the austerity of his life that he macerated his body with prayer and fasting and lay upon the bare ground for twenty years together covered only with a bearskin this is attested by very good authors but if the story which poggius tells of him in his jests be true he must afterward have relaxed much of this continency  joannem andream says he doctorem bononiensem cujus fama admodum vulgata est subagitantem ancillam domesticam uxor deprehendit re insueta stupefacta mulier in virum versa ubi nunc ait joannes est sapientia vestra ille nil amplius locutus in vulva istius respondit loco admodum sapientiae accommodato andreas had a beautiful daughter named novella whom he loved extremely and he is said to have instructed her so well in all parts of learning that when he was engaged in any affair which hindered him from reading lectures to his scholars he sent his daughter in his room and lest her beauty should prevent the attention of the hearers she had a little curtain drawn before her to perpetuate the memory of his daughter he entitled his commentary upon the decretals of gregory ix the novellae he married her to john calderinus a learned canonist the first work of andreas was his gloss upon the sixth book of the decretals which he wrote when he was very young he wrote also glosses upon the clementines and a commentary in regulas sexti which he entitled mercuriales because he either engaged in it on wednesdays diebus mercurii or because he inserted his wednesdays disputes in it he enlarged the speculum of durant in the year      this is all which mr bail mentions of his writings though he wrote many more andreas died of the plague at bologna in      after he had been a professor fiveandforty years and was buried in the church of the dominicans many eulogiums have been bestowed upon him having been called archidoctor decretorum in his epitaph he has the title of  rabbi doctorum lux censor normaque morum rabbi of the doctors the light censor and rule of manners and it is said that pope boniface called him lumen mundi the light of the world mr bail says it was pity andreas followed the method of the pyrrhonists so much that he proved his own opinion very solidly when he had a mind to it but this he seldom did choosing rather to relate the sentiments of others and to leave his readers in the midst of the dispute  andreas tobias professor of history and greek at groningen born at braunfels in the county of solms the  0th of august   0  he studied philosophy at herborn under alstedius after which he went to bremen where he lived several years he was one of the most constant auditors of gerard de neuville a famous physician and philosopher and as he had a desire to obtain a public professorship he prepared himself for it by several lectures which he read in philosophy he returned to his own country in      where he did not continue long but went to groningen being sent for by henry alting he read lectures upon all parts of philosophy for some time after which alting got him to be tutor to the son of a prince palatine in which employment he continued three years part of which he spent at leyden and part at the hague at the court of the prince of orange he was called to groningen in      to succeed janus gebhardus who had been professor of history and greek he discharged this trust in the most faithful manner till his death which happened the   th of october      andreas was a great stickler for mr des carts which he showed during the life and after the death of that philosopher he wrote in defense of him against a professor of leyden whose name was revius and published an answer to him in      entitled methodi cartesianae assertio opposita jacobi revii praef methodi cartesianae considerationi theologicae the second part of this answer appeared the year following he wrote likewise in      against mr regius in defense of the remarks of mr des carts upon a programma which contained an explication of the human mind he taught the cartesian philosophy in his own house though his professorship did not oblige him to that and even when his age had quite weakened him mr des marets acquaints us with these particulars making mention of a swiss student who dared not venture to attend upon the philosophical lectures of tobias andreas for fear it should be known in his own country where it might prove an obstacle to his promotion in the ministry  andreini isabella a native of padua and most celebrated actress toward the beginning of the seventeenth century this was not her only perfection for she was also admired as an excellent poetess which appears from the eulogiums many learned men and great wits have bestowed upon her and from the works she published the infanti of pavia so the academists of this city are styled were of opinion they did their society an honor by admitting her a member of it and she in acknowledgment of this honor never forgot to mention among her titles that of academica infanta her titles were these isabella andreini comica gelosa academica infanta detta laccessa she had one advantage which is no frequent among the most excellent

school at radcliffe and was afterward sent to merchanttaylors here he made a great proficiency in the learned languages and dr watts residentiary of st pauls and archdeacon of middlesex who had lately founded some scholarships at pembroke hall in cambridge sent him to that college on the first of his exhibitions after he had taken the degree of bachelor of arts he was chosen fellow of the college soon after having taken the degree of master of arts he applied himself to the study of divinity and being chosen catechist in the college he read a lecture on the ten commandments every saturday and sunday to which great numbers out of the other colleges of the university and even out of the country resorted as to a divinity lecture his reputation increasing daily he began to be taken notice of by sir francis walsingham secretary of state to queen elizabeth who being unwilling so fine a genius should be buried in the country procured him the vicarage of st giless cripplegate in london and got him afterward chosen a prebendary and residentiary of st pauls and also prebendary of the collegiate church of southwell being thus preferred he distinguished himself as a diligent and excellent preacher and read divinity lectures three times a week at st pauls in term time upon the death of dr fulke he was chosen master of pembroke hall to which college he became a considerable benefactor he was also appointed one of the chaplains in ordinary to queen elizabeth who took great delight in his preaching he was in no less esteem with her successor james i who gave him the preference above all other divines as a preacher and made choice of him to vindicate his sovereignty his majesty having in his defense of the rights of kings asserted the authority of christian princes over causes and persons ecclesiastical cardinal bellarmine under the name of matthew tortus attacked him with great vehemence and bitterness the king employed andrews to answer the cardinal who did it with great spirit and judgment in a piece entitled tortura torti etc his majesty upon this promoted him to the bishopric of chichester to which he was consecrated november     0  and at the same time made him his almoner in which place dr andrews behaved with great honor and fidelity not even making those advantages to himself which he might legally have done upon the vacancy of the bishopric of ely he was advanced to that see and consecrated september      0  he was also nominated one of the kings privy counselors of england and afterward of scotland when he attended his majesty to that kingdom when he had been nine years in the sea of ely he was advanced to the bishopric of winchester and deanery of the kings chapel which two last preferments he held till his death there is a pleasant story related of him while he was bishop of winchester in the life of waller the poet waller going to see the king at dinner overheard a very extraordinary conversation between his majesty the bishop of winchester and dr neale bishop of durham these two prelates standing behind the kings chair his majesty asked them my lords said he cannot i take my subjects money when i want it without all this formality in parliament the bishop of durham readily answered god forbid sir but you should you are the breath of our nostrils whereupon the king turned and said to the bishop of winchester well my lord what say you sir replied the bishop i have no skill to judge of parliamentary cases the king answered no putoffs my lord answer me presently then sir said he i think it lawful for you to take my brother neales money for he offers it mr waller says the company was pleased with this answer but the wit of i seemed to affect the king for a certain lord coming in soon after his majesty cried out o my lord they say that you lig with my lady no sir says his lordship in confusion but i like her company because she has so much wit why then says the king do not you lig with my lord of winchester there this great prelate was in no less reputation and esteem with king charles i than he had been with his predecessors he died at winchesterhouse in southwark september         in the seventyfirst year of his age and was buried in the parish church of st saviors where his executors erected to him a very fair monument of marble and alabaster on which is an elegant inscription written by one of his chaplains mr milton has wrote also a beautiful elegy on his death in the same language in the dedication of his sermons published under the care and inspection of dr laud bishop of london and the bishop of ely above mentioned we have the following character of this prelate the person whose works these are was from his youth a man of extraordinary worth and note a man as if he had been made up of learning and virtue both of them so eminent in him that it is hard to judge which had precedence his virtue which we must still judge the more worthy in any man was comparable to that which was to be found in the primitive bishop of the church and had he lived amongst those ancient fathers his virtues would have shined even amongst those virtuous men and for his learning it was as well if not better known abroad than respected at home and take him in his latitude we which knew him well knew not any sort of learning to which he was a stranger but in his profession admirable none stronger than he where he wrestled with an adversary and that bellarmine felt who was as well able to shift for himself as any that stood up for the roman party none more exact more judicious than he where he was to instruct and inform others and that as they knew who often heard him preach so they may learn which will read this which he has left behind him and yet this fullness of his material learning left room enough in the temper of his brain for almost all languages learned and modern to seat themselves so that his learning had all the helps language could afford and his languages learning enough for the best of them to express his judgment in the mean time so commanding over both as that neither of them was suffered idly or curiously to start from or fall short of their intended scope so that we may better say of him than was sometimes said of claudius drusus he was of as many and as great virtues as mortal nature could receive or industry make perfect besides the tortura torti already mentioned bishop andrews wrote a manual of private devotions and meditations for every day in the week and a manual of directions for the visitation of the sick there were likewise several sermons and tracts in english and latin of his published after his death he had had a share in the translation of the pentateuch and the historical books from joshua to the first book of chronicles exclusively  aneau or anulus bartholomew a learned man of the sixteenth century born at bourges in france and educated under melchior volmar he made great advances in polite literature and imbibed the principles of the protestant religion which volmar professed the reputation he had for his skill in the learned languages and poetry induced the old echevins of lions to offer him a professorship of rhetoric in the college which they were going to erect in that city aneau cheerfully accepted this offer and held the professorship above thirty years he discharged his duty with great applause and in      was chosen principal of the college he propagated the doctrines of the reformation among his scholars but this he did very secretly for a long time and when it was perceived it was at first only complained of but an accident which happened on the festival of the holy sacrament in the year      put a final stop to all his attempts in favor of protestantism by a very fatal catastrophe upon that day which was the   st of june as the procession was passing toward the college there was a large stone thrown from one of the windows upon the host and the priest that carried it whether aneau was the author of this insult or not is uncertain the people however being enraged at it broke into the college in a body and assassinated aneau whom they supposed to be the guilty person and the college itself was shut up next day by order of the city  angelis dominico de author of several pieces relating to the history of literature was born the   th of october      at lecce the capital of otranto in the kingdom of naples of one of the noblest and most considerable families in that city he began his studies at lecce and at seventeen years of age went to finish them at naples where he applied very closely to the greek language and geometry he went afterward to macerata where he was admitted doctor of law his desire of improvement induced him also to travel into france and spain where he acquired great reputation several academies of italy were ambitious of procuring him as a member accordingly we find his name not only amongst those of the transformati and spioni of lecce but also in that of the investiganti of naples in the academy of florence and in that of the arcadians at rome the last of which he was admitted into the  th of august school he received holy orders very early and was afterward canon and grand penitentiary of the church of lecce vicar general of niesti gallipoli and gragnano first chaplain of the troops of the kingdom of naples and of the pope auditor of m nicholas negroni and afterward of the cardinal his uncle whilst philp v of spain was master of the kingdom of naples he was honored with the title of principal historiographer and afterward became secretary to the duke of gravina he died at lecce the  th of august      in the fortythird year of his age and was interred in the cathedral of that city  angelus christopher a learned greek of the seventeenth century author of several works he was born at peloponnesus in greece and obliged by the turks to abandon his country on account of his religion after having suffered a variety of torments he came afterward to england where he was supported by the bishop of norwich and several of the clergy by this prelates recommendation he went to cambridge and studied about three years in trinity college in whitsuntide    0 he removed to oxford and studied at baliol college where he did great service to the young scholars of the university by instructing them in the greek language in which manner he employed himself till his death which happened on the  st of february       anglus thomas an english priest well known for the singularity of his opinions and several little tracts which he wrote in the seventeenth century he was born of a good family which he mentions in the title page of some of his works he went by several names but mr baillet says his true name was white but that h used to disguise it under that of candidus albius bianchi and richworth but he was most known in france by the name of thomas anglus des carts generally called him mr vitus he passed some time in most countries in europe but his longest stay was at rome and paris when he was in england he lived a considerable time in the family of sir kenelm digby and seems to have had a great esteem for the opinions of this gentleman as may be seen in his writings particularly in the preface to his latin work concerning the institutions of the peripatetic philosophy according to the hypothesis of sir kenelm he was a great advocate for the peripatetic philosophy he attempted even to make the principles of aristotle subservient to the explaining the most impenetrable mysteries of religion and with this view he engaged in the discussion of predestination free will and grace mr baillet says what he wrote upon this subject resembles the ancient oracles for obscurity his answer to this accusation brought against him by several authors may not perhaps be improperly mentioned here as it gives an idea of the peculiarity of his temper and genius i value myself says he upon a brevity and conciseness which is suitable to the teachers of science the divines are the cause that my writings are obscure for they refuse to give me any opportunity of explaining myself in short either the learned understand me or they do not if they do understand me and find me in an error it is easy for them to refute me if they do not understand me it is unreasonable for them to exclaim against my doctrines in such abstruse points as we have mentioned he was much embarrassed and by giving too great scope to his own thoughts he pleased neither the molinists nor jansenists he is allowed however to have been a man of an extensive and penetrating genius but having no talent at distinguishing the ideas which should have served as the rule and foundation of his reasoning he could not clear up the difficulties wherein he involved himself on the  0th of june      the congregation of the index expurgatorius at rome condemned some treatises of thomas anglus the doctors of douay censured also twoandtwenty propositions extracted from his sacred institutions he published his supplicatio postulativa justitiae in opposition to their censure wherein he complains that they had given him a vague undetermined censure without taxing any particular proposition he died some time after the restoration of charles ii but in what year is uncertain  angriani or aygnani michael commonly called michael of bologna a divine of distinguished learning in the fourteenth century born at bologna in italy where he entered into the order of the carmelites he studied afterward at the university of paris where he received his degree of doctor in the general chapter of his order held at ferrara in      in that of bourdeaux in      and in that of treves in      he was named regent of the convent at paris in the year      he assisted at the general chapter held at aix in provence under the character of definitor of the province of bologna and here he received the title of master that is doctor of divinity which was likewise given him in the general chapters held at puy in languedoc in      and at bruges in      where he assisted as provincial of his province  the great schism which divided the church after the death of pope gregory ix occasioned likewise a division amongst the religious orders particularly that of the carmelites the convents of germany hungary bohemia poland denmark sweden norway prussia flanders friesland and several other provinces contiguous to germany together with tuscany lombardy and the other countries of italy acknowledged pope urban vi but those of france spain scotland and naples supported the party of pope clement vii which was joined also by bernard olensis or oleri the seventeenth general of the order of the carmelites and for this reason he was deposed by pope urban who gave orders in the general chapter held at bruges in      that another superior should be elected out of the countries which had submitted to his authority the chapter obeyed the popes directions and chose angriani under the title of vicar general which was confirmed by a bull of that pope dated the   th of april    0 and the year following he was chosen general of the order by the chapter held at verona the provincials of the provinces who declared for clement vii not being present their places were supplied by other monks named in their room and in      he had the same honor conferred on him by the general chapter held at bamberge in the province of upper germany but the year following going to genoa to wait upon pope urban vi he was deposed from his office without any cause alleged for it some persons indeed supposed it might be oweing to his being an intimate friend and confident of certain cardinals whom the pope caused to be put to death about that time others imagined it to be owing to some suspicions which the pope entertained against the archdeacon of bruges who had been angrianis scholar angriani being discharged from his office retired to the convent of bologna but notwithstanding his having been thus deposed from the generalship of his order by urban pope boniface ix made him vicar general of the province of bologna in      and in      he was present at the general chapter of placentia as definitor of the same province he died at bologna the   th of november   00 according to father lewis de saint therese or the  st of december

province and on that of connaught the popish archbishop of tuam who was the great oracle of his party and whose councils had hitherto been very successful was not only taken prisoner but his papers seized and his foreign correspondence discovered by which all the designs of the rebels were broken and vast advantages accrued to the protestant interest the parliament had sent commissioners to

second commission consisting of men who in their judgment were more agreeable to him and at the head of thi commission mr annesley was placed these commissioners landed at dublin on the  th of june      and were so successful in their negociations that in a few days a treaty was concluded between them and the lord lieutenant it was signed on the   th of that month and very soon after dublin was put into the hands of the parliament this was certainly a very signal service not only to those who employed him but to the whole protestant interest in ireland which was then on the very point of being extinguished however after the commissioners assumed the supreme power he was not able to hinder them from doing many things against his judgment and therefore ought not to be blamed fr those irregularities which were such as the times seemed to require though they could not excuse mr annesley not liking his situation returned speedily home where he found all things in confusion the overment being on the very point of dissolution which however did not discourage him from doing all that lay in his power to serve his counry and though he did this without effect yet sure it is very unjut to charge him with it as an offense as wood does who represents him as an absolute time srver though he was one of the secluded members and as eminent for opposing the illegal things done after the murder of the king as any man in the nation who had not borne arms in his service after the death of cromwell when the rump resumed their old power mr annesley though he doubted whether the parliament was not dissolved by the death of the king resolved to get into the house if it were possible in which good design he got several worthy gentlemen to concur with him but with little success though the scheme was managed with great wisdom and spirit such as sufficiently declared what his real sentiments were and how much he had the resettling the constitution at heart in the confusions which followed he had little or no share as being too well known to be trusted either by the rump or the army and besides he was shrewdly suspected of knowing at least of sir george booths insurrection if not of being concerned in it but when things began to take a better turn by the restoring of the secluded members to their seats february       0 mr annesley began again to make a figure and to appear in his old character that of a true patriot in this he appeared with such luster that he was chosen president of the new council of state having at that time a correspondence with his majesty king charles ii then in exile which cost him the life of his dear brother who was drowned in stopping into a packetboat with letters for his majesty soon after the restoration viz on the  0th of april      he was raised to the dignity of a baron of england by the title of lord annesley of newport pagnel in the county of bucks as also of an earl by the style of       which some little time after was changed for that of anglesey in the preamble of the patent notice is expressly taken of the services rendered by him in the kings restoration nay some tell us that his lordship might have been prime minister if he had not declined it to avoid envy however he had always a considerable share in the kings favor and was heard with great attention at council and in the house of lords he certainly showed his extreme detestation of the kings murder by his sitting in judgment on the regicides at hickss hall and the old bailey though the oxford historian reflects upon this insinuating that he had been as deep in those matters as the persons then tried which is a palpable falsity many reflections of this sort he bore in his lifetime with great constancy or rather indifference being desirous of discharging his duty to his king and country without hurting others and without being solicitous of making great advantages to himself yet as he served a generous master he received from him offices both of profit and trust in      he was made treasurer of the navy and on the  th of february       his majesty in council was pleased to appoint the duke of buckingham the earl of anglesey the lord holles the lord ashley and mr secretary trevor or any three of them to be a committee to peruse and revise all the papers and writings concerning the settlement of ireland from the first to the last and to make an abstract of the state thereof in writing and accordingly on the   th of june      they made their report at large which was the foundation of a commission dated the  st of august      to prince rupert the dukes of buckingham and lauderdale earl of anglesey lords ashley and holles sir john trevor and sir thomas chichley to inspect the settlement of ireland and all proceedings in order thereunto and this was followed by another commission of the seventeenth of january       to prince rupert etc whereunto the duke of ormond the earl of shaftsbury and the lord treasurer clifford were added to inspect the affairs of ireland viz the acts of settlement and explanation and the execution of them and the disposing the forfeited lands and the state of his majestys revenue etc after which by reason of his singular prudence and fidelity the earl of anglesey had the great office of lord privy seal conferred on him the   d of april      and all this notwithstanding a great variety of attempts made to prejudice him as well in the kings as in the public opinion all which he not only effectually defeated by clearly exposing them and manifesting his own innocence but also turned them to his advantage so as to rise more by the intrigues of his enemies than by any art of his own the long experience his lordship had of men and things rendered him so true a judge of merit that he could discover it in men of all persuasions and his freedom from prejudice was such that he could hate it in none how different soever from himself they might be in religious or political opinions this noble disposition rendered him liable to a formidable attack during the time of the popish plot when to have behaved with decency toward the roman catholics of any rank was sufficient to stigmatize the sincerest protestant with the dangerous character of being a favourer of papists one dangerfield whose name will be transmitted to late posterity as a discoverer of plots true and false on the  0th of oct    0 charged his lordship in an information delivered upon oath at the bar of the house of commons with endeavoring to stifle evidence with relation to the popish plot and to promote the belief of a presbyterian one with many other things alike probable or rather alike improbable yet so far credited at that time as to receive countenance from the house the trouble he received from this base attack did not hinder him from speaking his opinion freely upon those matters in the house of lords particularly in relation to the irish plot of which he declared his absolute disbelief when few durst own they suspected it notwithstanding the apparent imposture in the accounts given of it his charity for men of all religions did not however abate either his zeal for the protestant cause or his affection for the true interest of his country the earl of castlehaven thought fit in the year    0 to write his memoirs in which he took a great deal of pains to represent the general rebellion in ireland in the lightest colors possible and as if it had been far from universal at first and that it was made so at least as much by the measures pursued by such as ought to have suppressed them as by any ill intention of the catholics concerned in it the earl of anglesey having received these memoirs from their author thought fit to write some animadversions upon them which he did in a letter to the earl of castlehaven wherein he takes notice of abundance of remarkable passages in those distracted times and as his subject led him delivered his opinion freely in respect to the duke of ormond and his management of affairs in that kingdom this letter to the earl of castlehaven was written in august    0 but was not published till      the duke of ormond about a year afterward expostulated with the lord privy seal on this subject by letter to which the earl replied and there the matter rested in      when the nation was in a high ferment the earl drew up a very particular remonstrance dated april the   th the same year and presented it to his majesty it was very warm and very loyal and yet it was far from being well received it was not however thought proper to remove him from his high office on this account and therefore in the month of june      the duke of ormond then lord lieutenant of ireland was prevailed upon to exhibit a charge against the lord privy seal on account of his reflections on the earl of castlehavens memoirs this produced a sharp dispute between those two peers which ended in the earl of angleseys losing his place of lord privy seal though it certainly raised his reputation his very enemies being forced to confess that he was both hardly and unjustly treated after this misfortune which happened in august      his lordship remained pretty much at his countryseat at blechingdon in oxfordshire where he devoted his time to his studies and meddled very little with public affairs yet did he not entirely abandon business much less discover any pique or disrespect toward the royal family on account of what he had suffered but behaved with so much temper and duty that without betraying or even dissembling his principles he recovered the favor of king james ii so that it is generally believed he would very speedily have been declared lord chancellor of england if this had not been prevented by his death which happened april the  th      at his house in drury lane without any long sickness by a quinsy in the seventythird year of his age he left behind him a numerous posterity it is not easy to say any thing worthy of so great a mans character and yet something is necessary to complete the design of this life and to give the reader some idea of his mind as well as his fortune as he had an excellent and universal education becoming the heir of a noble family so he was always remarkably prone to learning and to the encouragement of learned men he was well read in the classics and perfectly versed not only in the greek and roman history but in the spirit and policy of these famous nations his intercourse however with foreign writers did not hinder him from retaining a superior passion for all the branches of learning which had any respect to his own country he had studied the laws with such diligence as to be styled and esteemed a lawyer even by the most conceited lawyers of his time in history he was a very great critic and with respect to records and whatever else fell under the consideration of a judicious antiquary no man of his time deserved greater reputation than he he was also well versed in the civil and canon law understood ehurch history perfectly and was a great divine his writings which are extant will fully support all that has been hitherto said and the world would have had still higher proofs of his lordships great learning and abilities if the largest and most valuable of all his works had not been unluckily lost or as some say injuriously destroyed however as anthony wood who never speaks well of this nobleman but against his will allows that he had a smooth sharp and keen pen we presume that nobody will doubt it as to the aspersions thrown on his memory by a reverend prelate his contemporary they would have deserved a more particular consideration if it had been usual for that writer to have given good characters of his acquaintance or to have avoided characterizing such as he had little or no acquaintance with we will conclude our account of this noble person with observing that he was one of the first english peers who distinguished himself by collecting a fine library which he performed with great care as well as at a large expense and as he was desirous that so valuable a collection might not quickly be dissipated but remain in his family he caused it to be disposed in a manner suitable to its worth in a particular apartment in anglesey house but these precautions proved fruitless as his lordships good intentions likewise did his books within a few months after his decease being exposed to public sale by mr millington a famous auctioneer yet this sale was attended with an accident which will hinder its being ever forgotten we mean the discovery of the earls famous memorandum in the blank leaf of an  or the pourtraiture of his sacred majesty in his solitudes and sufferings in order to disabuse the world as to the true author of that book who according to that memorandum was not king charles i but bishop gauden which produced a long controversy managed by various hands and in several books james the second earl of anglesey who succeeded his father in      died in    0 and was succeeded by his son james who married her grace the late duchess of buckinghamshire he died in the beginning of the year   0  and was succeeded by his brother john earl of anglesey who was vice treasurer receivergeneral and paymaster of the forces in ireland he was succeeded at his death    0 by his brother arthur who while he sat in the house of commons in ireland distinguished himself by the weight and eloquence of hi speeches and was always heard after his accession to the title of earl of anglesey with the utmost attention in the british house of peers on the death of queen anne he was appointed by king george i one of the lords justices till he arrived from hanover after which he wa sworn of his majestys privy council and on the  d of january        with henry hyde then earl of rochester made jointtreasurer of ireland and treasurer at war on the death of the duke of manchester he was on the  th of february        in full senate nanimously elected highsteward of the university of cambridge where he had his education he had been one of their representative in three several parliaments whilst he was a commoner he died on the   st of march      and was succeeded in his title by his cousin lord altham of the kingdom of ireland the state of this family for the last forty years has been very peculiar having given rise to some remarkable events and to several extraordinary claims and litigations which have employed the courts of justice in ireland and demanded the attention of the houses of peers both in ireland and in england but a relation of these facts belongs more properly to a peerage than to the present work  anselm archbishop of canterbury in the reign of william rufus and henry i was an italian by birth being born in the year  0   at aost a town at the foot of the alps belonging to the duke of savoy he was descended of a considerable family his fathers name was gundulphus and his mothers hemeberga after he had gone through a course of studies and traveled for some time in burgundy and france he took the monastic habit in the abbey of becc in normandy of which lanfranc afterward archbishop of canterbury was then prior at that time anselm was no more than    years of age three years after when lanfranc was made abbot of caen anselm succeeded him in the priory of becc and when herluin abbot of that monastery died anselm was promoted to the abbacy about the year  0   anselm came over into england being invited thither by hugh earl of chester who requested his assistance in his sickness soon after his arrival william rufus falling sick at gloucester and being pressed to fill up the sea of canterbury which had been vacant above four years thought fit to nominate anselm who with much difficulty was prevailed upon to accept that dignity before his consecration he gained a promise from the king for the restitution of all the lands which were in the possession of that see in lanfrancs time and thus having secured the temporalities of the archbishopric and done homage to the king he was consecrated with great solemnity on the  th of december  0   soon after his consecration the king intending to wrest the duchy of normandy from his brother robert endeavoring to raise what money he could for that purpose anselm made him an offer of five hundred pounds which the king thinking too little refused to accept and the archbishop thereby fell under the kings displeasure about that time he had a dispute with the bishop of london touching the right of consecrating churches in a foreign diocese the next year the king being ready to embark for normandy anselm waited upon him and desired his leave to convene a national synod in which the disorders of the church and state and the general dissolution of manners might be remedied but the king refused his request and even treated him very roughly upon which the archbishop and his retinue withdrew from court another cause of discontent between the king and the archbishop was anselms desiring leave to go to rome to receive the pall from pope urban ii whom the king of england did not acknowledge as pope being more inclined to favor the party of his competitor guibert this misunderstanding occasioned great disputes and to put an end to the controversy a council or convention was held at rockingham castle the issue of which was that the majority of the bishops being either gained or overawed by the court threw up their canonical obedience and renounced anselm for their archbishop in consequence of this proceeding anselm desired a passport to go beyond the sea till the present misunderstandings could be made up but the king absolutely refused his request and would only consent that there should be a kind of truce or suspension of the affair from march to whitsuntide during which interval the difference was to sleep but before the expiration of this term the king broke through the agreement banished several clergymen who were anselms favorites and miserably harassed the tenants of his see whitsuntide being come and the bishops having in vain endeavored to soften anselm into a compliance the king with the advice of his great men received him into favor upon his own terms and because anselm persisted in refusing to receive the pall from the kings hands it was at last agreed that the popes nuncio who had brought the pall into england should carry it down to canterbury and lay it upon the altar of the cathedral from whence anselm was to receive it as if it had been put into his hands by st peter himself things being thus adjusted the archbishop went to canterbury and received the pall with great solemnity the june following and now it was generally hoped that all occasion of difference between the king and the archbishop was removed but it appeared soon after that the reconciliation on the kings part was not sincere for william having marched his forces into wales and brought that country to submission took that opportunity to quarrel with anselm pretending he was not satisfied with the quota the archbishop had furnished for that expedition finding therefore his authority too weak to oppose the corruptions of the times he resolved to go in person to rome and consult the pope but the king to whom he applied for leave to go out of the kingdom seemed surprised at the request and gave him a flat denial notwithstanding this the archbishop resolved upon the voyage and accordingly embarked at dover but when the king heard that he had crossed the channel he seized upon the archbishopric and made every thing void which anselm had done the archbishop got safe to rome and was honorably received by the pope after a short stay in that city he accompanied the pope to a country seat near capua whither his holiness retired on account of the unhealthiness of the town and here anselm wrote a book in which he gave an account of the reason of our saviors incarnation the pope wrote to the king of england in a strain of authority enjoining him to reinstate anselm in all the profits and privileges of his see anselm likewise wrote into england upon the same subject as for the king he endeavored to get anselm discountenanced abroad and wrote to roger duke of apulia and others to that purpose but he had not credit enough it seems to gain his point for anselm was treated with all imaginable respect wherever he came this famous archbishop was very serviceable to the pope in the council of bai which was held to oppose the errors of the greek church with respect to the procession of the holy ghost in this synod anselm answered the objections of the greeks and managed the argument with so much judgment learning and penetration that he silencd his adversaries and gave general satisfaction to the western church this argument was afterward digested by him into a tract and is extant among his other works in the same council anselm geerously interposd and prevented the pope from pronouncing sentence of excommunication against the king of england for his frequent outrages on religion after the synod of bai was ended the pope and anselm returned to rome where an ambassador from the king of england was arrived in order to disprove anselms allegations and complaints against his mster and the better to effect his purpose he tried the interest of his purse and partly by presents and partly by promises he bribed the court of rome to desert anselm the archbishop perceiving how matters went would have returned to lions but the pope would not part with him and to sweeten him after his disappointment lodged him in a noble palace where his holiness made him frequent visits about that time the pope having summoned a council to fit at rome anselm had a very honorable seat assigned him and his successors this being the first time of an archbishop of canterburys appearing at a roman synod when the council broke up anselm immediately left rome and returned to lions where he was entertained for so time by hugo the archbishop he staid there till he heard the news of king williams and pope urbans death which happened not long after henry i the new king of england having restored the s of canterbury winchester and salisbury which had been seized by his predecessor anselm was solicited to return into england and ing come as far as clugny an agent from the king met him with a letter inviting him to return to his archbishopric in this letter the king sed himself for not staying till anselms return and being crowned by another prelate the archbishop being arrived in england was received with extraordinary respect by the king and the people and thus for matters went smoothly enough but when it was required of anselm that he should be reinvested by the king and do the customary homage of his predecessors he refused to comply alleging the canons of the late synod at rome about investitures the king was greatly disged at anselms noncompliance however not being well settled on the throne he was unwilling to come to a rupture it was agreed therefore that the dispute should rest till the easter following and in  time both parties were to send their agents to rome to try if they could persde the pope to dispense with the canons of the late synod in relation to investitures about this time anselm summoned a synod to meet at lambeth on occasion of the kings intended marriage with maud or matilda eldest daughter of malcolm king of scotland in this synod it was determined that the king might lawfully marry that princess notwithstanding she was generally reported to be a nun having worn the veil and had her education in a religious house soon after this marriage anselm was of signal service to king henry against his brother the duke of normandy who invaded england and landed with a formidable army at portsmouth for the archbishop not only furnished the king with a large body of men but was very active likewise in preventing a revolt from him the agents sent by the king and the archbishop to rome being returned brought with them a letter from pope paschal to the king in which his holiness absolutely refused to dispense with the canons concerning investitures the king on his part resolved not to give up what for some reigns had passed for part of the royal prerogative and thus the difference was kept on foot between the king and anselm in this dispute the majority of the bishops and temporal nobility were on the court side and some of them were very earnest with the king to break entirely with the sea of rome however it was not thought advisable to proceed to an open rupture without trying a farther expedient and therefore fresh agents were dispatched by the king to rome with instructions to offer the pope this alternative either to depart from his former declaration and relax in the point of investitures or to be content with the banishment of anselm and to lose the obedience of the english and the yearly profits accruing from that kingdom at the same time anselm dispatched two monks to inform the pope of the menaces of the english court but the kings ambassadors could not prevail with the pope to recede from his declaration his holiness protesting he would sooner lose his life than cancel the decrees of the holy fathers which resolution he signified by letters to the king and anselm soon after the king having convened the great men of the kingdom at london sent anselm word that he must either comply with the usages of his fathers reign or quit england but the agents disagreeing in their report of the popes answer anselm thought proper not to return a positive answer till farther information and thus the controversy slept for the present the next year a national synod was held under anselm at st peters westminster at which the king and the principal nobility were present the year following the king was pleased to relent and desire anselm to take a journey to rome to try if he could persuade the pope to relax anselm at the request of the bishops and barons undertook the voyage at the same time the king dispatched one william warelwast to rome this agent arriving there before anselm solicited for the king his master but to no purpose for the pope persisted in refusing to grant the king the right of investiture but at the same time his holiness wrote a very ceremonious letter to the king of england entreating him to wave the contest and promising all imaginable compliance in other matters anselm having taken leave of the court of rome returned to lions where he received a sharp and reprimanding letter from a monk acquainting him with the lamentable condition of the province of canterbury during the archbishops stay at lions the king sent another embassy to rome to try if he could prevail with the pope to being anselm to a submission but the pope instead of being gained excommunicated some of the english court who had dissuaded the king from parting with the investitures however his holiness declined pronouncing any censure against the king anselm perceiving the court of rome dilatory in its proceedings removed from lions and made a visit to the countess adela the conquerors daughter at her castle in blois this lady inquiring into the business of anselms journey he told her that after a great deal of patience and expectation he st now be forced to excommunicate the king of england the countess was extremely concerned for her brother and wrote to the pope to procure an accommodation the king who was come into normandy hearing that anselm designed to excommunicate him desired his sister to bring him with her into normandy with a promise of condescension in several articles to this anselm agreed and waited upon the king at a castle called laigle where the king restored to him the revenues of the archbishopric but would not permit him to come into england unless he would comply in the affair of the investitures which anselm refusing to do continued in france till the matter was once more laid before the pope and now the english bishops who had taken part with the court against anselm began to change their minds as appears by their letter to him in normandy in this letter after having set forth the deplorable state of the church they press him to come over with all speed promising to stand by him and pay him the regard due to his character it is subscribed by gerrard archbishop of york robert bishop of chester herbert bishop of norwich ralph bishop of chichester sampson bishop of worcester and william elect of winchester anselm expressed his satisfaction at this conduct of the bishops but acquainted them that it was not in his power to return till he was further informed of the proceedings of the court of rome in the mean time being informed that the king had fined some of the clergy for a late breach of the canons he wrote to his highness to complain of that stretch of his prerogative at length the ambassadors returned from rome and brought with them a decision more agreeable than the former for now the pope thought fit to make some advances toward gratifying the king and though he would not give up the point of investitures yet he dispensed so far as to give the bishops and abbots leave to do homage for their temporalities the king who was highly pleased with this condescension in the pope sent immediately to invite anselm into england but the messenger finding him sick the king himself went over into normandy and made him a visit at the abbey of becc where all differences between them were perfectly adjusted and now anselm being recovered from his sickness embarked for england and landing at dover was received with extraordinary marks of welcome to omit other circumstances of respect the queen herself traveled before him upon the road to provide for his better entertainment from this time nothing remarkable happened in the life of this famous archbishop excepting only his contest with thomas elected archbishop of york who endeavored to disengage himself from a dependency upon the sea of canterbury before the termination of this dispute anselm died at canterbury in the seventysixth year of his age and the seventeenth of his prelacy on the twentyfirst of april a d   0  this great prelate was author of several pieces the largest edition of his works is that published by father gerberon it is divided into three parts the first of these containing dogmatical tracts is entitled monologia the second part contains practical and devotional tracts the third part takes in anselms letters in four books as to the character of archbishop anselm it may be partly collected from the circumstances of his life above recited he has been much praised for the resolution he showed in the disputes he had with william rufus and henry i where he believed the rights of the church and the interest of religion concerned no greatness no menaces of princes nor prospect of danger could discourage him in the pursuit of his point malmesbury tells us he was a person of great strictness and selfdenial his temper and sedateness were such that after he turned monk he never was heard to utter the least reproachful word this archbishop was the first who restrained the english clergy from marrying he was canonized in the reign of henry vii at the instance of cardinal morton then archbishop of canterbury johannes sarisburiensis who wrote the life of archbishop anselm has recorded several miracles said to be wrought by him particularly he tells us that a flemish nobleman was cured of a leprosy by drinking the water in which anselm had washed his hands in celebrating the mass that he extinguished fires calmed tempests and healed diseases only by making the sign of the cross that he rescued a hare which had taken refuge under his horses feet by commanding the dogs not to pursue her any more that two soldiers were cured o an ague by tasting the crumbs of some bread he had been eating tha by praying to god he produced a spring of excellent water at the very op of a hill for the relief of certain villagers and that a ship in which e sailed having a large hole in one of her planks nevertheless took in no water so long as the holy man was on board the same author tells us that this holy archbishop continued to work miracles after his death particularly that a monk of the church of canterbury  restored to health by paying his devotions at the tomb of st anselm that one born blind deaf and dumb received sight hearing and speech by the same means that a soldier was cured of a dropsy by winding the saints girdle about his body and that the same girdle was successfully applied o the assistance of women in childbirth  anson george an eminent sea commander and distinguished nobleman of the eighteenth century was descended from an ancient and respectable family which had long been settled in staffordshire he was born at sgborough manor in the parish of colwich in that county on the   d of april      being the third son of william anson esquire by elizabeth eldest daughter and coheir of richard carrier esquire of wiswoth in derbyshire another of whose daughters by marrying sir thomas parker became afterward countess of macclesfield and was mother to the late and grandmother to the present earl the navy bing mr ansons choice he went early to sea and on the  th of may      was made second lieutenant of his majestys ship the hampshire by sir john forris commander in chief of a squadron to the baltic which promotion was confirmed by the board of admiralty in the next year he was again in the baltic in the fleet commanded by sir george byng and at this time he had an opportunity which pleased hi much of seeing on the danish shore the illustrious czar peter of russia and the famous catherine who was afterward publicly married by that prince and crowned as his empress on the   th of march        mr anson was appointed second lieutenant of the montagu one of the ships of sir george byngs squadron in the expedition to sicily and he was present in the celebrated action near that island by which the spanish fleet was effectually destroyed and the designs of the king of spain against sicily received a very considerable check on the   th of june      he was preferred to be master and commander of e weel loop and on the  st of february       he was raised to the rank of po captain and to the command of the scarborough  of war though it is possible he might derive some advantage in these early and speedy promotions from his connection with the earl of macclesfield then lord chancellor of england yet it can scarcely be supposed that they could have been so quickly attained in a time of peace if he had not given peculiar proofs of merit in his profession soon after his appointment to the scarborough he was ordered in her to south carolina in which station he continued for three years and while he resided in that province he erected a town anson bourgh and gave name to a county which is still called anson county after his return from his settlement in south carolina he always spoke with satisfaction both of that country and its inhabitants being commanded home in october      he returned to england in the following spring and was paid off in may      on the   th of october in the same year mr anson was appointed captain of the garland man of war and went out in her to south carolina from whence he was ordered back in december      and the ship was put out of commission at sheerness however having the good fortune to be well with lord torringto and sir charles wager successively first lords of the admiralty he did not remain long out of employ for on the   th of may      the command of the diamond one of the downs squadron was bestowed upon him which command he held but about three months the diamond being then paid off on the   th of january       he was again called into public service and appointed captain of the squirrel man of war in which ship he was ordered in the following april for south carolina this was the third time of his being placed upon that station and it was probably peculiarly agreeable to him on account of the property he had acquired and the settlement he had made in the province here he continued till the spring of the year      when in consequence of an order given in december      he returned to england and in the month of june was paid off at woolwich it appears from some original letters of mr anson to the board of admiralty with the fight of which we have been favored that he conducted himself in these several employments with an ability and discretion which gave general satisfaction after his last return from south carolina we find that he had staid at home between two and three years it being the  th of december      when he was put into the command of the centurion in this ship he was ordered in the february following to the coast of guinea from which station he returned to his own country by way of barbados and south carolina on the  0th of july      it is evident from the journal of the centurion during this period compared with the instructions given to captain anson by the board of admiralty that he executed with great prudence and fidelity the directions of government and it is understood in the family that he obliged the french to desist from their attempt to hinder our trade upon that coast without coming to any action at a time when it would have been very inconvenient to the british court to have had an open rupture with the court of france  mr ansons conduct in his various situations and employments had produced so favorable a character of his capacity and spirit that when in the war which broke out with spain in      it was determined to attack the american settlements of the spaniards in the great pacific ocean and by this means to affect them in their most sensible parts he was from the beginning fixed upon to be the commander of the fleet which was designed for that purpose as the history of this expedition which laid the foundation of his future fortunes has in consequence of the excellent account that has been written of it by the late mr robins and the curious and interesting nature of the subject been more read than almost any other which has ever appeared it is not necessary to give a detail of it in the present article it is well known that he departed from st helens on the   th of september    0 at the head of a squadron of five men of war a sloop of war and two victualling ships that he stopped first at madeira then on the coast of brasil and next at port st julian in patagonia that they encountered prodigious difficulties in doubling cape horn that in this perilous passage the remainder of his fleet was scattered from him and part of it never joined him again that at length he arrived at the island of juan fernandes that from thence he proceeded to peru took the town of paita anchored a few days at quibo sailed to the coast of mexico and formed the design of intercepting the acapulco ship that after stopping a while at the harbor of chequetan he determined to cross the pacific ocean that at last his squadron was reduced to his own single ship the centurion that he made some stay at tinian one of the ladrones or marian islands from which he immediately went to macao and that sailing back from macao in quest of the manilla galleon he had the good fortune of meeting with it and of taking it on the  0th of june      that after this enterprise he returned to canton from whence he embarked to england by the cape of good hope that having completed his voyage round the world he came safe to an anchor at spithead on the   th of june      and that he executed the whole of the undertaking with singular honor and advantage to himself and the officers and people under him though from original errors and defects in the embarkation and from causes in which he was in no wise concerned the grand design of the expedition was not fully answered if any of our readers should happen to be unacquainted with these transactions they will have recourse to the account of them at large that has been published under the name of mr walter it being only our intention to select such circumstances as have a more immediate relation to the personal character of mr anson and which indicate the turn of his mind as before he set sail upon the expedition he took care to furnish himself with the printed journals of the voyages to the south seas and the best manuscript accounts he could procure of all the spanish settlements upon the coasts of chili peru and mexico which he afterward carefully compared with the examinations of his prisoners and the information of several intelligent persons who fell into his hands so through the whole enterprise he acted with a remarkable discretion and with a calmness which particularly distinguishes his character when he was ready to depart from st catharines and considered that his own ship might possibly be lost or disabled from getting round cape horn he gave such directions to the other commanders as would have prevented the undertakings being even in that case abandoned his humanity was displayed at the island of juan fernandes in his assisting with his own labor and obliging the officers without distinction to give a helping hand in carrying the sick sailors in their hammocks to shore at the same place he sowed lettuces carrots and other garden plants and set in the woods a great variety of plumb apricot and peachstones for the better accommodation of his countrymen who should hereafter touch there from a like regard to future navigators commodore anson was particularly industrious in directing the roads and coasts to be surveyed and other observations to be made for he well knew by his own experience of the want of these materials of how great consequence they might prove to any british vessels which in succeeding times might be employed in those seas his integrity and generosity in the treatment of some female prisoners who had fallen into his hands and his care to prevent their meeting with any degree of rudeness from a set of sailors who had not seen a woman for near a twelvemonth are greatly to his honor by the wise and proper use which he made of the intelligence he had obtained from some spanish captures the commodore was encouraged to form the design of attacking the town of paita and his conduct in that attack added much to his reputation such was the excellent discipline to which he had accustomed his men that in the taking of the town only one man was found who was known to have so far neglected his duty as to get drunk after the attack upon paita when a spirit of envy and jealousy arose concerning the distribution of the plunder he manifested his prudence and equity in allaying this spirit and his liberality in giving up his own share but there was nothing from which mr anson derived greater personal credit or which reflected greater glory upon the english nation than his behavior to his prisoners in general and especially to the women before mentioned this behavior was so honorable in itself and so beneficent in its consequences that it deserves to be particularly noticed though his force was rendered weak by the sickness and death of numbers of his men and by the separation or loss of the larger part of his small squadron we find that he was always intent upon contriving some scheme or other by which if possible the design of his expedition might be answered when no purpose was likely to be effectual but the taking of the acapulco ship he pursued that plan with the greatest sagacity and perseverance in no instance was the fortitude of his mind more tried than when the centurion was driven out to sea from the uninhabited island of tinian himself many of the officers and part of the crew being left on shore nevertheless in this gloomy and disconsolate situation he preserved his usual composure and steadiness though he could not be without his share of inward disquietude he calmly applied to every measure which was likely to keep up the courage of his men and to facilitate their departure from the island he personally engaged in the most laborious part of the work which was necessary to the constructing of a vessel for this purpose and it was only upon the pleasing and unexpected news of the return of the centurion that throwing down his axe he by his joy broke through for the first time the equable and unvaried character which he had hitherto preserved commodore anson when he was at macao exerted great spirit and address in procuring the necessary aid from the chinese for the resitting of his ship in the scheme of taking the manilla galleon and in the actual taking of it he displayed united wisdom and courage nor did the accustomed calmness of his mind forsake him on a most trying and critical occasion when in the moment of victory the centurion was dangerously on fire near the powderroom during his subsequent stay at canton he acted in all respects with the greatest spirit and firmly maintained the privileges and honor of the british flag the perils with which he had so often been threatened pursued him to the last for on his arrival in england he found that he had sailed through the midst of a french fleet then cruizing in the channel from which he had the whole time been concealed by a fog thus was his expedition finished when it had lasted three years and nine months after having by its event says the writer of his voyage strongly evinced this important truth that though prudence intrepidity and perseverance united are not exempted from the blows of adverse fortune yet in a long series of transactions they usually rise superior to its power and in the end rarely fail of proving successful  mr anson a few days after his return to his own country was made a rear admiral of the blue and in a very short time he was chosen member of parliament for heydon in yorkshire on the   th of december      when the duke of bedford was appointed first lord of the admiralty he was appointed one of the commissioners and on the   d of april in the following year he was made a rear admiral of the white on the   th of july      he was raised to the rank of vice admiral in the latter end of the year      and the beginning of      he commanded the squadron in the channel service and bore the inconveniences of a long and tempestuous winter navigation with his usual perseverance nothing would have frustrated the success of this expedition but the accidental intelligence which was given by the master of a dutch vessel to the duke danvilles fleet of admiral ansons station and intention however being employed again early in the ensuing spring he had an opportunity of rendering a signal service to his country being then on board the prince george of  0 guns with rear admiral warren in the devonshire and twelve ships more under his command he intercepted on the  d of may      off cape finisterre a considerable fleet bound from france to the east and west indies and laden with merchandis treasure and warlike stores and took six men of war and four east indiamen not one of the enemys ships of war escaping by this great and successful exploit he defeated the pernicious designs of two hostile expeditions made a considerable addition to the force and the riches of our own kingdom and thus converted into a public benefit the intended means of a public calamity m st george captain of the invincible in allusion to the names of the two ships which had been taken and pointing to them at the same time said when he presented his sword to the conqueror monsieur vouz avez vaincu linvincible et la gloire vous suit on the   th of june following his majesty king george the second in consideration of mr ansons eminent services was pleased to raise him to the honor of an english peerage by the style and title of lord anson baron of soberton in the county of southampton and his lordship made choice of a motto very happily suited to the dangers he had gone through and the successes he had met with nil desperandum on the   th of april      he married elizabeth eldest daughter of philip lord hardwicke at that time lord chancellor of great britain which lady died without issue on the first of june    0 he had frequently the honor of convoying the late king from england to holland the first time was in the year      and ever after he constantly attended his majesty on his going abroad and on his return to this kingdom on the   th of july      his lordship was made vice admiral of great britain an appointment that is more of a civil than a military nature but which nevertheless is always given to a military man on the   th of june      he was preferred to be first commissioner of the admiralty in the room of the earl of sandwich and in the years      and      he was one of the lords justices of the kingdom during his majestys absence the squadrons fitted out in the last mentioned year on the prospect of a war with france were got ready with singular dispatch the officers sent to the ports exerting themselves in a remarkable manner that more success did not attend them was owing to accidents mr boscawen commanded one division of the fleet and sir edward hawke the other and both these gallant admirals always served with credit often with the most brilliant success it was the run of the times inflamed by party writers to blame lord anson for not sending a fleet to relieve minorca in time when port mahon was besieged by the duke of richlieu and it was alleged that when he did send one it was not strong enough as to his not sending it sooner this was occasioned in a great measure by mr boscawens squadron on which we depended for a supply of seamen not coming in by several weeks so early as was expected and after that the government was kept in suspense by the alarms of an invasion founded on very particular intelligence with regard to the strength of the fleet the ablest seaofficers men whose judgments no one could dispute always thought that the force under byng was quite sufficient it was a match in numbers for the french admiral and was a squadron remarkably well appointed to this may be added that neither the time of sending a fleet nor the strength of it depended solely upon the first lord of the admiralty but must have had the concurrent opinion of the whole cabinet on the   th of november      lord anson upon a change in the administration resigned his post as first commissioner of the admiralty a very accurate inquiry was made in the next session of parliament into the affair of minorca and the ministry of that time were by several resolutions of the house of commons acquitted of any blame or neglect of duty on the   th of february      he was made an admiral and on the  d of july he was again placed at the head of the admiralty board where he continued during the remainder of his life he came in with his old friends the duke of newcastle and the earl of hardwicke and in the most honorable manner for he renewed his seat with the concurrence of every individual in the ministry mr pit resuming the seals as secretary of state and with the particular approbation of king george the second all the rest of his conduct as first commissioner of the admiralty was crowned with success under the most glorious administration which this country ever saw the last time that lord anson commanded at sea was in      to cover the expedition against the coast of france being then admiral of the white and having hoisted his flag on board the royal george of  00 guns he sailed from spithead on the first of june with a formidable fleet sir edward hawke serving under him and by continually cruizing before breast he protected the several descents which were made that summer at st maloes cherburg etc the french fleet not venturing to come out he kept his own squadron and seamen in constant exercise a thing which he thought had been too much disregarded on the  0th of july      his lordship was raised to the dignity of admiral and commander in chief of the fleet and in a few days he sailed from harwich in the charlotte yacht to convoy her present majesty to england whom he landed after a rough and tedious passage on the  th of september in february      he went to portsmouth to accompany the queens brother prince charles of mecklenburgh and to show him the arsenal and the fleet which was then upon the point of sailing under the command of sir george pocock for the havanna lord anson in attending the prince caught a violent cold that was accompanied with a gouty disorder under which he languished two or three months this cold at length settled upon his lungs and was the immediate cause of his death he died at his seat at moorpark in hertfordshire on the  th of june      and was buried in the family vault at colwich besides the other honors we have mentioned he was a member of his majestys privy council one of the elder brethren of trinityhouse and a governor of the charter house he was very assiduous at the admiralty board and remarkably quick in making naval dispositions of every kind and in appropriating the proper strength and proper sort of ships to the different services he liked to see his table filled with the gentlemen of the navy and many eminent and valuable men of that profession frequently met there among the various services which will render the name of anson illustrious his discreet and successful choice of officers deserves particularly to be mentioned as will be allowed by all who recollect that some of the most distinguished as sir charles saunders captain saumarez sir percy brett admiral keppel sir peter denis admiral campbell and others were either his lieutenants in the centurion or served under him on different occasions he may in general be said to have been a true friend and patron to men of real merit and capacity in the service in a late work the editor of which has taken very little pains to obtain authentic information concerning the persons treated of it is asserted that lord anson at home lessened his great reputation by a foolish attachment to gaming that having seen little of the polite world he easily became the dupe of sharpers in high life who eased him of a considerable share of his wealth and that the ridicule he incurred upon these occasions it is thought affected his spirits and contributed not a little to bring on that decline which shortened his days but we have the best authority for saying that this representation of things is as false as it is injurious to his lordships character upon the whole he neither won nor lost by gaming and he made it like hundreds of others who pass uncensured his amusement rather than his business to affirm that any ridicule affected his spirits is an absolutely groundless assertion the great regard which was shown him in all the companies he frequented must put his memory above such an aspersion lord anson left his whole fortune to his brother thomas anson esquire who was member of parliament for litchfield and with whom he had always lived in the strictest friendship this gentleman was well known for his liberal patronage of and his exquisite skill in the fine arts upon his decease the united fortunes of the family devolved to his nephew by his eldest sister george adams esquire who has assumed the name of anson  anthony or antony dr francis a very learned physician and chemist in the latter end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth centuries his father was an eminent goldsmith in the city of london and had an employment of considerable value in the jeweloffice under the reign of queen elizabeth this son of his was born april       0 and having been carefully instructed in the first rudiments of learning while at home was about the year      sent to the university of cambridge where he studied with great diligence and success and some time in the year      took the degree of master of arts it appears from his own writings that he applied himself for many years that he studied in that university to the theory and practice of chemistry with sedulous industry and made no small progress it is not at all clear from any memoirs that ave reached our hands when he left cambridge and came up to london but it seems highly probable that it was not before he attained the age of forty he began soon after his arrival to publish to the world he effects of his chemical studies and in the year      sent abroad his first treatise concerning the excellency of a medicine drawn from gold but not having taken the necessary precautions of addressing himself to the college of physicians for their license he fell under their displeasure and being some time in the year   00 summoned before the preent and censors he confessed that he had practiced physic in london for somewhat more than six months and had cured twenty persons or more of several diseases to whom he had given purging and vomiting physic and to others a diaphoretic medicine prepared from gold and mercury as their case required but withal acknowledged that he had no license and being examined in several parts of physic and found inexpert he was interdicted practice about a month after he was committed to the counterprison and fined in the sum of five pounds propter illicitam praxin that is for prescribing physic against the statutes and privilege of the college but upon his application to the lord chief justice he was set at liberty which gave so great an umbrage to the college that the president and one of the censors waited on the chief justice to request his favor in defending and preserving the college privileges upon which mr anthony submitted himself promised to pay his fine and was forbidden practice but not long after he was accused again of practicing physic and upon his own confession was fined five pounds which fine on his refusing to pay it was increased to twenty pounds and he committed to prison till he paid it neither were the college satisfied with this but commenced a suit at law against him in the name of the queen as well as of the college in which they prevailed and obtained judgment against him but after some time were prevailed upon by the entreaties of his wife to remit their share of the penalty as appears by their warrant to the keeper of the prison for his discharge dated under the college seal the  th of august   0  after his release he seems to have met with considerable patrons who were able to protect him from the authority of the college and though dr goodal tells us that this learned society thought him weak and ignorant in physic yet it seems there were other learned bodies of another opinion since after all these censures and being tossed about from prison to prison he became doctor of physic in our own universities this did not hinder new complaints being brought against him by dr tailor and another physician who grounded their proceedings chiefly on his giving a certain nostrum which he called aurum potabile or potable gold and which he represented to the world as an universal medicine there were at this time also several things written against him and his manner of practice insinuating that he was very inaccurate in his method of philosophising that the virtues of metals as to physical uses were very uncertain and that the boasted effects of this medicine were destitute of proof dr anthony upon this published a very learned and modest defense of himself and his aurum potabile in latin written with great decency much skill in chemistry and with an apparent knowledge in the theory and history of physic this book which he published in    0 was printed at the university press of cambridge and had a very florid dedication to king james prefixed he likewise annexed such certificates of cures under the hands of several persons of distinction and some too of the faculty that it very plainly appeared he did not by any means deserve to be treated as an ignorant empiric or a mere pretender to chemistry his book however was quickly answered and the controversy about aurum potabile grew so warm that he was obliged to publish another apology in the english language which was also translated into latin and is still in great esteem abroad yet here at home it was far from answering the doctors expectation for it did not at all abate the opposition formed against his practice by the faculty or allay that bitterness with which his opponents treated his argument and writings but considered in another light it proved very advantageous to him for it procured the general good will of ordinary readers and contributed exceedingly to support and extend his practice notwithstanding all the pains taken to decry it yet what chiefly contributed to maintain his own reputation and thereby reflected credit on his medicine was his unblemished character in private life for our dr anthony was a man of unaffected piety untainted probity of easy address great modesty and boundless charity which procured him many friends and left it not in the power of his enemies to attack any part of his conduct except that of dispensing a medicine of which they had no opinion it is not either our inclination or agreeable to the design of this work to enter deeply into this controversy but it may not be amiss to observe that though much has been said to discredit the use of gold in medicine yet some very able and ingenious men have written very plausibly in support of those principles on which dr anthonys practice was founded the age in which dr anthony flourished was very favorable to his notion since chemistry was then full as much admired though perhaps not so well understood as at present he had therefore a very extensive and beneficial practice which enabled him to live hospitably at his house in bartholomewclose and to be very liberal in his alms to the poor he died on the   th of may      in the   th year of his age and was buried in the church of st bartholomew the great i the isle which joins to the north side of the chancel where a handsome monument has been erected to his memory with a suitable inscription our author was twice married and by his last wife whose name was elizabeth he had two sons john and charles both physicians the former sold his fathers aurum potabile and lived by it very handsomely the latter settled in the town of bedford where he attained the character of a learned honest and industrious man in his profession  antinous this celebrated youth lived in the reign of adrian and has been universally celebrated for his unrivalled beauty and indeed if the statues intaglios and other remains of antiquity which were designed to perpetuate his memory may be thought faithfully to represent his person no one can dispute his claim to external loveliness but antinous lived in an age when beauty was more dangerous to male than to female youth the emperor beheld his blooming graces with the eyes of infamous desire and if nature could permit us to suppose reciprocity in such detestable attachments it would seem that the youth returned the affection of his master with an equal ardour the unbridled and extravagant passion of adrian was as blasphemous as it was otherwise abhorrent for at the death of this minion he not only in his own person devoted to him that worship which was due to god but caused divine honors to be paid him through all the regions of his extensive empire it appears from diverse authors that attributes of mercury of apollo and of bacchus were ascribed to him and that learned antiquarian mr bowman in his dissertation on an intaglio of antinous under the figure of mercury gives us good reason to suppose he was honored by the egyptians as their annubius the manner of his death is variously related  some authors insisting that he offered his life a voluntary sacrifice for the emperor upon the absurd pagan notion that by such means he might prolong the fated date of the friend who was dear to him others relate that from the same motive he yielded himself a ready victim for the completion of certain mysteries of magic in which adrian was engaged while a third class assert that he drowned himself in the nile on account of adrians long stay in egypt be this as it will the emperor lamented him with tears and anguish deified him had temples erected to him appointed priests and prophets to officiate in his worship and deliver his supposed oracles had the town in which he was reputed to have died rebuilt and called by his name and being told that a new star had made its appearance in the heavens he affirmed it to be the soul of this favorite  antonides vander goes john an eminent dutch poet born at goes in zealand the  d of april      his parents were anabaptists people of good character but of low circumstances they went to live at amsterdam when antonides was about four years old and in the ninth year of his age he began his studies under the direction of adrian junius and james cocceius antonides took great pleasure in reading the latin poets and carefully compared them with grotius heinsius etc by this means he acquired a taste for poetry and enriched his mind with noble ideas he first attempted to translate some pieces of ovid horace and other ancients and having formed his taste on these excellent models he at length undertook one of the most difficult tasks in poetry to write a tragedy this was entitled trazil or the invasion of china antonides however was so modest as not to permit it to be published vondel who was then engaged in a dramatic piece which was taken also from some event that happened in china read antonidess tragedy and was so well pleased with it that he declared if the author would not print it he would take some passages out of it and make use of them in his own tragedy which he did accordingly and it was reckoned much to the honor of antonides to have written what might be adopted by so great a poet as vondel was acknowledged to be by all good judges upon the conclusion of the peace betwixt great britain and holland in the year      antonides wrote a piece entitled bellona aan band i e bellona chained a very elegant poem consisting of several hundred verses the applause with which this piece was received excited him to try his genius in something more considerable he accordingly wrote an epic poem which he entitled the river y the description of this river or rather lake is the subject of the poem which is divided into four books in the first the poet gives a very pompous description of all that is remarkable on that bank of the y on which amsterdam is built in the second he opens to himself a larger field he begins with the praises of navigation and describes the large fleets which cover the y as an immense forest and thence go to every part of the world to bring home whatever may satisfy the necessity the luxury or pride of men the third book is an ingenious fiction which supposes the poet all of a sudden carried to the bottom of the river y where he sees the deity of the river with his demigods and nymphs adorning and dressing themselves to go to a feast which was to be celebrated at neptunes court upon the anniversary of the marriage of thetis with peleus in the fourth book he describes the other bank of the y adorned with several cities of north holland and in the close of the work addresses himself to the magistrates of amsterdam to whose wisdom he ascribes the riches and flourishing condition of that powerful city  antonidess parents had bred him up an apothecary but his remarkable genius for poetry soon gained him the esteem and friendship of several persons of distinction and particularly of mr buisero one of the lords of the admiralty at amsterdam and a great lover of poetry who sent him at his expense to pursue his studies at leyden where h remained till he took his degree of doctor of physic and then his patro gave him a place in the admiralty in the year      antonides married susanna bermans a ministers daughter who had also a talent for poetry his marriage was celebrated by several eminent poets particularly by the celebrated peter francius professor of eloquence who composed some latin verses on the occasion antonides in the preface to his heroic poem promised the life of the apostle paul which like virgils aeneid was to be divided into twelve books but he never finished that design for only a few fragments of it have appeared and the reason he gave for not bringing it to a conclusion was that he durst not meddle with theological subjects being persuaded whatever moderation he should observe he must displease some party after marriage he did not much indulge his poetic genius and within a few years he fell into a consumption of which he died on the   th of september      being then but thirtyseven years and a few months old he is esteemed the most eminent dutch poet after vondel whom he studied to imitate and is thought to have excelled in sweetness of expression and smoothness of style but in accuracy and loftiness he is greatly inferior to his original his works have been printed several times having been collected by his father anthony tansz the last edition was printed by nicholas ten hoom at amsterdam in the year      in quarto under the direction of david van hoogstraaten one of the masters of the latin school of that city who added to it also the life of the poet  antoninus philosophus marcus aurelius the roman emperor born at rome the   th of april in the    st year of the christian era he was called by several names till he was admitted into the aurelian family when he took the name of marcus aurelius antoninus hadrian upon the death of cejonius commodus turned his eyes upon marcus aurelius but as he was not then eighteen years of age and consequently too young for so important a station he fixed upon antoninus pius whom he adopted upon condition that he should likewise adopt marcus aurelius the year after this adoption hadrian appointed him questor though he had not yet attained the age prescribed by the laws after the death of hadrian aurelius married faustina the daughter of antoninus pius by whom he had several children in the year     he was invested with new honors by the emperor pius in which he behaved in such a manner as endeared him to that prince and the whole people  upon the death of pius which happened in the year     he was obliged by the senate to take upon him the government in the management of which he took lucius verus as his colleague dion cassius says that the reason of doing this was that he might have leisure to pursue his studies and on account of his ill state of health lucius being of a strong vigorous constitution and consequently more fit for the fatigues of war the same day he took upon him the name of antoninus which he gave likewise to verus his colleague and betrothed his daughter lucilla to him the two emperors went afterward to the camp where after having performed the funeral rites of pius they pronounced each of them a panegyric to his memory they discharged the government in a very amicable manner it is said that soon after antoninus had performed the apotheosis of pius petitions were presented to him by the pagan priests philosophers and governors of provinces in order to excite him to persecute the christians which he rejected with indignation and interposed his authority to their protection by writing a letter to the common assembly of asia then held at ephesus the happiness which the empire began to enjoy under the two emperors was interrupted in the year     by a dreadful inundation of the tiber which destroyed a vast number of cattle and occasioned a famine at rome this calamity was followed by the parthian war and at the same time the catti ravaged germany and rhaetia lucius verus went in person to oppose the parthians and antoninus continued at rome where his presence was necessary  during this war with the parthians about the year     or     antoninus sent his daughter lucilla to verus she having been betrothed to him in marriage and attended her as far as brundusium he intended to have conducted her to syria but it having been insinuated by some persons that his design of going into the east was to  the honor of having finished the parthian war he returned to rome the romans having gained a victory over the parthians who were obliged to abandon mesopotamia the two emperors triumphed over them at rome in the year     and were honored with the title of fathers of their country this year was fatal on account of a terrible pestilence which spread itself over the whole world and a famine under which rome labored it was likewise in this year that the marcomanni and many other people of germany took up arms against the romans but the two emperors having marched in person against them obliged the germans to sue for peace the war however was renewed the year following and the two emperors marched again in person but lucius verus was seized with an apoplectic fit and died at altinum  in the year   0 antoninus made vast preparations against the germans and carried on the war with great vigor during this war in     a very extraordinary event is said to have happened which according to dion cassius was as follows antoninuss army being blocked up by the quadi in a very disadvantageous place where there was no possibility of procuring water in this situation being worn out with fatigue and wounds oppressed with heat and thirst and incapable of retiring or engaging the enemy in an instant the sky was covered with clouds and there fell a vast quantity of rain the roman army were about to quench their thirst when the enemy came upon them with such fury that they certainly must have been defeated had it not been for a shower of hail accompanied with a storm of thunder and lightning which fell upon the enemy without the least annoyance to the romans who by this means gained the victory in     antoninus made a treaty with several nations of germany soon after avidius cassius governor of syria revolted from the emperor this insurrection however was put an end to by the death of cassius who was killed by a centurion named anthony antoninus behaved with great lenity toward those who had been engaged in cassiuss party he would not put to death nor imprison nor even sit in judgment himself upon any of the senators engaged in this revolt but he referred them to the senate fixing a day for their appearance as if it had been only a civil affair he wrote also to the senate desiring them to act with indulgence rather than severity not to shed the blood of any senator or person of quality or of any other person whatsoever but to allow this honor to his reign that even under the misfortune of a rebellion none had lost their lives except in the first heat of the tumult and i wish said he that i could even recall to life many of those who have been killed for revenge in a prince hardly ever pleases for even when just it is considered too severe in     antoninus visited syria and egypt the kings of those countries and ambassadors also from parthia came to visit him he stayed several days at smyrna and after he had settled the affairs of the east went to athens on which city he conferred several honors and appointed public professors there from thence he returned to rome with his son commodus whom he chose consul for the year following though he was then but sixteen years of age having obtained a dispensation for that purpose on the   th of september the same year he gave him the title of imperator and on the   d of december he entered rome in triumph with commodus on account of the victories gained over the germans dion cassius tells us that he remitted all the debts which were due to himself and the public treasury during fortysix years from the time that hadrian had granted the same favor and burnt all the writings relating to those debts he applied himself likewise to correct many enormities and introduced several excellent regulations in the year     he left rome with his son commodus in order to go against the marcomanni and other barbarous nations and the year following gained a considerable victory over them and would in all probability have entirely subdued them in a very short time had he not been taken with an illness which carried him off on the   th of march   0 in the fiftyninth year of his age and nineteenth of his reign the whole empire regretted the loss of so valuable a prince and paid the greatest regard to his memory he was ranked amongst the gods and every person almost had a statue of him in their houses his book of meditations has been much admired by the best judges it is wrote in greek and consists of twelve books there have been several editions of it in greek and latin of all books says the learned meric casaubon in his preface to the second edition of his translation of this work into english that have ever been written by any heathen i know not any which either in regard of itself for the bulk thereof or in regard of the author deserves more respect than this of marcus antoninus the chiefest subject of the book is the vanity of the world and all worldly things as wealth and honor life etc and the end and scope of it to teach a man how to submit himself wholly to gods providence and to live content and thankful in what estate or calling soever in the author of it two main things i conceive very considerable first that he was a very great man one that had good experience of what he spoke and secondly that he was a very good man one that had lived as he did write and exactly as far as was possible to a natural man performed what he exhorted others to be it therefore spoken to the immortal praise and commendation of antoninus that as he did write so he did live never did writings so conspire to give all possible testimony of goodness uprightness innocence and whatever could amongst heathens be most commendable as they have done to commend this one they commend him not as the best prince only but absolutely as the best man and best philosopher that ever was and it is his proper commendation that being so commended he is commended without exception if any thing had ever been talked against him the historians mention it but as a talk not credited by them nor by any that ever were of any credit his meditations were his actions his deeds if you consider him as a man and a heathen did agree with his sentences  antonio nicholas knight of the order of st james and canon of seville did great honor to the spanish nation by his bibliotheque of their writers he was born at seville in      being the son of a gentleman whom king philip iv made president of the admiralty established in that city in      after having gone through a course of philosophy and divinity in his own country he went to study law at salamanca where he closely attended the lectures of francisco ramos del manzano afterward counselor to the king and preceptor to charles ii upon his return to seville after he had finished his lawstudies at salamanca he shut himself up in the royal monastery of benedictines where he employed himsell several years in writing his bibliotheca hispanica having the use of the books of bennet de la sana abbot of that monastery and dean of the faculty of divinity at salamanca in the year      he was sent to rome by king philip iv in the character of agentgeneral from this prince he had also particular commissions from the inquisition of spain the viceroys of naples and sicily and the governor of milan to negociate their affairs at rome the cardinal of arragon procured him from pope alexander vii a canonry in the church of seville the income whereof he employed in charity and purchasing of books he had above thirty thousand volumes in his library by this help joined to a continual labor and indefatigable application he was at last enabled to finish his bibliotheca hispanica in four volumes in folio two of which he published at rome in the year      the work consists of two parts the one containing the spanish writers who flourished before the fifteenth century and the other those since the end of that century after the publication of these two volumes he was recalled to madrid by king charles ii to take upon him the office of counselor to the crusade which he discharged with great integrity till his death which happened in      he left nothing at his death but his vast library which he had brought from rome to madrid and his two brothers and nephews being unable to publish the remaining volumes of his bibliotheca sent them to cardinal daguisne who paid the charge of the impression and committed the care thereof to monsieur marti his librarian who added notes to them in the name of the cardinal antonio had been also engaged in a work entitled trophaeum historicoecclesiasticum deo veritati erectum ex manubiis pseudo historicorum qui etc he had projected several other works in his mind but we must not omit that which he published at antwerp in      de exilio sive de poena exilii exiliumque condition et juribus in folio  antonius marcus a famous roman orator at his first entrance into the service of the commonwealth he gave a remarkable proof of his spirit and good sense which deserves to be mentioned he had obtained the questorship of the province of asia and had gone as far as brundusium to embark in order to take upon him his office when his friends sent him word that he was accused of incest and that his cause was to be heard before cassius the praetor a judge of such severity that his tribunal was said to be the rock of the accused antonius might have taken the advantage of the law which forbids any accusation to be admitted against those who were absent on the public service but he chose rather to justify himself in form and for this purpose returned to rome where he stood his trial and was acquitted with great honor sicily fell to his lot during his pretorship and he cleared the seas of the pirates which infested the coast he was made consul with a posthumous albinus in the year of rome     when he opposed the turbulent designs of sextus titus tribune of the people with great resolution and success some time after he was made governor of cilicia in quality of proconsul where he performed so many great exploits that he obtained the honor of a triumph we cannot omit observing that in order to improve his great talent for eloquence he became a scholar to the greatest men at rhodes and athens in his way to cilicia and when on his return to rome soon after he was appointed censor which office he discharged with great reputation having carried his cause before the people against marcus duronius who had preferred an accusation of bribery against him in revenge for antoniuss having erazed his name out of the list of senators which this wise censor had done because duronius when tribune of the people had abrogated a law which restrained immoderate expense in feasts he was one of the greatest orators ever known at rome and it was owing to him according to the testimony of cicero that rome might boast herself a rival even to greece itself in the art of eloquence he defended amongst many others marcus aquilius and moved the judges in so sensible a manner by the tears he shed and the scars he showed upon the breast of his client that he carried his cause cicero has given us the character of his eloquence and of his action he never would publish any of his pleadings that he might not as he said be proved to say in one cause what might be contrary to what he should advance in another he affected to be a man of no learning his modesty and many other qualifications rendered him no less dear to many persons of distinction than his eloquence made him universally admired he was unfortunately killed during the fatal disturbances raised by marius and cinna it was discovered where he had concealed himself and soldiers were immediately sent to dispatch him he spoke to them in such a manner that they were greatly affected and there was none but the commander himself who had the cruelty to kill him and he had not heard his discourse but had just entered into the room full of indignation that his soldiers had not executed his orders this happened in the year of rome      apelles one of the most celebrated painters of antiquity he was born in the isle of cos and flourished in the time of alexander the great he was in high favor with this prince who made a law that no other person should draw his picture but apelles he accordingly drew him holding a thunderbolt in his hand the piece was finished with so much skill and dexterity that it used to be said there were two alexanders one invincible the son of philip the other inimitable the production of apelles alexander gave him likewise another remarkable proof of his regard for when he employed apelles do draw campaspe one of his mistresses having found that he had conceived an affection for her he resigned her to him and it was from her that apelles is said to have drawn his venus anadyomene this prince went often to see apelles when at work and one day when he was overlooking him we are told that he talked so absurdly in regard to painting that apelles desired him to hold his tongue telling him that the very boys who mixed the colors laughed at him mr freinshemius however thinks it incredible that apelles would make use of such an expression to alexander or that the latter who had so good an education and so fine a genius would talk so impertinently of painting nor is it likely perhaps that apelles would have expressed himself to this prince in the manner which he is reported to have done upon another occasion alexander as we are told having seen his picture drawn by apelles did not commend it so much as it deserved a little after a horse happened to be brought which neighed at sight of the horse painted in the same picture upon this apelles is said to have told alexander sir it is plain this horse understands painting better than your majesty  one of apelless chief excellencies was his making his pictures exactly resemble the persons represented insomuch that the physiognomists are said to have been able to form a judgment as readily from his portraits as if they had seen the originals his readiness and dexterity at taking a likeness was of great service to him in extricating him from a difficulty in which he was involved at the court of egypt he had not the good fortune to be in favor with ptolemy a storm forced him however to take shelter at alexandria during the reign of this prince a mischievous fellow in order to do him an injury went to him and in the kings name invited him to dinner apelles went and seeing the king in a prodigious passion told him by way of excuse that he should not have come to his table but by his orders he was commanded to show the man who had invited him this was impossible the person who had put the trick upon him not being present apelles however drew a sketch of his picture on the wall with a coal the first lines of which discovered him immediately to ptolemy  apelles left many excellent pictures which are mentioned with great honor by the ancients but his venus anadyomene is reckoned his masterpiece his antigonus has also been much celebrated this was drawn with a sideface to hide the deformity of antigonus who had lost an eye his picture of calumny has also been much taken notice of  apollonius rhodius a greek writer born in alexandria under the reign of ptolemy euergetes king of egypt he was a scholar of callimachus whom he is accused of having treated with ingratitude whereby he drew upon himself the indignation of this poet who gave him the name of ibis from a bird of egypt which used to purge itself with its bill apollonius wrote a poem upon the expedition of the golden fleece the work is styled argonautica and consists of four books quintilian in his institutiones oratoriae says that this performance is wrote aequali quadam mediocritate that the author observed an exact medium between the sublime and low style in writing longinus says also that apollonius never sinks in his poem but has kept it up in an uniform and equal manner however that he falls infinitely short of homer notwithstanding the faults of the latter because the sublime though subject to irregularities is always preferable to every other kind of writing gyraldus speaking of this poem commends it as a work of great variety and labor but says however that the style and manner of it are harsh in some places though quite otherwise where this poet describes the passion of medea this he painted in such a manner that virgil himself was so pleased with it that he made no scruple to copy it almost entirely in the story of dido and aeneas  apollonius not meeting at first with that encouragement which he expected at alexandria removed to rhodes where he set up a school for rhetoric and gave lectures for a considerable time thence he got the name of rhodius here it was that he corrected and put the finishing hand to his argonautics which being publicly recited met with universal applause and the author was complimented with the freedom of the city he is said to have written a book concerning archilochus a treatise of the origin of alexandria cnidos and other works he published his poem of the argonautics at alexandria upon his return thither when sent for by ptolemy euergetes to succeed eratosthenes as keeper of the public library it is supposed that he died in this office and that he was buried in the same tomb with his master callimachus the ancient scholia upon his argonautics are still extant they are thought to be written by tarrhaeus theon and others henry stephens published an edition of this poem in greek in quarto in      with the scholia and his own annotations there was likewise an edition published in greek and latin at leyden in      by jeremy hoclzlin  apollonius a pythagorean philosopher born at tyana in cappadocia about the beginning of the first century at sixteen years of age he became a strict observer of pythagorass rules renouncing wine women and all sorts of flesh not wearing shoes letting his hair grow and wearing nothing but linen he soon after set up for a reformer of mankind and chose his habitation in a temple of aesculapius where he is said to have performed many wonderful cures philostratus has wrote the life of apollonius in which there are numberless fabulous stories recounted of him we are told that he went five years without speaking and yet during this time that he stopped many seditions in cilicia and pamphilia that he traveled and set up for a legislator and that he gave out he understood all languages without having ever learned them and that he could tell the thoughts of men and understood the oracles which birds gave by their singing the heathens were fond of opposing the pretended miracles of this man to those of our savior and by a treatise which eusebius wrote against one hierocles we find that the drift of the latter in the treatise which eusebius refutes seems to have been to draw a parallel betwixt jesus christ and apollonius in which he gives the preference to this philosopher  mr du pin has wrote a confutation of philostratuss life of apollonius in this he proves   that the history of this philosopher is destitute of such proofs as can be credited   that philostratus has not wrote a history but a romance   that the miracles ascribed to apollonius carry strong marks of falsehood and there is not one which may not be imputed to chance or artifice   that the doctrine of this philosopher is in many particulars opposite to right sense and reason  apollonius wrote some works which are now lost  appian an eminent historian who wrote the roman history in the greek language he flourished under the reigns of the emperors trajan and adrian and he speaks of the destruction of jerusalem as of an event which happened in his time he was born of a good family in alexandria from whence he went to rome where he distinguished himself so much at the bar that he was chosen one of the procurators of the emperor and the government of a province was committed to him he wrote the roman history in a very peculiar method he did not compile it in a continued series after the manner of livy but wrote distinct histories of all the nations that had been conquered by the romans and placed every thing relating to those nations in their proper order of time it was divided into three volumes which contained twentyfour books or twentytwo according to charles stephens volaterranus and sigonius photius tells there were nine books concerning the civil wars though there are but five now extant this performance of his has been charged with many errors and imperfections but photius is of opinion he wrote with the utmost regard to truth and has shown the greatest knowledge of military affairs of any of the historians for while we read him we in a manner see the battles which he describes but his chief talent continues that author is displayed in his orations in which he moves the passions as he thinks proper either in reviving the resolution of the soldiers or repressing the impetuosity of those who are too precipitate in the preface of his work appian gives a general description of the roman empire of all this voluminous work there remains only what treats of the punic syrian parthian mithridatic and spanish wars with those against hannibal the civil wars and the wars in illyricum and some fragments of the celtic or gallic wars  arabella stuart commonly called the lady arabella so often talked of for a queen that custom seems to have given her a right to an article in this manner under her christian name as that by which our historians distinguish her she was the daughter of charles stuart earl of lenox who was younger brother to henry lord darnley father to king james vi of scotland and i of england by elizabeth daughter of sir william cavendish knt she was born as near as can be computed in the year      and educated at london under the eye of the old countess of lenox her grandmother she was far from being either beautiful in her person or from being distinguished by any extraordinary qualities of mind and yet she met with many admirers on account of her royal descent and near relation to the crown of england her father dying in the year      and leaving her thereby sole heiress as some understood of the house of lenox several matches were thought of for her at home and abroad her cousin king james inclined to have married her to lord esme stuart whom he had created duke of lenox and whom before his marriage he considered as his heir but this match was prevented by queen elizabeth though it was certainly a very fit one in all respects as the english succession was at this time very problematical the great powers on the continent formed many designs about it and thought of many husbands for the lady arabella such as the duke of savoy a prince of the house of farnese and others in the mean time this lady had some thoughts of marrying herself at home as a celebrated writer informs us to a son of the earl of northumberlands but it is not credible that this took effect though he says it did privately the very attempt procured her queen elizabeths displeasure who confined her for it in the mean time her title to the crown such as it was became the subject amongst many others of father personss famous book wherein are all the arguments for and against her and which served to divulge her name and descent all over europe and yet this book was not very favorable to her interest on the death of the queen some malcontents framed an odd design of disturbing the public peace and amongst other branches of their dark scheme one was to seize the lady arabella and to cover their proceedings by the sanction of her title intending also to have married her to some english nobleman the more to increase their interest and the better to please the people but this conspiracy was fatal to none but its authors and those who conversed with them being speedily defeated many taken and some executed as for the lady arabella is does not appear that she had any knowledge of this engagement in her behalf whatever it was for domestic writers are perplexed and foreign historians run into absurdities when they endeavor to explain it she continued at liberty and in some kind of favor at court though her circumstances were narrow till the latter end of the year   0  when some way or other she drew upon her king jamess displeasure however at christmas when there was much mirth and good humor at court she was again taken into favor and had a service of plate presented to her of the value of two hundred pounds a thousand merks given her to pay her debts and some addition made to her annual income this seems to have been done in order to have gained her to the interest of the court and to put the notions of marriage she had entertained out of her head all which however proved ineffectual for in the beginning of the month of february   0  she was detected in an intrigue with mr william seymour son to lord beauchamp and grandson to the earl of hertford to whom notwithstanding she was privately married some time afterward upon this discovery they were both carried before the council and severely reprimanded and then dismissed in the summer of the year    0 the marriage broke out whereupon the lady was sent into close custody at the house of sir thomas parry in lambeth and mr seymour was committed to the tower for his contempt in marrying a lady of the royal family without the kings leave it does not appear that this confinement was attended with any great severity to either for the lady was allowed the use of sir thomas parrys house and gardens and the like gentleness in regard to his high quality was shown to mr seymour some intercourse they had by letters was after a time discovered and a resolution taken thereupon to send the lady to durham a resolution which threw her into deep affliction upon this by the interposition of friends she and her husband concerted a scheme for their escape which was successfully executed in the beginning though it ended unluckily the lady under the care of sir james crofts was at the house of mr conyers at highgate from whence she was to have gone the next day to durham on which she put a fair countenance now notwithstanding the trouble she had before shown this made her keepers the more easy and gave her an opportunity of disguising herself which she did on monday the  d of june      by drawing over her petticoats a pair of large frenchfashioned hose putting on a mans doublet a peruke which covered her hair a hat a black cloak russet boots with red tops and a rapier by her side thus equipped she walked out between three and four with mr markham they went a mile and a half to a little inn where a person attended with their horses the lady by that time she came thither was so weak and faint that the hostler who held the stirrup when she mounted said that gentleman would hardly hold out to london riding however so raised her spirits that by the time she came to blackwall she was pretty well recovered there they found waiting for them two men a gentlewoman and a chambermaid with one boat full of mr seymours and her trunks and another boat for their persons in which they hasted from thence toward woolwich being come so far they bade the watermen row on to gravesend there the poor fellows were desirous to land but for a double freight were contented to go on to lee yet being almost tired by the way they were forced to lie still at tilbury whilst the rowers went on shore to refresh themselves then they proceeded to lee and by that time the day appeared and they discovered a ship at anchor a mile beyond them which was the french bark that waited for them here the lady would have lain at ancho expecting mr seymour but through the importunity of her followers they forthwith hoisted sail and put to sea in the mean time mr seymour with a peruke and beard of black hair and in a tawney cloth suit walked alone without suspicion from his lodging out at the great west door of the tower following a cart that had brought him billets from thence he walked along by the towerwharf by the warders of the south gate and so to the iron gate where one rodney was ready with a pair of oars to receive him when they came to lee they found that the french ship was gone the billows rising high they hired a fisherman for twenty shillings to put them on board a certain ship that they saw under sail that ship they found not to be it they looked for so they made forwards to the next under sail which was a ship from newcastle this with much ado they hired for forty pounds to carry them to calais and the master performed his bargain by which means mr seymour escaped and continued in flanders on tuesday in the afternoon my lord treasurer being advertised that the lady arabella had made an escape sent immediately to the lieutenant of the tower to set strict guard over mr seymour which he promised after his yare manner he would thoroughly do that he would but coming to the prisoners lodgings he found to his great amazement that he was gone from thence one whole day before a pink being dispatched from the downs into calais road seized the french bark and brought back the lady and those with her as soon as she was brought to town she was after examination committed to the tower declaring that she was not so sorry for her own restraint as she should be glad if mr seymour escaped for whose welfare she affirmed she was more concerned than for her own her aunt the countess of shrewsbury was likewise committed on suspicion of having prompted the lady arabella not only to her escape but to other things it being known that she had amassed upwards of twenty thousand pounds in ready money the earl of shrewsbury was confined to his house and the old earl of hertford sent for from his seat by degrees things grew cooler and though it was known that mr seymour continued in the netherlands yet the court made no farther applications to the archduke about him in the beginning of the year      a new storm began to break out for the lady arabella either pressed at an examination or of her own free will made some extraordinary discoveries upon which some quick steps would have been taken had it not shortly after appeared that her misfortunes had turned her head and that consequently no use could be made of the evidence of a person out of her senses however the countess of shrewsbury who before had leave to attend her husband in his sickness was very closely shut up and the court was amused with abundance of strange stories which wore out by degrees and the poor lady arabella languished in her confinement till the   th of september      when her life and sorrows ended together even in her grave this poor lady was not at peace a report being spread that she was poisoned because she happened to die within two years of sir thomas overbury as for her husband sir william seymour he soon after her decease procured leave to return distinguishing himself by loyally adhering to the king during the civil wars and surviving to the time of the restoration was restored to his greatgrandfathers title of duke of somerset by an act of parliament which entirely cancelled his attainder and on the giving his royal assent to this act king charles ii was pleased to say in full parliament what perhaps was as honorable for the family as the title to which they are restored his words were these as this is an act of an extraordinary nature so it is in favor of a person of no ordinary merit he has deserved of my father and of myself as much as any subject possibly could do and i hope this will stir no mans envy because in doing it i do no more than what a good master should do for such a servant by his lady arabella this noble person had no issue but that he still preserved a warm affection for her memory appears from hence that he called one of his daughters by his second wife frances daughter and coheiress of robert devereux earl of essex arabella seymour  archilochus a greek poet born in the isle of paros he was the son of telesicles and according to mr bail flourished in the   th olympiad his poetry abounded with the most poignant satire his satirical vein had such an effect on lycambes that he hanged himself on account of the severe satire which archilochus wrote against him the indignation of archilochus against lycambes arose from the latters not keeping his word lycambes had promised him his daughter and afterward refused her to him it is not unlikely that he attacked the whole family of lycambes in his lampoon for it is said that the daughter followed the example of her father and there are some who affirm that three of lycambess daughters died of despair at the same time in this piece of archilochus many adventures are mentioned full of defamation and out of the knowledge of the public there were likewise many loose indelicate passages in the poem and it is said to have been on account of this satire that the lacedaemonians laid a prohibition on his verses having considered the reading of such loose pieces as not agreeable to the rules of modesty the lacedaemonians says valerius maximus commanded the book of archilochus to be carried out of their city because they thought the reading of them not to be very modest or chaste for they were unwilling the minds of their children should be tinctured with them lest they should do more harm to their manners than service to their genius and so they banished the verses of the greatest or at least next to the greatest poet because he had attacked a family which he hated with obscene abuse it has been affirmed by some that he himself was banished from lacedaemon and the maxim that he had inserted in one of his pieces is assigned for the reason thereof that it was better to fling down ones arms than to lose ones life he had written this in vindication of himself  archilochus was so much addicted to raillery and abuse he did not even spare himself he is said however to have been much in favor with apollo for when he had been killed in a combat the oracle of delphi drove the murderer out of the temple and was not appeased without a multitude of excuses and prayers and even after this the oracle ordered him to a certain house there to pacify the ghost of archilochus this poet excelled chiefly in iambic verses and was the inventor of them he is one of the three poets whom aristarchus approved in this kind of poetry quintilian puts him in some respects below the other two aristophanes the grammarian thought that the longer his iambic poems were the finer they were cicero informs us of this particular the longest of your epistles say he to atticus seems to me the best as the iambics of archilochus did to aristophanes the hymn which he wrote to hercules and iolus was so much esteemed that it used to be sung three times to the honor of those who had gained the victory at the olympic games there are few of his works extant and this says mr bail is rather a gain than a lose with regard to morality heraclides composed a dialogue upon the life of this poet which if it had remained would in all probability have furnished us with many pariculars concerning archilochus  archimedes a celebrated geometrician born at syracuse in the island of sicily and related to hiero king of syracuse he was remarkable for his extraordinary application to mathematical studies in which he used to be so much engaged that his servants were often obliged to take him from thence by force he had such a surprising invention in mechanics that he affirmed to hiero if he had another earth whereon to plant his machines he could move this which we inhabit he is said to have formed a glass sphere of a most surprising workmanship wherein the motions of the heavenly bodies were represented he fell upon a curious method to discover the deceit which had been practiced by a workman employed by king hiero to make a golden crown but he became most famous by his curious contrivances whereby the city of syracuse was so long defended when besieged by marcellus the vigorous efforts made to carry the place had certainly succeeded sooner says levy had they not been frustrated by one man this was archimedes a man famous for his skill in astronomy but more so for his surprising invention of warlike machines with which in an instant he destroyed what had cost the enemy vast labor to erect against the vessels which came up close to the walls he contrived a kind of crow projected above the wall with an iron grapple fastened to a strong chain this was let down upon the prow of a ship and by means of the weight of a heavy counterpoise of lead raised up the the prow and set the vessel upright upon her poop then letting it down all of a sudden as if the vessel had fallen from the walls to the great terror of the seamen it sunk so far into the sea that it let in a great deal of water even when it fell directly on its keel however notwithstanding all his art syracuse was at length taken by marcellus who commanded his soldiers to have a particular regard to the safety of archimedes but this ingenious man was unfortunately slain by a soldier who did not know him what gave marcellus the greatest concern says plutarch was the unhappy fate of archimedes who was at that time in his musaeum and his mind as well as eyes so fixed and intent upon some geometrical figures that he neither heard the noise and hurry of the romans nor perceived that the city was taken in this transport of study and contemplation a soldier came suddenly upon him and commanded him to follow him to marcellus which he refusing to do till he had finished his problem and fitted it for demonstration the soldier in a rage drew his sword and ran him through others write that archimedes seeing a soldier coming with a drawn sword to kill him entreated him to hold his hand one moment that he might not die with the regret of having left his problem unfinished and the demonstration imperfect but that the soldier without any regard either to his problem or demonstration killed him immediately other again write that as archimedes was carrying some mathematical instruments in a box to marcellus as sundials spheres and angles wit which the eye might measure the magnitude of the suns body some soldiers met him and believing there was gold in it slew him liv says he was slain by a soldier who did not know who he was whilst he was drawing schemes in the dust that marcellus was grieved at his death and took care of his funeral making his name at the same time a protection and honor to those who could claim being related to him archimedes is said to have been killed in the    d olympiad and    th year of rome about two hundred and eight years before the birth of christ we have several of his works still extent but the greatest part of them are lost when cicero was quaestor for sicily he discovered the tomb of archimedes all overgrown with bushes and brambles there was an inscription upon it but the latter part of the verses was quite worn out  arden edward was descended of a most ancient and honorable family seated at parkhall in warwickshire he was born in the year      and his father dying when he was an infant of two years old he became before he inherited the estate of the family the ward of sir george throkmorton of coughton whose daughter mary he afterward married in all probability it was his engagement with this family and being bred in it that made him so firm a papist as he was however that be succeeding his grandfather thomas arden esquire in      in the family estate he married mary throkmorton and settled in the country his religion impeding his preferment and his temper inclining him to a retired life his being a near neighbor to the great earl of leicester occasioned his having some jars with him who affected to rule all things in that county some persons therein though of good families and possessed of considerable estates thought it no discredit to wear that noblemans livery which mr arden disdained in the course of this fatal quarrel excessive insolence on one side produced some warm expressions on the other insomuch that mr arden openly taxed the earl with his conversing criminally with the countess of essex in that earls life time and also inveighed against his pride as a thing the more inexcusable in a nobleman newly created these taunts having exasperated that minister he projected or at least forwarded his destruction mr arden had married one of his daughters to john somerville esquire a young gentleman of an old family and good fortune in the same county this mr somerville was a man of a hot rash temper and by many thought a little crazy he was drawn in a strange manner to plot if it may be so called against the queens life and thus the treason is alleged to have been transacted in the whitsunholidays      he with his wife was at mr ardens where hugh hall his fatherinlaws priest persuaded him that queen elizabeth being an incorrigible heretic and growing daily from bad to worse it would be doing god and his country good service to take her life away when the holidays were over he returned to his own house with his wife where he grew melancholy and irresolute upon this his wife writes to hall her fathers priest to come and strengthen the man hall excuses his coming but writes at large to encourage somerville to prosecute what he had undertaken this letter had its effects somerville set out for london but got no farther than warwick where drawing his sword and wounding some protestants he was instantly seized while he was going to warwick his wife went over to her fathers and showed him and her mother halls treasonable letter which her father threw into the fire so that only the hearsay of this letter could be alleged against him and his wife by hall who wrote it who was tried and condemned with them but to return to somerville on his apprehension he said somewhat of his father and motherinlaw and immediately orders were sent into warwickshire for their being seized and imprisoned october  0      mr somerville was committed to the tower for high treason november   hall the priest was committed also and on the seventh of the same month mr arden on the sixteenth mary the wife of mr arden margaret their daughter wife to mr somerville and elizabeth the sister of mr somerville were committed on the twentythird mr arden was racked in the tower and the next day hugh hall the priest was tortured likewise by these methods some kind of evidence being brought out on the sixteenth of december edward arden esquire and mary his wife john somerville esquire and hugh hall the priest were tried and convicted of high treason at guildhall london chiefly on halls confession who yet received sentence with the rest on the nineteenth of december mr arden and his soninlaw somerville were removed from the tower to newgate for a nights time only in this space somerville was strangled by his own hands as it was given out but as the world believed by such as desired to get him silently out of theirs the next day being december  0      edward arden was executed at smithfield with the general pity of all spectators he died with the same high spirit he had shown throughout his life after professing his innocence he owned himself a papist and one who died for his religion and want of flexibility though under color of conspiring against the state he strenuously insisted that somerville was murdered to prevent his shaming his prosecutors and having thus extenuated things to such as heard him he patiently submitted to an ignominious death his execution was according to the rigor of the law his head being set as somervilles also was upon london bridge and his quarters upon the city gates but the body of his soninlaw was interred in moorfields as for mrs arden she was pardoned but the queen gave the estate which fell to her by here is and her husbands attainder to mr darcy as for hugh hall the priest he was pardoned too but leicester doubting his secrecy would have engaged chancellor hatton to have sent him abroad which he refusing new rumors little to that proud earls honor flew about hollinshed stowe and such writers treat mr arden as a traitor fairly convicted and so have others who knew much better but camden was too honest to write thus and there is good authority to incline our belief that he died for being a stout englishman rather than a bad subject his son and heir robert arden esquire being bred in one of the inns of court proved a very wise and fortunate person insomuch that by various suits he wrung from edward darcy esquire the grantee most of his fathers estates and by marrying elizabeth daughter of reginald corbet esquire one of the justices of the kings bench he restored the credit and splendour of this ancient family and was so happy to see henry arden esquire his eldest son knighted by king james and married to dorothy the daughter of basil fielding of newnham esquire whose son became earl of denbigh the drawing this embarrassed account out of obscurity cannot but be grateful to our curious readers and will answer one great end of this work the elucidating dark passages in english history by a comparison of lights a thing not to be expected in general collections or even in the accounts of particular reigns  aretin peter a native of arezzo who lived in the sixteenth century he was famous for his satirical writings and was so bold as to carry his invectives even against sovereigns and from thence got the title of the scourge of princes francis i the emperor charles v most of the princes of italy several cardinals and many nobemen courted his friendship by presents either because they liked his compositions or perhaps from an apprenension of falling under the lash of his satire aretin became thereupon so insolent that he is said to have got a medal struck on one side of which he is represented with these words il divino aretino and on the reverse sitting upon a throne receiving the presents of princes with these words i principi tributati da popoli tributano il servidor loro some imagine he gave himself the title of divine signifying thereby that he performed the functions of a god upon earth by the thunderbolts with which he struck the heads of the highest personages he used to boast that his lampoons did more service to the world than sermons and it was said of him that he had subjected more princes by his pen than the greatest had ever done by their arms aretin wrote many irreligious and obscene pieces such are his dialogues which were called ragionamenti we have also six volumes of letters wrote by him but they are not in much esteem i have read says mr menage all peter aretins letters without finding any thing that i could insert in any of my books there is nothing but the style of them worth regarding some say that aretin changed his loose libertine principles but however this may be it is certain that he composed several pieces of devotion he wrote a paraphrase on the penitential psalms and another on genesis he wrote also the life of the virgin mary and that of st catherine of sienna and of st thomas aquinas he was author likewise of some comedies which were esteemed pretty good of their kind he died in the year      being about sixtyfive years old  it is said by some that he fell into such a fit of laughter on hearing some smutty conversation that he overturned the chair upon which he sat and that in the fall he hurt his head and died upon the spot aretin wrote some verses against peter strozzi but he heartily repented of this for strozzi being a resolute man threatened to have him stabbed in his bed which so frightened the poet that he durst not allow any body to come into his house nor had he the courage to go out of it himself as long as strozzi staid in the state of venice  ariosto lodovico or lewis a celebrated italian poet descended of a good fumily and born at the castle of reggio in lombardy in the year      he soon gave marks of his great genius for when very young he composed several excellent poetical pieces one of the most remarkable of which is the story of pyramus and thisbe which he formed into a play and had it acted by his brothers and sisters this performance gained him great applause all who saw it presaging he would prove one of the greatest poets of the age his father however being a man of no taste for learning regarded more what study would be most profitable for his son to follow than what suited his genius and inclination he obliged him therefore to apply to the law which he did for some years though with great reluctance but upon his fathers death he returned to the more agreeable pursuits of poetry he was left but in indifferent circumstances either because the estate was divided amongst all his brothers or because his fathers income consisted chiefly of places of profit which determined at his death when ariosto was about thirty years of age he was introduced to hippolito cardinal of est a great patron of learned men who entertained him in a very honorable manner the success which he had hitherto had in the little poetical pieces which he had published inspired him with the ambition of distinguishing himself by some nobler work sannazarius bembo nangerius and sadolet had rendered themselves famous for the beauty of their latin poems ariosto had likewise wrote some in this language but finding as sir john harrington observes that he could not raise himself to the highest rank amongst the latin poets which was already possessed by others he applied himself chiefly to the cultivation of his native tongue being desirous to enrich it with such works as would render it valuable and important to other nations he read homer and virgil with critical assiduity and having in view these great originals he began a poem on the loves of orlando taking the subject from bojardos orlando inamorato upon whose model he proceeded he began this poem when he was about thirty years of age it is the most celebrated of all his works though there have been many different opinions concerning it but his attachment to poetry did not hinder him from engaging in public affairs for he was employed in embassies and negociations in different parts of italy the cardinal of est wanted to have carried him to hungary with some other illustrious persons who attended him but ariosto refusing to go lost all his interest with his patron  upon the death of hippolito he engaged in the service of alfonso duke of ferrara who treated him with great esteem and affection and appointed him governor of graffignana which office he discharged with great honor and success after his return home he dedicated the rest of his life to retirement prosecuting his studies in a house which he built for himself at ferrara he translated several pieces out of french and spanish into italian and wrote also several satires which according to mr menage are esteemed by the best judges there are likewise five comedies of his extant which the duke of ferrara was so pleased with that he erected a magnificent stage in the hall of ferrara for the representation of them and made the author several considerable presents at his desire ariosto translated the maenechmi of plautus into italian which was exhibited with great success and all his other comedies were frequently acted by persons of the first quality and when his lena was first represented ferdinand of est afterward marquis of massa so far honored the piece as to speak the prologue ariosto used to read his verses to his friends and the ladies of his acquaintance his manner of reading was excellent so that he thereby gave a peculiar grace to every thing he pronounced he was honored with the laurel by the emperor charles v in the year       ariosto was of an amorous disposition and left two natural sons he was affable easy and condescending in his temper he enjoyed the friendship of the most eminent men of learning of his time most of whom he mentions with great respect in the last canto of his orlando furioso his constitution was but weakly so that he was obliged to have recourse to physicians the greatest part of his life he bore his last sickness with great resolution ane serenity and died at ferrara the  th of july      according to sir john harrington being then fiftynine years of age he was interred in the church of the benedictine monks who contrary to their custom attended his funeral he had a bust erected to him and an epitaph written by himself inscribed upon his tomb his death was much regreted by all who knew him and particularly by the men of letters who honored his memory by several latin and italian poems  the following article was omitted by mistake of the compositor in its proper place but it appeared to the editor of too much importance to be sacrificed to alphabetical order  arbuthnot john an eminent physician a distinguished wit and a polite writer in the latter end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the present century was descended from the noble family of his name in scotland and was the son of a clergyman of the episcopal church in that country he was born at arbuthnot in kincardinshire near montrose not long after the restoration of king charles the second but in what particular year is uncertain having been sent at a proper age to the university of aberdeen he applied himself diligently to all the academical studies and particularly to that of physic in which he took his doctors degree the political principles of his father not suffering him to comply with the revolution he forfeited his church preferment and retired for support to a small estate of his own the sons embraced the same political principles on which account they were laid under a necessity of seeking their fortunes abroad the doctor however traveled no farther than to london where he was entertained at the house of mr william pate a woollendraper soon after which he took up the business of teaching the mathematics an undertaking for which he was very well qualified he was probably engaged in this employment when dr woodward published in      his essay toward a natural history of the earth the account which dr woodward in his essay gave of the universal deluge appeared to dr arbuthnot to be irreconcilable with just philosophical reasoning upon mathematical principles and therefore he drew up an answer to that part of the work under the following title an examination of dr woodwards account of the deluge etc with a comparison between stenos philosophy and the doctors in the case of marine bodies dug out of the earth by ja md with a letter to the author concerning an abstract of agostino scillas book on the same subject printed in the philosophical transactions by w w f r s this learned piece appeared in      in  vo and laid the foundation of dr arbuthnots literary reputation which not long after received a considerable and deserved increase by his essay on the usefulness of mathematical learning in a letter from a gentleman in the city to his friend at oxford in the mean time as physic was his profession so the practice of it was what he principally had in view at first indeed as is usual with regard to young physicians he met with no great encouragement but after a while his business so increased to produce a competency and by degrees his skill in it joined with his pleasing wit and extensive literature introduced him into good esteem and favor with the polite part of the world on st andrews day   0  he was elected a fellow of the royal society and on the  0th of october in the following year he was sworn physician extraordinary to queen anne by her majestys especial command this honor was conferred upon him in consideration of his successful services to his royal highness prince george of denmark that prince being taken suddenly ill at epsom was recommended to dr arbuthnot who happened to be upon the spot and his highness recovering by the doctors assistance ever after employed him as his physician upon the indisposition of dr hannes he was appointed in november   0  fourth physician in ordinary to the queen and on the   th of april    0 he was admitted a fellow of the college of physicians about this time or a little after dr arbuthnot formed an intimate connection with the celebrated triumvirate swift pope and gay and it was not long before he added a new luster to that constellation of wits by the brightness of his own early in the year      he engaged with mr pope and dr swift in a design of writing a satire on the abuses of human learning in every branch which was to be executed in the manner of cervantes the original author of this species of satire under the history of some feigned adventures they had observed says the ingenious and learned editor of mr popes works those abuses still kept their ground against all that the gravest and ablest authors could say to discredit them they concluded therefore the force of ridicule was wanting to quicken their disgrace which was here in its place when the abuses had already been detected by sober reasoning and truth in no danger to suffer by the premature use of so powerful an instrument but the prosecution of this noble design at least in a regular way was prevented by the queens death which exceedingly disconcerted pope swift and arbuthnot who were all of them warmly attached to lord oxfords ministry and a final period was afterward put to the project by the separation and growing infirmities of dr swift by the bad health of dr arbuthnot and other concurring causes the imperfect essay which was drawn out toward this design under the title of the first book of the memoirs of martinus scriblerus is sufficient to make us greatly regret that it was not completed a critical account of this undertaking and of the share which dr arbuthnot had in it we here present to the reader polite letters adds the celebrated editor before mentioned never lost more than in the defeat of this scheme in the execution of which each of this illustrious triumvirate would have found exercise for his own peculiar talents besides constant employment for those they all had in common dr arbuthnot was skilled in every thing which related to science mr pope was a master in the fine arts and dr swift excelled in the knowledge of the world wit they had all in equal measure and this so large that no age perhaps ever produced three men to whom nature had more bountifully bestowd it or art had brought it to higher perfection we are told by the same writer that the travels of guliver were first intended as a part of scribleruss memoirs queen annes death made so deep an impression upon dr arbuthnots spirits that to divert his melancholy he went to paris where a brother of his resided his stay there however was very short for he returned to london in the beginning of september during this time he appears to have been in some suspense whether he should be permitted to hold his place at st jamess but being at length told that he was to lose it he philosophically observed to dr swift that he hoped to be able to keep a little habitation warm in town indeed considering his attrchment to former men and measures it is not surprising that he should be deprived of his situation in the royal household though it might have been to the honor of government to have shown a peculiar indulgence to a man of such distinguished genius and merit dr arbuthnot having quitted st jamess where he appears generally to have lived while he was physician to queen anne took a house in doverstreet some time after in conjunction with mr pope he was engaged in giving assistance to mr gay in the comedy or rather the farce of three hours after marriage this play was brought upon the stage in      and was ill received being damned on the first night of its representation at the bath season in the latter end of      dr arbuthnot went to that city apparently for his health being accompanied by one of his brothers who was lately come to england and whose singular and amiable character is well drawn by mr pope in a letter to mr digby on the  0th of september      the doctor was chosen second censor of the royal college of physicians in      he was seized with a most unusual and dangerous distemper an imposthume in the bowels from which he speedily and happily recovered to the great joy of his friends he published in      in quarto his work entitled tables of ancient coins weights and measures explained and exemplified in several dissertations in the same year on the  th of october he was made an elect of the college of physicians and on the   th of that month he pronounced the harveian oration during all this time he continued the practice of his profession with good reputation and among other eminent persons whom he attended in his medical capacity was the late earl of chesterfield who was proud to have such a man for his friend as well as for his physician dr arbuthnot was not however so deeply engaged in business but that he could find leisure to write several pieces of wit and humor among which his epitaph on the infamous colonel chartres which came out in      has been particularly admired much about the same time he wrote a very entertaining paper concerning the altercation or scolding of the ancients in      he had an opportunity of contributing his endeavors toward detecting and punishing the scandalous frauds and abuses which had been carried on under the specious name of the charitable corporation in the same year he published his treatise concerning the nature and choice of aliments which was followed in      by his essay on the effects of air on human bodies a little before the last publication he met with a severe domestic affliction in the loss of his son charles hereafter mentioned whose life he says if it had so pleased god he would willingly have redeemed with his own nevertheless he added with the greatest piety i thank god for a new lesson of submission to his will and likewise for what he has left me dr arbuthnot is thought to have been led to the medical subjects just mentioned by the consideration of his own case his disorder was an asthma which having gradually increased with his years became at length desperate and incurable under this affliction he retired in      with a view of obtaining some small relief to hampstead from whence in answer to a kind enquiry of mr pope he gave that friend a particular account of his distemper and of his having no expectations of a recovery in a letter written two or three months after to his other great friend dr swift he displays the resignation calmness and piety of his mind though he met with a temporary relief at hampstead and especially from riding yet being sensible that an effectual cure of his disease was impossible he thought proper to return to his own house in corkstreet burlingtongardens where he departed this life on the   th of february        dr arbuthnot appears in every respect to have been a most amiable and worthy man and the justness of the following account of him which comes from the ingenious pen of lord orrery will be acknowledged by all who are acquainted with the doctors life and writings his lordship speaking of that part of swifts epistolary correspondence which only was then published adds i should have been much pleased in finding some of dr arbuthnots letters among this collection although he was justly celebrated for wit and learning there was an excellence in his character more amiable than all his other qualifications i mean the excellence of his heart he has shown himself equal to any of his contemporaries in humor and vivacity and he was superior to most men in acts of humanity and benevolence his very sarcasms are the satirical strokes of good nature they are like slaps in the face given in jest the effects of which may raise blushes but no blackness will appear after the blows he laughs as jovially as an attendant upon bacchus but continues as sober and considerate as a disciple of socrates he is seldom serious except in his attacks upon vice and then his spirit rises with a manly strength and a noble indignation his epitaph upon chartres allowing one small alteration the word permitted instead of connived at is a complete and a masterly composition in its kind no man exceeded him in the moral duties of life a merit still more to his honor as the ambitious powers of wit and genius are seldom submissive enough to confine themselves within the limitations of morality in his letter to mr pope written as it were upon his deathbed he discovers such a noble fortitude of mind at the approach of his dissolution as could be inspired only by a clear conscience and the calm retrospect of an uninterrupted series of virtue the dean laments the loss of him with a pathetic sincerity the deaths of mr gay and the doctor says he to mr pope have been terrible wounds near my heart their living would have been a great comfort to me although i should never have seen them like a sum of money in a bank from which i should receive at least annual interest as i do from you and have done from bolingbroke this testimony of lord orrerys to the merit of dr arbuthnot is confirmed by that of mr pope who used to represent his morals as equal to any mans and his wit and humor as superior to those of all mankind so prolific was his wit that in this quality swift only held the second place no adventure of any consequence ever occurred on which the doctor did not write a pleasant essay in a great folio book which used to lie in his parlour of these however he was so negligent that while he was writing them at one end he suffered his children to tear them out at the other for their paperkites we learn from mr george arburthnot that his father seldom related any thing of himself or his writings which he neglected so much when finished that he was sometimes at a loss to find them the integrity of his character is well expressed in a letter to dr swift i have not seen any thing as yet to make me recant a certain inconvenient opinion i have that one cannot pay too dear for peace of mind dr arbuthnot always made it a point to stand up for the honor of religion we are told that he was often with lord chesterfield in the morning and more than once declared himself in his lordships presence a patron of christianity but the doctors zeal and steadiness in this respect will best appear in one of his own letters my neighbor the proseman is wiser and more cowardly and despairing than ever he talks me into a fit of vapors twice or thrice a week i dream at night of a chain and rowing in the galleys but thank god he has not taken from me the freedom i have been accustomed to in my discourse even with the greatest persons to whom i have access in defending the cause of liberty virtue and religion for the last i have the satisfaction of suffering some share of the ignominy that belonged to the first confessors this has been my lot from a steady resolution i have taken of giving these ignorant impudent fellows battle upon all occasions there is nothing which more distinguishes dr arbuthnots character than the cheerfulness of his temper in a letter wretten to dr swift in      he says as for your humble servant with a great stone in his right kidney and a family of men and women to provide for he is as cheerful as ever in public affairs it was not to public affairs only that this disposition was confined for it evidently appears to have accompanied him in every situation and every affliction of life a circumstance which we the rather take notice of as a reflection to the disadvantage of it has been thrown out by a late writer upon the whole we may conclude after the most impartial survey of dr arbuthnots character that his memory is entitled to distinguished honor as a man of wit a man of science and literature and a man of religion and virtue in saying this we do not mean to assert that we entirely approve in every instance of his choice of the objects against which his humor and satire were directed in some of his political principles we greatly differ from him and we think that cases might be mentioned in which his ridicule was too severely pointed at men of real abilities and merit the doctor is said but at what particular period we are not informed to have been some time steward to the corporation of the sons of the clergy he was a married man and besides other children had two sons george and charles the latter of whom was educated at christ church college oxford and entered into holy orders two daughters survived him who are since dead unmarried george who is still living is first secondary in the remembranceoffice a place of very considerable profit he is possessed of an ample fortune besides and is a gentleman of known and acknowledged worth and character dr arbuthnot shared the same fate with his friends pope and swift in having several literary brats illegitimately fathered upon him and among the rest the famous romance of robinson crusoe there came out in      in two volumes    mo the miscellaneous works of the late dr arbuthnot to which is prefixed the following advertisement the contents of these volumes and what is inserted in swifts miscellanies comprehend all the pieces of wit and humor of this admirable author although this collection which has gone through various editions undoubtedly contains some of his genuine productions yet every reader of taste and discernment will easily perceive that many if not most of the tracts here ascribed to him cannot have proceeded from his excellent pen and george arbuthnot esquire upon the perusal of them has testified that the greatest part of them were not written by his father  aristophanes a celebrated comic poet of athens his place of nativity however has been contested for his enemies endeavored to represent him as a stranger but he fully confuted this suggestion repeating on this occasion a verse of telemachus in the odyssey thus translated my mother told me so twas he she said i know not and pray who has more to plead   he was contemporary with plato socrates and euripides and most of his plays were written during the peloponnesian war his imagination was warm and lively and his genius particularly turned to raillery he had also great spirit and resolution and was a declared enemy to slavery and to all those who wanted to oppress their country the athenians suffered themselves in his time to be governed by men who had no other views than to make themselves masters of the commonwealth aristophanes exposed the designs of these men with great wit and severity upon the stage cleon was the first whom he attacked in his comedy of the equites and as there was not one of the comedians who would venture to personate a man of his great authority aristophanes played the character himself and with so much success that the athenians obliged cleon to pay a fine of five talents which were given to the poet he described the affairs of the athenians in so exact a manner that his comedies are a faithful history of that people for this reason when dionysius king of syracuse desired to learn the state and language of athens plato sent him the comedies of aristophanes telling him these were the best representation thereof he wrote above fifty comedies but there are only eleven extant which are perfect these are plutus the clouds the frogs equites the acharnenses the wasps peace the birds the ecclesiazusae or female orators the thesmophosiazusae or priestesses of ceres and lysistrata the clouds which he wrote in ridicule to socrates is the most celebrated of all his comedies madam dacier tells us she was so much charmed with this performance that after she had translated it and read it over two hundred times it did not become the least tedious to her which she could not say of any other piece and that the pleasure which she received from it was so exquisite that she forgot all the contempt and indignation which aristophanes deserved for employing his wit to ruin a man who was wisdom itself and the greatest ornament of the city of athens aristophanes having conceived some aversion to the poet euripides satirizes him in several of his plays particularly in his frogs and his thesmophosiazusae he wrote his peace in the tenth year of the peloponnesian war when a treaty for fifty years was concluded between the athenians and the lacedaemonians though it continued but seven years the acharnenses was written after the death of pericles and the loss of the battle in sicily in order to dissuade the people from intrusting the safety of the commonwealth to such imprudent generals as lamachus soon after he represented his aves or birds by which he admonished the athenians to fortify decelaea which he calls by a fictitious name nepheloccoccygia the vespae or wasps was written after another loss in sicily which the athenians suffered from the misconduct of chares he wrote the lysistrata when all greece was involved in a war in which comedy the women are introduced debating upon the affairs of the commonwealth when they came to a resolution not to go to bed with their husbands till a peace should be concluded his plutus and other comedies of that kind were written after the magistrates had given orders that no person should be exposed by name upon the stage he invented a peculiar kind of verse which was called by his name and is mentioned by cicero in his brutus and suidas says that he also was the inventor of the tetrameter and octometer verse  aristophanes was greatly admired amongst the ancients especially for the true attic elegance of his style it is says madam dacier as agreeable as his wit for besides its purity force and sweetness it has a certain harmony which sounds extremely pleasant to the ear when he has occasion to use the common ordinary style he does it without using any expression that is base and vulgar and when he has a mind to express himself loftily in his highest flight he is never obscure let no man says scaliger pretend to understand the attic dialect who has not aristophanes at his fingers ends in him are to be found all the attic ornaments which made st chrysostom so much admire him that he always laid him under his pillow when he went to bed mr frichlin observes that plautus has a great affinity to aristophanes in his manner of writing and has imitated him in many parts of his plays frichlin has written a vindication of our poet in answer to the objections urged against him by plutarch how great an opinion plato had of aristophanes is evident even from plutarchs acknowledgment who tells us that this poets discourse upon love was inserted by that philosopher in his symposium and cicero in his first book de legibus styles him the most witty poet of the old comedy there have been several editions and translations of this poet the time of his death is unknown but it is certain he was living after the expulsion of the tyrants by thrasybulus whom he mentions in his plutus and other comedies  aristotle the chief of the peripatetic philosophers born at stagyra a small city in macedon in the   th olympiad about three hundred and eightyfour years before the birth of christ he was the son of nichomachus physician to amyntas the grandfather of alexander the great he lost his parents in his infancy and proxenes a friend of his fathers who had the care of his education taking but little notice of him he quitted his studies and gave himself up to the follies of youth after he had spent most of his patrimony he entered into the army but not succeeding in this profession he went to delphos to consult the oracle what course of life he should follow when he was advised to go to athens and study philosophy he accordingly went thither when about eighteen years of age and studied under plato till he was thirtyseven by this time he had spent his whole fortune and we are told that he got his living by selling powders and some receipts in pharmacy he followed his studies with most extraordinary diligence so that he soon surpassed all in platos school he eat little slept less and that he might not oversleep himself diogenes laertius tells us that he lay always with one hand out of the bed having a ball of brass in it which by its falling into a basin of the same metal awaked him we are told that aristotle had several conferences with a learnjew at athens and that by this means he instructed himself in the sciences and religion of the egyptians and that he thereby saved himself the trouble of traveling into egypt when he had studied about fifteen years under plato he began to form different tenets from those of his master who became highly piqued at his behavior upon the death of plato he quitted athens and retired to atarnya a little city of mysia where his old friend hermias reigned here he married pythias the sister of this prince whom he is said to have loved so passionately that he offered sacrifice to her some time after hermias having been taken prisoner by meranon the king of persias general aristotle went to mitylene the capital of lesbos where he remained till philip king of macedon having heard of his great reputation sent for him to be tutor to his son alexander then about fourteen years of age aristotle accepted the offer and in eight years taught him rhetoric and natural philosophy which according to plutarch he taught nobody else philip erected statues in honor of aristotle and for his sake rebuilt stagyra which had been almost ruined by the wars  aristotle having lost the favor of alexander by adhering to calisthenes his kinsman who was accused of a conspiracy against alexanders life he removed to athens where he set up his new school the magistrates received him very kindly and gave him the lycaeum so famous afterward for the concourse of his disciples and here it was according to some authors that he composed his principal works plutarch however tells us that he had already wrote his books of physics morals metaphysics and rhetoric the same author says that aristotle being piqued at alexander because of the presents he had sent to xenocrates was moved with so much resentment that he entered into antipaters conspiracy against this prince the advocates for aristotle however maintain this charge to have been without foundation that at least it made no impression on alexander since about the same time he ordered him to apply himself to the study of animals and sent him in order to defray his expenses eight hundred talents which amounts to four hundred and eighty thousand crowns besides a great number of fishers and huntsmen to bring him all sorts of animals when aristotle was accused of impiety by one eurymedon a priest of ceres he wrote a large apology for himself addressed to the magistrates but knowing the athenians to be extremely jealous in regard to their religion and remembering the fate of socrates he was so much alarmed that he retired to chalcis a city of eubaea where he ended his days some say he poisoned himself to avoid falling into the hands of his enemies others affirm that he threw himself into the euripus because he could not comprehend the reason of its ebbing and flowing and there are some who tell us he died of a cholic in the sixtythird year of his age being the third of the    th olimpiad two years after alexander the stagyrites carried away his body and erected altars to his memory  besides his treatises on philosophy he wrote also on poetry rhetoric law etc to the number of four hundred treatises according to diogenes laertius or more according to francis patricius of venice an account of such as are extant and of those said to be lost may be seen in fabriciuss bibliotheca graeca he left his writings with theophrastus his beloved disciple and successor in the lycaeum and forbad that they should ever be published theophrastus at his death trusted them to neleus his good friend and disciple whose heirs buried them in the ground at scepsis a town of troas to secure them from the king of pergamus who made great search every where for books to adorn his library here they lay concealed one hundred and sixty years until being almost spoiled they were sold to one apellicon a rich citizen of athens sylla found them at this mans house and ordered them to be carried to rome they were some time after purchased by tyrannion a grammarian and andronicus of rhodes having bought them of his heirs was in a manner the first restorer of the works of this great philosopher for he not only repaired what had been decayed by time and ill keeping but also put them in a better order and got them copied there were many who followed the doctrine of aristotle in the reigns of the twelve caesars and their numbers increased much under adrian and antoninus alexander aphrodinus was the first professor of the peripatetic philosophy at rome being appointed by the emperors marcus aurelius and lucius verus and in succeeding ages the doctrine of aristotle prevailed almost amongst all men of letters and many commentaries were wrote upon his works  the first doctors of the church disapproved of the doctrine of aristotle as allowing too much to reason and sense but anatolius bishop of laodicea didymus of alexandria st jerome and st augustine and several others at length wrote and spoke in favor of it in the sixth age boethius made him known in the west and translated some of his pieces into latin but from the time of boethus to the eighth age joannes damascenus was the only man who made an abridgment of his philosophy or wrote any thing concerning him the grecians who took great pains to restore learning in the eleventh and following ages applied much to the works of this philosopher and many learned men wrote commentaries on his writings amongst these were alfarabius algazel avicenna and averroes they taught his doctrine in africa and afterward at cordoya in spain the spaniards introduced his doctrine into france with the commentaries of averroes and avicenna and it was taught in the university of paris until amauri having supported some particular tenets on the principles of this philosopher was condemned of heresy in a council held there in    0 when all the works of aristotle that could be found were burnt and the reading them forbidden under pain of excommunication this prohibition was confirmed as to the physics and metaphysics in      by the popes legate though at the same tme he gave leave for his logic to be read instead of st augustins used at that time in the university in the year      simon cardinal of st cecil and legate from the holy see prohibited the reading of the physics and metaphysics of aristotle all these prohibitions however were taken off in      for the cardinals of st mark and st martin who were deputed by pope urban v to reform the university of paris permitted the reading of those books which had been prohibited and in the year      pope stephen approved of all his works and took care to have a new translation of them into latin  arius a divine of the fourth century the head and founder of the arians a sect which denied the eternal divinity and consubstantiality of the word he was born in lybia near egypt eusebius bishop of nicomedia a great favorite of constantia sister of the emperor constantine and wife of licinius became a zealous promoter of arianism he took arius under his protection and introduced him to constantia so that the sect increased and several bishops embraced it openly there arose however such disputes in the cities that the emperor in order to remedy these disorders was obliged to assemble the council of nice where in the year     the doctrine of arius was condemned arius was banished by the emperor and all his books were ordered to be burnt and capital punishment was denounced against whoever dared to keep them after five years banishment he was recalled to constantinople where he presented to the emperor such a profession of faith as made him believe arius quite orthodox in the year     arius went to alexandria where st athanasius refused to receive him notwithstanding all his menaces and recommendatory letters he came to this city again in     but though athanasius had been sent into exile yet the people of alexandria rejected arius who began to raise disturbances in egypt constantine being informed thereof sent orders to him to come to constantinople where his friends intended that he should be received into the communion of that city constantine demanded of arius if he followed the nicene faith arius assured him he did by an oath and the emperor having demanded a profession of his faith he presented it to him in writing but he had clothed his favorite tenets in the simplicity of scripture expressions and he took oath of his belief in the contents of the paper which he delivered constantine being persuaded of the sincerity of arius ordered alexandria to admit him again into the church arius was now conducted in triumph by eusebius and his other adherents but as they approached the great square of constantinople arius being pressed by a natural necessity retired to a house of convenience where he died instantly on the spot all his entrails bursting out with his liver and spleen this happened in the year     ariuss sect however did not die with him for it was supported by several bishops and several others of great weight in the church the arians by turns persecuted and were persecuted there are several authors who find fault with arius for putting his sentiments into verse that they might be sung by his disciples and they particularly censure the matter and form of his thalia  arminius james the founder of the sect of armenians or remonstrants born at oudewater in holland in    0 he lost his father in his infancy and was indebted for the first part of his education to a goodnatured clergyman who had imbibed some of the opinions of the reformed and who in order to avoid being obliged to say mass often changed his habitation arminius was a student at utrecht when death deprived him of his patron this loss would have embarrassed him greatly but that he had the good fortune to be assisted by rodolphus snellius his countryman who took him with him to marpurg in      soon after his arrival here he had the news of his country having been sacked by the spaniards this plunged him into the most dreadful affliction nor could he help returning to holland to be himself an eyewitness of the state to which things were reduced but having found that his mother his sisters his brethren and almost all the inhabitants of oudewater had been murdered he returned to marpurg his stay here was however but short for he returned again to holland being informed of the foundation of the university of leyden and pursued his studies at this new academy with so much assiduity and success that he acquired very great reputation he was sent to geneva in      at the expense of the magistrates of amsterdam to perfect his studies and here he applied himself chiefly to the lectures of theodore beza who was at this time explaining the epistle to the romans arminius had the misfortune to displease some of the leading men of the university because he maintained the philosophy of ramus in public with great warmth and taught it in private being obliged therefore to retire he went to basil where he was received with great kindness here he acquired such great reputation that the faculty of divinity offered him the degree of doctor without any expense but he modestly excused himself from receiving this honor and returned to geneva where having found the adversaries of ramism less violent than formerly he became also more moderate he had a great desire to see italy and particularly to hear the philosophical lectures of the famous james zabarella at padua he satisfied this cariosity and spent six or seven months in the journey he then returned to geneva and afterward to amsterdam where he found many calumnies had been raised against him on account of his journey to italy which had somewhat cooled the affections of the magistrates of amsterdam his friends and patrons he easily justified himself to men of sense though many weak and superstitious persons remained prejudiced against him he was ordained minister at amsterdam the   th of august      and soon distinguished himself by his sermons which were remarkable for their solidity and learning so that he was extremely followed and universally applauded martin lydius professor of divinity at franeker thought him a fit person to refute a writing wherein the doctrine of theodore beza upon predestination had been attacked by some ministers of delft arminius accordingly at his earnest entreaty undertook to refute this work but upon examining and weighing the arguments on both sides he embraced the opinions he proposed to confute and even went farther than the ministers of delft he was threatened with some trouble about this at amsterdam being accused of departing from the established doctrine but the magistrates of amsterdam interposing their authority prevented any dissension in   0  he was called to the professorship of divinity at leyden he began his lectures with three elegant orations the first of the object of divinity the second of the author and end of it and the third of the certainty of it and then proceeded to the exposition of the prophet jonah the disputes upon grace soon after kindled in the university and the states of the province were forced to appoint conferences betwixt him and his adversaries gomarus was a great persecutor of arminius but the reputation of the latter was so well established that he was continually attended by a numerous audience who admired the strength of argument and solid learning which he showed in all his lectures this exposed him to the envy of his brethren who treated him with great outrage in the year   0  he wrote an excellent letter to the ambassador of the elector palatine to vindicate his conduct with regard to the contests about religion in which he was engaged and the same year gave a full account to the states of holland of his sentiments with regard to the controverted points these contests however his continual labor and his uneasiness at seeing his reputation blasted by a number of slanders threw him into a fit of sickness of which he died the   th of october   0  dominic baudius and hugo grotius wrote each of them a poem upon his death and daniel heinsius did the same but this poem was afterward suppressed in the addition of his works  arminius was esteemed an excellent preacher his voice was low but very agreeable and his pronunciation admirable he was easy and affable to persons of all ranks and facetious in his conversation amongst his friends his great desire was that christians would bear with one another in all controversies which did not affect the fundamentals of their religion and when they persecuted each other for points of indifference it gave him the utmost dissatisfaction his enemies endeavored to represent him in the most disadvantageous light but his memory has been sufficiently vindicated by men of the greatest distinction he left several works  arpinas or arpino joseph caesar a famous painter born in the year    0 at the castle of arpinas in the kingdom of naples he lived in great intimacy with pope clement viii who conferred upon him the honor of knighthood and bestowed on him many other marks of his friendship in the year   00 he went to paris with cardinal aldobrandin who was sent legate to the french court on the marriage of henry iv with mary of medicis his christian majesty gave arpinas many considerable presents and created him a knight of st michael the coloring of this painter is thought to be cold and inanimate yet there is spirit in his designs and his compositions have somewhat of fire and elevation the touches of his pencil being free and bold are therefore admired by connoisseurs in painting but they are generally incorrect what he painted of the roman history is the most esteemed of all his works the french king has in his collection the following pieces of this master viz the nativity of our savior diana and acteon the rape of europa and a susana he died at rome in    0  arrian a famous historian and philosopher who lived under the emperor hadrian and the two antoninuses born at nicomedia in bithynia he was styled the second xenophon and was raised to the most considerable dignities of rome mr tillemont takes him to be the same person with that flaccus arrianus who being governor of cappadocia stopped the incursions of the alani and sent an account of his voyage round the euxine see to hadrian he is said to have been preceptor to the famous philosopher and emperor marcus antoninus there are extant four books of his diatribae or dissertations upon epictetus whose disciple he had been and photius tells us that he composed likewise twelve books of that philosophers discourses we are told by another author that he wrote the life and death of epictetus the most celebrated of his works in his history in greek of alexander the great in seven books a performance much esteemed by the best judges photius mentions also his history of bithynia another of the alani and a third of the parthians in seventeen books which he brought down to the war carried on by trajan against them he gives us likewise an abridgment of arrians ten books of the history of the successors of alexander the great and tells us also that he wrote an account of the indies in one book which is still extant the work which he first entered upon was the history of bithynia but wanting the proper memoirs and materials for it he suspended the execution of this design till he had published some other performances this history consisted of eight books and was carried down till the time when nicomedes resigned bithynia to the romans but there is nothing of it remaining but what is quoted in photius and stephanus byzantinus arrian is said to have written several other works lucian tells us that he wrote the life of a robber whose name was tiliborus this author endeavoring to excuse himself for the pains he had taken in writing the life of alexander the impostor speaks in the following manner let no person says he accuse me of having employed my labor upon too low and mean a subject since arrian the worthy disciple of epictetus who is one of the greatest men amongst the romans and who has passed his whole life amongst the muses condescended to write the life of tiliborus there is likewise under the name of arrian a periplus of the red sea that is of the eastern coasts of africa and asia as far as the indies but authors are not agreed whether this is the production of the author of whom we write there is likewise a book of tactics under his name the beginning of which is lost to these is added the order which he gave for the marching of the roman army against the alani and giving them battle which may very properly be ascribed to our author who was engaged in a war against that people  there were several other persons of his name julius capitolinus in his life of the emperor gordian mentions a greek historian of that name this cannot be the arrian of whom we write since he lived an age before that emperor suetonius in his life of tiberius mentions a poet of the same name but he was more ancient than the other two since tiberius endeavored to imitate him in his greek poems he is very probably the same who according to suidas wrote the alexandrias an heroic poem in twentyfour book upon the actions of alexander the great  arsenius a deacon of the roman church of great learning and piety he was pitched upon by the pope to go to the emperor theodosius as tutor to his son arcadius arsenius arrived at constantinople in the year     the emperor happening one day to go into the room where arsenius was instructing arcadius he found his son seated and the preceptor standing he reproached the latter for not supporting properly the dignity of his employment arsenius politely excused himself alleging that having the honor to speak to an emperor for arcadius had been associated to the empire at eight years of age he could not with good manners remain seated in his presence but theodosius not being satisfied with this answer took from his son the imperial ornaments made arsenius fit in his place and ordered arcadius for the future to receive his lessons standing and uncovered arcadius however profited but little by his tutors instructions for some time after he formed a design of dispatching arsenius the officer to whom arcadius had applied for this purpose divulged the affair to arsenius who retired to the deserts of scete where he passed many years in the exercises of the most strict and fervent devotion he died there at ninetyfive years of age  artalis joseph born at mazara in sicily in      he had an early passion for poetry and a strong inclination for arms he finished his studies at fifteen years of age about which tims he fought a duel in which he mortally wounded his adversary he saved himself by taking shelter in a church and it was owing to this accident that he afterward applied himself to the study of philosophy his parents being dead and himself much embarrassed in his circumstances he resolved to quit his country and to seek his fortune elsewhere he accordingly went for candia at the time when this city was besieged by the turks he gave there so many proofs of his bravery that he obtained the honor of knighthood in the military order of st george when he was upon his return for italy he was often obliged to draw his sword he was sometimes wounded in these rencounters but being an excellent swordsman he had often the advantage of his antagonist he rendered himself so formidable even in germany that they used to style him chevalier de sang ernest duke of burnswic and lunenburg appointed him captain of his guards but this did not make him neglect the muses for he cultivated them amidst the noise of arms he was member of several academies in italy and became highly in favor with many princes especially the emperor leopold he died the   th of february      at naples where he was interred in the church of the dominicans with great magnificence the academy de gl intricati attended his funeral and vincent antonio capoci made his funeral oration  artemidorus famous for his treatise upon dreams he was born at ephesus but took upon him the surname of daldianus in this book by way of respect to the country of his mother he styled himself the ephesian in his other performances he lived under the emperor antoninus pius as he himself informs us when he tells us that he knew a wrestler who having dreamed he had lost his sight carried the prize in the games celebrated by command of that emperor he not only bought up all that had been wrote concerning the explication of dreams which amounted to many volumes but he likewise spent many years in traveling in order to contract an acquaintance with fortune tellers he also carried on an extensive correspondence with all the people of this sort in the cities and assemblies of greece italy and the most populous islands collecting at the same time all the old dreams and the events which are said to have followed them he despised the reproaches of those grave supercilious persons who treat the foretellers of events as cheats impostors and jugglers and frequented much the company of those diviners for several years he was the more assiduous in his study and search after the interpretation of dreams being moved thereto as he fancied by the advice  in some measure by the command of apollo the work which he wrote on dreams consisted of five books the first three were dedcated to one cassius maximus and the last two to his son whom  took a good deal of pains to instruct in the nature and interpretation of dreams the work was first printed in greek at venice i      and rigaltius published an edition at paris in greek an latin in   0  and added some notes artemidorus wrote also treatise upon auguries and another upon chiromancy but they a not extant  arthur king of the britons of whom though the common opinion be that nothing wi certainty can be affirmed from his birth to his death yet is it b just that what is related of him should be told here therefore w shall report chiefly from geoffrey of monmouth the common sto of arthur and his exploits as to his birth he is said to ha been the son of uther pendragon king of the britons by igern the wife of gorlois duke of cornwall this lady is held to ha been in her time the greatest beauty in britain and we are tol that uther pendragon enjoyed her by the help of merlins skill  magic who gave this amorous prince the form of gorlois so the igerna taking him for her husband received him readily to her be and had by him arthur but though he was begotten in adulter he was born in wedlock for soon after this transaction uther pedragon killed gorlois and married his widow igerna who w brought to bed of arthur in  0  this story is in itself very incrdible but if we admit the commentary of buchanan it becomes  clear and as intelligible as we could wish he says that the ki lay with the duke of cornwalls wife in the dukes lifetime a marrying her after his decease the story of the magical intervi was invented to restore the splendor of the ladys honor and man way for the kings owning arthur for his son uther pendrag had also by the same lady a daughter called anne and dying in t year     arthur ascended the throne in his place though he  then but fifteen or as buchanan says eighteen years old at t time the saxons committed horrid devastations in britain under t command of colgrin their duke wherefore dubricius archbish of caerleon solemnly crowned arthur at the request of the nob and the people who immediately prepared to take the field again the saxons his generosity personal bravery and great zeal  the glory of the britons procured him quickly a competent army with which he routed colgrin and all his forces consisting of saxons scots and picts on the banks of the river douglas but not without very considerable loss on his own side upon this colgrin retired with the remains of his army into york where arthur besieged him and while he lay before the place cador duke of cornwall defeated baldulph the brother of colgrin who with six thousand men came to his relief the king however could not take york for cheldric or cerdic king of the saxons landing in albania ie scotland with a prodigious number of men from on board a fleet of six hundred sail marched toward the britons upon which by the advice of his council arthur raised the siege of york and marched to london on his arrival in that city he called a general assembly wherein the state of affairs having been thoroughly debated it was agreed to send ambassadors to hoel king of armorica i e britanny who was arthurs sisters son to entreat his assistance which being accordingly done hoel himself embarked with fifteen thousand men and landing at southampton then called the port of hamo quickly found his uncle who received him with all the affection and respect imaginable immediately after this junction arthur and his kinsman marched to oblige the saxons to raise the siege of kaerlind coit now called lincoln the saxons upon their approach instantly rose from before the place that with the greater convenience they might fight the britons the battle was bloody and obstinate but at last the saxons were overthrown with the loss of six thousand men part killed and part drowned in the rivers the remains of the army retired to the woods of caledon which most probably are celidon woods in lincolnshire where they made a brave stand but being surrounded by the britons were at last obliged to surrender upon articles viz that they should leave behind them all their booty retire peaceably to their ships and transport themselves back again into germany for the performance of these articles they gave hostages and were then suffered to retire in order to embark quietly but in their voyage repenting of what they had done they landed at totness burnt all the country as far as the severn sea slaughtered the peasants ruined the villages and at length laid ge to the city of badon ie bath in somersetshire when this news was brought to king arthur who was on the point of marching against the scots and picts he instantly ordered the saxon hostages to be put to death and then marched to the relief of the besieged city when he drew near it himself first made a speech to the army and then the archbishop dubricius harangued them likewise and gave them his blessing on the day of battle arthur put on an excellent coat of mail a golden helmet with the figure of a dragon upon the top thereof across his shoulder hung his shield called pridwen or prywen wherein was pictured the virgin mary bearing the child jesus in her arms he had likewise by his side his sword called calliburn and in his right hand he bore his lance rou thus equipped he attacked the saxons who were drawn up in the form of a wedge the battle lasted from morning till evening when the saxons withdrew to the top of a high hill and there encamped the next day arthur attacked them again but they made a gallant defense till the greatest part of the day was worn out which so enraged arthur that he threw himself among the foremost ranks and with great hazard of his person performed there incredible feats of valor for he slew with his own hand four hundred and seventy men the britons encouraged by the example of their prince forced the saxon camp on all hands and put many thousands of them to the sword amongst whom fell colgrin and baldulph but as for cerdic he carried off the remains of his army and endeavored to recover his ships after the important victory at badon arthur received advice that the scots and picts had besieged the city of aclud which is thought to be dunbritton in scotland where he left his nephew hoel sick at the time he marched back against the saxons to his assistance therefore the generous british prince marched with all the alacrity imaginable leaving cador duke of cornwall to pursue the saxons on his approach the scots and picts not only raised the siege but fled precipitately to loughlomond where they endeavored to fortify themselves in the islands but arthur having quickly equipped a fleet obliged them to surrender and out of his great clemency pardoned them in the mean time cador duke of cornwall taking a circuit round the saxons and thereby giving them time to collect themselves into a body and to refresh after their fatigues suddenly seized and carried away their ships and then marched in quest of them who perceiving their desperate condition retired into the isle of thanet where cador blocked them up with their own ships and after killing their commander cerdic in fight forced them to surrender upon articles and to give hostages once more for their departing out of the kingdom this done cador rejoined the king who kept his christmas at york where he destroyed the temples of the pagans restored the christian churches and appointed pyramus his chaplain archbishop of this see he also promoted augusel to the sovereignty over the scots rewarded other persons of distinction and took himself to wife guanhumara a lady descended from the romans of exquisite beauty bred up in the family of cador duke of cornwall the next summer he fitted out a fleet and therewith invaded ireland of which guillamurius was the chief king who to oppose him drew together a numerous army which arthur defeated and made him prisoner upon this all the petty princes in the island submitted then he sailed to iceland which he likewise subdued and received the submissions of doldavius king of gothland and gunsasius king of the orkneys whom the very terror of his arms had reduced to obedience after this he returned into britain and governed here twelve years in peace with such magnificence and splendour that all europe was amazed at it and the greatest potentates stood in fear of him at length sichelin king of the norwegians dying and leaving his kingdom to lot arthurs brotherinlaw the people of norway notwithstanding set up riculf on this pretense therefore arthur invaded that kingdom defeated the norwegians killed riculf conquered norway and dacia that is denmark and having given the whole to lot proceeded with his victorious army to invade gaul then a province as our historian tells us of the roman empire the greatest part of the country he quickly subdued blocked up the roman governor in paris and reduced him to such straits there that he was on the very point of starving in this distress he challenged arthur to a single combat which he was too gallant a man to refuse whereupon a bloody duel ensued in which at first arthur had the worst but at length he conquered and killed flollo upon which paris surrendered he spent however nine years in conquering the rest of france after which he returned to that city and kept a royal court bestowing neustria afterward called normandy upon his butler bedver and the rest of the provinces upon his domestics upon the approach of the feast of pentecost arthur determined to to call a great assembly of the most noble of his subjects which he appointed to be held at caerleon in montgomeryshire because standing on the river usk near the severn sea it was both pleasant and commodious for the coming and going of those who were invited accordingly there assembled augusel king of scotland the king of north wales the king of south wales cador now called king of cornwall the archbishops of london york and caerleon with a multitude of british princes there came likewise guillamurius king of ireland malvasius king of iceland doldavius king of gothland gunfasius king of the orkneys lot king of norway aschillius king of the dacians etc at this time he was solemnly crowned the kings of scotland cornwall north and south wales carrying four golden swords before him not long after this the romans demanded tribute which arthur by the advice of his council not only refused but resolved to make war upon them a mighty army he gathered and marched to southampton where he embarked leaving the government of britain to his nephew modred the son of lot by his sister anne before mentioned but while he was a coasting about the island he had news brought him that a spanish giant had forcibly taken away helena the daughter of his nephew hoel duke of britanny whom he had carried to mount st michael in cornwall thither the king pursuing him slew him in single combat after which he proceeded in the war he had first designed and having therein triumphed over all the forces of the roman empire and slain with his own hand lucius tiberius their general as he was passing the alps in order to go to rome he received advice that modred his nephew had revolted and had married guanhumara his queen this says our historian obliged him to desist from his enterprise against leo king of the romans wherefore sending hoel king of britanny with a great army to secure the peace of gaul he with the rest of his forces sailed for britain modred knowing the badness of his cause endeavored to fortify himself by many and great alliances with this view he once more called in the saxons and also invited by promising great sums of money the scots picts and irish to fight under his banner at length having assembled eighty thousand men he led them down into kent to oppose his uncle who he knew intended to land there he could not however prevent arthurs coming on shore but he presently engaged him and after a bloody battle in which many of the kings friends fell was defeated and forced to fly to winchester as for the queen she retired to the city of caerleon and there became a nun king arthur pursued his nephew to winchester and there a second time engaged him beat him and forced him to fly toward cornwall there on the banks of the river camel modred made a stand again with sixty thousand men with whom arthur fought a third battle wherein after thousands had been slain and amongst them many of the most honorable persons on both sides at length modred himself was killed and his army totally routed in this engagement however our hero arthur received several wounds which forced him to retire into the island of avalon where feeling himself extremly weak he resigned the crown to constantine the son of cador duke of cornwall and a few days after died a d     it is necessary to add a little sober truth to this romantic story and therefore let us conclude this article with observing that henry ii who was the first of the plantagenet line being in the last year of his reign at pembroke and hearing there a welsh bard singing to his harp the story of our arthur concluding with an account of his death and burial in the churchyard of glastenbury between two pyramids the king instantly gave orders that the matter should be enquired into and the body dug up this was done as the king directed and at the depth of seven feet was found a vast stone whereon was fastened a leaden cross with this inscription on the inside hic jacet sepultus inclytus rex arturius in insula avalonia here lies the famous king arthur buried in the isle of avalon digging still lower they found the kings body in the trunk of a tree his beautiful queen lying by him with long flowing hair in color bright as gold which however sunk into dust when touched the kings bones were very large sized and in his skull there were ten wounds or more all cicatrized except that of which he died this discovery was made in the year      as giraldus cambrensis tells us who saw these bones and examined the whole matter carefully there was also a table containing this story set up in the monastery of glastenbury and the leaden cross with the inscription remained there till the dissolution of the monastery where it was seen by the great antiquary leland but what is become of it since does not appear  arundel thomas archbishop of canterbury in the reigns of richard ii henry iv and henry v he was the second son of robert earl of arundel and warren and brother of richard earl of arundel who was beheaded  at twenty two years of age from being archdeacon of taunton he was raised to the bishopric of ely the  th of april      in the reign of edward iii he was a great benefactor to the church and palace of this see among other donations he gave a curious table of massy gold adorned with precious stones which had been given to prince edward by the king of spain and sold by the latter to bishop arundel in      he was appointed lord chancellor of england two years after he was translated to the sea of york and in      was advanced to the archiepiscopal see of canterbury when he resigned the chancellorship this was the first instance of the translation of an archbishop of york to the sea of canterbury scarce was he fixed in this see when he had a contest with the university of oxford about the righ of visitation the affair was referred to king richard who determined it in favor of the archbishop at his visitation in london he revived an old constitution by which the inhabitants of the respective parishes were obliged to pay to their rector one halfpenny in the pound of the rent of their houses in the second year of his translation a parliament being held at london the commons with the kings leave impeached the archbishop together with his brother the earl of arundel and the duke of gloucester of high treason the archbishop was sentenced to be banished and within forty days to depart the kingdom on pain of death he retired first to france and then to the court of rome where pope boniface ix gave him a kind reception and wrote a letter to king richard in his favor but this having no effect his holiness resolved to interpose his authority he accordingly nominated arundel to the bishopric of st andrews and declared his intention of giving him several preferments in england the king being informed of the popes designs wrote a letter to him in the following terms thomas for his treasonable conspiracy against our crown and royal dignity has been sentenced only to perpetual banishment whereas had he been dealt with answerably to his demerits he ought to have suffered the punishment of high treason but in consideration of his character and out of regard to religion we have thought fit to grant him his life and abated the rigor of the law but since his going beyond sea both ourself and our subjects are much surprised at the turn of his fortune for we are informed he has been invited to your holinesss court countenanced in his misbehaviour taken into your protection and put in hopes of recovering his see or at least of being promoted in our kingdom to benefices of greater value than those he enjoyed before how destructive such unaccountable favors as these must be to our dignity and government and to what apparent danger it may expose us is easy to imagine for which reason we are resolved not to bear with such treatment though the whole world were of a different opinion for we are thoroughly acquainted with this man we know him to be of a turbulent seditious temper who if he were permitted to live in our dominions would return to his old practices poison our subjects with misreporting the administration and endeavor to undermine our government for it is probable he would use sufficient precaution not to fall under the lash of the law we desire therefore that your holiness would prevent these opportunities of mischief and not shock our interests and inclinations by such favors for should such measures be put in execution it is possible they might create such misunderstandings between the crown and the mitre as it might prove difficult to remove for to speak plainly we cannot take that person for our friend who caresses our enemies and takes them by the hand in so loving a manner however if you have a mind to provide for him otherwise we have nothing to object only we cannot allow him to dip in our dish we heartily desire you would take the mater into serious consideration as you tender our royal regards and expect a compliance with any future request your holiness may make to us this epistle had so good an effect upon his holiness that he withheld his intended favors from arundel and at the kings request promoted roger walden to the sea of canterbury  next year arundel returned to england with the duke of lancaster afterward henry iv upon whose accession to the throne the pope evoked the bull granted walden and restored arundel to his see in the first year of king henrys reign arundel summoned a synod which sat at st pauls the next year the commons moved that he revenues of the church might be applied to the service of the pubic but arundel opposed the motion with such vigor that it was thrown aside in the year   0  arundel began to exert himself against the lollards or wickliffites he summoned the bishops and clergy at oxford in order to stop the progress of this new sect and prevent the universitys being farther tinctured with their opinions in      being informed that this doctrine gained ground notwithtanding the condemnation thereof in a full congregation at oxford e resolved to visit the university and apply some farther remedy e accordingly went thither attended by the earl of arundel his nephew and a splendid retinue when he came near oxford he was et by the principal members of the university who told him that he came only to see the place he was welcome but if he came as  visitor they refused to acknowledge his jurisdiction the archbishop resented their behavior in such a manner that he left oxford in a day or two and wrote to the king concerning this affair after  warm contest between the university and the archbishop the dispute as referred to king henry who according to the example of his predecessors gave it in favor of the archbishop soon after a convotion being held at st pauls in london the bishops and clergy omplained of the growth of wickliffism at oxford and pressed the chbishop to put a stop to this evil for this purpose he sent delegates to the university who received them with respect and appointed a committee to examine all heretical books particularly those of wickliffe this committee having censured some passages extract from his books sent an account of their proceedings to the archbishop who confirmed their censures and sent an authority in writing to some eminent men of the university to enquire into person suspected of heterodoxy and oblige them to declare their opinions these rigorous proceedings rendered arundel extremely odious to the wickliffites and his zeal for suppressing that sect carried him to several unjustifiable severiies against the heads of it particularly against sir john oldcastle and lord cobham this prelat died at canterbury the  0th of february      having held the

flourished in the time of the emperor domitian when sallustius lucullus was lieutenant for the romans in britain the british historians especially geoffrey o monmouth place him in the reign of the emperor claudius wh enterprise against britain he is said to have opposed the accou we have of arviragus in that author is generally esteemed to be fabulous however the substance of it is as follows kymbelinus when he had governed britain ten years begat two sons the elder name guiderius and the younger arviragus kymbelinus being dead guiderius who succeeded him resolved to shake off the roman yoke and began with refusing to pay the usual tribute whereupon the emperor claudius undertook an expedition into britain in battle which ensued between the romans and the britons guideri was treacherously killed by leuis hamo a roman upon which aviragus putting on his brothers habiliments and heading the brtons gained a victory over claudius but being soon after besiege by that prince in the city of winchester he made his submission to the romans and in consequence of the treaty married the emperor daughter genuissa matters being thus accommodated claudi returned to rome and left to arviragus the government of the briti islands after the departure of the romans arviragus became very powerful prince and this so elevated him with pride that  disdained any longer subjection to the romans and assumed to himself an independent authority whereupon vespasian was sent again him into britain and upon the arrival of this general a great batt was fought in which neither side got the victory but the mornin after the fight by the mediation of queen genuissa the two leade were reconciled vespasian returned to rome and arviragus rmained in britain this monarch lived to a good old age govering his kingdom in peace confirming the old laws of his ancestors enacting new ones and liberally rewarding persons of merit so that his fame spread all over europe and he was both loved and feared by  romans and bcame the subject of their discourse more than any king of his time after his death he was buried at gloucester in a certain temple which he had built and dedicated to the honor of the empeor claudius this is the substance of geoffrey of monmouths narrative there is an old tradition that in the time of this british king joseph of arimathea came over into britain and planted

james paget esquire baron of the exchequer whose kindness he acknowledges with the utmost sense of gratitude in june      he lost his father whose bad economy proved very injurious to himself and family he continued for some years in the paget family during which time he applied to the law with great assiduity in the year      he became a solicitor in chancery and on the   th of february      was sworn an attorney in the court of common pleas in august      the city of london being then in great confusion he retired to cheshire and toward the end of the year      he went to oxford the chief residence of the king at that time where he entered himself of brazen nose college and applied with great vigor to the study of natural philosophy mathematics and astronomy on the  th of may      he became one of the gentlemen of the ordnance in the garrison at oxford from whence he removed to worcester where he was commissioner receiver and register of the excise and soon after captain in lord ashleys regiment as well as comptroller of the ordnance on the   th of october      he was elected a brother of the free and accepted masons and in some of his manuscripts there are said to be many curious particulars relating to the history of this society the kings affairs being now grown desperate after the surrender of worcester mr ashmole retired again to cheshire where he contied till october and then returned to london upon his arrival in town he became acquainted with the great astrologers sir jonas moore mr lilly and mr booker who received him into their fraternity and elected him steward of their annual feast in      h went down into berkshire where he lived an agreeable and retire life in the village of englefield it was here that he became acquainted with the lady mainwaring to whom he was married on the   th of november      soon after his marriage he went an settled in london where his house was frequented by all the learne and ingenious men of that time mr ashmole was a diligent an curious collector of manuscripts in the year    0 he published treatise written by dr arthur dee relating to the philosopher stone together with another tract on the same subject by an unknow author about the same time he was busied in preparing for the press a complete collection of the works of such english chemists as ha till then remained in manuscript this undertaking cost him great labor and expense and at length the work appeared toward the close of the year      he proposed at first to have carried it on t several volumes but he afterward dropped this design and seeme to take a very different turn in his studies he now applied himself to the study of antiquity and records he was at great pains to trac the roman road which in antoninuss itinerary is called bennevana from weedon to litchfield of which he gave mr dugdale a account in a letter in      he began to collect materials for hi history of the order of the garter which he lived to finish and there by did no less honor to the order than to himself in septembe following he made a journey to oxford where he set about givin a full and particular description of the coins given to the public librar by archbishop laud  upon the restoration of king charles ii mr ashmole was intrduced to his majesty who received him very graciously and on the   th of june    0 bestowed on him the place of windsor herald and a few days after he appointed him to give a description of h medals which were accordingly delivered into his possession and kin henry viiis closet was assigned for his use at the same time a commission was granted to him to examine hugh peters about the cotents of the kings library which had fallen into his hands whi was carefully executed but to little effect on the   th of februar mr ashmole was admitted a fellow of the royal society and on t  th of february following the king appointed him secretary of sunam in the west indies on the   th of july      the universi of oxford in consideration of the many favors they had receiv from mr ashmole created him doctor of physic by diploma whi was presented to him by dr yates principal of brazen nose college on the  th of may      he presented his institution laws and ceremonies of the most noble order of the garter to the king who received it very graciously and as a mark of his approbation granted him a privy seal for four hundred pounds out of the custom of paper on the   th of january      a fire broke out in the middle temple in the next chamber to mr ashmoles by which he lost a noble library with a collection of nine thousand coins ancient and modern and a vast repository of seals charters and other antiquities and curiosities but his manuscripts and his most valuable gold medals were luckily at his house at lambeth in      the university of oxford having finished a magnificent repository near the theater mr ashmole sent thither his curious collection of rarities which benefaction was considerably augmented by the addition of his manuscripts and library at his death which happened at lambeth the   th of may in the seventysixth year of his age he was interred in the church of great lambeth in surry on the   th of may       asser of st davids asserius menevensis author of the life of king alfred was born at st davids in pembrokeshire where he entered himself into the order of benedictine monks being invited by king alfred to his court he gained so great a share in that princes favor that he gave him the bishopric of shirburn and made him abbot of the monasteries of amersbury and banwel and as sir john spelman tells us of exeter according to dr cave it was he who persuaded alfred to found the university of oxford and settle annual stipends upon the professors of the several sciences we have a chronicle or annals ascribed to him he died in the year  0   atheling edgar the son of edward the son of edmond ironside king of england by agatha daughter to solomon king of hungary or rather of the emperor henry ii in what year he was born is not certain but he was very young in  0   when his father and family were recalled into their native country by their kinsman edward the confessor then king thereof his father died soon after his return before the king had time to give him any essential marks of that kindness which he professed to him edgar was carefully bred up by him who was his great uncle and was undoubtedly intended for his successor as the best authors assure us and as his title atheling or most noble implies which is rightly noted by mr seldom correcting in this respect polydore virgil who mistook it for a surname but on king edwards death edgar was deprived of his right because of his youth his being born abroad and his having too little experience for a crowned head in such troublesome times harold the son of earl godwin chiefly through the intrigues of the clergy was preferred before him for which they are severely censured by some writers this happened in the beginning of a d  0   harold however treated him with great respect as long as he lived after whose death and defeat in the fatal battle of hastings the nobles and people in general looked upon edgar as king and even acknowledged him as such but william duke of normandy awing them with his victorious army was owned and crowned monarch of england at westminster in the same year to him if we credit some of our ancient historians edgar immediately submitted and was amongst the number of those whom william carried with him as hostages into normandy other authors are silent on this head but all agree that in  0   edgar attended by many of the prime nobility retired first into northumberland afterward into scotland the persons who adhered to him had so considerable an interest both at home and abroad that they quickly drew together a numerous army and therewith began to bid fair for unsettling the new establishment in  0   king william sent robert common into the north in order to expel edgar and his associates out of those parts constituting him earl of northumberland but this great man had but an ill fate being slain by such forces as he had about him the next year a great succor came to these malcontents from denmark and more english lords reconciling themselves to edgar he made head against the normans and after several successful engagements made himself master of the city of york and wintered between the ouse and trent notwithstanding all efforts of the conqueror in  0 0 he was less fortunate william found means by money and promises to draw off the danes and some of the lords of his party and in the end obliged him again to retire into scotland malcolm king of that country married this year his sister margaret so excellent a woman that in her lifetime she was styled the good and after her decease was regarded as a saint this marriage enabled edgar to make new attempts in which he had mostly the better the king of scots openly assisting him notwithstanding king william had demanded him and threatened to invade scotland in case of refusal some domestic troubles hindered that prince from performing his threat for two years in  0   however king william entered scotland with an army but with indifferent success upon this he readily made peace with malcolm and reglated according to ancient treaties the bounds of their respective dominions in this peace the scots historians say edgar atheling was included and on his submission received into king williams favor which is very probable since the war was on his account in  0   edgar left scotland where he had been so kindly entertained and where his sister was queen he crossed the sea into normandy and was kindly received by king william who gave him a grand allowance some of our authors say it was a pound of silver a day others twenty shillings however he was therewith contented and lived quietly william of malmsbury his cotemporary and who expressly takes notice that he was living when he wrote speaks of him in terms little to his advantage he says he behaved meanly and foolishly in the kings court and as an instance thereof mentions his quitting his great allowance for a horse but this is not very consistent with the testimonies of other authors or with the general current of history after this submission our histories are silent concerning him for many years this however is a plain proof that he acted like a man of honor toward the norman since in that space there were many stirs of which he might have made his advantage in  0   that is about twelve years after his submission edgar conceiving himself ill treated at court retired fm thence this does not seem to speak him of quite so mean a spirit as malmsbury would make him certain it is that even now he had the hearts of the english nation since in the old abbey chronicles we meet with this prayer on the mention of his retreat may the almighty give him honor alluding to the little respect shown him at court but this retreat however was not without the kings consent on the contrary edgar obtained license to sail with a certain number of ships and two hundred soldiers on board to apulia this therefore was no disgraceful flight but rather an honorable exile about the same time his younger sister christina became a nun in ramsay abbey how long edgar continued in apulia is uncertain yet when he returned from thence he went into normandy where he was well received by duke robert who gave him certain lands for his subsistence whether this was done to awe his brother william rufus who seized the kingdom of england or purely to provide for an unhappy prince cannot now be determined but in  0   on the conclusion of a solemn treaty between the brethren robert and william the latter procured edgar athelings being dispossessed of his lands upon which he withdrew out of normandy and went into scotland to his brotherinlaw king malcolm in the same year this last mentioned prince raised a puissant army and therewith invaded england and carried away much spoil on the news whereof both brothers hastened out of normandy and sent a considerable force on board transports toward the north that they might more speedily assemble an army in those parts but being near michaelmas the weather proved stormy and most of the men were lost king william ii and duke robert raised however an army and though it was winter advanced therewith toward scotland upon this edgar interposed reconciled the two kings and mediated a good peace for this service he was restored to king williams favor and came back with the brothers to london however when duke robert returned into normandy edgar chose to accompany him either because he loved him best or feared him least this was in the beginning of  0   his stay in normandy was but short for the next year we find him again in england attending on and in favor with william ii that prince resided at gloucester about easter and was there so ill that his death was expected on the   th of august  0   malcolm king of scots importuned him by letters to regulate certain differences according to treaty on which william summoned him to gloucester and sent edgar to conduct him this he performed but after all king william treated malcolm very ill who returning into scotland levied an army entered northumberland and besieging the castle of alnwick which had been unjustly taken from him he was there treacherously slain together with his eldest son edward this unfortunate event could not but afflict edgar exceedingly especially when he saw his nephews deprived of their rights the scots setting up donald bane i e donald the white whom the english writers call dufenald for their king who was brother to malcolm edgar sent for his five nephews into england and carefully brought them up but not without some danger to himself if we credit the scots historians one orgar reported to king william rufus that edgar should say boastingly to his nephews that the right to the english crown was in him and in them edgar denied the charge and was allowed to justify himself by combat that is he chose a knight to enter into the lists for him who was so happy as to conquer buchanan informs us that the reason he did not fight in person was because edgar at this time was old and infirm but in thi he was mistaken edgar not exceeding fortythree and as we shall see he went afterward into palestine two of edgars nephews died before they were of age which hindered him from doing what he would otherwise have done for them his third nephew edgar growing toward mans estate and the scots inviting him when they were weary of his uncle to accept the crown he resolved to assist him in that undertaking applying therefore to king william he procured a small assistance from him and therewith marched to the borders of scotland where his forces quickly increased so as to enable him to look donald in the face it was in the winter of  0   that he set forward on this expedition and in the next spring having defeated and taken donald prisoner he established his nephew on the throne and then came back again into england after this we meet with no account of him till such time as with robert the son of godwin a famous knight he undertook a journey into the holy land it is probable this was in  0   he was with baldwin ii king of jerusalem when besieged in rama and having in their hazardous sally wherein they escaped thence lost his knight he thought of returning this was in   0  and accordingly he came back soon after into europe received great civilities from the greek and german emperors who importuned him to remain in their courts which he civilly excused and continued his journey either into england or normandy henry i had now ascended the english throne and espoused maud edgars niece he had therefore all imaginable reason to expect a good reception at court which however he either did not find or else it may be declined for we are certain that he was some short time after his return from the east in normandy with duke robert for whom he had a great kindness he even remained firm in his friendship to him when king henry invaded his dominions and was taken prisoner fighting in his cause as also was duke robert himself at the fatal battle of tenchebray wherein the whole force of normandy was routed which fell out in the latter end of   0  king henry dealt very severely with the rest of the prisoners but as for edgar he dismissed him freely this is the last time he is mentioned in our histories and after his return into england he went to pass the remainder of his days in the country where according to malmsbury he was living in    0 when he must have been seventy or thereabouts in what year he died appears not nor do we read that he was ever married he was born during his fathers exile lost him when his life would have secured him a crown struggled though to no purpose against the conqueror was through his whole life the sport of fortune and died full of years in a dark obscurity to which we add that till now his life was never written from a supposed want of materials and from a real want of inclination to glean from our ancient historians a multitude of little memorandums concerning an injured unfortunate prince this justice we have at length done to his memory and the english history which from this article we hope will not appear quite so barren as some modern writers would represent it  atterbury francis bishop of rochester in the reigns of queen anne and king george i was born the  th of march      at middleton or miltonkeynes near newportpagnel in buckinghamshire he had his education in grammar learning at westminster school and from thence in    0 was elected a student of christchurch college in oxford where he soon distinguished himself for the politeness of his wit and learning and gave early proofs of his poetical talents in a latin version of mr drydens absalom and achitophel an epigram on a ladys fan and a translation of two odes of horace he took the degree of bachelor of arts june the thirteenth      and that of master april the twentieth      this year he made his first essay in controversial writing in a piece entitled an answer to some considerations on the spirit of martin luther and the original of the reformation during his stay in the university he is generally thought to have borne no inconsiderable part in the famous controversy between dr bentley and the honorable mr charles boil afterward earl of orrery concerning the genuineness of phalariss epistles though mr atterburys name was not made use of on that occasion at what time he entered into holy orders is not certainly known but in      upon the death of his father he made application to the earl of nottingham to succeed in the rectory of milton which he then called the height of his ambition and wishes as being the place of his birth but being disappointed in his expectation of this preferment and long since tired of a college life mr atterbury resolved to quit the university and produce himself on a more active stage and accordingly making london his residence he soon distinguished himself in such a manner that he was appointed one of the chaplains in ordinary to king william and queen mary and was elected preacher at bridewell and lecturer of st brides in      our young divine preached a remarkable sermon at bridewell chapel before the governors of that and bethlehem hospital on the power of charity to cover sin to which mr benjamin hoadly since bishop of winchester published some exceptions the same year he was warmly attacked for his sermon preached before the queen at whitehall entitled the scorner incapable of true wisdom but the largest field of controversy in which he ever engaged was that which opened itself in the year   00 and continued four years between him dr wake afterward archbishop of canterbury and others concerning the rights powers and privileges of convocations in which however the truth of the question may be supposed to lie he displayed so much learning and ingenuity as well as zeal for the interests of his order that the lower house of convocation returned him their thanks and the university of oxford complimented him with the degree of doctor in divinity january the twentyninth   00 he was installed archdeacon of totness being promoted to that dignity by sir jonathan trelawny then bishop of exeter the same year he was engaged with some other learned divines in revising an intended edition of the greek testament with greek scholia collected chiefly from the fathers by mr archdeacon gregory upon the accession of queen anne in   0  dr atterbury was appointed one of her majestys chaplains in ordinary and in october   0  he was advanced to the deanery of carlisle about two years after this he was engaged in a dispute with mr hoadly concerning the advantages of virtue with regard to the present life occasioned by his sermon preached the thirtieth of august   0  at the funeral of mr thomas bennet a bookseller in   0  sir jonathan trelawny then bishop of exeter appointed him one of the canons residentiaries of that church and in   0  sir john trevor a great discerner of men and their abilities was so struck with his fame and charmed with his eloquence that he made him preacher of the rolls chapel this year he was engaged in a fresh dispute with mr hoadly concerning passive obedience occasioned by his latin sermon entitled concio ad clerum londinensem habita in ecclesia s elphegi in    0 came on the famous trial of dr sacheverell whose remarkable speech on that occasion was generally supposed to have been drawn up by our author in conjunction with dr smaldridge and dr friend the same year dr atterbury was unanimously chosen prolocutor of the lower house of convocation and had the chief management of affairs in that house the eleventh of may      he was appointed by the convocation one of the committee for comparing mr whistons doctrines with those of the church of england and in june following he had the chief hand in drawing up a representation of the present state of religion in      dr atterbury was made dean of christchurch notwithstanding the strong interest and warm application of several great men in behalf of his competitor dr smaldridge the next year saw him at the top of his preferment as well as of his reputation for in the beginning of june      the queen at the recommendation of the earl of oxford advanced him to the bishopric of rochester and deanery of westminster and he was consecrated at lambeth the  th of july following it is said he had in view the primacy of all england and that his credit with the queen and ministry was so considerable and his schemes so well laid as probably to have carried it upon a vacancy had not her majestys death in august      prevented him at the beginning of the succeeding reign his tide of prosperity began to turn and he received a sensible mortification presently after the coronation of king george i when upon his offering to present his majesty with a view no doubt of standing better in his favor with the chair of state and royal canopy his own perquisites as dean of westminster the offer was rejected not without some evident marks of dislike to his person during the rebellion in scotland which broke out in the first year of this reign bishop atterbury gave an instance of his growing disaffection to the established government in refusing to sign the declaration of the bishops besides which he constantly opposed the measures of the court in the house of lords and drew up some of the most violent protests with his own hand thus he went on till the year      when the government having reason to suspect him of being concerned in a plot in favor of the pretender he was accordingly apprehended on the twentyfourth of august and committed prisoner to the tower this commitment of a bishop upon a suspicion of high treason as it was a thing rarely practiced since the reformation so it occasioned various speculations among the people on the twentythird of march       a bill was brought into the house of commons for inflicting certain pains and penalties on francis lord bishop of rochester a copy of which was sent to him with notice that he had liberty of counsel and solicitors for making his defense under these circumstances the bishop applied by petition to the house of lords for their direction and advice as to his conduct in this conjuncture and on the  th of april he acquainted the speaker of the house of commons by a letter that he was determined to give that house no trouble in relation to the bill depending therein but should be ready to make his defense against it when it should be argued in another house of which he had the honor to be a member on the  th the bill passed the house of commons and was the same day sent up to the house of lords for their concurrence on the  th of may being the day appointed by the lords for the first reading of the bill bishop atterbury was brought to westminster to make his defense the counsel for the bishop were sir constantine phipps and william win esquire for the king mr reeve and mr wearg the proceedings continued above a week and on saturday may the eleventh the bishop was permitted to plead for himself which he did in a very eloquent speech on monday the thirteenth he was carried for the last time from the tower to hear the reply of the kings counsel to his defense on the fifteenth the bill was read the third time and after a very long and warm debate passed on the sixteenth by a majority of eightythee to fortythree on the twentyseventh the king came to the house and confirmed it by his royal assent it is said his majesty passed the bill with some regret being much concerned as he expressed it that there should be just cause of dooming to perpetual banishment a bishop of the church of england and a man of such eminent parts and learning to alleviate however in some measure the severity of this sentence the bishops daughter mrs morris was permitted to attend her father in his travels and his soninlaw mr morris by virtue of his majestys sign manual had leave to correspond with him on the eighteenth of june      this eminent prelate having the day before taken leave of his friends who from the time of passing the bill against him to the day of his departure had free access to him in the tower embarked on board the aldborough man of war and landed the friday following at calais from thence he went to brussels and afterward to paris where he resided till his death softening the rigours of his exile by study and conversation with learned men and by a constant epistolary correspondence with the most eminent scholars particularly with m thiriot an ingenious french gentleman for whom he had a great esteem and who has obliged the public with some of the bishops original letters which are chiefly critiques on several french authors bishop atterbury died at paris the fifteenth of february      his body was brought over to england and interred the twelfth of may following in westminster abbey some time before his death he published a vindication of himself bishop smaldridge and dr aldrich from a charge brought against them by mr oldmixon of having altered and interpolated the copy of lord clarendons history of the rebellion bishop atterburys sermons are extant in four volumes in octavo those contained in the two first were published by himself and dedicated to his great patron sir jonathan trelawny bishop of winchester those in the two last were published after his death by dr thomas moore his lordships chaplain his epistolary correspondence with mr pope is extant in the collection of that poets letters as to bishop atterburys character however the moral and political part of it may have been differently represented by the opposite parties it is universally agreed that he was a man of great learing and uncommon abilities a fine writer and a most excellent precher  audley sir thomas was descended of an ancient and honorable family in essex an born in      he had the advantage of an university education an afterward studied the law in one of the inns of court in      h was autumnreader of the inner temple on the recommendatio of the duke of suffolk the king took notice of him and finding him to be a man of great parts and good address procured him to be chosen speaker of that parliament which met on the third of november      audleys conduct in this station fully answered the kings expectations the next year he was made attorney of the duchy o lancaster and may  0      upon the resignation of sir thomas moore the king delivered to him the great seal with the title of lord keeper and at the same time conferred on him the honor of knighthood in january following the king appointed him lord chancellor and soon after granted him the site of the priory of christ church near aldgate now called dukes place with all the churchplate and lands belonging to that house in this high office he was as diligent in the kings business as he had been when speaker of the house of commons for in july      he sat in judgment and pronounced sentence of death upon sir thomas moore indicted of high treason for refusing to acknowledge the kings supremacy in the church when sentence was past sir thomas said that he had for seven years bent his mind and study upon this cause but as yet he found it no where writ by any approved doctor of the church that a layman could be head of the ecclesiastical state to which audley returned sir will you be reckoned wiser or of a better conscience than all the bishops the nobility and the whole kingdom  as audley had been very active in the business of the divorce so he had a large hand in the proceedings previous to the dissolution of such religious houses as had not two hundred pounds by the year his persuasions and the kings threats having procured a bill to be passed for this purpose by which the king not only obtained all the lands of the small monasteries but also their jewels and rich movables the next step was to prevail with the abbots of larger foundations to surrender audley offered the abbot of athelny a hundred marks per annum pension which he refused as too small a sum with the abbot of st osithes in essex he was more successful in a letter to cromwell the visitorgeneral after mentioning that he had by great solicitation prevailed with this ecclesiastic he insinuates that his place of lord chancellor being very chargeable he wished the king might be moved for an addition of some profitable offices an upon making application for the great abbey of walden in essex which with some difficulty he obtained he extenuated its worth and alleged that it would be but a reasonable recompense for the great damage and infamy he had suffered in serving the king  on the twentyninth of november      he was created baron audley of walden in essex and installed knight of the garter a little before his death he obtained from the king a license to change the name of buckingham college in cambridge into that of magdalen or maudlin to this college he was a great benefactor bestowed on it his own arms and is generally reputed its founder he died on the last of april      having held the seals upwards of twelve years and in the fiftysixth year of his life as appears by the inscription on his tomb mr rapin says he was a man of sound judgment and was serviceable to the reformers whenever he could be so without any hazard or danger to himself but was too much a courtier to insist even upon what he judged reasonable if disapproved of by the king lloyd says that he was always in favor with the queen who had no less interest in the kings heart than the kingdom had in his head and that he knew king henrys temper better than himself whom he surprised always to his own bent never moving any of his suits to him but when in haste and most commonly amusing him with other matter until he passed his request  by his lady elizabeth daughter of thomas gray marquis of dorset he had two daughters margaret and mary the latter dying unmarried margaret became his sole heir and married first lord henry dudley a younger son of john duke of northumberland and afterward thomas duke of norfolk by whom she had a son thomas who by act of parliament    eliz was restored in blood and in the   th of the same reign was summoned to parliament by his grandfathers title as baron of walden in the first of king james i he was created earl of suffolk and afterward lord high treasurer of england he built on the ruins of the abbey of walden that noble palace which in honor of our chancellor he called audleyend  augustine or austin st the first archbishop of canterbury was originally a monk in the convent of st andrew at rome and educated under st gregory afterward pope gregory i by whom he was dispatched into britain with forty other monks of the same order about the year     to convert the english saxons to christianity they landed in the isle of thanet and having sent some french interpreters to king ethelbert with an account of their errand the king gave them leave to convert as many of his subjects as they could and assigned their place of residence at dorovernum since called canterbury to which they were confined till the king himself was converted whose example had a powerful influence in promoting the conversion of his subjects but though he was extremely pleased at their becoming christians he never attempted to compel them he had learned says the venerable bede from his instructors in the way of salvation that force and dragooning was not the method of the gospel that the religion of jesus christ was to make its way by argument and persuasion to be matter of choice and not of compulsion augustine by direction of the pope went afterward to arles in france where he was consecrated archbishop and metropolitan of the english nation by the archbishop of that place on his return to britain he dispatched a priest and a monk to rome to acquaint the pope with the success of his mission and to desire his resolution of certain questions these men brought back with them a pall and several books vestments utensils and ornaments for the churches his holiness by the same messengers gave augustine directions concerning the settling of episcopal sees in britain and ordered him not to pull down the idol temples but to convert them into christian churches only destroying the idols and sprinkling the place with holy water that the natives by frequenting the temples they had been always accustomed to might be the less shocked at their entrance into christianity and whereas it had been their custom to sacrifice oxen to their false gods he advised that upon the anniversary of each churchs consecration the people should erect booths round about and feast therein not sacrificing their oxen to devils but killing them for their own refreshment and praising god for the blessing he further cautioned him not to be puffed up with the miracles he was enabled to work in confirmation of his ministry but to consider how much the english were the favorites of heaven since god enabled him to alter the course of nature to promote their conversion  augustine fixed his see at canterbury and being supported by the interest of king ethelbert made an attempt to settle a correspondence with the british bishops and to bring them to conformity with the roman church to this purpose a conference was held at a place in worcestershire since called augustins oak but without success a second conference was proposed at which the appearance was more numerous than at the former seven british bishops attending at it with a great many learned monks from the monastery of bancornaburg or bangor who were under the direction of their abbot dinoth these britons before they began their journey applied to a certain hermit of eminent virtue and good sense to know whether or not they should give up the usages and traditions of their church and acknowledge the pretensions of augustine he told them that if augustine should prove to be a man of god they ought to be governed by him they asked him how they should know this the hermit replied our savior says take my yoke upon you for i am meek and low in heart if augustine be affable and humble he has probably taken christs yoke upon him and offers you the same privilege but if he be haughty and insolent it is plain he is not commissioned from heaven nor are his words to be regarded the father asked by what marks they were to discover his temper the hermit desired them to manage it so that augustine and his company should be first at the place and if he rose to salute them at their coming in they might conclude he was sent from god but if he neglected this civility they might return his contempt and have nothing to do with him when the britons came into the synod augustine received them sitting in resentment of which affront they warmly opposed every thing he offered the articles insisted on by augustine were that they should celebrate easter and administer baptism according to the practice of the romish church and that they should acknowledge the popes authority if they would comply in these respects and assist in the conversion of the saxons he would bear with the disagreement of their customs in other cases but the britons replied they could yield none of the points contested  this apostle of the english died at canterbury in the year  0  the popish writers ascribe several miracles to him the observation of the festival of st augustine was first enjoined in a synod held under cuthbert archbishop of canterbury and afterward by the popes bull in the reign of king edward iii  axtel daniel a colonel in the service of the long parliament and executed for the share he had in the murder of king charles i the particulars of this gentlemans life before he engaged in the service of the parliament are so deeply buried in oblivion that notwithstanding all the industry we have used a very few only and those of less consequence than we could wish can be brought to light he was of a good family and had a tolerable education that is to say such a one as might fit him for the course of life it was intended he should lead being placed by his relations as an apprentice to a grocer in watlingstreet as he was of a very serious disposition and had been very early tinctured with those principles which were in that age styled puritanical he became an eager follower of such ministers as distinguished themselves by their zealous preaching his great attachment to these sort of people and the natural warmth of his own temper were the occasions of his quitting his own calling and going into the army to which he was principally determined by keeping a day of fasting and prayer with mr simeon ash mr love mr woodcocke and other ministers in lawrencelane wherein according to his judgment they did so clearly state the cause of the parliament that he was fully convinced of the justice of their cause and resolved to venture his life for it such were the consequences of the professors of the christian religion converting their pulpits into schools of politics to which it may truly be said the civil wars owed its beginning as most of the dismal consequences with which it was attended flowed but too apparently from the same source after having thus chosen his party he behaved in the army with so much zeal courage and conduct that he rose by degrees to the several commands of captain major and lieutenant colonel in a regiment of foot it was in this last capacity that he acted with great vehemence against all endeavors for a reconciliation with the king and particularly concurred in exhibiting a charge of high treason against eleven members of the house of commons for betraying the cause of the parliament endeavoring to break and destroy the army with other particulars which obliged those gentlemen to withdraw which was the first force put upon that house of commons and the remembrance of the concern clonel axtel had therein contributed not a little to his destruction upon several changes that afterward happened these members were again admitted sat and voted in the house and new schemes were entered upon for restoring the constitution by settling the government in order to which the house of commons on the fifth of december      resolved that his majestys concessions to the propositions upon the treaty of the isle of wight were sufficient grounds for the houses to proceed upon for the settlment of the kingdom but a great party in the army who thought otherwise determined to prevent the effects of this and accordingly placed one colonel pride with a guard at the door of the parliament house having in his hands a list of those members who were to be excluded accordingly he prevented all of them from entering the house and secured some of them who were most suspected under a guard provided for that purpose which act of his was supposed by some of the wisest men in england to dissolve and destroy the representatives of the commons of england and to leave those who remained and acted without any legal authority yet this remnant of the house of commons on the thirteenth of december revived the vote of nonaddresses and though they were but twentysix in number took upon them to issue a commission for trying the king passing a vote on new years day that it was treason in the king to levy war against the parliament on the ninth of january the trial of the king was proclaimed by sound of trumpet and beat of drum in westminster hall at the old exchange and in cheapside and all people were summoned who had any thing to say against the king to appear and be heard on the twentieth of january when the king was brought before the high court of justice colonel stubberd and colonel axtel had the command of the soldiers below stairs the king demanded of sergeant bradshaw who was the president by what authority they brought him there and the president appealing to the charge which was in the name of the commons and people of england lady fairfax the generals wife cried out it is a lie it is false not a half not a quarter of the people oliver cromwell is a rogue and a traitor which words were repeated by mrs nelson upon this colonel axtel cried out down with the whores shoot them which vehemence of his made him be taken notice of the people at the time of his majestys passing to his trial moved by the sadness of the sight cried out god save the king which obliged such as drove on his death to procure another cry to countenance their design and therefore colonel axtel beat the soldiers till they cried justice justice and on the last day of the trial when the common people cried god preserve your majesty the soldiers were again taught by the prevailing argument of the cane to cry out execution execution after the sentence was passed the king was carried through the middle of king street in a common sedan by two porters who out of reverence to his person went bareheaded till the soldiers under colonel axtels command beat them and forced them to put on their hats after the murder of the king when cromwell was sent into ireland the regiment in which colonel axtel served was drawn out by lot for that expedition which occasioned his going over into that kingdom where he made a considerable figure was much esteemed and trusted by cromwell and raised for his fidelity courage and conduct as general ludlow tells us to the command of a regiment and the government of kilkenny and the adjacent precinct which important trust ludlow farther tells us he discharged with diligence and success and in his station showed a more than ordinary zeal in punishing those irish who had been guilty of murdering the protestants other writers represent this in quite a different light and charge him with severities not at all inferior in cruelty to those committed by the irish rebels themselves after cromwell on the twentieth of april      had turned the long parliament out of the house things took another turn and he having assumed the supreme power to himself sent over his son henry to ireland where he commanded at first as major general and by his endeavors to establish the new government so disgusted all the godly but more particularly the anabaptists that on the twentyeighth of november      they sent major jones and one mr doyley to acquaint him that quartermastergeneral vernon adjutant allen colonel barrowe and colonel axtel desired to speak with him upon which he offered to confer with them immediately as soon as they came into his presence colonel barrowe premising his and their many personal obligations received from the major general told him that finding themselves of late not made use of they could not with satisfaction to their consciences receive pay from the public without doing service for it and therefore came to acquaint him that they had upon solemn seeking of god and serious deliberation with themselves represented to his highness and the lord deputy their resolutions to quit their commands and had sent their reasons for doing it signifying that they had reserved the delivering up of their commissions to the major general as a particular mark of their respect for him wherefore he did in his own and in the name of the rest of the officers declare that they were from thenceforward discharged from any public employment in the army and at the same time they all of them tendered their commissions which the major general however did not think fit to accept but they having publicly declared that they looked upon their offer as a sufficient discharge he thought fit to appoint them another meeting the next day in the afternoon he told them at this meeting that he was very sorry to find they were so resolute in what they proposed the day before as to giving up their commissions and that it was no pleasant thing to him to receive them from persons who had so long served the public as they had done if they quitted indeed upon a conscientious dissatisfaction he knew not well what to reply but that he hoped when he parted with them the day before that they would have given him time to have reasoned the matter with them and not have put him upon giving so sudden an answer but since considering how positive they had been and that they had contrary to his expectation and that not in so decent a manner as he could have wished made it the talk of the town he thought himself concerned forthwith to declare his acceptance of their proposal and that he should take care since they insisted so earnestly upon it without any provocation of his and contrary to his desires they should be fairly discharged the army and satisfied what was due to each of them and that since they were resolved to retire he should wish them well in their private capacities and show them all respect befitting the place he stood in there and hoped that they would mind the promise they made the day before of serving god and being always ready to serve the public in order thereto upon this they seemed to express great thankfulness and very high satisfaction in the choice they had made only colonel axtel having first premised that he thought himself now on a level with the major general complained in very rough and bitter language of the ill usage he had met with and the slights that had been put upon him since the great revolution in england and the power of the parliament had been devolved upon a single person which mr cromwell bore as patiently as he could but it appears clearly enough from the letters he wrote to secretary thurloe that he was extremely sensible of the usage he had met with and looked upon these people as absolutely disaffected both to the government in general and to his family in particular the condition of colonel axtel from this time was very unpleasant he lived in a private condition upon the estate he had acquired in the service but instead of that power and authority which he had exercised for six years together over the town and district of kilkenny he was now in the state of a disaffected man and not only without trust and without authority but also so much suspected by his superiors that he could not take the slightest journey about his private affairs without having spies set over him and being frequently called to account all this was occasioned by the wild principles and restless spirits of the anabaptists which as they had brought about the subversion first of one government and then of another were now grown as turbulent under a third yet henry cromwell when vested with the character of lord lieutenant of ireland was contented to watch over them without persecuting them and except the great jealousy that he expressed of their motions he kept his word with them very exactly and treated them as well as they could expect after the death of the protector oliver which happened on the third of september      things took a new turn and his son richard who had assumed the title of protector immediately after his fathers death saw himself in the beginning of the next year reduced to the fatal necessity of dissolving what he called a parliament with which ended his authority and on the seventh of may      the remnant of the long parliament resumed the power of which they had been deprived by cromwell and his son henry who commanded as lord lieutenant in ireland having submitted as well as his brother richard lieutenant general edmund ludlow was sent over to take the supreme authority there and one of the first things he did being to newmodel the army colonel axtel came again into play had a regiment given him and was one of the few persons in whom ludlow chiefly confided it may not be amiss to remark that though this gentleman changed his opinion with respect to church matters and of a presbyterian became an anabaptist yet as to his notions of civil government he remained somewhat more steady and was always looked upon as a zealous friend to a commonwealth it was this disposition of his and his clear reputation for courage and conduct as an officer that induced general ludlow to make choice of him to command one division of the irish brigade that was sent over to maintain the parliament in possession of their authority and to keep out the king which however they were so far from doing that they contributed very much to his return the rising of sir george booth which happened in august the same year was the occasion of their being transported to england but they had no share in reducing him which was performed before their arrival by major general lambert their coming however was esteemed of great service to the parliament though it proved otherwise for colonel zanchy who commanded them concurred with the army in putting a new force upon that assembly which lasted till christmas and then the rum as it was called was again restored by the terror of monks army which was marching out of scotland as he at the beginning declared positively for the parliament colonel axtel and the rest of the officers of the irish brigade kept that body of troops which were esteemed the best in the kingdom from acting against him which if they had done in conjunction with lambert his design in all probability had miscarried but as monk very well knew that those forces would never concur in restoring the king while under the officers who then commanded them he resolved to try whether it might not be possible to engage them first to change their officers and then to fall into his measures which was the most critical point he had to manage they were at that time quartered in yorkshire and thither he sent colonel redman who commanded part of those troops in ireland under henry cromwell and who was turned out by ludlow he carried with him some of his friends who had served under him and on his first appearance the best part of the irish brigade very fairly told colonel zanchy and colonel axtel that they might take what measures they thought fit but for themselves they were determined to serve under colonel redman and their old officers this revolt gave the deaths wound to the republic for colonel redman pursuant to the orders he had received from general monk immediately marched that body of old troops into cheshire which so weakened lamberts army that was before superior to monks that it left him in no condition to oppose the march of that general to london which colonel axtel perceiving resolved to shift for himself and being thenceforward deprived of all command endeavored to settle his private affairs and secure himself the best way he could but when a fresh opportunity offered of asserting the good old cause colonel axtel showed his affection to it by venturing his life in a very desperate undertaking and that too as a private man the occasion was this the council of state had committed general lambert to the tower in the beginning of the month of march but on the ninth of april    0 he made his escape from thence and got down as far as daventry in northamptonshire where having assembled a considerable body of horse he was joined by colonel okey colonel axtel colonel cobbet lieutenant colonel young major creed captain timothy clare captain gregory captain spinach besides diverse soldiers that were anabaptists colonel richard ingoldsby and colonel streater who were sent to reduce lambert followed him with such diligence that on easter day which was on that year on the twentysecond of april they came up with him in a plain near daventry having only a brook between them when the two bodies came near just as colonel ingoldsby was going to charge streater commanded six files of musketeers to advance one file gave fire and hurt one or two of lamberts horse his drums beat and in good order he advanced having given strict command that his musketeers should not fire till they came as near as push of pike but lamberts men held the noses of their pistols toward the ground and nelthorps troop came off to ingoldsby hasleriggs troop having deserted him before for colonel ingoldsby sending captain elsemore before him with a party as he marched to find lambert met captain haslerigg and took him prisoner but released him upon his parole to send his whole troop over to join ingoldsby which he faithfully performed sending it to them by his quartermaster but he retired himself colonel ingoldsby told lambert he was his prisoner whereupon creed and the rest earnestly entreated him to do what he pleased with them but to let lambert escape acquainting him that his life could be of no advantage to him which ingoldsby absolutely refused telling them that he would not be treacherous to those that had commanded him by such an ungenerous act lambert then turned about his horse and attempted to make his escape but ingoldsby pursued him so close that he came quickly up to him and vowed to pistol him if he did not immediately yield lambert in great depression of spirits twice prayed him to let him escape but when he saw he could not prevail submitted as well as the rest did except okey axtel and clare who escaped this was the last struggle that was made in favor of the commonwealth and axtel used his utmost industry afterward to conceal himself as foreseeing that it would not be long before he might be called to an account for the large share he had taken in the trial of the king but his care in this respect was to very little purpose for before the close of the month he was discovered and committed to prison we are told by one of his friends that he was betrayed by a royalist who having engaged him to a meeting on pretense of treating with him for the purchase of some lands gave notice of the time and place by which he was apprehended and committed to the tower after the kings restoration the bill of indemnity being then depending in the house of commons they on the fourteenth of june    0 resolved that daniel axtel should be one of the twenty excepted out of that bill on the twelfth of july following a warrant was sent for his detention in the tower for high treason on the twentyninth of august the king passed the so long expected act of free and general pardon out of which only two and fifty persons were excepted of which colonel daniel axtel was the fiftieth as also the two persons disguised in frocks and vizors who appeared upon the scaffold at the murder of king charles i which persons were left to be proceeded against as traitors according to the laws of england on the tenth of october following the grand jury for the county of middlesex having found bills against twentyeight persons for their concern in the kings murder of which mr axtel was the last they were brought to the sessions house in the old bailey where colonel axtel was the same day arraigned upon an indictment for compassing and imagining the death of the late king when for some time he refused to plead alleging that what he had done was in pursuance of an act of parliament and therefore he conceived no inferior court ought to judge of it to which point he desired he might have counsel assigned but the court having reasoned with him and told him that in case of treason it was the same thing to stand mute as to confess the indictment he was prevailed upon to plead not guilty when he was asked how he would be tried and told that the proper answer was by god and his country he said that was not lawful god not being locally present however he soon after made the usual answer and put himself upon his trial this did not come on till the   th of october    0 when after challenging ten of the jury the indictment was opened in which the counsel for the crown observed that the high court erected for the trial of the late king had all the formalities of a court such as their president their council their chaplain and guards and as some of their judges one of their counsel and their chaplain had been already tried they had now brought this gentleman to the bar as the commander of the guard and then proceeded to call their evidence mr holland simpson proved that colonel axtel had the command of the soldiers below stairs and threatened to shoot lady fairfax for disturbing the court colonel hercules huncks deposed that on the day the king died himself colonel phayre colonel hacker and cromwell being in a room together cromwell desired him to sign a warrant for the kings execution which he having refused to do and cromwell having given him some harsh language on that account mr axtel said colonel huncks i am ashamed of you the ship is now coming into the harbor and will you strike sail before we come to an anchor mr axtel positively denied this and told colonel huncks that himself was named in the warrant for execution and that he wished he did not make others a peace offering to save himself sir purbeck temple swore that mr axtel beat the soldiers to make them cry justice and execution that he laughed and scoffed with them during the trial and that he suffered and as the witness believed procured the soldiers to fire powder in the palms of their hands which threw such clouds of smoke into the kings face that he was obliged to rise out of his chair and beat it off with his hand mr john jeonar who was one of the kings domestic servants and attended him at the trial gave positive evidence that when the court broke up the first day colonel axtel ordered the guards to cry justice justice and the last day execution execution and he farther deposed that being very near the colonel he heard him lead that cry by making use of the same words himself one samuel burden who had been a soldier in the kings army but at the time of the trial in colonel axtels regiment swore that himself and others were commanded by the colonel to give evidence against the king and for that purpose were sent to mr cook who managed the charge against the king to have their examinations taken which was accordingly done this man likewise swore that the colonel sent one elisha axtel with a file of soldiers to take boat and go down to the common hangman who lived beyond the tower in order to fetch him to execute the king lieutenant colonel nelson deposed that in private conversation at dublin colonel axtel acknowledged to him that he was concerned in the secret of managing the kings execution and being desired by the witness to tell him who the persons were that appeared upon the scaffold in vizors he told him they were two sergeants well known both to him and to the witness and that their names were hewlet and walker such was the evidence given to support the charge in the indictment for compassing and imagining the death of the king in his defense colonel axtel alleged that he was a commissioned officer under the lord fairfax as he had been before under the earl of essex and by his commission was to obey his superior officer who commanded him that day to westminster hall according to the customs of war so that if he had disobeyed his superior officer then he had died and now must die for obeying him but the court told him he might have refused without any danger as well as colonel huncks and that passive as well as active obedience was required from every man and that neither his nor his superiors commission bid him kill his father much less the father of his country as for the muskets mounted toward the lady he said that if a lady grew uncivil to disturb the court he could do no less than check her that his striking the soldiers for not crying justice was a mistake for he said he struck them because they did it saying i will give you justice that his inciting them at the sentence to cry execution was the execution of justice and that could do no hurt the court took a good deal of pains to show him the insufficiency of these pretenses and how incompatible they were with the constitution of this kingdom and the laws of the land upon which subject we met with a very curious and instructive passage in the reports of a very learned judge the trial lasted on account of the prisoners long and large defense for upwards of three hours but the jury without going from the bar found him guilty on the sixteenth of october he was brought up again to the sessions house in order to receive sentence at which time mr axtel insisted that there was no overt act proved against him sufficient to support the indictment and suggested that he died only for want of words upon which the lord chief baron observed that it was otherwise that he was present in the court beating the soldiers and sending for an executioner which were all of them facts and not words upon this colonel axtel appealed to god that he did not find himself guilty of consulting contriving or having any hand in the death of the king and concluded that he was innocent and prayed god that his blood might not cry against them  then silence being commanded the lord chief baron made a long speech in which he told colonel francis hacker and mr axtel that they had no cause to hope for mercy nor was there any room for mercy and then pronounced that sentence which is usually given in cases of high treason after he was carried back to newgate he showed himself very full of spirit and courage spoke to every body that was about him with great vehemence and zeal for the cause in which he died as appears very fully from the account of his behavior printed after his death by the care of those of his party in this disposition he continued without the least alteration or sinking of his spirits which must be attributed to his notions of religion that had made such an impression upon his mind as entirely prevented his feeling any thing of that weakness and terror which is incident to human nature at the near approach of death and of a violent and shameful death especially but the account beforementioned shows us that he remained firm to the last and spoke with the same freedom that day he died as on any other in his whole life on friday the nineteenth of october about nine in the morning colonel francis hacker and colonel daniel axtel were drawn on one hurdle from newgate to tyburn where they behaved with great boldness and resolution more especially the latter who was the better speaker of the two and who did not fail to justify his conduct to the people with the same sort of arguments he had used before his judges after the execution was performed the head of colonel axtel was set up at the further end of westminster hall and his quarters were in like manner disposed of so as to become spectacles in other public places but the body of mr hacker was by his majestys great favor given entire to his friends and by their care was decently interred at the time of his death the colonel left behind him a widow and seven children for whose subsistence he had made a competent provision in the time of his prosperity  ayscue ayscough or askew sir george an eminent english admiral in the last century he was descended from a very good family in lincolnshire and entered early into the sea service where he obtained the character of an able and experienced officer and the honor of knighthood from king charles i this however did not prevent him from adhering to the parliament when by a very singular intrigue they got possession of the fleet and so zealous he was in the service of his masters that when in      the greatest part of the navy went over to the prince of wales he who then commanded the lion secured that ship for the parliamient which was by them esteemed both an acceptable service and an action of great importance as this was a sufficient proof of his fidelity he had the command given him in a squadron that was employed to watch the motions of the prince of wales and accordingly sailed therewith to the coast of ireland where by his vigilance he prevented his highness from doing what he would otherwise have done and by his great interest with the seamen he drew many of them back to that service from which they had deserted this recommended him strongly to the parliament who the next year sent him with a considerable number of ships and the honorable title of admiral in those seas to the coast of ireland which commission he discharged with equal vigor and vigilance supplying dublin with provisions attending the army upon all emergencies and contributing in every respect so effectually to the reduction of ireland that the parliament not only thought fit to continue him in his command for another year but likewise ordered an immediate provision to be made for the payment of his arrears and presented him with one hundred pounds as a special mark of their favor and the just reward of his services after the war was finished in ireland and the parliament had thereby time and opportunity to think of the proper means of subduing the rest of the dominions of the crown of england to their obedience sir george ayscue had orders to sail with a small squadron to reduce the island of barbados but before he was in any readiness to sail his orders were countermanded the reason of this was that the parliament had received information that the dutch were treating with sir john grenville in order to have the isles of scilly put into their hands and therefore it was thought necessary to reduce these islands first  blake and ayscue were employed in this expedition in the spring of the year      and performed it with honor and success they had but a small body of troops on board and sir john grenville had a considerable force in the island of st mary commanded by some of the best officers in the late kings army so that if those disputes had been decided by the sword the engagement must have been both bloody and doubtful sir john easily perceived that this must end fatally in respect to him and the kings forces under his command and therefore entered into a treaty with general blake and admiral ayscue who used him very honorably and gave him fair conditions after which blake returned to england and ayscue proceeded on his voyage to barbados the parliament when they heard of the reduction of scilly were extremely well pleased as indeed they had reason since privateers from thence did so much mischief that scarcely any trade could be carried on with tolerable security but when the conditions were known some great men changed their opinions and gave blake to understand that he and his colleague had been too forward so that it was doubted whether parliament would ratify this agreement blake said that if they had given sir john grenville good conditions they had done it with good reason that in the first place it saved the effusion of english blood and next that there was a strong squadron of dutch ships at no great distance the commander of which had offered sir john no less than  00000 pounds to put these islands into his hands that if the parliament did not approve of his conduct he should be sorry for it and should take care to prevent a mistake of that sort in future by laying down his commission as he was confident sir george ayscue would likewise do upon this there was no more said of the articles which were honorably complied with and sir george received orders to sail immediately to the west indies which he obeyed never expecting to hear any more of these articles which as they were made with good reason so he thought they would have met with a good reception but he had afterward cause given him to apprehend that whatever benefit the parliament might receive from the service itself they were far enough from being satisfied with the manner in which it was done  sir george continued his voyage without meeting with any cross accident till his arrival at barbados which was on the   th of october      he then found his enterprise would be attended with great difficulties and such as had not been foreseen at home the lord willoughby of parham commanded there for the king and had assembled a body of five thousand men for the defense of the island he was a nobleman of great parts and great probity one who had been extremely reverenced by the parliament before he quitted their party and whose worth had so strongly recommended him both to the esteem and affection of the inhabitants that he had as absolute a disposal of their persons and properties as it was necessary for a governor to have who was in such a situation and the use he made of his power and influence was as perfectly right in itself as the critical circumstances of those times required sir george though he fully apprehended how many and how great obstacles lay in his way yet showed no signs of concern but boldly forced his passage into the harbor and made himself matter of twelve sail of dutch merchantmen that lay there hoping that this might raise an insurrection in the island in which however he was mistaken the next morning he sent a summons to the lord willoughby requiring him to submit to the authority of the parliament of england to which his lordship answered that he knew no such authority that he had a commission from king charles ii to be governor of that island and that he would keep it for his majestys service at the hazard of his life that he might be able to make good his word he put the island and its inhabitants into the best posture of defense possible and being much superior in strength sir george thought it not prudent to land the few troops he had and thereby discover his weakness to so cautious an enemy in the mean time he received a letter by an adviceboat from england with the news of the kings being defeated at worcester with one intercepted from lady willoughby containing a very particular account of that unhappy affair upon this he summoned lord willoughby a second time and accompanied his summons with lady willoughbys letter which however made no impression upon his lordship who continued firm in his resolution of holding out the island as long as he could all this time sir george anchored in speights bay and stayed there till december when the virginia merchant fleet arriving he resolved to take that opportunity to land with the greater advantage for he made as if they were a reinforcement that had been sent him and he had only waited for them till then whereas the truth was he had not above two thousand men and the sight of the little army on shore made him cautious of venturing his men till he thought the inhabitants had conceived a greater idea of his strength than they had done before the virginia ships were welcomed at their coming in as a supply of men of war and he presently ordered his men on shore   0 scotch servants aboard that fleet were added to a regiment of  00 men and some seamen to make their number look more formidable sir george had on board his fleet one colonel allen a gentleman of barbados who came from thence into england to solicit from the parliament a force sufficient for the reduction of the island and therefore he was thought the properest man to command the forces on shore he accordingly landed with them on seventeenth of december and found lord willoughbys torches well entrenched near a fort which they had on the seacoast they attacked him however and in a sharp dispute wherein about sixty men were killed on both sides had so much the advantage that they drove them to the fort notwithstanding that colonel allen their commander was killed by a muket shot as he attempted to land the soldiers and seamen however pushed on and made themselves masters of the fort and four pieces of cannon that were in it after this the sailors returned to their ships which cruized up and down to prevent any succors coming to the islanders or any merchants trading with them the soldiers posted themselves in the fort and from thence made incursions into the country upon which the chief of the inhabitants grew weary of the war which sir george understanding by the correspondence he had in the island he by the same means procured colonel moddiford who was one of the most leading men in the place to enter into a treaty with him and this negotiation succeeded so well that moddiford declared publicly for a peace and joined with sir george to bring lord willoughby the governor to reason as they phrased it  sir georges men were now all on shore and made up a body of two thousand foot and an hundred horse for many deserters had come over to him if colonel moddiford had joined him with his party in attacking them there was no hope of the governors escaping who having before deserted the parliament could expect no mercy from them if he was taken without a treaty but perhaps all these considerations would scarcely have prevailed with that generous nobleman to have given up the island if an accident had not happened which put most of the gentlemen about him into such confusion that he could no longer depend upon their advice or assistance the thing happened thus his lordship perceiving his superiority lay chiefly in his horse resolved to make a brisk push with the body under his immediate command and having previous to the execution of his design called together his officers while they were sitting in council a cannonball beat open the door of the room and took off the head of the sentinel posted before it which so frightened all the gentlemen of the island that they not only compelled the governor to lay aside his former design but to retire to a place two miles farther from the harbor sir george ayscue taking advantage of this unexpected good fortune immediately ordered all his forces on shore which consisted as was said of two thousand foot and one hundred horse to advance under the command of captain morris as if he intended to have attacked them in their entrenchments which struck such a terror into some of the principal persons about the governor that after mature deliberation on his own circumstances and their disposition he began to alter his mind and thereupon to avoid the effusion of christian and english blood both parties appointed commissaries to treat sir george named captain peck mr searl colonel thomas moddiford and james colliton esquire the lord willoughby sir richard peers charles pim esquire colonel ellice and major byham who on the seventeenth of january agreed on articles of rendition which were alike comprehensive and honorable the lord willoughby had what he most desired indemnity and freedom of estate and person upon which soon after he returned to england the islands of nvis antiga and st christopher were by the same capitulation surrendered to the parliament with a proviso that lord willoughby colonel walrond and some other persons mentioned in that treaty were restored to their estates and the inhabitants were promised not only indemnity but protection in the quiet enjoyment of their plantations upon condition that they did nothing to the prejudice of the commonwealth  this treaty being signed mr searl was appointed governor of barbados and mr rynell of antigua and the leeward islands in virtue of a commission granted to sir george ayscue for this purpose the news of the reduction of these islands made such a noise in that part of the world that captain dennis who was detached with a few ships to virginia reduced it without much trouble after which sir george considering that he had fully executed his commission and that his presence was no farther necessary in america resolved to return with the squadron under his command to england which he accordingly did and arriving at plymouth on the twentyfifth of may      was received with all imaginable testimonies of joy and satisfaction by the people there to whom he was well known before as his late success also served not a little to raise and heighten his reputation it was not long after his arrival before he found himself again obliged to enter upon action for the dutch war which broke out in his absence was then become extremely warm and he was forced to take a share in it though his ships were so extremely foul that they were much fitter to be laid up than to be employed in any farther service on the twentyfirst of june      sir george ayscue in obedience to the orders he had received from london came to dover with his eleven sail and there joined his old friend admiral blake on board whose ship he dined and was received with all imaginable marks of respect and kindness by that famous commander in the beginning of the next month blake having received orders to sail northward and destroy the dutch herring fishery sir george ayscue was left to command the fleet in the downs within a few days after blakes departure he took five sail of dutch merchantmen and had scarcely brought them in before he received advice that a fleet of forty sail had been seen not far from the coast upon which he gave chase fell in amongst them took seven sunk four and ran twentyfour upon the french shose all the rest being separated from their convoy which considering that sir george had with him only the squadron he brought from barbados was very gallantly performed as whitelock judiciously informs us in the account that sir george gave of this action to the parliament he observed that running dutch ships upon the french shore was the same thing as sinking or burning them for though the french defended them vigorously from the english ships that pursued them yet they afterward went aboard the dutch and plundered them without mercy the dutch admiral van tromp who was at sea with a great fleet having information of the situation that sir george ayscue was in resolved to take advantage of him and with no less than one hundred sail clapped in between him and the river and resolved to surprise such ships as should attempt to go out or if that design failed to go in and sink sir george and his squadron the english admiral soon discovered their intention and causing a signal to be made from dover castle for all ships to keep to sea he thereby defeated the first part of their project however van tromp attempted the second part of his scheme in hopes of better success and on the eighth of july when it was ebb he began to sail toward the english fleet but the wind dying away he was obliged to come to an anchor about a league off in order to expect the next ebb sir george in the mean time caused a strong platform to be raised between deal and sandown castles well furnished with artillery so pointed as to bear directly upon the dutch as they came in the militia of the county of kent were also ordered down to the seashore to entertain the enemy with their small shot notwithstanding which preparation the dutch admiral did not recede from his point but at the next ebb weighed anchor and would have stood into the port but the wind coming about southwest and blowing directly in his teeth constrained him to keep out and being streightened for time he was obliged to sail away and leave sir george safe in the harbor with the small squadron he commanded he was soon after ordered to plymouth to bring in under his convoy five east india ships which he did in the latter end of july and in the first week of august brought in four french and dutch prizes for which activity and vigilance in his command he was universally commended in a few days after this intelligence was received that van tromps fleet was seen off the back of the isle of wight and it was thereupon resolved that sir george with his fleet of forty men of war most of them hired merchantmen except flagships should stretch over to the coast of france to meet them accordingly on the sixteenth of august between one and two of the clock at noon they got sight of the enemy who quitted their merchantmen being fifty in number about four the fight began the english admiral with nine others charging through their fleet his ships received most damage in the shrouds masts sails and rigging which was repaid the dutch in their hulls sir george having thus passed through them got the weathergage and charged them again but all his fleet not coming up and the night already entered they parted with a drawn battle captain peck the rearadmiral lost his leg of which soon after he died several captains were wounded but no ship lost only some shattered and torn of the dutch not one was said to be lost though many were shot through and through but so that they were able to proceed on their voyage and anchored the next day after being followed by the english to the isle of bassa but no farther attempt was made by our fleet by reason as it was pretended of the danger of the french coasts from whence they returned to plymouthsound to mend and repair their rigging the truth of the matter was some of sir georges captains were a little bashful in this affair and the fleet was in so indifferent a condition that it was absolutely necessary to refit before they proceeded again to action he proceeded next to join blake in the northern seas where he continued during the best part of the month of september and took several prizes and toward the latter end of that month sir george returned with general blake into the downs with one hundred and twenty sail of men of war on the twentyseventh of that month a great dutch fleet appeared after which blake with his fleet sailed and sir george ayscue pursuant to the orders he had received returned to chatham with his own ship and sent the rest of his squadron into several ports to be careened it does not appear that parliament openly expressed any dislike or distaste at sir georges behavior upon his coming home but on the contrary showed him all the regard and respect imaginable though he had some friends who informed him that this was in appearance only since they could not help expressing a dislike to the terms he had granted to lord willoughby at barbados which they considered as the second part of sir john grenvilles busness for which they had been so angry both with him and blake all this however sir george bore without any visible signs of discontent professing that he had done what he took to be his duty and would continue to do so as long as he commanded in the english fleet without troubling himself about the humors of particular men whom after all his endeavors he might find it impossible to please but while these jealousies and heartburnings subsisted on both sides an occasion offered which enabled all parties to satisfy themselves it so fell out that toward the end of november      the famous general blake lying at the mouth of our river began to think that the season of the year left no room to expect farther action for which reason he detached twenty of his ships to bring up a fleet of colliers from newcastle twelve more he had sent to plymouth and our admiral as is before observed with fifteen sail had proceeded up the river in order to their being careened such was the situation of things when van tromp appeared with a fleet of eightyfive sail upon this blake sent for the most experienced officers on board his own ship where after a long consultation it was agreed that he should wait for and fight the enemy though he had but thirtyseven sail of men of war and a few small ships accordingly on the twentyninth of november a general engagement ensued which lasted with great fury from one in the afternoon till it was dark blake in the triumph with his seconds the victory and the vanguard engaged for a considerable time near twenty sail of dutch men of war and they were in the utmost danger of being oppressed and destroyed by so unequal a force this however did not hinder blake forcing his way into a throng of enemies to relieve the garland and bonadventure in doing which he was attacked by many of their stoutest ships which likewise boarded him but after several times beating them off he at last found an opportunity to rejoin his fleet the loss sustained by the english consisted in five ships either taken or sunk and several others disabled the dutch confess that one of their men of war was burnt toward the latter end of the fight and the captain and most of his men drowned and also that the ships of tromp and evertson were much disabled at last night having parted the two fleets blake supposing he had sufficiently secured the nations honor and his own by waiting the attack of an enemy so much superior and seeing no prospect of advantage by renewing the fight retired up the river but sir george ayscue who inclined to the bolder but less prudent counsel was so disgusted at this retreat that he laid down his commission the services this great man had rendered to his country were none of them more acceptable to the parliament than this act of laying down his command they had long wished and waited for an opportunity of dismissing him from their service and were therefore extremely pleased that he had saved them this trouble however to show their gratitude for past services and to prevent his falling into absolute discontent they voted him a present of three hundred pounds in money and likewise bestowed upon him three hundred pounds per annum in ireland there is good reason to believe that cromwell and his faction were a well pleased with this gentlemans quitting the seaservice for as they were then meditating what they soon afterward put in execution the turning the parliament out of doors it could not but be agreeable to them to see an officer who had so great credit in the navy and who was so generally esteemed by the nation laid aside in such a manner both as it gave them an opportunity of insinuating the ingratitude of that assembly to so worthy a person and as it freed them from the apprehension of his disturbing their measures in case he had continued in the fleet which is highly probable might have come to pass considering that blake was far enough from being of their party and only submitted to serve the protector because he saw no other way left to serve his country and did not think he had interest sufficient to preserve the fleet after the defection of the army which perhaps might have been the case if sir george ayscue had continued in his command this is so much the more probable as it is very certain he never entered into the protectors service or showed himself at all willing to concur in his measures though there is no doubt that cromwell would have been extremely glad of so experienced an officer in his spanish war he retired after this to his country seat in the county of surrey and lived there in great honor and splendor visiting and being visited by persons of the greatest distinction both natives and foreigners and passing in the general opinion of both for one of the ablest seacaptains of that age yet there is some reason to believe that he had a particular correspondence with the protectors second son henry since there is still a letter in being from him to secretary thurloe which shows that he had very just notions of the worth of this gentleman and of the expediency of consulting him in all such matters as had a relation to maritime power the protector toward the latter end of his life began to grow dissatisfied with the dutch the rather because of the share they had taken in the affairs of the north where they had espoused the cause of the king of denmark to a degree of partiality and were projecting the total suppression of the swedish power this did not by any means agree with the protectors plan in regard to foreign affairs and as it was not in his nature to bear with any disappointment in his views so he resolved to destroy this system of the dutch and yet without entering immediately into a war with them it was with this view that he encouraged the swedes to cultivate with the utmost diligence a maritime force promising in due time to assist them with a sufficient number of able and experienced officers and with an admiral to command them who in point of reputation was not inferior to any then living it was upon this occasion and for this service that he cast his eyes upon sir george ayscue but not caring to deal directly with a man who had declined acting under his government and had never frequented his court he resolved that the proposition should be made him by the swedish ambassador and sent the lord keeper whitelock to introduce him to the admiral at his countryseat this interview had its effect sir george ayscue from that time began to entertain favorable thoughts of the design and brought himself by degrees to approve of the proposition that was made to him so far as to think at least not only of quitting the retreat he had chosen but even of accepting the offer made him and of going over for that purpose to sweden but as great undertakings move slowly and there is much time necessary for ripening such vast projects into execution so we find that sir george ayscue had not brought himself to an absolute compliance in reference to this design before the death of the protector yet that did not hinder his closing at last with the proposals made him from sweden and putting every thing in order for his journey toward the latter end of the year      but as such a design as this was could not be put in execution without making some stir and thereby raising public discourse about it so this had such an effect upon the danish minister then residing here that he could not forbear writing to mr secretary thurloe in pretty strong terms upon the occasion insinuating at the same time some general reflections on the character of sr george ayscue this however had no effect either in procuring an interposition from the state to prevent sir george from prosecuting his design or in obliging him to alter his resolution on the contrary as soon as he had seen the officers embarked and had dispatched some private business of his own he prosecuted his voyage though in the very depth of winter this exposed him to great hardships which however he endured with much constancy and on his arrival in sweden he was received with all imaginable demonstrations of civility and respect by the king who was extremely well pleased with his coming and might very probably have made good his promise of promoting him to the rank of highadmiral of sweden if he had not been taken off by an unexpected death this put an end to his hopes in that country and disposed sir george ayscue to return home where a great change had been working in his absence which was that of restoring king charles ii it does not at all appear that sir george had any concern in this great affair but the contrary may be rather presumed from his former attachment to parliament and his making it his choice to have remained in sweden if the death of the monarch who invited him thither had not prevented him on his return however he not only submitted to the government then established but gave the strongest assurances to the administration that he should be at all times ready to serve the public if ever there should be occasion which was very kindly taken and sir george ayscue had the honor to be introduced to his majesty and to kiss his hand it was not long before he was called to the performance of his promise for the dutch war breaking out in      he was immediately put into commission by the direction of the duke of york who then commanded the english fleet in the spring of the year      sir george ayscue hoisted his flag as rearadmiral of the blue under the right honorable the earl of sandwich and in the great battle that was fought the third of june in the same year that squadron had the honor to break through the dutch fleet and thereby made way for one of the most glorious victories ever obtained by this nation at sea for in this battle the dutch had ten of their largest ships sunk or burned besides their admiral opdams which blew up in the midst of the engagement by which the admiral himself and upwards of five hundred men perished eighteen men of war were taken four fireships destroyed thirteen captains and two thousand and fifty private men made prisoners and this with so inconsiderable a loss as that of one ship only and three hundred private men as there was some time requisite for refitting and repairing the english navy after so warm an action the duke of york who commanded the fleet in that engagement returned to london but not till the king had visited the navy where going on board the royal charles at the buoy of the nore he knighted several of the officers who had distinguished themselves in the late battle and made a grand naval promotion the fleet being again in a condition to put to sea was ordered to rendezvous at southwoldbay from whence to the number of sixty sail they weighed on the fifth of july and flood over to the coast of holland the standard was borne by the gallant earl of sandwich to whom was vice admiral sir george ayscue and sir thomas tyddiman rearadmiral sir william penn was admiral of the white sir william berkley vice admiral and sir joseph jordan rearadmiral the blue flag was carried by sir thomas allen whose vice and rear were sir christopher mimms and sir john harman the design they went on was to intercept de ruyter in his return or at least to take and burn the turkey and east india fleets of which they had certain intelligence they succeeded in neither of these schemes de ruyter returned unexpectedly by the north of scotland and arrived safely in holland where he was immediatey promoted to the chief command of the fleet the turkey and india fleets consisting of twenty sail under the command of commodore bitter chose to take the same northern route in hopes of avoiding the english navy but having intelligence at sea that this would prove very difficult if not impossible they took shelter in the port of bergen in norway the earl of sandwich having detached sir thomas tyddiman to attack them there returned home and had the good luck to take eight dutch men of war which served as convoys to their east and west india fleets and several merchantmen richly laden which finished the triumph of that year the plain superiority of the english over the dutch at sea engaged the french in order to keep up the war between the maritime powers and make them do their business by destroying each other to declare on the side of the weakest as did the king of denmark also which nevertheless had no effect upon the english who determined to carry on the war against the allies with the same spirit they had done against the dutch alone in the spring therefore of the year      the fleet was very early at sea under the command of the joint admirals for a resolution having been taken at court not to expose the person of the duke of york any more and the earl of sandwich being then in spain in the character of ambassadorextraordinary prince rupert and old general monk now duke of albermarle were appointed to command the fleet having under them as gallant and prudent officers as ever distinguished themselves in the english navy and amongst these sir william berkley commanded the blue and sir george ayscue the white squadron prince rupert and the duke of albemarle went on board the fleet the twentythird of april      and sailed in the beginning of may toward the latter end of that month the court was informed that the french fleet under the command of the duke of beaufort were coming out to the assistance of the dutch this rumor of their joining the dutch was spread by france in order to deceive us and distress the dutch themselves in reality having no such intention upon the receiving this news the court sent orders to prince rupert to sail with the white squadron the admirals excepted to look out and fight the french which command that brave prince obeyed but found it what many wise people thought a mere groundless bravado intended to raise the courage of their new allies and thereby bring them into the greater danger at the same time prince rupert sailed from the downs the dutch put out to sea the wind at northeast and a fresh gale this brought the dutch fleet on the coast of dunkirk and carried his highness toward the isle of wight but the wind suddenly shifting to the southwest and blowing hard brought the dutch and the duke to an anchor captain bacon in the bristol first discovered the enemy and by firing his guns gave notice of it to the english fleet upon this a council of war was called wherein it was resolved to fight the enemy notwithstanding their great superiority after the departure of prince rupert the duke had with him only the red and blue squadrons making about sixty sail whereas the dutch fleet consisted of ninetyone men of war carrying      guns and     0 men it was the first of june when they were discerned and the duke was so warm for engaging that he attacked the enemy before they had time to weigh anchor and as de ruyter himself says in his letter they were obliged to cut their cables and in the same letter he owns that to the last the english were the aggressors notwithstanding their inferiority and other disadvantages this days fight was very fierce and bloody for the dutch confiding in their numbers pressed furiously upon the english fleet while the english officers being men of determined resolution fought with such courage and constancy that they not only repulsed the dutch but renewed the attack and forced the enemy to maintain the fight longer than they were inclined to do so that it was ten in the evening before their cannon were silent the following night was spent in repairing the damages suffered on both sides and next morning the fight was renewed by the english with fresh vigor admiral van tromp with vice admiral vander hulst being on board one ship rashly engaged among the english and were in the utmost danger either of being taken or burnt the dutch affairs according to their own account were now in a desperate condition but admiral de ruyter at last disengaged them though not till his ship was disabled and vice admiral vander hulst killed this only changed the scene for de ruyter was now as hard pushed as van tromp had been before however a reinforcement arriving preserved him also and so the second days fight ended earlier than the first the duke finding that the dutch had received a reinforcement and that his small fleet on the contrary was much weakened through the damages sustained by some and the loss and absence of others of his ships took toward the evening the resolution to retire and endeavor to join prince rupert who was coming to his assistance the retreat was performed in good order twentysix or twentyeight men of war who had suffered least brought up the rear interposing between the enemy and the disabled ships three of which being very much shattered were burnt by the english themselves and the men taken on board the other ships the dutch fleet followed but at a distance as they thus sailed on it happened on the the third day that sir george ayscue admiral of the white who commanded the royal prince being the largest and heaviest ship of the whole fleet unfortunately struck upon the sand called the galloper where being threatened by the enemys fireships and hopeless of assistance from his friends whose timely return the near approach of the enemy and the tide had absolutely rendered impossible he was forced to surrender this was that famous engagement which did equal honor to both the maritime powers and in which both their officers and seamen are allowed to have performed as great things as were ever attempted on the watery element yet our historians have given very imperfect accounts of it even those who ought to have made it their business to be more particularly acquainted with this transaction so that if we would learn any particulars relating to it we must look for them in the works of strangers and even of enemies who in this respect have been both juster and kinder than the authors either of our general or naval histories the dutch admiral de ruyter in his letter to the states general says in few words that sir george ayscue admiral of the white having run upon a sand bank fell into their hands and that after taking out the commanders and men that were left they set the ship on fire but the large relation collected by order of the states out of all the letters written to them upon that occasion informs us that sir george ayscue in the royal prince ran upon the galloper an unhappy accident says that relation for an officer who had behaved very gallantly gallantly during the whole engagement and who only retired in obedience to the admirals orders the unfortunate admiral made signals for assistance but the english fleet continued their route so that he was left quite alone and without hope of succor in which situation he was attacked by two dutch fireships by which without doubt he had been burnt if lieutenantadmiral tromp who was on board the ship of rear admiral sweers had not made a signal to call off the fireships perceiving that his flag was already struck and a signal made for quarter upon which rearadmiral sweers by order of tromp went on board the english ship and brought off sir george ayscue his officers and some of his men on board his own vessel and the next morning sir george was sent to the dutch coast in order to go to the hague in a galliot by order of general de ruyter the english ship was afterward got off the sands notwithstanding which general de ruyter ordered the rest of the crew to be taken out and the vessel set on fire that his fleet might be the less embarrassed which was accordingly done but in tie french relation published by order of court we have another circumstance which the dutch have thought fit to omit and it is this that the crew gave up the ship against the admirals will who had given orders for setting her on fire there were some circumstances which made the loss of this ship in this manner very disagreeable to the english court and perhaps this may be the reason that so little is said of it in our own relations in all probability general de ruyter took this opportunity of sending sir george ayscue to the dutch coast the next morning from an apprehension that he might be retaken in the next days fight on his arrival at the hague he was very civilly treated but to raise the spirits of their people and to make the most of this dubious kind of victory the states ordered sir george to be carried as it were in triumph through the several towns of holland and then confined him in the castle of louvestein so famous in the dutch histories for having been the prison of some of their most eminent patriots and from whence the party that opposed the prince of orange were styled the louvestein faction as soon as sir george ayscue came to this castle he wrote a letter to king charles ii to acquaint him with the condition he was in how long he remained there or whether he continued a prisoner to the end of the war is what we cannot determine from any lights that we have been able to procure but it is said that he afterward returned to england and spent the remainder of his days in peace it is a thing greatly to be regretted that so little care has been taken to do justice to the memories of so many great men as have served this nation some at the expense of their lives and others of their liberties their virtues surely deserve a better reward and it is to be hoped that the pains we have taken in this collection will render the doing justice to such great and good men so visibly necessary that succeding generations will have no reason to make this complaint  it is with a view to this that even where we cannot render our memoirs of such illustrious persons so complete as we could wish we labor with the utmost diligence to make them as perfect as we can which observation will be sufficient to excuse us to our readers for concluding this article somewhat abruptly since it is done merely through want of materials and not of inclination  aysserius or asserius menevensis by some called asser by others asker a learned monk of st davids concerning whom though much has been said yet we find very little has been written with certainty rather as we apprehend for want of considering the matter thoroughly than from any want of materials or from any real obscurity in which his story is involved we shall therefore give as clear and distinct an account of him as may be and remove most of the difficulties which have been hitherto thought too obscure in his history he was of british extraction probably of that part of south wales called pembrokeshire and was bred up in the learning of those times in the monastery of st davids in latin menevia whence he derived hit surname of menevensis there he is said to have had for his tutor johannes patricius one of the most celebrated scholars of his age here he had also the countenance of nobis or novis archbishop of that see who was also his relation but it does not appear that he was either his secretary or his chancellor as some writers would have us believe from st davids he was invited to the court of aelfred the great merely from the reputation of his learning this seems to have been about the year   0 or somewhat earlier those who had the charge of bringing him to court conducted him from st davids to the town of dene dean in wiltshire where the king then was he received him with great civility and showed him in a little time the strongest marks of favor and affection insomuch that he condescended to persuade him not to think any more of returning to st davids but rather to continue with him as his domestic chaplain and assistant in his studies asserius however modestly declined this proposal alleging that it did not become him to desert that holy place where he had been educated and received the order of priesthood for the sake of any preferment he could meet with elsewhere king aelfred then desired that he would divide his time between the court and the monastery that is to say that he would spend six months at court and six at st davids asserius would not lightly comply even with this request but desired the kings leave to return to st davids to ask the advice of his brethren which he obtained but in his journey falling ill at winchester of a fever he lay there sick twelve months and a week till the king wondering at his long stay wrote him letters requiring his return to court but it seems he was too weak to ride of which when king aelfred was informed by his letter he desisted from his request as soon as he recovered asserius made a journey to st davids where consulting with his brethren on the kings proposal they unanimously agreed that he should accept it promising themselves great advantages from his favor with the king of which at that time it seems they had great need one hemeid a petty prince of south wales making them exceedingly uneasy and sometimes compelling their archbishop to quit the place of his residence but at the same time they requested of asserius that he would prevail on the king to allow him to reside quarterly at court and at st davids rather than that he should remain absent six months at a time when he came back he found the king at leoneforde who received him with great marks of distinction he remained with him then eight months at once reading and explaining to him whatever books were in his library whereby he grew into so great credit with that generous prince that on christmaseve following he gave him the monasteries of amgresbyri and banuwille that is ambrosbury in wiltshire and banwell in somersetshire with a silk pall of great value and as much incense as a man could carry sending together with them this compliment that these were but small things and by way of earnest of better that should follow them and indeed soon after asserius tells us he had exeter bestowed upon him and not long after that the bishopric of sherburn which however he seems to have quitted in     though he always retained the title as wilfred archbishop of york was constantly so styled though he accepted of another bishopric thenceforward he constantly attended the court in the manner before stipulated and is named as a person in whom he had a particular confidence by king aelfred in his testament which must have been written some time before the year     since mention is made therein of esna bishop of hereford who died that year he is also mentioned by the king in his prefatory epistle placed before his translation of gregorys pastoral addressed to wulffig bishop of london and therein the king does not call him bishop of sherburn but my bishop acknowledging the help received from him and others in that translation for as we learn both from the king and from asserius himself the method used by that prince in translating was this he had the sense of his author given him by one or other of the many learned men he had about him and then he digested it into an easy flowing style in which he had a peculiar excellency that men might thereby be invited to reading for aelfred did not translate as an author to get reputation but as a prince to promote the public good neither did he design that the books which he published should pass for exact translations but for good and useful treatises from which such as understood none but their mother tongue might reap profit and instruction it seems to have been the near resemblance which the genius of asserius bore to that of the king which gained him so great a share in his confidence and very probably it was on this account that asserius drew up those memoirs o the life of aelfred which we still have and which he dedicated and presented to the king in     in which work we have a very remarkable account of the manner wherein that prince and our autho spent their time together asserius tells us that having one day being the feast of st martin cited in conversation a passage of some famous author the king was mightily pleased therewith and would have him write it down in the margin of a book he carried in hi breast but asserius finding no room to write any such thing there and yet being desirous to gratify his master he asked king aelfred whether he should not provide a few leaves in which to set down such remarkable things as occurred either in reading or conversation the king was extremely pleased with this hint and directed asserius to put it immediately into execution which he accordingly did pursuing this method constantly their collection began to swell till at length it became of the size of an ordinary psalter and this was what the king called his handbook or manual asserius however calls it enchiridion in all probability asserius continued at court during the whole reign of aelfred and for aught we know several years after but where or when he died was matter of dispute though the saxon chronicle positively fixes it to the year   0 to which we think no just objection can be made the reader will observe that we take asser the monk and asser bishop of sherburn for one and the same person which some however have denied yet we go farther still and assert him to have been also archbishop of st davids we do indeed admit that if there was such a reader in the public schools at oxford as asser the monk he must have been some other person of the same name and not our author but we do not think this point so clearly made out as to deserve much dispute about it since it rests almost wholly on the authority of harpsfield for though he cites the annals of winchester yet we find no such thing in the annals that we have nor is the account consistent with itself in several other respects besides this of asser as sir john spelman has justly observed there is no less controversy about the works of asserius than about his preferments for some allege that he never wrote any thing but the annals of king aelfred whereas pits gives us the idea of no less than five other books of his writing and adds that he wrote many more the first of these is a commentary on boethius which is mentioned by leland on the authority of the chronicle of st neots the truth is he explained this author to king aelfred when he made his saxon translation whence the censure passed upon it that though it was a work of great use in those times yet it was in a manner ridiculous in in ours the same thing may be said of any literal version the second thing mentioned by pits is the annals of aelfreds life and reign the third he styles annals britanniae or the annals of britain in one book mentioned also by leland and bale and which has been since published by the learned dr gale who inclined to think it genuine which is certainly more than it deserved the fourth piece he calls aurearum sententiarum enchiridion lib   id est an enchiridion of golden sayings in one book which is without question the manual or commonplacebook made for king aelfred and reckoned among his works by this very pits it must be owned that leland had also spoken of this enchiridion but more accurately and in a manner becoming so great a writer for he speaks of it as an instance of the learning and diligence of asser which it certainly was and though the collections he made concerning this author are much better and larger than those of bale and pits yet he modestly upon this subject apologizes for speaking so little and so obscurely of so great a man the next in pits catalogue is a book of homilies and the last a book of epistles he took it for granted that asser being a bishop preached sometimes and that having so many friends he must needs write letters which is all the foundation that can be in nature for these two volumes no ancient author saying a word of them of the like stamp is bishop godwins account of his being buried in his cathedral church of sherburn which is mere guesswork founded on his being bishop there and with equal probability we might say he was buried at st davids though there is not any authority for either thus we conclude the article of this most excellent person who was without question one of the most pious most learned and withal one of the most modest prelates of the age in which he lived  assheton william doctor of divinity was the son of mr assheton rector of middleton in lancashire and descended of the ancient family of the baronets of his name in that county he was born in the year      and being instructed in grammarlearning at a private countryschool was removed to brazen nose college at oxford july        and elected a fellow of his college in      after taking both his degrees in arts he went into orders became chaplain to the duke of ormond chancellor of that university and was admitted doctor in divinity in january      in the following month he was nominated to the prebend of knaresburgh in the church of york and whilst he attended his patron in london obtained the living of st antholin in      by the dukes interest with the family of st johns he was presented to the rectory of beckenham in kent and was often unanimously chosen proctor for rochester in convocation  he was the projector of a scheme for providing a maintenance for clergymens widows and others by a jointure payable by the mercers company the bringing this project to perfection took up his thoughts for many years for though encouraged by many judicious persons to prosecute it he found much difculty in providing such a fund as might be a proper security to the subscribers he first addressed himself to the corporation of the clergy who declared they were not in a capacity to accept the proposal meettng with no better success in his next application to the royal bank of england the doctor applied himself to the mercers company who agreed with him upon certain rules and orders of which the following are the chief that the company will not take in subscriptions beyond the sum of one hundred thousand pounds that all married men of the age of thirty or under may subscribe any sum not exceeding one thousand pounds that all married men not exceeding the age of forty may subscribe any sum not exceeding five hundred pounds and that all married men not exceeding the age of sixty years may subscribe any sum not exceeding three hundred pounds and that the widows of all persons subscribing according to these limitations shall receive the benefit of thirty pounds per cent per ann free of all taxes and charges at the two usual feasts of lady day and michaelmas and that the first of these payments shall be made at the first of the said feastdays which shall happen four months or more after the decease of the subscriber excepting such as voluntarily make away with themselves or by any act of theirs occasion their own death either by duelling or committing any other crime in any or either of those cases the widow receives no annuity but upon delivering up the companys bond to have the subscriptionmoney returned to them that no seafaring man may subscribe nor others that go farther than holland ireland or the coasts of england and that any person may subscribe for others whom he shall nominate in his last will during the natural life of his wife if she survive and his intention to be declared in his subscription  dr assheton wrote several pieces against the papists and dissenters and some practical and devotional tracts a few years before his death he was offered the headship of his college which he declined he died at beckenham in      in the seventieth year of his age to give his character as drawn by the writer of his life he was very regular and assiduous in private devotion meditation and reading history and philosophy he justly used as the proper handmaids to divinity which was his business and delight he readily subscribed to all critical learned and laborious works by which means he completed one of the best libraries any clergyman can desire laying out at least ten pounds per annum to improve and increase his first stock of books those of devotion were intermixed or at hand to begin and end with he preached twice every sunday to keep the people from straggling and engage them to frequent the church otherwise he knew and lamented that we have but too much preaching in the nation finding at length his labor too great for him yet rather than lessen it though in a small parish he determined to keep an assistant to whom he committed the catechizing part in his declining age allowing him five shillings per sunday over and above thirty pounds per annum and the benefit of his table all church days etc with several gifts and advantages that made up the whole fifty pounds per annum he watched diligently over his flock and would suffer none to perish for want of admonition or reproof as well in the spirit of meekness as with all authority though he never sued cited or prosecuted the most injurious and obstinate offenders yet he rebuked and avoided the unruly and kept the impertinently censorious and perverse at a due distance he so much the more deserved of his parish as he was more generous and charitable among them than just to himself in disregarding often his small tithes and perquisites taking quietly what some left him and helping all wherein to make all just and easy too he tried all possible fair ways without contention by letting out the whole and letting every man his part and at last taking all in kind when they would not come near the value he kept up the true moderate english hospitality genteelly managed by an excellent virginsister who lived and died with him while he remained single and some few years after by a truly virtuous wife though sickly for whom he set up his coach being most tender of her and sorrowful at her death as he was a most affectionate tender husband and brother so he was a just indulgent master and had generally careful and honest servants whom he took pains to make religious peaceable and sober he daily observed the good old religious way of familydevotion he sometimes used extempore sermons having a body of divinity in his head until he was disturbed and put into a consternation with his congregation by a woman swooning away in the church who was soon carried out and the people became silent yet he could not recover his subject or recollect any thing he had said before which obliged him to make an apology and come down though easy of access and courteous and affable he distinguished persons times and places his tabletalk was both delightful and improving he diverted sad stories and decried false ones he would not willingly know a wicked person nor suffer a liar or talebearer in his fight he never looked so frowning as when a certain gentleman was backbiting another and telling him a scandalous story he started up and with emotion asked him if he could face the absent which soon confounded the whisperer  end of the first volume
