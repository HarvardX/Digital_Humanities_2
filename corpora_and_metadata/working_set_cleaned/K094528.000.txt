the hermitage a british story  york printed by c etherington for the author and sold by john bell bookseller in the strand london and c etherington york  mdcclxxii  preface the following sheets were wrote by a gentleman respectable for his knowledge in the useful and ornamental parts of life the work in general inculcates resignation to the will of heaven filial reverence and universal love  the editor  the hermitage possessed of an ancient family estate periander dwelt in a village exercising those virtues which render a man happy in himself and a blessing to his fellow creatures  providence had made him the father of an only son whose excellencies at once indulged the warmest of his parental wishes and promised to the world a happy successor to periander whose gray hairs approached the grave  the first vestiges of the reformation had not taken place in this kingdom yet periander from a mind enlarged with learning and benevolence had embraced certain principles dissenting from the romish church  in the neighborhood of the village stood a monastery the chief of which an ecclesiastic who from the contracted habits of his education had hardened his soul with every severity of superstition his meagre tall figure was made lean by a mind of anxiety and his pale visage and hollow eyes expressed avarice and envy he had acquired a bigotry of principle from example rather than judgment his monastic learning not advancing his charity had furnished him with censures and condemnations and his aversions were more generally exercised than his compassion  arbitrary in his principles so was father peter arbitrary in his manners the insolence of the church enflamed his bosom and zeal for peculiar modes extinguished that essence of religion universal love to depart from father peters precepts was to sin without measure and amidst a thousand good actions and a life of uninterrupted benevolence periander acquired the hatred and enmity of the ghostly father  father peter who from his holy office might be conceived to be an imitator of the god whom he served whose life being totally abstracted from the cares of the world was sustained in luxury by the hands of the labourer whose religious zeal offering to the deity through his ministers stored the cloister with the tenths of all his fruits possessed of abundant leisure to indulge his study of the divinity through all his works might we not have hoped that such a man would have armed himself against the powers of satan and have governed the impetuous ardour of human passions correcting them with true religion but so far from modulating the sallies of the soul with piety and virtue wrath and persecution were the weapons which were wielded by his consecrated hands  the influence which the religious had over families their secret intercourse and the rigorous mode in which they sustained their arbitrary authority gave father peter many opportunities of instigating mischief on his neighbor his blind bigotry induced him to think that in distressing one who dissented from the church of rome he rendered essential service to the god of all through zealous frenzy he devised a thousand treacheries and a thousand snares to oppress and injure periander  the seigniory was lord melvils where perianders lands lay he held them by knights service to this lord the treacherous priest addressed himself and from a forged instrument alleged to be recorded amongst the rolls and legends of the monastery of st benedict he induced him to prosecute a claim to the estates of periander the secret engines from monastic emissaries were sent abroad the ignorant deluded through their blindness into zeal were prepared as witnesses to evidence whatever they might be prompted to  periander already enervated with age his soul untoned his judgment relaxed and his mind smoothed into that divine composure which blesses the good man in his old age as the harbinger of his dissolution received these acts of oppression without dread he confided in the god of justice and smiled at the devices of his enemies but too late he perceived that the workers of iniquity were not always corrected by the instant hand of interposing providence he was at length alarmed with the reality of his danger his paternal bosom felt apprehensions for his son his age was disturbed in the midst of its infirmities and the hand of care grasped at his fainting soul  periander did not long sustain the shock he sunk into the arms of death with filial devotion his beloved son astianax laid him in the vault amidst his ancestors  astianax called from his travels by his fathers approaching fate an utter stranger to the enmity and stratagems of father peter took possession of his inheritance the contest still went on some little time preceding to the day of trial astianax had retired into the gallery of his mansion to meditate on the posture of his affairs and to consider of lord melvils claim as he walked pensive to and fro on a sudden behind him at the further end of the gallery he heard a clash of armor turning hastily he observed the buckler and shield to shake which once his great ancestor norban wore and in which in palestine he testified his valor to the saracens he regarded the event as accidental and on pursued his melancholy walk hearing the sound again he looked up and perceived the coat of mail to tremble on the crooks where it hung and the gauntlet moved as if it beckoned him this is no common circumstance cries he let me discover the occasion of that trouble in these arms which with their owner long have been at rest he ascended a few steps and begun to hand the armor when he distinguished within the breast plate a light like the fainting rays which glow worms shed within the shadowy bower at eventide advancing further he discovered that the beams proceeded from a small onyx cross which hung concealed by the armor suspended in a golden chain from the collar the unexpected acquisition threw him for a moment into surprise strange it is thought he that such a gem should remain for seven ages undiscovered by his forefathers a gem so rare that in its composition it excelled all he had ever seen it was as the onyx stone shadowy and round and variegated but around it was diffused a livid light on its parts were various engravings of mysterious or emblematical characters appearing like the egyptian devices representing the attributes of the god of nature a sudden propensity led astianax to place the chain upon his neck soon as the amulet had touched his bosom from every point of the cross there fell warm drops of blood and with a horrid clangour the armor shook in every joint surprise now changed to fear have i says he with sacrilegious hands polluted this fair gem and is the spirit of the mighty norban offended at my rashness again the armor shook these uncommon appearances increased his amazement as if danger was near he laid his hand upon his sword and looking around seemed to expect an enemy his enemy was there the insatiable ecclesiastic not being content with the slow progress of the laws in the oppression of astianax and not being appeased by the death of the good periander but taking advantage of the liberty which these times of bigotry afforded to the churchmen he past through the apartments of the house uninterrupted and sought the heir of periander in his retirement to accomplish his infernal purposes by his assassination the blessed spirits of those who have left this life remain our guardian angels and till this globe by fire shall be refined into a heaven for men they hover in the upper atmosphere where light alone fills the expanse and ride above the watery vapourous veil which circumvades this planet there they behold whatever betides their kindred souls on earth from whence descending to our aid as each emergency advances far as such refined beings spirits of heavenly mould can move the dull and drowsy senses of our earthly form they influence our will or check our wish or turn our rash resolve by touch so delicate that we amidst the inspiration know not how or why we pass between our purpose and the event their form is also pure that to our sight the spirits riding on the beams of light escape the sense like colors till they pass on mediums which are attuned to the dullness of mans nature so when they would conduct us from perils eminent or to the fair possessions of prosperity they assume some form terrestrial to minister to us their more peculiar care  the approach of father peter at first struck astianax with apprehension but on recollection of his holy office and of his public name for godliness and rigid virtue his fear subsided yet not knowing why he still retained his hand upon his sword the ghostly father in his bosom hid the dagger which he brought to shed astianaxs blood with a solemn look of sanctity he addressed the youth in language culled from all the store of base hypocrisy first disciplined in dark monastic schools with seeming tears he spoke of periander and crossing his breast prayed for his departed spirit he sighed and talked of all the ancestry of young astianax and called on saints to lead him in the paths of his forefathers forth he stretched his hand to bless him and from his sword the unsuspicious youth was ready to withdraw to clasp the monk within his bosom where his soul rebounded with the fervor of his reverence and love to those of whom he spoke in that instant the armor shook alarmed by the repeated sound astianax stepped back the noise had touched the ecclesiastics ear and with emotions not to be expressed he felt unusual terrors seize his soul the crucifix upon the bosom of astianax again let fall fresh tears of blood and fixed with earnest and involuntary grasp his hand remained upon his sword various passions wandered on his features the monk long used to look upon the face of those he dealt with there to discover from that undeceiving index the sentiments which agitate the soul fixed a steady gaze upon the youth wondering to behold a luster beam over all his aspect such as zealots fancy to their patron saints his dark resolves were shaken astianax thus upon his guard rendered the monks enterprise impracticable the shaking of the armor was supernatural conscious evil filled the guilty mind of father peter with terrors and selfcondemnation his soul let go its bloody purpose and for a moment relaxed into remorse but for a moment only for the succeeding thought turned on a future time to execute his project  during the short time in which these few ideas moved within the mind of the ecclesiastic astianax and he stood motionless and silent the monk gazing on the youth and the youth with eyes uplifted fixed on the armor peter broke silence and arming his bosom with the tokens of the cross he called upon the sacred name of god to bless and sanctify him that he might avoid the snares and wiles of those infernal beings which possessed this mansion and the frenzyd spirit of astianax amidst this ejaculation with uplifted eyes and hands he turned to quit the chamber when behold the loosened garment let the weapon pass and at his feet the naked dagger dropped this was the hour of wonder to astianax he scarce gave credit to what he saw his astonished mind could not form one conjecture wherefore the good the pious monk wore in his bosom this dire instrument confounded in the event the monk in haste passed on not noticing the matter but apprehending that hence the youth would take the alarm and ever in his presence be on his guard  soon as astianax had recollected himself from his surprise he stooped to take the dagger up when he beheld the onyx sending forth more brilliant rays than when he first perceived it on the breast plate of his ancestor he dropped upon his knee and holding forth the glowing amulet thus he poured forth his thoughts  most glorious relick of my sire great norban do i not apprehend thy inestimable value and thy wondrous qualities whilst suspended on my bosom thy virtues can presage the unforeseen approach of danger and the advancing changes to prosperity thy bloody tears foretell that hazard is not far behind and thy luster blazeth forth to proclaim the footsteps of serenity and peace o ye blessed manes of my departed ancestors if ye behold the last remains this single personage of your illustrious blood with eyes of approbation and with angelic love guard me from perils and the wiles of satan be present to my soul in all its resolutions and so inspire me with the love of honor that i may emulate your glorious deeds and imitate your virtuous lives and when my regenerated spirit shall leave this vale of sin and sorrowfulness to meet you on the wings of light may i be esteemed deserving of your approbation and adjudged worthy to be enrolled by the recording angel in the illustrious table of your genealogy in heaven  the monk retired into his secret cell and there instead of devoting his meditations to religious prospects his temporal ambition and rapacious avarice led him to form new plans for the destruction of astianax lord melvil was a man whose early life was dissolute and vicious every degree of fashionable error was familiar to him in his lasciviousness he ruined half his vassals in his ebriety he mastered the herculean cup of alexander in him ignorance begat obstinacy his resentment was insatiate his will was arbitrary and his whole demeans groaned under his authority age and disease had weakened his faculties but left his mind all unreformed the churchmen took possession of his soul they ingrafted bigotry upon the darkness of his understanding wound up the springs of superstition and from the horrors of their doctrine induced his avarice to bend in purchase of salvation large endowments had been made and father peters monastery enriched with vast donations the enmity to periander first gave rise to the prosecuted claim of his estates lord melvil had devoted it for a thousand masses more to the same monastery the death of periander removed the object of the ecclesiastics vengeance but the object of his avarice was yet in being the active spirit of astianax the heir and the unbounded love his excellencies gained him together with his determined purpose of appealing to the king in person seemed to throw such obstacles to a design which fraud alone supported that father peters subtlety was confounded he was convinced that astianax would not be the same supine opponent he had met with in periander that he would never cease to trace the subject to its source and that the esteem his virtues had procured him would prompt a thousand friends to aid his suit and second his appeal before the king against a lord whose violence and oppression had long been infamous he reflected that the claim sustained itself upon a forgery that the king whose youthful soul was not subjected to the bigotries of church dominion would give but little credit to the dormant legends of a monastery the world already entertained suspicions of the artifices of ecclesiastics their large acquisitions had promoted jealousies and thence their authorities grew distasteful an apprehension of the discovery of this fraud brought many terrors he reflected that astianax was now the only one remaining of his ancient house and that without an heir his lands reverted to the lord an easier passage this than what he had devised in the days of periander the death of astianax would accomplish all his purpose the perpetration committed to his own hands avoided discovery and left no accomplice to betray the treachery with soul inured to sin he resolved upon the horrid project but angels interposing held his hands and frustrated his device  under these circumstances see the ecclesiastic in his cell the religious habit the cloak of hypocrisy cast from his inflamed bosom where disappointment irritated all his sinful disposition on the table where he rested stood the image of a suffering deity suspended on the cross a rosary and a book of prayer the holy gospels lay upon his couch with wafers and the hallowed waterurn overwhelmed objects to other minds excitive of reverence and adoration to father peter nothing more than inanimate emblems of his profession with such attendants who could apprehend that temporalities were all his care rapine and avarice vengeance and blood could not such objects touch thy hardened heart and prompt thee to look inward on thyself inured to wickedness habituated to this cell with these its ornaments even the representation of an expiring savior even the doctrines of the son of god availed not undeterminate he in his gloomy mind for some time revolved a thousand stratagems and with his wiles he wearied out the midnight lamp  one morning astianax was called by some peculiar friends to join the chase willing to remove the melancholy ideas which had possessed his mind he accepted the invitation the boar was roused was fierce and made the hunters exercise all their alacrity and skill astianax was separated from his friends one companion left with him in the same thicket a stranger who during the diversion seemed merely a distant spectator but upon nearer approach appeared a spectator masked the summer sun was vehement and for the freedom of the air the youth had opened his bosom where the onyx shone with rays distinguishing some propitious moment was at hand the stranger still approaching seemed with cautious looks to survey the wood as if he feared their privacy might be interrupted he drew near when opening his upper garment and the mask being withdrawn or vanishing discovered him to be an ancient hermit whose venerable look and gracious countenance bespoke benevolence and virtue the appearance of such a person gave astianax some surprise the secrecy of the place the disguise the fresh impressions father peter had left all conduced to make him distrust the holy looks of the hermit and even to loose his confidence in the auspicious omens of the amulet an expression of anxiety sat on his features from astianaxs looks the sage distinguished his ideas for he was disciplined in phisiognomy young man says he lay aside all apprehension that i design you evil i am no stranger to the reason why my appearance troubles your thoughts the late visit which you received from the principal of the monastery of st benedict is well known to me i knew his enmity to periander i knew his projects to dispossess you of your inheritance i am no stranger to his influence over lord melvil the record with which he arms that infamous persecutor is all a forgery my great esteem of periander is not lessened in astianax i am now a stranger to you some little time will reveal my real character i have assumed this disguise to give you such intelligence and to warn you of the evils which await you from hence i go to father peter my authority and influence are such with him that he shall stay the prosecution but young man beware for ere we meet again a multitude of perils will beset thee arm thy breast with every virtue cloth thee with patience trust in heaven loose not thy confidence in god even in the very moments of thy greatest afflictions the hand of providence conducts the events of this life by ways so mysterious to man that what we esteem the greatest evils often prove the passage to prosperity and happiness the monk is possessed of such inveteracy such unrelenting vengeance that this frustration of his purpose will stimulate his avarice will serve him for the projecting of new schemes and for the lighting up of malice yet more vehement prepare for wiles and treacheries for they will surely tread upon thy heel and circumvent thee in the most secret secure and unsuspected channels his talent for such business is refined as satans and there my aid is totally impossible heaven permits that the benedictine shall proceed in his iniquity till from the eminence his fall shall become horrible the sins of his house shall raze it to its foundation and the traces of the habitation shall be effaced by the ploughshare thou shall once more see my countenance when peace shall bless thee virtue consists not in wrestling with the will of fate but in sustaining the trials of life with fortitude and resignation supporting the mind from falling through lassitude into despair or from impatience being severed with rashness and headstrong resolution the author of every event tries the heart of man and in his own good time brings forth the fruits of virtue and of honor to await with patience to submit with resignation and without complainings to sustain the evils of mortality with perseverance and with piety to stand erect before the frowns of lifes adversity scorning to incline to either hand either to forlornness or to impetuosity but looking forward with faith depending on the will of heaven is to work out the labors of propriety for god ordains and his ministers execute what ever is derives its origin from heaven  astianax listened with reverence and astonishment the hermit did not give him liberty to reply he turned swiftly away and skilful in the mazes and intricacies of the thicket soon was effectually concealed and clear of all pursuit the conversation of this reverend personage filled astianaxs mind with thoughtfulness he admired his wisdom and his precepts yet feared his prescience he turned homeward and as he passed along thus he breathed his thoughts whence or what are the evils to betide i am not able to conjecture hence shall this venerable sages precepts be ever present to my mind shame it is that such a wretch as this benedictine should cloth him with the cloak of sanctity and in his holy function with hypocrisy to screen such evil dispositions already learning gains a rapid progress in this land the shades of ignorance are dispersing as the vapors of the valley mount upon the morning rays to bring on a serene meridian the crafts and artifices by which the church have hitherto held the vulgar in bigotry and superstition an iron arbitrary reign are gradually dissipating under the beams of learning the darkness is stricken the terrors and the goblins vanish the authority of rome wastes away such men as father peter aid the blessed work of providence yet the vices of the ecclesiastics not only reflect infamy on themselves but even religion itself becomes odious through its ministers men draw conclusions from appearances miracles are no longer the infatuation of this land these subtleties when seen through prejudice a peoples minds even against the holiest institutions of the church when men who minister in sacred office show themselves unaffected by the doctrine which they would inculcate the doctrine suffers in the contempt which betides the teacher men cannot be divine but men may be discreet the principles of religion breathe the support of liberty but the church has subverted them for the promotion of captivity and bondage the mind when at large will pursue the divinity through every revelation but strain it too far or circumscribe it too narrowly and religion is languishing in incomprehensibilities or rushing headlong down the precipice of blind implicit faith the acceptable services before god are the workings of understanding in other worship alike the camel and the man bend the prostrated knee my prophetic mind presages to me many degradations of the church she has advanced her pride and power with a rapid progress and prosperity has made her mad like an idiot who gazes at the moon as she ascends the horizon and from the level straddles to mount her rosy car the church intoxicate with greatness levels to its authority all under heaven and sees not the distance which intervenes between gods sufferance and his approbation between his long probations and his judgment the insolence of priesthood will exist to the last verge till at length the total dissolution of these monasteries these convents these cathedrals and colleges like shackles on the hand of liberty worn in ages of supine indolence will be torn off and all the pompous acclamations of a choir of priests will change for that most acceptable service the sighings of a contrite heart  in a short time astianax experienced the accomplishment of the hermits promise the suit slept tranquillity possessed the bosom of astianax  that his ancient family might not be extinct he determined to marry and ere it was long was made happy in the excellencies of jessalind the daughter of a gentleman who with his family for a few months had visited this land from normandy his fortune was but small but his proper judgment had led him to give a liberal education to his daughter whose fine taste had been improved in every degree of learning fashionable in the age she was skilful in every domestic art and added thereto a perfection in music and dancing her person was amiable her manners elegant and her sense refined these were displayed by an uninterrupted flow of health pleasantry and good spirits time passed away felicitous and smooth  amongst a few select friends who sometimes with their visits changed the domestic scene polidore had gained a great ascendence over the mind of astianax he had cultivated in his principles the most punctual sense of honor and inspired him with every military fervor for defense of that honor by arms his readiness in rendering services his alacrity in executing any project which he knew would give pleasure to his friend his impartial and disinterested counsels had made astianax place in him the utmost confidence and esteem whilst those two friends were one day alone in the grove which adjoined to astianaxs mansion thus polidore addressed him i am so well known to my friend that i need not seek to win his confidence by a rehearsal of my services or gain his opinion of my veracity by assertions which would injure our mutual esteem my regard for astianax makes me jealous of every injury done to his honor and it becomes a duty in me to apprize him of every danger which besets him be not too much shocked my friend by a discovery in which your happiness is in imminent peril your jessalind is inconstant  at that expression astianax started shuddered and grew enflamed have a care cries he these are weapons too accute to sport with  polidore showed a resentful look at this reply can you says he dispute my veracity then let the rest of the discovery sleep if you think i injure her my profession allows you means to satisfy your honor you know i am a soldier  the experience which astianax had of polidores sincerity gave him credulity his thoughts were confused his judgment confounded and amidst the distraction of injured love and the shame of such dishonor he gave way to an impetuous tide of jealousy and resentment he was greedy of hearing his own calamities and disgrace and devoured the poisonous and destructive tale with vehemence polidore appeased by such apology as astianax in his confusion could utter was prompted to pursue the horrid history  grinvil your kinsman who from his earliest youth has been your intimate and bosom friend it is he that injures you the guilty hour of assignation is at hand is it not about the time at which you have often said in this season of the year your jessalind retires to bathe it is replies astianax and what of that this winding walk says polidore will lead us to the bathhouse undiscovered i will attend you to the place and leave you to be assured of my truth they hastened on they arrive within sight of the bath polidore departed  with arms enfolded and with downcast eyes astianax stood ruminating on the tale the more he revolved in his mind the circumstances and events attending his hours of married life the more was he induced to discredit the relation a wish arose within his beating heart born from reviving love and kindling hope but soon that wish was blasted and jealousy in his dire realm of chaos swept away extinguished hope and swallowed up expiring love when with eyes shedding tears of distraction he beheld the amulet portending woe in a few moments as he stood thus concealed in his shady situation he viewed the lovely jessalind without attendant moving to the bath the serenity of virtue sat smooth upon her brow placid innocence becalmed her looks whilst fond felicity was sporting with insuspicion in dimples on her cheek over his whole soul affection lay bleeding his eyes as they dwelt upon the object swam in tears whilst the blackness of his mind in mourning absorbed the image from the aching optics and never returned one fair refraction to the seat of love when nature struggled to give birth to hope the amulet and polidores known faith obstructed every passage but the influx of despair  she entered the bath the sound of several voices struck astianaxs ear his heart was thrown into dreadful convulsions and all his bosom blazed with resentment his impatience became unsupportable he rushed from his concealment and bursting into the antichamber of the bath discovered the disconcerted and alarmed jessalind with the treacherous grinvil for jealousy for madness this was evidence sufficient the emotions of astianaxs breast stifled his words he only had power left him to call grinvil to defend himself grinvil would have parleyd but astianax rushed on the terrified jessalind fainted sword met with sword and in the bosom of grinvil the horrid steel was plunged  scarce breathing from his victory astianax stepped forward to destroy the fair the insensible jessalind a dreadful burst of thunder seemed to make the earth tremble to the center roused from the very grasp of death grinvil cast up his hand and eyes and faultering bid him forbear the attitude the accents of his dying friend seemed to express something irresistible gasping with rage astianax paused as the lion over his captive stag when breathless with the chase to meditate his ravenous repast grinvil took possession of this interval if you suspect the virtue of your wife you are deceived our meeting here was accidental i die content if i should save her innocence he ceased  the blood gushed from his wound in torrents  his speech is gone  his eyes grow dim  he faints   astianax like one who heard the direful voice of an avenging angel denouncing desolation to whole empires stood fixed in horror his extended eyes shifted their distracted stare from jessalind to grinvil his trembling hands stained with the murder of his friend convulsively grasped his reeking sword irresolute for suicide irresolute for flight too proud to seek for sanctuary not longer able to endure the horrid spectacle he sought the grove he sought some hiding place where he might form a resolution for his conduct the grove renewed his grief conscience ceases not to haunt the steps of guilt the grove the bath alike afforded him objects for despair too late he proved the want of discretion in polidore for from his wellproved faith he could never conceive that he was treacherous too late he recollects the pious precepts of the hermit on the chase too late he finds that the abortive claim so basely instigated by the benedictine was now effected and as a murderer not only life was forfeited but his lands escheated to lord melvil how dreadful was the prospect of his total desolation divested of his property guilty of innocent blood a victim due to justice by one rash act rushed from the height of human happiness into the darkest gulf of woe fallen from affluence from the joys of virtuous love domestic harmony and heartfelt selfapproving rectitude and honor but yet to aggravate and crown his misery the innocent traduced jessalind widowed in penury and at the instant pregnant  the first interval of judgment prompted astianax to seek the thickest cover of an adjoining forest to conceal him till the approach of night as he was assured in these walks the alarm would speedily be spread and his escape frustrated thence under the favor of the darkness he determined to proceed into the mountains and at some secure distance live unknown till perchance a favorable opportunity might present to gain an advocate for the obtaining royal clemency  how distracting a scene presented itself to jessalind upon her recovery from her swoon grinvil weltering in his blood convulsed and in the agonies of death astianax gone gone full of condemnations jealousy and hatred against his innocent and forlorn jessalind then cries she all the remainder of existence is given to despair with lamentations and disheveled hair she fled into the avenue and strained her voice with incessant calls on her beloved husband no voice replied but plaintive echo sobbing in the gloomy grove she flew to her late happy habitation the domestics alarmed at her complainings stood astonished and melting into tears  as soon as the dreadful story was related grinvils body was removed by a faithful old servant and by him carried to a friend a shepherd who inhabited a cot in an adjoining valley a man well skilled in salutary drugs and one who in his youth from long services in arms had acquired a wondrous knowledge in the art of surgery some faint remains of life appearing he had hopes the wound might not prove mortal  whilst these matters were transacting the rumor spread with rapid wing and soon had reached lord melvils ears whose officers like hungry wolves upon the snowcloathd alps poured down their rude rapacious bands on the estates of the unfortunate astianax they beset the mansion house possess themselves of all and with a brutality peculiar to their office command the friendless heartbroken widowed jessalind to quit the place the command admitted no reply their hardened hearts suffered no compassion and whilst her lingering steps hung trembling on the threshold which she loved with savage rage they push her out  now all the elements in war seemed to have made this habitation the scene of their dire vengeance fierce lightnings blazed in the apartments and rush upon each gallery tremendous bursts of thunder shook the building to its foundation as if a torrent poured its waters down the stairs the noise of vast cascades were heard and in the painted gallery the agitated coat of mail sounded with the clangour of a mighty combat  the wretches who executed lord melvils commission conjecturing they were beset with evil spirits fled and left the place without inhabitants  the report of these amazing circumstances busied the ear of every villager it reached the monastery of st benedict the priests enflamed with the zeal of their hypocrisy rejoiced in the intelligence esteeming all these wonders as the bugbears born of credulity and ignorance and apprehending this a fortunate opportunity to execute their exorcisms and acquire an impious credit with the vulgar by exercising the miraculous privilege of chaining spirits by their religious ofces they sought their principal to crave his license for their visiting the house of the unfortunate astianax father peter was then in close conference with one on business of importance and would not be disturbed well judging it were best for these rash men not to brave the wrath of the enchanted armor at this very instant father peter entertained a visiter whose friendship was not to be neglected the grant of astianaxs escheated lands already was framing for the records of the monastery and polidore was shut up with the monk in his cell to claim the miserable reward of his inestimable services polidore had been gained by avarice and great gratuities to perpetrate the worst of crimes the monk baffled in his former projects cast his eyes toward the soldier whose love of gain he perceived stood incompatible with his sincerity and that interest could easily subvert his specious principles he won the soul of this base man by assurances that certain lands which lay contiguous to his scanty farm should be granted by the monastery together with infallible absolution if he should be the means of astianaxs overthrow artful and subtle he devised the plan and at this instant the traitor listened to assurances that so soon as lord melvil sealed the grant he should receive the rewards of his treachery  the malicious monk resolute in his purpose had determined to engage this his emissary for from his having been many years a missionary in his younger days he had acquired a competent knowledge of the disposition of a soldier born in abject life and bred a mercenary and whilst he fixed his project and his plan thus he meditated on the character of his accomplice  this polidore he is a soldier born of the lowest of mankind unlettered and unprincipled he has risen through the fatalities of war and mounted by the scale of death to superiority he has been tutored in subtleties and craft purloining other mens opinions passions and purposes to win the way to his promotion it was his earliest object his vacant soul received it for a solitary portion thus ambition has become his only passion the slaughter of his brothersoldier is his prosperity and his exaltation comes fostered in bloodshed thence it is that affection and compassion never were subjects of his brutal bosom all true courage is derived from virtue and honor from integrity but the soldiers substitutes for these are savage insensibility and the law of arms from his youth his estimates of mankind have been formed from himself he barters existence for his pay his blood is hired with the wages so every attachment every principle every price is given to serve ambition such is the man in whom father peter puts his confidence immersed in crimes like these such a man cannot possess one virtue such a man can assassinate his friend  jessalind sought a resting place in an adjoining convent whose abbess was a distant relation to her husband here she determined to remain until she could hear from her father in normandy into whose arms she would throw herself to spend the remainder of her miserable days  the night which had overshadowed astianax was heavily beset with clouds and the young moon soon reached the dusky horizon yet with unremitting steps he sought the heath at length he sat him down where rugged rocks had formed a little circle resorted to by goats who shunned the storms of winter or sought the shadowy haunt to screen them from the summersun amidst the dusty tracks some little plots of grass were scattered inviting to repose and down the rifted cliffs a stream of water trickled through the moss to tempt the fainting lips with its refreshment the weary limbs will yield to rest even amidst the afflictions of the mind the grass the murmuring breeze the watertrill all tempted sleep astianax sunk into repose ere long beyond the hills the distant thunders growld and gushing winds bustle through the rocks the storm advances and now a horrid peal bursts over astianaxs head astonished he awakes in terror he cries out here rests the miscreant o lord from thee the sinner finds no hiding place thy vengeance ever overtakes the guilty the heavy clouds were rent light changing instantaneous with darkness floods of lightning fill the whole welkin with a blaze light too acute for mortal eye succeeds impenetrable darkness the loud thunderclaps which seemed to convulse the world in their intervals were followed by a dreary universal silence in which the very breezes slept astianax trembled the human mind conscious of evil is busy to torment itself guilt dragging on remorse brings terror his attendant astianax doubted not the angry arm of providence wielded the storm to brand the odious wretch whose hands were red with the murder of his friend and whose head was overwhelmed with the misery of having undone a virtuous wife and beggared his progeny even in the womb  at length the hurricane subsides and ere it was long the morning dawns the clouds had gathered up their heavy skirts and left the horizon tinged with a silver ray which lighted up the pale gray eye of morn the distant hills were green to the view and nights last shadow fled adown the valleys mixing with the blue trimmed vapors the heavens above were muffled in a shaggy cloak like ruffled plumes when the awaking vulture shakes his pinions at length the fringe of every folding cloud was stained with crimson the dye improves till the whole velvet mantle of the rising day glowed into scarlet edged with burnished gold and forth ascends the ruddy orb of light exulting in the race he now renews all nature as if ashamed of being caught within the sluggard arms of sleep wore blushes now the universal silence is subdued the birds awake the song the curlew pipes it as he passes on the plover on her bustling pinion sallies round and the heath cock cackles to his brood to lead them to the sweet repast of bilberries luxuriant  how cheering is the face of morn to innocence but to astianax it was increase of woe the night removed removes his safety pent in by rocks within a narrow space far from the road of any passengers save shepherds he resolved to pass away the day and when the evening returned pursue his way into the mountains where there are mines and there amongst these miserable men who earn a sorry sustenance by laboring in the bowels of the earth he might at once support existence and conceal himself till he could send intelligence to alfred the father of his jessalind of his situation that he might move the throne for pardon amongst the cliffs he gathered berries to stay his hunger from briers brambles and the juniper and drank his drink fresh from the fountains lip  as he sat in tears to pass away the heavy hours of day the dreary waste surrounding afforded no prospects to amuse the mind where nature sat in desolations weeds and mourned the long protracted absence of sylva and her sister ceres all around or hill or dale was clad in russet heath save here and there a barren mountain lifts its rugged brow a mass of stormbleachd cliffs where vegetation from the reign of chaos never smiled or chance some plots lying on the distant steep from whence the heath by lightning burnt had made a space for grass and pasturage where shaggy goats were seen to climb or some few scattered sheep over which a starving shepherd hung desponding of the providence of heaven and scarce believes himself the better brute whilst near at hand a hasty brook was seen as driven on from rock to rock in course confused pouring its frothy streams precipitate impatient to escape the inhospitable the native land along whose channel rocks beset with yew stand mutes to mourn her passage into happier climes no swallow flitted through the winding way nor rail consoled her negro race with cheerful call a sad resort for sickening goats a secret dell where they could hide their woe from mortal eye save a single pair of ravens who occupied the place and named it the vale of melancholy where to the ear of misery they told the daily tale of death whilst over the spacious tract of moor and down the dreary dale astianaxs eye wearily wandered the sun had shot his rays beyond the cloud and lighted up the distant hill where grief to his soul at the stretch of sight he viewed the fair enclosures and the cheerful verdure of a cultivated land as extending from out the richer valley the vapors which oerhang the dale seeming to blaze with light as if the god of nature shed a bounteous smile upon the favored scene  after some days journey distance secured the wanderer and now he ventured forth by day in his wretched journey accident had brought him to a shepherds hut placed in a little vale surrounded by a chain of mountains where a few acres with fresh verdure pastured a cow the hills descending to the south abounded with wild thyme and variegated pansies where a flock of sheep with fleeces white as snow were scattered up and down the northern hills stood rugged and black mourning the distant god of day who only once a year shot transverse rays across the waste and looked askance upon the seat of barrenness through this valley a little stream with many meandrings winds its tardy pace as if it lingered in the scene it loved along the margin nodding willows played with fond reflection in the silver lake there hazels mixed with poplars stand where thrushes whistle on the rural song of sweet retirement a little plain fronted the hut where a single thorn had grown for half a century beneath whose shade a bench built up of stones and turf afforded a pleasing resting place thick ivy covered the cottage front and house leek ornamented the thatch a little plot of garden ground was stocked with roots where in one continued range a multitude of beehives stood and in the sunshine sent their buzzing myriads forth to labor at the approach of astianax a dog that slumbered in his watch gave the alarm and to his barkings echo from the hill repeats the signal to the distant swain a gray old man came forth whose countenance shone with benevolence as wondering to behold a man in gay apparel wandering there amidst the mountains far from any road a place scarce accessible and seldom visited by any but shepherds he for a while remained silent whilst he surveyed astianax with deep attention he saluted him enquired what occasion brought him there and what those sorrows were which he perceived to hang upon his brow astianax returned his gracious looks with tears father says he i am unfortunate my miseries have overwhelmed me the treachery of men has made me hate their intercourse and here i wander finding greater satisfaction in wastes and wilds sustaining life with berries and the fountains brim than in the crowded hall busied with servile cringing dogs and smelling rank of luxury and riot  the shepherd from his talk conceived astianax was disordered in his mind his compassion prompted him to lend his aid to calm his troubled reason charity with her looks benign lighted up his countenance and the divinity shone forth his presence on his features wisdom with silverhaird experience stood confessed over all his figure blessed old age exclaimed the enraptured astianax in thee mankind confess the image which god ordained in the first creation   young man interrupts the shepherd rest here a little first i pray thee recollect that all the ways of providence are left unsearchable to human understanding and so blind are we that oftentimes those things which we esteem calamities lead to the birth of our felicity and what is present evil is the very passage to our prosperity tell me whence are all thy sorrows i would talk to thee of that allseeing everbounteous god who despising not the sighings of a contrite heart dries up the tears of men in misery perchance i thus his minister may lend thee consolation astianax was moved anew he recollected the admonitions of the hermit conscious that he had neglected his sage precepts and yielded himself a sacrifice to passion fresh tears were shed after some moments of astonishment that the judgment of each reverend teacher had admonished him to principles of the like import and weighing in his thought the tenor of his crimes as being incapable of consolation he replies in vain you talk of that great being in whom alone is peace in vain you ask of my afflictions my miseries are not to be revealed the secret through a thousand vows is bound in darkness the recollection will for ever be my torment madness would attend description the baseness the villainies the treacheries of mankind afford a history so horrid that their permission in the eye of heaven would make even zealots stagger from their religion into infidelity and blasphemously cry amidst the darkness there is no god my wretchedness has wrestled with consolation by the way and the comforter is passed by time once elapsed turns not his wings offended heaven has marked me with the seal of fate from the celestial eye i wander forth like cain to hide me from the countenance divine which i have enflamed with wrath if in this world a place is found where god abides not but behold amidst these horrid wastes this little paradise is placed where he communes with shepherds  after some little talk the good old man desired his visiter to take refreshment and set before him milk with butter honey and bread and to conclude the mess in a plain cup of horn served him with nectar brewed from the stores the busy bees had yielded the cheering repast afforded gayer spirits the shepherd with joy perceived his guests countenance much brightened his benevolent heart exulted he asks the stranger to enter his hut where a grave bending matron the consort of the shepherds happiness was assiduous in the cleanly offices of her household from the hills returned the shepherds two sons hardy and hale the youths breathed freshness and health in gratitude for the bounty of their father astianax from his purse presented them with each two broad pieces of gold wonder struck their countenance they were astonished at the gift and their hearts were filled with wishes to render him good offices  astianax arose and bid the shepherd and his family adieu the old man stayed him earnestly desiring to know whither he sought to go or where he hoped to rest the question could not be resolved he knew not whither he wandered but to the importuning of his host at length he answered i seek some place for my retirement where innocence and truth have formed their habitation if they ere this are not escaped to heaven i have forsworn the busy world and seek to form some hermitage where i may spend my life in prayer and meditation by penitence to purchase expiation of my crimes some hermitage where few men come and yet where human steps may tread that seeing them i may remember what i am and renewing to my mind the history of mankind i may daily to the throne of heaven put up petitions for mercies on them to repay evil with good and close this life of misery and care in supplications for the pardon of the world  an hermitage you seek replies the shepherd the hermitage of paul du monte as old tradition goes was near this place  the name du monte struck astianax with horror his own surname he thought he had associated with necromancers the old man beheld his agitation with surprise and asked the cause but he was replied to with sighs my sons added the shepherd shall attend you to the hill where story tells this ancient hermit dwelt a man of holy life and sage beyond his race of noted birth near in blood to nobles yet there he dwelt the first surprise past over astianax with impatience desired the young men would accompany him the task was arduous but they were ready to testify their gratitude by such their assiduity repose yourself with us this night the shepherd said the spot is distant six hours journey there i have a few good goats and at some seasons these my sons go near the place to see how fares my herd in the morning they shall show the way and that the hours may not seem irksome i will relate to you the history as i received it from my grandsire who though then of ninety years of age had heard the tale when young as a relation of far distant facts with anxious ear affianax attended the shepherd thus  from normandy the good man came the youngest son of lord du monte bred to the holy office of a priest he was a member of the priory of st augustine  astianax was greatly agitated at this prelude his color came and fled alternately the shepherd observing his confusion asked him wherefore the story moved him the history of a man who centuries ago had hid himself amidst these wilds and of whom he apprehended astianax had never heard till then to conceal his thoughts he replied the story in its beginning reminds me of my father who in my youth would often laugh and tell of mad du monte the memory of that father is sacred to my soul these sighs a duteous tribute to his memory his parental virtues are indelibly written on my recollection  to the hermit continued the shepherd in reward for his great piety a visiting angel left the realms of light to pour upon him gifts most excellent and supernatural the gift of healing was his own and simples gathered from the cliffs and wilds became from him most salutary medicine his knowledge in natures secrets was extensive he foretold the seasons and their changes and saw the dire approach of famine pestilence or war his wisdom afforded him the power of upright judgment and with the shepherds he was judge determining their wrongs and injuries he taught the rudest men the sense of moral virtues and the lips of infants breathed his prayer the sins and subtleties of the ecclesiastics of st augustines house disgusted him their avarice and their intrigues were often his talk and when he uttered condemnations on their lives he trembled for the wrath of heaven which those most impious men provoked by their hypocrisy the errors of those learned sinners defying the enlightened spirit of science hardily braving a deity in whose name they taught deceit and cloakd the worst of crimes so offended the upright soul of paul du monte that he sought these barren mountains there to devote his life to piety and godly works in this solitude he remained for many seasons at length age and infirmity had bent his reverend figure and every day for long he sat at the entrance of his cell as if watchful for his releasing angel to give his spirit freedom from mortality and every shepherd often would he ask if yet no stranger was perceived about the mountains as questing for his habitation at length the visiter appeared with whom he seemed affectionately intimate one day he summoned to his cell the neighboring herdsmen and thus addressed them that you may declare my words unto your children and they to late posterity deliver the tradition down i call you here you have known me long and know my truth this visiter he is my brother i had foretold his coming and i knew it was the signal of my mortal dissolution scarce yet an hour remains for life the herds all loved the hermit and all wept forth from his breast he drew a crucifix and placed it on his brothers neck wear this he cries beloved norban  at that name astianax like one struck with instantaneous lightning started and sunk upon a knee with hands extended toward the shepherd in astonishment devouring every accent and each look  the old man thought these were the starts and passions of his malady pitying which he forbore to proceed astianax yet kneeling and trembling with impatience requested him to go on he obeyed wear this beloved norban said the hermit sword pestilence and storms shall never injure thee whilst this crucifix shall hang upon thy neck the jewel of extraordinary nature no sooner rested on the bosom of norban than forth it shed a blaze of light too piercing for the herds to gaze upon this shall thou wear continued the hermit till a good old age shall lead thee through the tranquil hours and yield thee to the peaceful sleep of death but i charge thee never divulge to any of thy kindred what further i relate when the hour of thy dissolution comes upon thee enjoin thy son in vows that with thy armor this gem may hang within the mansion of du monte there it shall hang for ages till one of thy good race whom heaven appoints to give rest unto my ashes shall reassume it and with it all its virtues  the agitation still increased within the bosom of astianax he scarce appeared to breathe for wonder the shepherd went on lament not for me said the hermit it is alone the flesh which sleeps for i shall change this nature into spirit that i may for seven ages yet to come become the guardian of my friends until these bones shall lie with my forefathers in the tomb my soul shall be a wanderer in the middle regions thence i shall pass a mediating spirit into the presence of the divinity presenting the petitions of thy posterity on earth before his everlasting throne in that period of time when my ashes shall rest in the sepulcher of the du montes thy issue norban will again reassume their ducal title and possess the large demains which norman william granted to our ancestor as a reward for his illustrious virtues depart he cried and leave me to my prayer indulge this last embrace  a brothers kiss  adieu  norban with the herdsmen retired and left the cell instantly the mountain shook as if the world was falling into ruin in the strange convulsion the rocks with mighty sounds were torn asunder bursting waters loosened from their subterraneous prisons tumbling rocks and peals of thunder in the bowels of the earth made a tremendous uproar the cell was closed and from the cliffs above a headlong torrent rushed in whose waters the sun beams struck and showed a blaze of light like that protecting sword which shone at edens gate to guard the sacred pass  norban with the spectators fled in astonishment astianax in silence listened to the latest accents which for some time seemed to sound upon his wondering ear his attitude was motionless until the shepherd in compassion to his malady lent him his arm and roused him from his depth of thought with clasping hands and eyes uplifted he repeats till one of thy good race whom heaven appoints to give rest unto my ashes shall reassume it and with it all its virtues  most wonderful and most mysterious sentences grant unto me almighty lord of heaven who see all the secrets of futurity the understanding of these dark presages make me the minister of this great work and guide me on to bless the spirit of du monte  the good old shepherd smiled and his two sons laughed out aloud at these his strange extravagancies astianax was not moved at their improprieties  grant unto me he cries with an increasing fervor grant unto me o god the virtuous labor of giving rest unto the bones of paul du monte within the tomb of his forefathers conscious i am of the imperfection of human judgment men are blind in their distinctions between good and evil the wretchedness which i endured thy providence ordained for good that thence i might be brought into this pious office and all those evils which betided me were only means of this thy work destined for me from seven long ages past as my present duty was concealed in time elapsed so are the means accomplishing these prophesies unveiled from comprehension but my breast feels all thy holy inspiration which pours upon my spirit confidence and intrepidity and with me is thy mighty arm before whose power nothing remains impossible  he raised himself and on his opened bosom hung the onyx blazing forth a luster equal to the midnight moon when passing clouds give forth her silver rays on the still ocean as she rolls her chariot wheels over her meridian amazement struck the cottagers they were ashamed of their arrogance and turned away their face astianax consoled them his wild appearance carried the impressions they had entertained no wonder the idea of such malady had possessed their minds at his being seen amidst the wildest wastes of britain where none but shepherds had for ages past been known to visit but now they looked upon the stranger as a man of god led forth by providences secret hand on embassy miraculous  soon as it was morning astianax with the two young shepherds proceeded to the hills the country seemed to have changed its aspect the young men wandered on bewildered terror came upon them and they fled astianax all the day persevered in his journey up the steeps led by a winding way which seemed to have been worn by passing goats at length fatigued he sat down beneath the covert of a solitary yew which hung from off the brink of rocks yet unessayd and night approaching there he slept and as he slept his mind was touched with images far distant from the thoughts which had employed the day his friend the slaughtered grinvil seemed to pass before him arrayed for battle laurels wreathed a verdant shade over his casque and on his sword the image of victory stood graven the field was gay with spring and over the flowers his steed on bounding pasterns seemed to tread as light as air and sporting with the bit submitted playfully to his restraint the dreamers fluttering heart received the accents uttered by the shade did astianax but live did the brave man but know that grinvil is on earth and heard him call him to the field of glory how would his bounding soul leap from the fetters of despair and wretchedness and glow with the ardour of reviving virtue brighter blazing as the meteor adds to its luster by the darkness of the night from whence it bursts into existence then would i restore him to these worthy friends and save a suicide they follow me the vision seemed to keep silence when there succeeded dressed in bridal robes a fair one led reluctant on whose downcast countenance was hidden from the dreamers eye at distance stood the wedding couch crowded with attendants and overspread with roses the crimson curtain was supported by laughing cupids and the blushing graces played with the bridal girdle as the bride approached the bed with tearfilld eyes she cast up looks of anguish to the skies and lifted her resolute arm to plunge a dagger in her bosom crying out i never cease to love thee my astianax but ere the blow was struck there rushed upon her a young stripling calling himself her son and showed the dreamer that it was his jessalind  in a tumult of distress and joy trembling yet fevered the astonished wanderer awaked when all was past away and the uprising sun chid his dilatory steps and gave him back the prospect of rude mountains horrid wastes and piles of rocks such as old chaos formed in sportive mood as monuments of his dreary empire his amazement increased when he beheld the face of nature changed and like his dream the wondrous work of causes supernatural presenting to him images fantastical and wild the hill was rent and opened to his eye a winding passage through stupendous rocks which seemed to prop the azure arch of heaven as he passed on within some little distance a crystal rill poured its divided streams from high and trilld from cliff to cliff around a gaping cavern which opened its dreary bosom to the view led by an impulse irresistible astianax with virtuous fortitude approached the onyx shed propitious beams conducting him through narrow passes to a spacious cell whose ample roof incrusted with variety of minerals reflected to his eye the blaze of gems innumerable  at a table formed of porphyry cut from the solid mass whereon it stood there sat in meditative posture the figure of a man as if preserved by spices and embalming his long and spreading beard and graceful locks which hung upon his neck were white and shone as silver as struck by the faint beams of day which entered some apertures in the roof a shaggy mantle the skin of a wild roe clothed his shoulders and his jacket was encircled with a leathern girdle as he reclined his head upon his hand one elbow rested on the table before him lay a book an extinguished lamp and rosary around the cell instruments for astronomy were scattered in a niche formed in the wall by nature studded and embossed with spar and spangles representing amethysts an empty urn was placed inscribed the dust of paul du monte  as astianax approached the luster of the onyx seemed to blaze upon the effigy and every limb was agitated a livid lambent flame surrounded all his image and darted on his eye like light refracted on the emerald a voice as one that spoke aloft in air called on astianax the voice the apparition renewed to him the remembrance of the hermit in the wood kneeling he replied thou hallowed spirit of my ancestor for such thou surely art here am i conducted by the hand of providence i come to serve thy will and see the wonderful accomplishment of thy presagings the vision raised his head and with extended arm seemed to demand attention when a voice was heard to say here thou shall remain to serve thy god in prayer and meditation until the time shall be accomplished which has been written in the book of fate to delight thy solitary hours peruse this book it will enrich thy mind with science and from science true religion is derived for as thou advancest in philosophy the growing ideas will enlarge thy knowledge of the deity as his wondrous works and attributes are revealed to thy understanding on the day in which thou shall attain the last of these few folios on that day the will of heaven shall lead thee hence when thou departest carry forth my ashes and let them rest amidst my ancestors  as the last sounds expired the apparition quivered in each limb and as it sunk astianax snatched off his cloak and spreading it to catch the sacred form received it as it wasted in a shower of dust with pious care he lodged the hallowed remains within the urn after replacing which bending on one knee thus he poured forth his prayer holy spirit of du monte thy prophetic knowledge hitherto foretold these wonderful events perceiving through the course of centuries unborn this pilgrimage of mine if thou art not enthroned in the realms of heaven and far abstracted from all cares for thy posterity art reigning in the ineffable beatitudes which await thy virtue but as thou foretoldest art a mediating spirit presenting to the throne of mercy mens petitions o bend thy gracious care toward my jessalind may some benign spirit save her and the issue of our love and when thy holy self shall pay the adoration undefiled which spirits only know before the throne of the divinity let thy mediating intercessions breathe in heaven for these thy kindred oh may she be sustained with some spiritual consolation to reconcile her soul effacing from her memory the injuries her rash lord has done her virtue and may she conceive that all the dire events she has endured were works conducing unto good good not revealed yet ordained in heaven and may her bosom entertain a confidence her astianax survives  he ceased and around the grot innumerable voices in strains seraphic sung an hallelujah the enraptured soul of astianax amidst the melody seemed to depart from its imprisonment and quit its mortal senses tasting of transports far surpassing what in human being she had hitherto experienced in a little time he became habituated to his cell not far distant ran the rill which filled his daily cup the cliffs afforded berrybearing shrubs and nuts the shepherds brought him milk of goats and facing the sun some little fertile plots he filled with herbs the pleasing pages of the book of science occupied the hours which were spared from his other avocations and thus he passed a life of fair tranquillity the evening led him to his peaceful couch where fleep was uninterrupted with images arising from distempered nerves and with the dawn he wakes  the prophecy being by tradition handed down amongst the shepherds the coming of astianax was soon made known the strange event brought the astonished people to the cell to pay him homage as a man divine and offer gifts their pious hands strewed his couch with skins of goats and clothed him with garments such as their humble life afforded to them astianax incessantly was teaching moral duties and to their maladies applied the salutary simples which he cultivated thus imitating the excellencies of his predecessor and emulating all his virtues and hence inspiring the minds of his attendants with reverence and love the sons of the hospitable shepherd in the vale from frequent intercourse experiencing the virtues of his soul as a saint esteemed him depending on their fidelity and recollecting the vision which preceded his approach to this his hermitage and which he apprehended was designed to touch his mind with resignation and consolatory hopes presaging better fate he often wished to send the young men forth to gain intelligence whether his jessalind was yet alive and what betided the possessions of du monte but ever as the wish grew anxious the luster of the onyx languished and weepd with blood the dire appearance was succeeded by contrition for his transgression of the maxims of his hallowed ancestor and all the images which hope or expectation painted on his mind quickly were effaced and his disturbed spirit left the ideas of the world he wished for and from prayer regained his lost serenity  already were fourteen years elapsed in this abode the book of wisdom yet remained unfinished and the latest page of knowledge was far distant  one morning after his usual adoration the same harmonious voices which saluted astianax upon his arrival with the melody of heaven sung a te deum and from the sacred urn there blazed a livid flame which shed the sweet perfume of eastern spices when consumed in incense the gems around the urn reflect the rays which glowed with beauties like the train of iris when she arises with a rosy toe upon the mountains top and rides upon the summer shower the book of knowledge turned as leaves tossed by the breeze and showed this last most sacred sentence the essence of all human wisdom is religion in prosperity it guides the giddy spirits to the paths of rectitude and in adversity it blesses us with confidence in god  astianax perused the lines no sooner were they read than the book closed and to the table became firmly united part of the very adamant itself as he sat his eyes were cast upon the ground in meditation on the wonders to which he had been witness from whence he was roused by the voice of one who called him by his name as he looked up behold there stood before him the apparition of his murdered friend of grinvil guilt filled his breast with horror in his astonishment he let go the maxims of the book of knowledge and cried out am i then summoned with thee to pass before the judgementseat will not my contrition expiate are my prayers unheard and shall not my soul find mercy  he was interrupted by the wellknown voice of grinvil assuring him his prayers were heard that he yet living and recovered of his wound sought for astianax in this solitude to restore him to the world astianaxs amazement was increased he scarce believed his senses after a few moments recovering himself he arose to embrace his friend grinvil being seated thus related his story  a few days being over after my removal from the bath my wounds showed symptoms flattering with hopes of a recovery but as they yet were dangerous i was not suffered to bestir myself i improved daily till at length my skilful surgeon gave permission to return to my own house from whence i sent to make enquiry after astianax after jessalind after lord melvil no intelligence could be gained of you it was believed you died a suicide and all enquiry ceased lord melvil urged to the pursuit of you the fugitive by father peter armed a few domestics and ranged the forests and the heath as if he quested wolves they were benighted and seeking shelter under the cliffs which stand upon the crown of mount avaro   of mount avaro cried astianax there was i that was my hiding place there i sustained a dreadful storm there the avenging elements seemed to pursue the miscreant   seeking shelter in that place continues grinvil lord melvil with two more the chiefs of his domestics died branded by lightning   astianax could not forbear to cry aloud lifting his hands and eyes to heaven how arrogantly blind is sinful man presuming judgment in the darkest of his ignorance surrounded with the terrors of the storm i deemed myself the mark for the enraged bolts the wretch whom justice followed armed with the brands of heaven i thought myself adjudged to misery when behold the very things which i called wretchedness were given me for blessings had morning arose upon us i had fallen by the hands of melvil but preordained for mighty works here in this mountain the will of heaven was not to be confounded   grinvil went on lord melvils retinue dispersed terrified and amazed fled homewards and left the bodies to the tempest geofrey the son and heir of melvil took possession of his seigniories geofrey a youth of high deportment and a haughty spirit contemning the bigotry and insolence of churchmen refused to seal the grant of astianaxs escheated lands to the benedictine monastery in pursuance of the superstitious folly of his father polidore whose treachery was publicly suspected he who occasioned all these dire calamities to your ancient house it was he that named the hour and place for me to meet him on the fatal day on a pretended urgency of business i was a stranger to the time when the virtuous jessalind usually resorted thither the plot was wound up with a soldiers resolution and the subtlety of priests  you know the rest   astianax weepd with grinvil   but as to polidore continues grinvil he wretched man was soon no more possessed of father peters secrets the minister of an abortive plot the holy father remaining in the power of one whose principles were well known to him and in whose character at large he could only place the momentary confidence for an assassin he died the death  in the holy wafer it was administered  he departed from the altar full of health and ere it was midnight he gave up the ghost receiving of the sacrament in him was sacrilege by the vengeance of an offended deity or by poison he was slain   but what of jessalind cries astianax   of her returns grinvil i only heard that retiring to the convent where lucia was lady abbess in a little time meeting with some disgust she retired into normandy where she is living with her father but whether there is issue of your love is yet unknown to me my coming here continues he may seem miraculous i apprehended that if you could escape you would have fled to normandy but the monastic in lord melvils name had gained immediate power to search the ports and passengers thence all probability of that attempt was void fruitless enquiries for many years induced me to believe that thou were dead when by accident as we were hawking in the melshaw downs i overtook a shepherd and his flock proceeding southward i asked his way and whence he came and finding that of late he journeyed from the mountains in a part of britain where i had never been curiosity prompted my enquiries amongst a multitude of stories such ignorant men relate of wonders which they have heard i was struck with his description of pengerard and this hermitage but much astonished when i heard him relate a wonderful prophecy which an hermit paul du monte some centuries ago published to the peasants and when he told me these dark sayings were verified and that the promised one was come my soul presaged that hither you had bent your way and taken your abode thence i determined to visit the place my anxiety grew every hour upon me and i was restless day and night until i set forward on my journey   and you dear friend replies astianax bear a great part in the accomplishment of that ancient prophecy   grinvil interrupted him crying now haste my friend and quit this gloomy cell the field of honor calls thee to arms for even now the young lord melvil with his uncles the lords selbourn and henricks and a mighty band of great confederates have taken arms against our sovereign and march their rebel troops toward the royal residence this is the season for thee at once to show thy loyalty and valor and claim thy usurped inheritance some chosen troops arrive from normandy perhaps with them comes alfred jessalinds father to redress the injuries of his family my attendants wait my coming about ten miles full west and with them some spare steeds well trained to arms haste to reassume thy honors   the dream now stood revived upon astianaxs memory and hope inspired the pleasing images of jessalinds return were it not for the pious duty cries astianax which i owe to the sacred memory of paul du monte and to these his hallowed ashes i would instantly accompany my friend toward the field of honor but the angelic voice of him departed left me this indispensable injunction when thou goes hence carry forth my dust and let it rest amidst my ancestors first permit me to fulfill his last request committed to me from the regions of spirits   grinvil was silent   after some little preparations they left the hermitage astianax in his arms bearing the urn thus journeying until they reached the retinue which waited grinvils return as they passed on toward night they gained a village astianax retired to the church and on the altar placed the sacred urn then prostrate he poured forth his thanksgiving to that bounteous providence which had preserved him thus miraculously from hence he retired leaving the ashes of paul du monte till morning  early as day break astianax again approached the altar with reverence he laid his hands upon the urn to bear it on his journey but it was sixd immovable amidst his astonishment he heard a voice commanding him to leave the ashes there at rest till peace was in the land with pious resignation he obeyed and retiring informed his friend that he was now at liberty to accompany him to the seat of war he quitted the hermits garb and from his beard which reached his girdle formed his countenance into the modern cut furnished with a suit of armor he assumed the lance and strode the managed steed as they journeyd on they approached the territories of lord albon this lord had called to arms his vassals and his knights and was preparing his march to join the royal standard it was now evening and astianax with his friend had formed their little camp upon the brow of an easy eminence where they overlooked the vale they determined to join their forces in the morning and to that end sent a messenger to greet lord albon and inform him of their arrival as astianax sat in the door of his tent meditating on the bounties of heaven and enjoying the delightful prospect with the freshness of the evening thus he expressed himself to his friend  whilst we attend to the works of nature we receive innumerable testimonies of the benevolence of that great existence whose eye superintends and whose breath pervades the universe every landscape is the manifestation of the presence of its allpowerful author every individual object in this scene bears inexpressible beauties which exceed human imagination leading us at once to astonishment and adoration see how the velvetverdant carpet which overspreads the lawn is embroidered with flowers and fringed with shrubs irregularly scattered round the autumn dresses yonder woods in a variety of colors the foliage of the shadowy sycamore is gilded the oak puts on his russet the holly half conceals her ripened berries with her evergreen the trembling poplar mixes its silvery hue amidst the dusky elms and here and there through the thick grove the whiteskind birch seems to conceal its nakedness amidst the windings of the woods the river shows its shining lakes where the glad spirit of the streams laughs at the dancing myriads of the sun beams their fleecy multitudes whiten the extended pasture browsing around the hillocks and with their bleating wake solitary echo from her silvan grot all intermixed the lazy oxen stand sullenly and recollect the flowery feast whilst the gay fantastic colts play round their dams vaulting in airy sport and to their airy sport the dams cast looks askance and neigh maternal cautions to their frantic rounds on this hand golden furrows gladden the ascent and load the reapers arms with wealthy sheafs the yellow hills stretch out the distant view to yonder heathy mountains where barrenness sits sullenly and frowns on sloth and whilst she eyes her haggard bosom furrowed over by storms with extended arms she grasps the cumberous clouds to veil her desolation wilder the aspect on the other hand which terminates the prospect the vale extends itself to such a distance that tinged with azure hue it seems to mix with heaven the nearer objects are oertopd in gay perspective with objects still behind hamlets and rills and cottages delightfully dispersed and mingled with the various teints of trees and streams of pastures corn and fallow the church spire thrusts its head above the smoke which clouds the town and there the solemn ruins of a castle nod upon the cliff and precipice and tremble over the brook below whose frighted nereides hide them in the reeds which wave along the marsh oh thou most splendid object thou descending orb of light how wonderful how delighting from thy abounding glory are shed forth the golden streams which paint the western heavens to thy blazing chariot wheel gay vegetation ever young and fair fertility with joys prolific wait now the slant ray overstretches all the valley and there behind the hill the beams shoot up aloft and skirt the pale gray and the crimson clouds with rich embroidery but whilst we contemplate the beauties of the scene behold far east the horizon stands crowded with ascending vapors and thou dayimparting constellation hastenest thy career and drives the rosyfooted hours beneath the mountains as objects are withdrawing from our view another sense finds pleasure the bleating of the sheep the voice of cattle trudging down the plain and mourning for the pail salute my ear the song of yonder blackbird perched upon the thorn the calling notes of every tenant of the spray the cooing of the doves that lodge in dusky pines the rustling gales which wanton with the aspine leaves the ivycoverd sage who whoots his trembling prayer to deities of darkness the deep tond cadence of the distant waterfall the voice of busy men who bear the harvest home the clangour of the smiths laborious hammer from his hovel the dashing of the streams which turn yon mill the barking of the cottage cur who waits impatiently the long protracted steps of his dear peasant master with the solemn sound of curfew bell which dies along the dale as thus united or intermixed afford delightful harmony through all thy glorious works almighty lord the enraptured spirit of the human mind wanders forth and full of wonder full of praise dwells on each object till in itself enlarged with the pure flame of adoration through unbounded space it bends inspired imagination and presents itself prostrate at thy throne full of humiliation reverence and gratitude paying to thy divine existence that worship which human language never can express  grinvil now invites his friend to share a slight repast and sweet repose concludes the night the dayspring calls them to their march and ere it is noon they reach the territories of lord albon a trumpeter salutes the stranger allies they draw near the castle a massy pile of building thrown together by various architects all irregular and confused towers jostle towers and battlement rides on battlement a dark unhallowed aspect hangs upon it time had dressed the walls in sable and gasping loops and yawning grates beset the horrid front and strike it with the characters of savage times of power uncivilized of slavery and arbitrary rule here the open gallery conducts to each rude tower whose walls stand garrisoned with men of stone to mock the siege as the strangers approach the gate the pavement sounds beneath the horses hoofs and hollow arches multiply the noise they cross the drawbridge of the ditch and to the trumpets summons the iron studded gates roll rumbling on the massive hinge and the portcullis in its passage harshly grates as the watchmen heave it up from a multitude of sluices waters rush and fill the muddy ditch on the outward wall men buckled up in steel bearing various arms spears bills and battle axes stand arraigned and archers throng each turret the noise of busy workmen with shrill clangour fitting harness armor and arms is heard on every side lord albons extensive seigniories command seven hundred knights with their esquires and retinue together with twelve hundred villains valient men renowned in arms which composed the garrison these were the guests he entertained an herald conducted the strangers to lord albon where with his knights he sat in council  the spacious hall received the concourse most commodiously situate within the inner court and sheltered from an enemy it wore a different aspect to the outworks the ascent was by an open stair where ten might move abreast the walls within were hung with tapestry where the historian told the achievements of his lordships ancestors the windows admitted shadowy day shining through painted glass where shields and familycoat armor were blazoned the painted rafters were sustained by gilded effigies of hercules bending his bearing neck in the gallery stood musicians on the strangers approach sounding the salute lord albon sat and on each side a rank of knights armed cap a pe behind each of whom stood an esquire bearing the shield stained or engraven with the several devices of their proper arms between the ranks grinvil and astianax moved on their retinue halting at the foot these ranks form a gloomy avenue of armor an arrangement of steel statues and burnished images as the strangers pass the lances were bent down by each saluting knight the agitated plumes tossed on each helmets brow and from the moving joints of every gauntlet and each coat of mail a harsh and horrid din reechoed in the hall they approach lord albon whose noble figure struck each stranger with respectfulness his armor polished and black as adamant was flowered and figured with inlaid gold his cuirass like the scales of dragons shone with burnished silver and round his collar and on every joint the studs were diamonds on his helmet plumes of scarlet waved and at his thigh a scimitar suspended in a belt of gold embroidery blazed with precious stones he graciously received the visiters retained them with their retinue in his corpse and sat them one on each hand to attend in council from his uplifted beaver lord albon showed a benevolent countenance and from his dark gray eyes shot forth intelligence the news brought by the scouts and spies related that the royal army was moving toward the rebels which showed that the battle was not far off after a farewell repast it was resolved to march and join the royal standard the ample board was spread the seats were placed along the hall and every officious squire unbraced the buckler and removed the helmet with a din of arms tumultuous and confused as the sound of hail when in a hasty storm it falls upon the leafy forest and now each heros countenance revealed with gracious smiles they greet the strangers the table was encumbered with the mess with every dainty of this luxurious land the dishes swelled the forest and the chase poured forth their stores the pasture and the streams their stock the service was in silver and a thousand dishes stood smoking with the rich repast the sun beams glazed upon the arms and danced upon the splendid feast which far outshone the pomp of ancient rome with officious care the board was cleared by multitudes of well taught slaves and straight in porcelain were placed fruits pastry and variety of sweet meats served to the guests with knives and spoons of solid gold the musicians filled the air with martial melody and from the flowing cup the sparkling wines were quaffed after the feast was ended they prepare for march and in some days they join the royal army within sight the rebels lay encamped upon an eminence so near that from the outposts the passing of the watch was heard the neighing of the steeds and one confused murmuring of the voice of busy troops mixed with the clang of arms the king commanded in person and to the royal tent the allies being introduced were stationed in the right wing of the army no norman troops were in the field detained by adverse winds they had not disembarked orders were issued for the next days attack and all the troops were under arms a spacious plain laid extended between the armies hemmed in by hills upon the left and to the right a deep morass each with ditches and high mounds of earth lay in their camp entrenched the mind of brave astianax an utter stranger to emotions of fear employed itself in thoughts divine humane compassion for his fellow creatures moved his soul he viewed with anxious eye the long extended camp stretching its storm bleachd canvass over the hill how many worthy men whose hearts beat ardently for honor ere tomorrows sun shall set will sleep in death how many valiant spirits through a wreck of wounds will pour themselves into eternity how many widowed eyes must weep how many orphans groan beneath adversity oh cursed ambition first introduced by satan to the souls of men a simple womans passion a passion with which simple woman first contaminated seduced man a foolish name for avarice unlawful wish for other mens fair honors and possessions essence of lucifer the contrariety of heaven whose hand writes on the world universal benevolence what crimes are infolded in thy girdle what wretchedness is enclosed in thy grasp the circling zodiac the belt of heaven is scarce thy boundary oh ambition in thy illegitimacy fostered by rebellion whither do thou stretch thy raven wing and bend thy boding flight on whose raven wing not one white plume or one fictitious mark of justice shines but all is sable as the curtain which conceals the damned what havoc shall stalk forth amongst mankind what horrid slaughter stain thy sullen crest ere once the sun shall circle us and over the book of fate the sorrowing seraph who enrolls the day will dip his pen in blood in massacre in wrong in spoil in desolation but providence permits these errors of mankind and perhaps permits them in compassion to the dying for man in this estate is on a pilgrimage from birth to death must pass the ills of life to purge him from those defilements of sin original sin of the spirit in its primeval state as the ore is cast into the furnace and reduced to litharge ere the refiner pours it forth in burnished gold we with mere mortal sense view the events of life through mediums deceitful we call the horrors of pestilence and the havoc of the war as scourges that are wielded in the hand of some avenging angel  perhaps we err  perhaps they are the mode of clemency profuse a clemency which calls in thousands of men from out their misery giving short date to their calamities and leading them into a realm of joy  good lord thy will be done  early as the dawn the royal army takes the field and heralds pass to call the foe to battle the rebels waiting for a tardy reinforcement loiter in their entrenchments till braved by the left wing who seize the outward works and shower their arrows on the foe impatient in their restraint receiving unretaliated wounds they leap the trench lord melvil with the confederate chiefs perceive their rashness and compelled with their main army to sustain them the battle becomes general astianax with grinvil fought side by side astianaxs armor turned aside the javelin and arrow and the proved falchion made no impression on his coat of mail grinvil did wonders his charge was rapid as the lightning and thought itself could not outstrip his guard at length his javelin was shivered in the assault and to his trusty sword he yielded all his valor long he fought and vanquished every oppressing foe but fate had wrote his doom and he received an arrow through the plaits of his cuirass a slant way shot which pierced him underneath the arm and rendered his sword no longer serviceable he was compelled to retreat and meeting astianax who slaughtered like a pestilence and cut his passage through the ranks wherever he assaulted he seeing his friend was wounded forebore the havoc and retired to guard him to some safer spot where the surgeons might withdraw the barb and dress the wound his friendly office once accomplished astianax flew back to join the battle providence ordained that he should fill the most momentuous instant the king from his rash ardour rushing too far became encircled by a troop of choicest foes sustained only by a few who overpowered were falling round him had already thought himself a prisoner when to the victorious phalanx astianax pushed on his steed he fretted on the bit and snuffd the air impatiently as conscious of the glory he should win the crucifix upon astianaxs bosom blazed like a passing comet and bedimd the gazers eye destruction rode on every side and gave him passage the royal arm the rebel hand had that instant rested that instant to astianaxs falchion fell the sacrilegious hand and scorned the miserable wretch who had abused its valor courage revived within the rallying guard in the right wing the cry of victory resounded the center pushes on and joins the king the rebels from despair now fought with madness  astianax was foremost in the field for deeds of valor one competitor alone fought for the king and almost equaled the hero in his claim for glory mounted on a dappled roan a gallant steed that tossed his silver main aloft in air a young man braved the greatest terrors of the war the red teints on his horses glossy skin seemed like a shower of blood a crimson plume covered his helmet and crimson ribbons bound his armor amidst the carnage of his sword he was known only by the name of the bloody knight wherever the foes rushed on and gained upon the royal troops there he attacked and when the fury of the despairing rebels made the battle the most sanguine then amidst the ranks he forced his way and meeting with lord melvil braved him to engage unhorsd him and amidst his amazed vassals severed his head from off his body and bore it by the hair aloft to view the spectacle dismayed the rebel troops  they fled  whilst he approached the king and made the offering which ensured the peace the rout was general  the king sent forth an herald through his army commanding the two valiant strangers to attend him in his tent the bloody knight obeyed the summons but astianax had left the field to visit his friend grinvil was still alive but languishd in his wound which then portended inevitable death he received astianax and heard his description of the battle with a smile amidst the circumstances of the fight the bloody knight engaged astianaxs wonder and applause he dwelt upon his valor with a partial pleasure but cries he what most astonishes is the device he wore upon his shield he bare a lion argent on a bloody field supported on a rising golden sun the coat of the du montes  grinvil interrupts could this be a son of thine my friend oh flattering thought replies astianax but empty and delusive had he been my son he would have quartered alfreds arms that strange device a savage tearing up a pine but now my friend says astianax let me conduct you to the neighboring town where you may rest commodiously and have the ablest surgeons in the army to attend your wound from thence i will immediately repair to execute the will of paul du monte and when the pious office is accomplished i will approach the king and seek as a reward the restitution of my lands  before astianax departed from his friend grinvil apprehensive of the approach of death thus addressed him oh astianax my friend my kinsman if thou feel affection for me remember my dear livia my sister the fates decree a period to thy sorrows the happy days approach in which thy toils and sufferings will end then think of me to thy care i give the beauteous maid she will inherit all my possessions and with that sufficiency will display the bright the illustrious excellencies of her soul for she has virtues which surpass most of her sex then astianax  he paused   what would my friend require of me cries astianax   if thou have a son o let her asylum be thy regard   after these words the friends both remained silent astianax relieved the anxious moment of deep thought and clasping his friends hand assured him of his protection of the fair livia whatever be my fate adds he she shall be as a daughter to me   grinvil returned his friendship with tears and on his hand imprinted kisses alas the last imprinted kisses of his life these faithful friends embraced and bid adieu  astianax hasted to the village where the sacred ashes of his ancestor were rested the king after publishing a general pardon to the rebels who came in and swore allegiance dispersed his army and removed his court to york  lord morton who was a favorite with the king was of a soul benevolent as exalted with science he rejoiced in rewarding virtue wheresoever he discovered it the valor of the bloody knight had fired his mind with admiration and esteem he sent to invite him to his tent and with a courteousness peculiar to his character engaged the heroic youth with his attendants to his castle from whence after a few days repose he promised to conduct him to court there to receive the royal bounty promised by his majesty after the victory  lord morton was desirous of knowing the quality of this stranger in order that he might council him what was the fittest request to offer to the throne as his majesty had left him to his option in what manner he should honor him  thus he related the circumstances of his life  i am of normandy the grandson of alfred a man of ancient family by my fathers side i am a lineal descendant of the duke of belfort whose honors and domains were granted by the norman william for his valiant services in a succeeding reign lord alexander giving displeasure to the king in not coinciding in some pernicious measures was betrayed by a servile minister to gratify the royal resentment was impeached and with his head lost the vast territories and the title of his ancestors lord alexander had a younger brother who possessed an ample fortune and was owner of an estate and mansion which from his family name was called du monte this estate descended to my father but from the malevolence and avarice of a crafty priest the principal of the benedictine monastery and from his own youthful impetuosity he entertained a groundless jealousy against my mother and seeking revenge for his mistaken wrongs he slew his kinsman grinvil a man of spotless fame and with my mother innocent of the alleged crime lord melvil having the seigniory seized the lands my father fled and died an obscure death my mother then pregnant with me retired into a convent where a relation was the abbess my fathers estates were to be granted by lord melvil to the monastery of st benedict in consequence of a vow extorted from the terrors of his troubled conscience the principal of the monastery had concerted the horrid plot all the treachery flowed from him and lord melvils bigotry was to have rewarded the crime as providence directed the grant remained unsealed when a sudden death took off lord melvil the disappointment drove the monk to madness for many years a raving horror harrowed up his soul and in his malady the most distracting desperation wore down his carcass to the grave my mother overwhelmed with her distresses would have remained amongst the nuns had not my approaching birth obliged her to retire into the arms of alfred soon after her arrival in normandy i was born i was named leo du monte from my infancy my constant residence has been with my grandfather till the rumor of this insurrection induced me to take up arms and seek for honor under the british standard my mother would attend me determining if i should fall in battle that she would retire into a convent adverse winds separated the little fleet in which we sailed with some few norman troops my mother with her attendants were drove back whilst the bark in which i sailed fortunately made land the hand of heaven sustained me in the battle and from the royal bounty with lord mortons influence i doubt not but i shall regain the possessions of my father but be that as it proves i think myself fortunate that justice wielded my sword and young lord melvil fell beneath my arm  lord morton found himself greatly interested in the young champions history and during the relation his regard for virtue moved his resolves at length they prepare to attend the court lord morton introduced the valiant leo having related to the king in his closet the heros history the essential services he had rendered the state together with the intercessions of lord morton for whose great power and good offices he was not to depart the throne dissatisfied induced the king of his royal munificence to restore to leo du monte the possessions of his ancestors and the title of the duke of belfort  whilst these transactions were passing astianax having reached the church where the hallowed dust of paul du monte was deposited on his knees before the altar he reassumed his pious duty and in slow journeyings bearing the urn he bent his way over the heights the nearest passage to the mansion of du monte  grinvils wound beyond the power of surgery proved mortal and he slept with his ancestors  astianax in his way passing over mountains deserts and dreary wilds one day toward evening found himself embarrassed by a hasty river which showed no tokens of its being passable until the flood subsided which had swelled the stream he stood upon the banks for some time irresolute whether to pursue the current the noise of waterfalls struck his ear he followed the sound and entered into a bay formed by nature of stupendous rocks the night drew on in this secure recess he determined to remain till morning his servants pitched their tents upon the hill the novelty of the scene afforded him delight the high cliffs under which he sat were porphyry the apertures every where were grown with shrubs and on the brow rude oaks extend their old misshapen arms over the bay and formed a lofty shade the continued rocks enclose a spacious amphitheatre in some parts standing erect like massive pillars in others shaken and irregular as rude as native chaos tremendously suspended over their base and threatening instantaneous wreck here and there the sable yews cling on the cliffs and over the precipice the trunks of stormtorn trees hang woven round with ivy whose fantastic branches play pendulant on every gale in the center of this rocky circle stands divided from the rest a mighty pile bearing the image of some fortress on either side of which a foaming torrent the whole rivers flood falls down precipitate an hundred fathom the sounding waters eddy in the deep and dismal gulf below where hemmed by many a rugged rock the giddy streams lash foam and twist and bustle on their voyage the ear astonished admits no other sound but the uproar of the impetuous water god who bellowed in the lake his hasty laws to the astonished streams so vulcans voice resounded in the noisy forges of the cyclops  as night advances forth from the chambers of the east the moon ascends and silvers the light vapor and now surmounting every shade rufulgent rides the azure firmament in her fair aspect meekness seems to reign in regions of tranquillity so conscious virtue smiles within a soul serene her countenance like fair content diffuses peace and her pale rays as moderation shining clear but cool no ruffling winds range through the heavy air but all above is stillness all below is horrid tumult astianax here seated in his mind revolves the various changes of his life the darkness of futurity the obscure meaning of the prophecy the improbability of his restoration to the honors of his family at the time when the ashes of paul du monte should rest in the tomb of his ancestors  meditation formed this scene for her abode and in this season she delights to walk abroad under the pale beams of the midnight moon she fills the recollection with a crowd of subjects and leads a train of young ideas forth forming their progress from the charts of old experience her last result is confidence in heaven for when imaginations wandering visions have exhausted fancy the undetermined thought comes weary home and lodges in the haunts of hope refreshed by holy faith in providence whose paths mysterious lead to paths of peace  such ideas closed his waking thoughts  he slept  when there arose to his astonished fancy visions by supernatural creation presented to his entranced spirit  on high sat justice in her garb seraphic suspended on a pale gray cloud the rays which blazed on her celestial form glowed in the vapoury couch and skirted it with silver deep in the hollow of the dreary rock sat malice like a wolf enraged by hunger haunching at the chains which bind her to her cell with eyes which seemed to weep the purest crystal stood treachery transformed to stone and petrified with her own tears avarice stood opposite a haggard form extending withered arms and grasping at the air beneath their feet pale envy showed her sickly face and drew along her squalid form that lengthened out a crawling nauseous serpent deep in the horrid whirlpool rolled in torture superstition over whose head the cataract incessantly poured down its filthy torrent stained with the blood of martyrs and of massacres and polluted with the sins of ages whilst bending over the brink behold hypocrisy pregnant with monsters who in their birth torture and revile the agonizing demon in the lake the ministers of justice calling forth eternal night she spreads her shadowy wing to hide the vision from the eye of heaven and in oblivions sable mantle gathers them up  the morning wakes astianax with her rosy finger the sun surmounts the horizon these visions were esteemed in his interpretation as the revelation of his concluded sorrows as his former dream presaged the progress of his redemption from the dreary solitude of mount pengerard as down the channel he pursues his way from the cataract a shower of spray is driven round the bay on which the suns opposing rays with lights divisibility spreads a painted bow upon the waters which emulates the robe of iris when bearing tidings to the earth of gods benevolence she comes saluting the new born smiling spring with fertilizing showers through this lucid portico he passed and soon arrived in a cultivated country where open roads rendered his journey expeditious his labors drew toward their conclusion he reached the well known valley where stood the mansion of du monte alas how changed the benedictine monastery was laid in ashes and smoking ruins alone denote its situation being proved a nursery of the rebellion by royal mandate laid in destruction and its possessions confiscated the woods the groves the old patrician oaks which once had graced the mansion of his father and had enjoyed two centuries and more of far extended wealth and splendor were no more the fatal hand of desolation had laid low the long stretched avenue and one confused ruin marked the spot where once the dwelling stood save one wing alone which had sustained the shock of time and saved the gallery where once astianax was miraculously saved with tears he viewed the waste amongst the ruins he attempts his way at his approach the doors which had remained shut up for years as if shook by tempests spontaneously gave way he gains the gallery shrouded and concealed by dust and ruins the armor of his ancestor trembled thence there seemed to awake a slumbering pelican which sat supported on the casque and shook its snowy plumes then stretching forth its fair white wings as if preparing for her flight on either side the vast extended plumage reached displaying all her ample breast where every silver feather shone spotless and burnished as the seraphs heavenly buckler when he stands arrayed in the glowing arms of light with a mighty sound she took her way aloft and as she mounted to the realms of heaven a lucid train such as the sun beams shoot from out the evening cloud traced her passage to the skies  astianax gazing upon the vision breathed this short ejaculation blessed spirit of the mighty norban have the labors of astianax gained thy approbation have these accomplished toils procured thee peace is the hour at hand which shall restore thee to the regions of felicity  astianax summoned the ecclesiastics of the several adjoining houses to attend him to the church of saint paul their to rest the ashes of his ancestor the villagers a mighty concourse throng around in silent reverence through the separating ranks of priests astianax approached the vault in his arms bearing the urn behind him an attendant carried the arms of norban the heavy gates which closed the cell moved stiff the harsh sounds wind along the wide extended arches the repository of the ancient family of du montes was revealed to the spectators where for successive centuries heroes and sages slept the solemn scene struck every eye with reverence and holy awe around stood ranged the cells where the deceased lay deposited each closed with marble on which the name and character of every one interred stood graven above were placed the effigies and arms by time and damp clothed with a sable veil in mournful order pointing out the long successions of the spoil of death the last stands periander  with down cast eyes astianax passed on and in its proper cell deposited the remains of paul du monte and hung aloft the arms of norban then bending to the earth he cries aloud  ye sacred manes of my father ye spirits of my ancestors hallowed be ye in heaven if ye regard the affairs of your posterity accept this filial duty and in your prayers to the omnipotent for us and our successors intercede pray that we perceiving what is acceptable maydeviate no more pray that we may in all our days have present with our hearts each excellence and every virtue of our parents and for our emulation their examples let our memory of them be full of gratitude and full of love lively in our recollection may their tenderness and care for ever live and be our days one universal scene of filial affection and thou most mighty god whose bounties are equaled only by thine omnipotence on whose finger sits the stary zodiac as a ring and by whose mighty arm creation is suspended thee to adore is mans incessant duty thou great parent of the universe as our souls are warmed with gratitude and love to our terrestrial parents thence let our thoughts ascend to thee replete with holy reverence conscious of thine exalted goodness thy long sufferings and innumerable mercies extended unto all mankind and whilst we reviewing all thy divine munificence to man and measuring our own unworthiness by thy inestimable bounties may we adore thee a gracious being with purest piety and contrite hearts and when thou would that we should pray correct the blindness of our wishes with propriety and let our petitions become acceptable and may our supplications divested of all arrogance be answered with thy paternal love extend unto us lord the gift of grace sustain us in the hour of mortal woe and when this expiring frame shall sink to rest on the maternal lap of earth grant that through the propitiation of thy son we may become partakers in the enjoyment of that ineffable beatitude which awaits those whom thou approvest  then raising himself from off the earth he cries heavens will be done straight was heard celestial melody which filled the air the voices of a multitude of chaunters singing to the harp and pronouncing praised be thy name o lord for all thy mercies shown to man on earth of whom thou take such abundant care and unto angels designs to equal them  amidst the hallelujah and the chorus astianax lifted up his face and to the strain accompanied his voice forth from the urn a livid lambent flame arose which shot its quivering point aloft and filled the vault with fragrance on the breast of astianax the onyx spread a blaze of light such as surrounded the heavenly form of gabriel when sped to earth on errands of divine import to patriarchs of old  over the urn two cherubs with their lucid pinions hovered and catching the ascending flame wafted it to heaven whilst all above the choir of aereal voices with the sounds of many trumpets sung his requiem  at the opening of the vault there appeared a youth of noble port in rich apparel with a crowd of gay attendants silent and in astonishment he stood with projected figure and extended hands now gazing on astianax then on the urn devouring every sentence the vulgar all behind trembling at these miraculous events stood mute in reverence the youth never yet presumed to express his wish of knowing the cause of what he saw neither could he bear to look intent upon astianax who seemed of a celestial form  a minister of light  as astianax with the ecclesiastics departed the vault he observed a person entering the church attended by a mighty crowd of men in whose countenances sat festivity and joy the aereal melody as if suspended on the breeze gradually departed and the distant and decreasing sounds slowly died upon the ear  on nearer approach lord albon who led the jocund band recollected astianax to be the knight who had accompanied him to the war and astianax immediately knew his noble host they approach to salute each other the rays of the onyx confounded lord albon they were too radiant for his eye to gaze on he stopped  he thought he saw the spirit of his friend decked in angelic luster but astianax relieved his confusion and cries out my noble lord this meeting affords me infinite delight my pilgrimage is ended my vow is fulfiled behold i have borne the ashes of the hermit paul du monte to this their resting place and my lord the will of providence sends forth unhopd for circumstances to aid the completion of the prophecy hence departing i shall approach the throne and crave from royal bounty the restoration of my lost possessions to aid which purpose i beg your lordships interest and intercession  they salute the stranger youth the stranger youth returns the bow and was about to inquire in whose presence it was he stood but thus lord albon interrupts   and you my valiant knight says he to astianax from whose puissant sword such havoc fell such noble deeds of arms you came as sent by heaven on this illustrious day at once to finish all your pious labors and grace my nuptials for this day i shall espouse a captive taken after the battle of whom i grew enamoured i took her from a band of ruffians who guarded her and a train of impious ecclesiastics by whom she was accompanied bearing the shrine and relics of st benedict in supplications for their sovereigns overthrow she would conceal her real character and says that in the perils of the day as she advanced toward the field of battle to secure herself from a band of plundering rebels she sought refuge with the monks from the humor of the female mind which human wisdom never could decypher no other place must witness to our vows but this to female will contention is ridiculous as blows bent on the wind hither i conduct her to experience better fortune and partake of all my honors see as i speak she comes  at that instant a troop of ladies entered as they advanced astianax thought he recollected her who hand in hand came with the person dressed in bridal robes a young maid of excellent beauty as nearer they approach he perceived she was the fair livia the sister of his departed friend the dying petition of grinvil renewed upon his memory he recollected that unsearchable are the secret paths through which providence brings on the decrees of heaven and he already apprehended it was the will of fates that he should make this maid his wife  the procession now approaches to the altar before them virgins scattered flowers and in the train soft voices sung the bridal song attuned to the lute the bride with downcast eyes appeared abashed and shedding tears endeavored to conceal her disconcerted looks nor raised one glance toward her lord who stood exulting in the happy moment and in whose breast the rapid tides of joy beat to his bounding heart  the officiating priest advanced  the bride with collected resolution at length looks up her looks struck on astianax the luster of whose amulet had reached her eye she started stretched her arms to catch assistance shrieked and fell and as she fell from her fair hand there dropped a dagger which she had concealed to prevent the odious espousal odious as contrary to inclination  the congregation were filled with astonishment lord albon trembled all but astianax and the young stranger were struck with horror they as being actuated by one mind at the same instant rushed forward and stretching forth their arms sustained her in her swoon kneeling they raised her returning spirits opened her quivering eyes the young stranger with astianaxs voice uniting mixed the varied exclamation of o save my mother oh save my jessalind my wife  at these words her alarmed spirits brought back her agitated senses she looks on one and then upon the other the silence of an instant is interrupted by her voice repeating my husband and my son my astianax and my leo are we in the regions of death or are we still on earth astonishment yet an astonishment of heavenly import  lord albon thought himself abused and called to his attendants for his sword here are tricks cries he and subtleties and holy frauds which interpose between me and my purpose and would deprive me of my bridal joys this pious knave who in his treachery usurps a husbands title shall be the first to feel my indignation here my sword vassals my sword he grasped astianax by the collar  the instant he laid his hands upon him a dreadful clap of thunder burst above their heads the air was red with lightning the church rocked on its pillars demons i defy you cries the enraged lord all all the tricks of this magician all his sorceries  the surprise and terror again threw jessalind into great emotions she fell upon the bosom of the young stranger and wept the youth stretched forth his hand entreating lord albon to suspend his anger until these wonderful circumstances were explained assuring him that the intended bride was his mother and craving her to decypher the remaining mysteries  the explanation soon was given lord albons rage subsided he was convinced this was more than artifice and correcting impassioned wishes with propriety of judgment his excellencies of soul were renewed in all their benevolence and honor he joined the hands of astianax and jessalind  the youth kneeling implanted kisses on the hands united father cries he bless me with your pardon ignorant that you still lived i have abused the bounty of the throne i have usurped the name of belfort this ducal title these estates these honors they appertain to you and at your feet i here resign them i will immediately present my petition to the crown for their removal  astianax raising him clasped him to his enraptured bosom enjoy thy honors worthy youth cries he enjoy the rewards of thy valor and thy virtue the mansion of du monte and these demains are all i ever wished for or will possess  jessalind relieved her son from astianaxs embrace and on her neck received his tears of transport  the general confusion stood becalmed in general astonishment and joy  lord albon thus addressed them above the selfish sentiments of partiality for my own happiness sincere joy fills all my soul for your restored felicity and your rewarded merit and you lord belfort full of valor and warm with principles of honor go on and scorn the little gains of selfenjoyment when an emulation of the god whose image it is you wear prompts to the exercise of virtues in the field of life for in virtue only true nobility consists and self approving conscience calls it happiness  the end
