memoirs of t wilkinson  vol iv  memoirs of his own life by tate wilkinson patentee of the theatresroyal york and hull  in four volumes   if i had held my pen but half as well as i have held my bottle  what a charming hand i should have wrote by this time vol iv  york printed for the author by wilson spence and mawman and sold by g g j and j robinson paternosterrow and t and j egerton whitehall london anno    0  memoirs of tate wilkinson i have been told i could prevent riotous proceedings  but i must beg leave to observe that theatrical opinions are so variable unsettled and prejudiced that i fear my reasons will have as little effect as if i were to entreat that all methodists would follow the playhouse or that methodists could persuade all play attendants to become devotees at the tabernacle  the good government that prevails in general at drury lane and covent garden theaters is owing to uniformity decorum begets decorum consequently the strict order to be found in the london audiences does not owe its happy preservation entirely to three or four constables in waiting or to ten or twelve of the kings guards witness the great riot on the chinese festival at drury lane in spite of the sanction of his majesty king george the second who was there in person  another instance  when the french actors were to have performed at the haymarket theater justice du eil attended by constables and reinforced with the kings guards were defeated by numbers and determined phrenzy then truly might overcame right  nay yearly at christmas holidays in london on retrospection the plays are indistinctly and with difficulty got through  on an uproar when lady coventry and several other persons of quality were obliged to quit the stagebox on account of a supposed affront given to miss bellamy in juliet it was the audience and not any other force compelled those disturbers to leave the theater  in      when captain smith of the guards gave offense on the first night mr murphy appeared in jaffier and only his second character on the stage it was the general voice that would not permit the play to prod till the cause of interruption was re oved  at york formerly on a shrove tuesday merely from a savage custom the upper gallery was so noisy from number ers that it could not be conquered but by raising the price on that night and which has by the experiment in a great measure removed the evil  i beg leave to be here understood as speaking of theaters in general but when the propriety of london is singled out let it be well recollected that the audiences there preserve their own respect for the instant the curtain draws up all noise subsides and every person sits down nor will they uffer the actors to proceed if a hat remains on a head but in most country theaters when the performance begins the vgazers in the galleries stand up and with their hats on nay hats are too often seen on in the pit  if at london a rioter is vociferous in the gallery they are from custom and good regulation so habituated to order and necessary attention that the offender is by universal consent delivered over to the constables who not only conducts the culprit out of the gallery but if guilty of throwing bottles etc on the stage or into the pit or boxes he is conveyed before a justice to be properly punished a disturbance there even of a short duration seldom happens in the pit for the instant of interruption the person is removed by force and turned out with disgrace and ignominy  to repeat more as to myself concerning the winter at edinburgh in      would not only be fulsome and impertinent but is far from being necessary nor would it be entertaining i acted a variety of characters and suffice it to say i was well received and met with great civilities and indulgences richard bays and footes pieces were repeated my first benefit on friday march    was a fine house alexander was revived with a triumph etc at the managers expense and a farce written by mr chaigneau of dublin called harlequin soldier taken from the french my second benefit was the last night in the season saturday april    another play never acted there called coriolanus with a new burlesque farce in two acts wrote by dr schombergh of bath called bucephalus the play pleased much  the farce not at all  though after playing coriolanus i produced myself as princess statira in a few days i engaged to proceed with the managers and company to glasgow where my bargain was chiefly dependent on two clear benefits and full of hopes that a second fire would not be wickedly put into practice or even attempted as had been the year before most of the same plays acted at edinburgh were ready and repeated at glasgow my first benefit was upwards of    l the play was henry the fourth falstaff mr lancaster prince of wales mr aickin hotspur mr wilkinson the farce i have forgot  lancaster was a great favorite at edinburgh  my second benefit was only  0l  the play was essex essex mr wilkinson with tragedy alamode etc  the sensible the friendly the spirited and the vivacious mr sinclair of whom york boasts as an honorable acquisition to its inhabitants was that year at glasgow college i have had the pleasure of hearing him declare the first play he ever saw acted was the night i appeared in the difficult character of king lear at the glasgow theater and whether the performance was superexcellent or the contrary is not for me to determine but i dare affirm being the first impression made on his youthful mind that he was highly delighted and will never forget wilkinsons lear let any actors merit how great soever interfere on his sight and more enlightened judgment  i do not recollect any circumstance worth relating in that trip to glasgow except my having the pleasure of being on a degree of intimacy with the worthy mr john moore known better by being called the good johnny moore he was a gentleman very extraordinary to say that every body loved and respected at his house i was often most agreeably entertained and particularly whenever mr nicholson stewart and others paid him a visit and came on a trip to se the play from edinburgh that said good character mr moore is mentioned not only by mrs bellamy but also by doctor smollet in his novel of humphrey clinker all praised and loved him and surely what every one said must be true i returned from glasgow to newcastle where my old friend mr baker manager of the york company was stationed at the races at that town it was their usual yearly service at that time for the summer season till york meeting the latter end of august  i acted cadwalladar on the saturday in the newcastle raceweek and major sturgeon the monday following  i had indeed been secretly engaged by mr baker for newcastle where i had never played till that time before my departure from glasgow i continued at newcastle to the finishing of the season in august at mr parkers the turkshead in the big market which house mr baker for many years made his constant place of residence all went smoothly on  we had a good raceweek a good assizeweek and several very good benefits  sir francis delaval cam down that summer from the south to his seat of seaton delaval built as i have been told under sir john vanbrughs direction  mr david ross came there at the same time by the invitation of sir francis  sir john now lord delaval and his lady were there also thomas delaval esquire the younger brother and sorry am i to add wha is well known that when sir francis died i lost a valuable and honorable friend the younger brother is also dead so that with engagements at sir francis delavals many invitations at newcastle where they are particularly hospitable my time passed agreeably and profitably i set myself a hard task preparatory to my own benefit which was to finish the season by getting up mr macklins favorite farce of love alamode with patience and assiduity it was a possible work and promised much credit and cash  to tell the truth i had by luck obtained the parts by the following method  the part of sir archy i had to prepare myself in mr garrick sent it to me at winchester in the year    0 squire groom from my friend ned shuter mordecai from mr creswick who had acted the part at covent garden the ladys part from mrs burdens copy who played it at the same theater so i had only to make the irish character of sir callaghan which by the frequency of seeing the farce and the help of the first act being printed in a magazine made it with a little trouble more than half ready to my hands sir theodore a part from remembrance the rest of my own manufacture  mr macklin it is true was justifiably angry but mine for his credit was better acted and more like his farce than the stuff given in every country town with puroined lines only and mr shylock to me proved himself no jew but a friend and a good christian he forgot and forgave and occasionally favored me with his permission to act the farce of love alamode though he after jokingly called me a great rogue i could not but allow the justice of his accusation i have often invited him to visit york but he was always better pleased by my visiting him and accepting his cheer good will and kindness than trying the experiment of my yorkshire board  i concluded at newcastle with love alamode as the farce was got up with the care and the austerity almost of mr macklin himself had he been the inspector it was received with an universal effect almost equal to a london representation when that piece was in its highest estimation  at newcastle it was cast as follows sir archy mr wilkinson sir callaghan mr frodsham squire groom mr creswick etc a crowded house and from the flattering reception it was honored with at that town and indeed from the compliments i received there at that time my vanity suggested i should be a lasting favorite though i aftewards experienced a contrary temper like the saying of friends who are soon hot and as soon cold  the york races which in the year      were in their great glory made me imagine love alamode would prove of the highest consequence there  good old mr baker said he could not be happy unless his adopted son tate wilkinson would oblige him by being at york that raceweek and he really treated me as a son with one fault attending a partial father which was all i did was right mr bakers liberality i had not the least occasion to doubt and if without any emolument whatever my services could have pleased or served so worthy and kind a friend they were sincerely at his command  we came as father and son to his house atyork where in fact i was the major omo and i said to i by itself i i should do great things at the theater from love alamode which would go down more pleasantly than my tea which they had not approved and expected to be applauded as a garrick a foot and a macklin in the different characters and here good reader you will observe a lesson for vanity and as efficacious and as good a cure as are spilsburys drops for the scurvy or godbolds for a consumption  i was so assured of success with love alamode etc though when in may      i had not thought of ever visiting york again notwithstanding i had left that city in tolerable favor that trip  and mark good reader that to love alamode  thereby hangs a tale and eventful history  the monday in the race week i fixed on cadwallader in the farce as a part i was certain the york audience were partial to me in and judged i was established in their opinions that year      was the second of the new theater when at rehearsal that noon a message was sent to me while on the stage that several gentlemen desired to speak with me in mr bakers dining room i instantly obeyed the summons first desiring the performers to wait and in imagination assuring myself it must certainly be a complimentary intended bespoke play for my performing in some shining character the night following when i made my entrance into the room in high mirth and glee where the gentlemen were and was singing aloud  york races are just now beginning the lads and their uses are coming after my bow and on the survey of features not recolleing one individual face there assembled i naturally requested to be acquainted with the honor of their comman is as i was at that time busily engaged with my attention to the rehearsal of the author a farce of mr footes which was intended for that very evening when a young gentleman quickly replied sir it is that very rehearsal and farce i came to put an immediate stop to then turning to mr baker said sir you need not be informed the york theater is not licensed and if you are not acquainted with another circumstance i beg you will understand you are guilty of a double offense by a flagrant breach of law and flying in the face of authority as the impudent libel called the author written by that scoundrel foot was stopped from any future performance six years ago in december      and has not been permitted since  my name mr wilkinson is aprice and the character of cadwallader you mean to perform is an affront to the memory of my father who is now dead as his son by g  d i will not suffer such insolence to pas either unnoticed or unpunished  therefore if at night you dare attempt or presume to play that farce myself and friends are determined one and all not to leave a bench or scene in your theater so mr wilkinson your immediate and determinate answer  i could only reply refer to mr baker who was the manager and the proprietor i was only on an engagement with that gentleman for the race week and i should be guided by his opinion and direction  well mr baker said mr aprice we wait your decision  the old gentleman spoke thus why look ye do you see gentlemen if so be that is the case why as to the matter of that mr wilkinson do you see me must not act cadwallader this evening  that mr aprice said was all he requested and added that himself and friends would all attend the theater that night but expected no infringement to be made on the treaty either by secret or offensive means to cause an opposition after the managers word was given then wished a good race week and aprice and his numerous association departed  for some minutes mr baker and i stood and gazed at each other like gayless and sharp after kitty prys departure  where one says o sharp sharp  the other answers o master master  but when recovered a little from the dilemma what was to be done that was the question  to be or not to be for i could not advance forward the author being a favorite farce and say a party of gentlemen would not suffer it to be acted for if it was they threatened a dangerous riot  or could we give out handbills and inform the public a performer was dangerously ill who might immediately contradict it and assert his being in perfect health so in council it was agreed to be naturally stupid say nothing but substitute the mayor of garratt and proceed with the farce so changed without any apology whatever  it certainly was the strangest mode that ever was adopted or that ever was suffered without momentous consequences attended with strict inquiring and investigation  the first scene between sir jacob jollup and mr lint the apothecary the astonished audience sat each staring in his fellows face like shakspeares blacksmith with his hammer up and swallowing a tailors news and concluded it was something new by wilkinson foisted into the author but when i was announced as the major and made my entrance the reader will not be surprised when informed i was received with an universal hiss  i took no notice but went on  the disapprobation continued but not so virulently as to occasion a stand still and the reader may be assured we lost no time in getting our work over but wished for bedtime and that all were well for though i owed heaven a debt it is clearly evident it was not then due and i was like falstaff loath to pay before the day at last the death of that days life came on the curtain droppeo and the poor major sturgeon sneaked away with marks of anger following at his heels and unk to bed to cover himself and his dishonor so ended the first lesson of the week where i expected to have outdone my usual outdoings but the greatest generals have met with disgraces and misfortunes  tuesday i acted the liar which went off wonderfully well i breathed better than in the morning and felt once more a little elated i had fixed on the apprentice as the entertainment which the summer before had done much for me in london but unfortunately it happened to be a favorite part of mr frodshams who in truth did not play it well but quite the contrary and in that character i ailed again without a single hand to assist i labored through a part which in london i had been much flattered by applause in the extreme my imitations were not known in yorkshire therefore naturally passed without the least effect  the reader will smile at the pleasant week i had promised myself but i fed on thin diet that of hope which i doubted not would give a brilliant and good ending after the bad beginning  wednesday for my third performance i intended sir john brute in the provoked ife  a favorite part in which i had been honored with much approbation at newcastle that summer  the farce was the upholsterer  and as i had stood remarkably well in dublin in opposition even to that excellent actor mr woodward repeatedly in the tonsor i judged my success could not be doubted and indeed i was so like in voice dress and manner it was a moot point which was which but the cracking of nuts were the only tokens of approbation and my nerves are irritated at the sound from that hour to the present i was particularly attached to sir john brute and think it was not improper for me as a comedian as i had paid the strictet attention to mr garrick in that part and it might have been termed a lucky performance of mine i had not studied it from my own suggestion but first at the particular desire of mr johnny moore of glasgow  about twelve on the wednesday when i had finished the rehearsal of the provoked wife a deputation of gentlemen were sent as ambassadors from the ladies assembled then at giordanis concert  york races were then in their high glory giordani was at that time under the patronage of lady bingley who had great sway in that town and county and was really enthusiastically musical she settled  00l a year on him which annuity he enjoys to this day and will to the end of his life  the gentlemen who came from the rooms informed me and mr baker that lady bingley and all the ladies assembled sent their compliments they wished that night to make a point of visiting the theater before they went to the rooms in order to show every encouragement to the manager but it was with the proviso that so indecent a play as the provoked wife which the ladies could not by any means countenance and desired if their protection and patronage was worth consideration might be changed to another comedy but if their request was not complied with they should not on any account enter the theater as they would not by any means think of setting out so improper a representation  here was another bar against my rise to greatness at york and from that fatal day my favorite part and play was almost exploded and truly to my loss by its being expunged for ladies to the boxes i never by any means could get to that wellwrote entertaining piece though i confess it has its blemishes  the ladies added that as to the farce of the upholsterer being altered it was very immaterial as very few would continue after the play but go to the rooms  more comfort still for unfortunate wilkinson  well the command as it might be termed from the boxes was likely and necessary to be obeyed however mortifying it was to me fresh bills were issuedforth with every necessary information of the play being altered at the universal desire of persons of distinction to love in a village in which a lady of inimitable talents and great musical abilities performed the part of rosetta she is now in a superior rank of life by being united to a person distinguishable for his indefatigable talents whose understanding has greatly added to the advantage of the commercial interest of the three kingdoms and who is universally respected  it is almost needless to add the gentlemans name is palmer comptroller of the general post office at that time york races were remarkable for attracting the first families not only of that immense county but the kingdom at large and york was then honored with as many ladies of the first distinction as gentlemen  but o what a falling off is there o woe is me to have seen what i have seen and seeing what i see  the house was full and the boxes were much crowded and my only care for the evening was to prepare for the barber  though most of the ladies and gentlemen would not wait to be shaved but to those who did i was not much indebted for the compliment of their attendance as too sure i had pilgarlicks ill luck again for as to my resemblance of woodward it did not occur to one in a hundred but it struck the fancy of the million that it was a part that appertained to their favorite robertson their darling and deservedly so for he was a comedian of true merit but in regard to my playing the barber it was not that night fortunate for me that i interfered with the edwin or the parsons of york stage on that occasion and my dressing like woodward i was afterward informed was in every article of it contrary to the dress of mr robertson and as they pinned their faith upon his sleeve why he was right and i was judged wrong in every particular therefore absurd and assuming in wilkinson to attempt mr robertsons part of the barber he would spoil it and was impudent ignorant and deserved chastisement and i quitted the stage the third night with an universal hiss and general marks of disapprobation  it was to me a week of perplexity and woe not pleasure to so great a man as i had fancied myself  the next day i accidentally stepped into a milleners shop where a little elderly lady sat knitting in the corner and without once looking at me on my entrance or if she had she would not have known me said well i am sure nanny you never shall persuade me to go to the play again to see that hunchbacked barber give me the mourning bride and mr frodsham and then there is some sense in it but for that man that wilkinson as you call him from london pray let him go back and stay there for he is the ugliest man i ever saw in my life and so thought jenny i am sure if he was worth his weight in gold he should never arry a daughter of mine  miss priestley who knew me looked conounded and said my dear aunt you would alter the severe opinion you are delivering to nanny i ou were to see mr wilkinson in some of his principal characters therefore dear aunt doughty go some other night and that gentleman will make a convert of you  no that he never will replied the old lay hastily for i shall never bear the siht of him again i turned round to her and said dear madam do not be so very hardhearted  try the theater once more when i play and i will exert my best abilities to make ou amends and deserve your better sentiments  the old lady stared down dropped the spectacles the knitted garters followed which had busily employed her attention while speaking and without a single word she took to her heels which were nimble and ran away out of the back door into newstreet i laughed immoderately but with miss priestley the odd circumstance had not such a whimsical effect she appeared much hurt and genteelly apologized for mrs doughty as not being a competent judge of plays though a worthy woman which indeed was her true character  it is strange to mention requesting an excuse for the being tedious on so trifling and unentertaining a subject the contrary effect my acting the barber in the upholsterer had on the same audience at a distant period from this unfortunate week in       mr woodward late in april      played four nights at york and on saturday the   th fixed for his benefit the part of razor and of course was applauded and approved the season following i acted the barber and was received as well as and pronounced not only like but equal to woodward which plainly proves the difference of being an established favorite or the contrary and let the reader only ruminate how many actors in london have voices that give a shock and seem discordant to the ear on first reception yet if any one of those performers are blessed with sterling merit without which he will never succeed and the tones become customary to the ears of the audience the very voice which at first gave disgust from custom will in a few years become not only familiar but even agreeable and rejoice the good herers on the first distinguishable sound even so distant as from behind the scenes which little hint will be sufficient for a certain preparation to give shouts of welcome and applause not only from the gods but every part of a charmed and a resounding theater  i must not forget to mention a very particular circumstance which was the cause of my having related the foregoing accident and shows how strangely things occur know then reader that in october      only three years after mrs doughtys unfavourable opinion of me with that said ladys own consent i actually was married to her daughter jane and have this year    0 still the honor and happiness to call that truly good woman my wife and the miss priestleys i am proud to call my cousins  not having finished the career of that memorable race week i must here register that fortune had not ceased plaguing me with my performance of the barber for on the night following mrs centlivres play of the busy body was acted marplot mr frodsham to which was added my highlyvalued tower of strength my ville de paris called love alamode  thundering applause and shouts of expectation had pleasingly disturbed my sleep the night before with glorious vast ideas such as expecting thanks and being the topic of admiring conversation for the favor mr wilkinson had conferred on the town by so good and unexpected a feast as mr macklins love alamode  indeed one material point was gained for the theater was crowded in every part the york audience then were particularly lukewarm as to applause when compared to any other established theater for mr woodward was so hurt the first night he acted at his reception that i was under the necessity of calling on all my acquaintance the next day to assure them mr woodward was so chagrined by their coolnes as to reception and expressing admiration he could not act so well as if on the london dublin or edinburgh stages  they took the hint an the next night he acted bobadil and the apprentice and from the different mode was so surprised and elated that he sat up till past two after all his fatigue aged    in the highest spirits but that serenity is now altered as if the children of another soil and that sometimes even to the overdoing more than three plaudits however their admiration may be raised in my humble opinon destros their own dignity and three is full sufficient for any performers greediness beyond enfeebles instead of strengthening the intended effect for though i well know and feel that true applause is the life and soul that gives vgour to the player and equal pleasure to the autors and is the cordial of all cordials the true ramati elixir yet when too often repeated from mistaken zeal it becomes faint and the inended compliment sinks into a joke and is rather a sarcastic than an honored intention to a cool though highly entertained observer a man may be wondered at for his swiftness in running a mile which may occasion his trying to run two swifter still but in the trial his reputation is lost and the strict wary eyes become weary with looking on the same object so long  but to return to love alamode in which the first scene being merely introductory not any applause could have been extorted from any audience silence and attention was all that could be required and that was granted the scene of the jew beau mordecai followed next  not a smile as i stood behind the scenes on the very tenter hooks of expectation my vanity attributed that only to the want of a little rousing and my desired appearance  a ratatat at the stage door and now for it says i  when i entered as sir archy scarcely a hand  my heart sunk somewhere  no matter where i said to myself for comfort assume courage  it is not in mortals to command success i will do more  i will deserve it i tried and tried but all in vain the scene dragged and grew more and more dull next came sir callaghan whom i was truly glad to see as it relieved me from a heavy tedious courtship with the lady which did not promise much better success  any change i trusted would be for the better  they gave applause on seeing frodsham and a few simpering smiles gave me a cheerer and i judged all would be for the better but when i as sir archy and he as sir callaghan were left to ourselves in the quarrelling scene which is truly well executed by the author and very entertaining instead of peals of laughter which i had assured myself would follow and to my speeches in particular the full assemblage before us seemed as if by magnetism charmed into an evenings nap  all was hush  they appeared perfectly willing to grant leave for our departure  we ended the act but not with any honors to grace the remembrance  and indeed by the turn of faces in the boxes and almost in every other part it was very perceptible the actors or the piece were by no means approved it was plain by its effect how dull it appeared to them and the coo treatment i met with was sufficiently grating to prevent a possibility of my being good company  a striking instance how much depends upon a first nights reception  for had they by general consent wished to have been pleased laughed and applauded we should have acted better and they would have relished and approved but they were chilled and disappointed from having expected too much felt chagrined and were slow as to giving the least encouragement and it might truly be termed not love alamode that night but the farce of cross purposes i for my own part as an actor never felt so severe a disappointment and wished for the week over as i could then take my leave of york for ever  while the music was playing preparatory to the second act frodsham flew eagerly to get relief from his fatal and false friend the brandy bottle i was not quite so rash but was contented with sending for a bottle of madeira of which i took large and eager libations  if thus a man can die much bolder with brandy so i drink off this bumper and now i can stand the test and my comrades shall see that i die as brave as the best thus armed after a tedious music by the inspiration of the invincible spirit of wine i felt bold and sallied forth once more to take the field i had to frodsham confessed myself disappointed and hurt however submissive resignation to the decrees of the fates was indispensable and as an honest witness on a trial often gives weight to the jury so did i rest hopes on my squire grooms setting all matters right and i predicted that when the curtain dropped i should be envious of his receiving all the honors and praises that would from the part being so applicable to the week insure good fortune when squire groom made his entree in his new dress and aw his potificalibus exactly as mr king had accoutred himself at london when he acted that part why even there my hopes were frustrated for his being dressed as a gentleman who had been riding his own match gave offense instead of being pleasing to the gentlemen of the turf it was sneered at as impertinently taking too great a liberty in the race week to have any freedom of character or even to be permitted to pass at a time when the whole dependence of the theater rested on the resort of company that attended york races  squire croms scene was permitted to get through ith difficulty  at the end of which apparent disgust and weriness lessened the audience every minute and then vanished all my pleasing prospect of profit and applause from my fancied treasure in possessing the celebrated farce of love alamode and as the people from all parts hastily retired we were equally quick in bringing about the catastrophe and were not under much terror or apprehension for the conclusion as none were left except a few harmless gazers that neither cared for the audience the farce nor the actors but found themselves in the theater they scarce knew how and as peaceably departed they hardly knew why now let me speak in my own defense as to my merit in acting the part of sir archy first in the scotch dialect i was very happy having naturally a nice ear and also repeated opportunities of improvement by having resided two winters in scotland  in that point i certainly had the advantage even of mr macklin yet not too scotch for an english audience for that may be possible as an actor may pronounce scotch too well for a london audience and yet that would be exactly right at edinburgh i could speak sir archy without fear at covent garden theater but would not by any means attempt a scotch character at edinburgh though i have been much honored by their partiality but at newcastle one hundred miles south of edinburgh i was accounted a good actor as to the dialect and would have seemed still better at york and superior to york again if i acted the part in london as the purity of the language is naturally less understood the more distant from the country than in or on the borders of scotland and the performers in london not acquainted with yorkshire substitute the wiltshire dialect instead of the northern which is quite opposite but to the london galleries the substitute answers full as well as ise zure etc fulfils every idea of a cockneys common comprehension as to my playing the character i was perfect to a letter and knew every other part and had fully comprehended and executed sir archy in mr macklins manner  to do which i was competent so the fault i may say as to its being so unfavourably received did not originate entirely from bad acting in short it was no more tan a chain of illluck that at one time or another in a greater or less degree pervades nearly all who in the catalogue of lifes calendar pass for men and i may venture to assert without offense that the public every where at times is a ticklish and dangerous dependence and there is no standing on such reliance with firmness as the soil is but a sandy foundation at the best  i have seen mr mossop when in dublin have a crowded house with his name the only one thought of in the whole playbill yet by the public being there glutted with too many good performers and from the frequency of feasting at the temple of parnassus they grew surfeited and after that mr mossop aided by mrs fitzhenry and the wellknown and admired miss catly with an additional band all combined have performed to  l  before i had acted the farce of love alamode at york i assured myself it would be called for and draw great houses on the friday and saturday following but the theatrical atmosphere continued dark gloomy and tempestuous and i after the storm was over retired to bed where i sulked most part of the following day  i begged to be excused from any duty on the friday the maid of the mill was acted by mrs mahon to a full house mr robertson performed the mock doctor and i had not seen the audience so truly entertained in the course of the week  the saturday we concluded with the wonder felix mr frodsham to which i tacked the minor which was well received and there i got much credit as well as in the liar that week and though i loved applause for who does not the medicine came too late  i made my bow the curtain dropped and as i judged for positively the last time with tate wilkinson as a performer on that stage  but ah me our resolutions too much resemble april weather and are a mere shadowy mixture of sunshine clouds and showers and what we do determine often we break and so and so as foolish becky says there ended my york raceweek      but not without a scourge for my vanity  i inwardly said and solemnly farewell old york on thee i turn my back there is a world elsewhere i might truly say i had undergone a severe penance although i had not lacked plenty of the good things of this world  the york company set off on the monday for beverley its usual place of residence at that time for four or five weeks before the hull season  mr baker as he was fully convinced i had no temptation to allure me again into yorkshire behaved most liberally for my trouble during the raceweek and he wished as i was in the country that i would try a short season at hull which he augured would answer mutually for our advantage and be much more profitable than at any other time if i made a journey on purpose for hull only  mr bakers arguments were feasible hull was a new spot and i yielded to the temptation and liked it better as that place had the charms of enticing novelty to allure me  we will here imagine the york company solacing themselves at pleasant beverley and myself idle sulky and full of chagrin at york ruminating on the late disappointments with all my vain glories tarnihed and fancied laurels withered  having desanted so long on theatrical subjects i apprehend that many persons in yorkshire whether the old who ave seen mr fredsham or the young who have heard much of that gentleman will be pleased with a description of him i have therefore in this niche placed him and that the almost surfeited reader after patiently poring over so much playhouse matter may either sit still and proceed with inspecting this poor monument or lay down the book and seek a more pleasing or profitable recreation i shall here give according to my best recollection a concise sketch of the once muchtalkedof and the now almost forgotten frodsham who was thirty years ago termed the york garrick  the abilities of that performer were unquestionable  he was naturally a good actor in spite of himself for though london improves and matures and is the most enviable theatrical situation yet genius will be found in every rank soil and station mr frodsham had a quick genius aided by a liberal education he was son of an ancient family in cheshire of the town of frodsham ten miles from chester being the half way between wigan and chester  but his mind his understanding and superabundant good qualities were all warped and undermined by nocturnal habits which failings unfortunately were supplied by refreshing pulls at the brandybottle in the morning to take off all qualms from the stomach till the certain consequence ensued of being enfeebled disordered mad dropsical and dead at the age of thiryfive  with proper cultivation he would have been a good substitute for barry  i do not say that would have done in his latter state but it would have been the case had he encountered london some years before he fell into such poisonous conduct to himself and then he was the idol which the remembrance of was the support of his fame on his latter years performance  he was awkward merely from the want of modelling and worse by being told from his drunken inferiors off the stage that all he did was right but had he been caught at a proper time while wild by such a man as mr garrick and that mr g would have really taken pains with him the york hero would have done honor to london in my experience and best observation his hamlet and jaffier still better with all his eccentricity i never saw equalled but by mr garrick and mr barry at that time and of that period i am speaking not of the present day though mr kembels judgment may challenge what i say as besides his various excellencies in that character where the play is performed in the third act the execution is not only spirited and possesses great feeling and fire but the manner of conceiving those passage and conveying them to the audience is superior by mr kemble to that of any other actors whatever in my remembrance  but i am now speaking of an exuberant rude flower of the drama possessed of voice with melody and merit all considered to an eminent degree he had strong feelings and tears at will and had he been a few years under the correction of a london audience and attentive to his good advisers he would in all probability long before this have been in his meridian and at this time a settingsun there is a coarse picture at york in the printshops of which portrait i cannot say the same of more expensive ones for it not only is very like his person attitude etc but is what a picture of real worth should be  it is a strong conveyance without giving elegance which he by no means ever attained though his admirers allowed him certainly what he had not and the said trifling print does not make him outre as to awkwardness but it just conveys him in frodshams manner and mode as an actor one of the strongest likenesses i ever was surprised with was when favored with a sight of mr garricks picture at full length in the character of richard the third at sir watkin william wynns st jamesssquare  i turned suddenly round and was actually astonished  for there i saw my old master just as i had seen him in his lifetime  mr powell of london who the stage had cause to lament is the nearest assimilation i can give of frodsham mr powell had the opportunity of strictly observing real artists garrick and barry in all their modes and shapes of grief  inattentive frodsham unhappily was his own master and a careless one for though he set himself difficult tasks he only now and then pursued the trump of fame with ardency or alacrity but lagged and never reached the goal though a very little spurring and jockeyship would have made him come in first and won many a theatrical plate the public were so infatuated and indeed he was so superior that he cast all others at a distance in his york situation and the audience too blindly and too partially for his good approved all he did beyond comparison and when in full pride before he wilfully sunk himself i do not think any actor but garrick would have been liked so well and even garrick not without some old maids opinions at a secret cabal where frodsham would have been voted superior and under the rose appointed the man for the ladies nor would that decision in favor of frodsham have been from lderly ladies only as he had often melted the youthful fair ones of the tenderest moulds whose hets have been susceptible whenever frodsham was the lover it was by no means a fortunate circumstance for that young gentleman to be so much superior to all the rest of the york company no actors of high degree were at that time ever known those boards to tread nor was he ever more than ten days in london thus situated at  l  s per week salary frodsham had not any opportunity for observation or improvement  no infringement was suffered or change of characters nay so tenacious was old mr crisp an old actor at york  that it was some time i believe before he could be prevailed upon to resign hamlet to frodsham and act the ghost crisp kept richard frodsham acted richmond  crisp sir john brute frodsham merely colonel balby frodsham besides his tragic abilities acted some such parts as lord hardy young bevil lord townly sir george airy sung very tolerably and was a very decent macheath about thirtytwo years ago he obtained a fortnight for holidays which occasioned great lamentations at york for they were certain if mr garrick saw frodsham it would be a woeful day for the york stage he not only was young and vain but selfopinionated to a superabundant degree when in london he left a card at mr garricks house mr frodsham of york with the same ease and facility as if it had been the first gentleman from yorkshire mr garrick judged this card of a country stroller very easy and very extraordinary and from the sample wished to see the york actor who had accordingly admittance the ensuing day and after a slight conversation during which garrick was astonished at the young mans being so very free and affable particularly on any subject pertaining to shakspeares plays etc and still with a procrastination that garrick was not accustomed to or by any means relished a compliance with he delayed every minute expecting that frodsham would present his petition to be heard and receive his commendation from garricks eye of favor but this obsequious request not being made garrick urged present business and presented the york romeo with an order for the pit desiring him that night to favor him with attendance to see him perform sir john brute accompanied with an invitation to breakfast the enuing morning  at the same time asking him pray now have you seen a play since your arrival in london  o yes quickly answered mr frodsham i saw you play hamlet two nights ago to which he added it was his own favorite character  well sys garrick pray now how did you approve  i hope i pleased you for that night he had judged his performance a lucky hit  frodsham replied o yes certainly my dear sir vastly clever in several passages but i cannot so far subjoin mine to the public opinion of london as to say i was equally struck with your whole performance in that part  i do not conjecture that any actor who spoke to garrick ever so amazed him  garrick stammered and said why  why now to be sure now why i suppose you in the country  pray now mr frodsham what sort of a place do you act in at york is it in a room or ridinghouse occasionally fitted up  o no sir a theater upon my honor  o sure why my lord burlington has said that why will  will you breakfast tomorrow and we will have a trial of skill and mrs garrick shall judge between us ha ha ha now i say  good day mr york for i must be at the theater so now pray remember breakfast frodsham promised he would and made his exit and though garrick himself told me the circumstance and truly laughed then yet i am certain at the time he had been greatly piqued astonished and surprised at so strange a visit from a country acor yet wishing to satisfy his curiosity had done it for once at the expense of his pride and dignity the following day arrived the york hero at palais royale in southamptonstreet according to appointment  breakfast finished with madam garrick as good superintendant waiting with impatience and full of various conjectures why the poor man from the country did not take courage and prostrate before the foot of majesty humbly requesting a trial engagement etc but as frodsham did not as expected break the ice garrick did  well mr frodsham why now well that is i suppose you saw my brute last night  now no compliment but tell mrs garrick well now was it right  do you think it would have pleased at york now speak what you think  o says frodsham certainly certainly and upon my honor without compliment i never was so highly delighted and entertained  it was beyond my comprehension but having seen you play hamlet first your sir john brute exceeded my belief for i have been told hamlet mr garrick is one of your first characters but i must say i flatter myself i play it almost as well for comedy my good sir is your forte  but your brute d  n it mr garrick your brute was excellence itself you stood on the stage in the drunken scene flourishing your sword you placed yourself in an attitude  i am sure you saw me in the pit at the same time and with your eyes you seemed to say damn it frodsham did you ever see any thing like that at york could you do that frodsham and it is possible that last remark was a just one the latter part of this harangue of frodshams possibly went not so glibly down as the tea at breakfast and the ease and familiarity with which it was accompanied and delivered not only surprised but mortified garrick who expected adulation and the bended knee  where thrift might follow fawning mr garrick not only loved but eagerly swallowed flattery with a conjurers avidity with hey pass and be gone and had it daily served up not only by inferiors equals and dependents but by persons of higher rank therefore to hear a country actor speak slightly touching his lord hamlet was too much to bear and as sir archy says was vary new after much affectation of laughter and seemingly approving all frodsham had uttered  well now hey for a taste of your quality  now a speech mr frodsham from hamlet and mrs garrick bear a wary eye frodsham with the utmost composure spoke hamlets first soliloquy without any idea of fear or terror or indeed allowing garrick as a tragedian a better hamlet or superior to himself garrick all the while darting his fiery eyes into the soul of frodsham a custom of garricks to all whom he deemed subservient as if he meant to alarm and convey from those eyes an idea of intelligence to the beholder of his own amazing intellects garrick certainly possessed most extraordinary powers of eye as they contained not only the fire and austerity he meant to convey but his mplicity in scrub and archness of eye in don john was equally excellent and as various  on frodsham the eye of terror had no such effect for if he had noticed and thought mr garricks eyes were penetrating he would inwardly have comforted himself his own were equally brilliant if not superiorly so when frodsham had finished hamlets first speech and without stop to be or not to be etc garrick said well hey now hey you have a smattering but you want a little of my forming and really in some passages you have acquired tones i do not by any means approve frodsham tartly replied tones mr garrick to be sure i have tones but you are not familiarized to them i have seen you act twice hamlet the first and i thought you had odd tones and mrs cibber strange tones and they were not quite agreeable to me on the first hearing but i dare say i should soon be reconciled to them  why now says the much astonished wondering garrick nay now that is  why now really frodsham you are a d  d queer fellow  but for a fair and full trial of your genius my stage shall be open and you shall act any part you please and if you succeed we will then talk of terms o says frodsham in the same flighty flow of spirits you are mistaken my dear mr garrick if you think i came here to solicit an engagement i am a roscius at my own quarters i came to london purposely to see a few plays and looking on myself as a man not destitute of talents i judged it a proper compliment to wait on a brother genius i thought it indispensable to see you and have half an hours conversation with you  i neither want nor wish for an engagement for i would not abandon or relinquish the happiness i enjoy in yorkshire for the first terms your great and grand city of london could afford and with a negligent wild bow made his exit and left the gazing garrick following his shade like shakspeares ghost himself standing in an attitude of surprise to ruminate and reflect and to relate this account of the strangest mad actor he had ever seen or ever after did see mr garrick told me these particulars himself and a narrative much of the same purpose i had from mr frodsham when i became acquainted with him in yorkshire mr garrick declared he never beheld such a strange mixture of merit and genius as in that eccentric frodsham and frodsham without any idea of offense weakly judged that his fame was equally known with the other great mans and he was determined such an established actor as the york idol should not be deemed rude by being in london and not visiting his brother hamlets altar frodshams remarks were rude and not true relative to tones for mr garrick spoke hamlet as naturally and void of particular tones as ever was heard his voice being remarkably harmonious strong and pleasing though in his hesitation and repetition off the stage he threw it into an affected manner which habit had formed into nature as to mrs cibbers ophelia though i have seen many good ones i have not seen her like nor ever expect it as her singing voice figure and features all combined will never let me bury in oblivion her remembrance  they all withered when my poor father died methinks i see her now where in my minds eye horatio but tones until familiarized may prevent favorite comedians till their merit is established from having their voice relished and approved when i first heard mr quick his voice did not much please me now i never hear the sound of it even from behind the scenes but i am as eager as any other attendant involuntarily to laugh it has to me so whimsical and very agreeable an effect with the tragedian this apparent difficulty is n t so easily got over ryans voice was bad to a degree so was mrs woffingtons ryan by having merit and worth was sanctioned and mrs woffington by the aid of beauty and merit was a great favorite in jane shore lady jane gray etc etc but these are wonderful hazards to encounter  before i quit mr frodshams mode of behavior at london i must inform the reader that the said harumscarum young gentleman unless he waited on johnny rich of covent garden theater that manager he feared would arraign him of being deficient in point of goodbreeding otherwise he had not the least inclination to bestow an hour on that gentleman as he had been informed mr richs genius was superficial and supposing he neither understood plays greek nor latin but encouraged pantomime only he held him in the greatest contempt  indeed the applause at york he commanded and received from every alehouse had intoxicated his brain as much as the plentiful potations of york burgundy with which and other pleasant spirited draughts he too soon finished his early days of life and fame he had by the lower people been so loaded with more fancied honors than he could carry that he had not a serious afterreflection or thought to inform him he had acted wrong in his deportment manners and behavior to mr garrick he knew garricks great fortune and his own no fortune at all but allowed no professional superiority in talents etc and when he spoke to mr garrick he said he of course supposed that mr garrick knew he was speaking to as good a gentleman as himself and an actor on much the same footing of merit for the bravos and encouragement he received in his best days at york were certainly flattering and from those causes combined with his own selfopinion had confirmed to him that he was secure of the highest opinion from all the nobility of england because a few saw him in a york raceweek with rich he met with a very different reception from that of the drury lane patentee he found him teaching a young lady to act with three or four cats about him after his being some time in the room when announced rich viewed him through a very large readingglass took his snuff and said well mr frogsmire i suppose you are come from york to be taught and that i should give you an engagement did you ever act richard mr frogsmire  yes sir  why then you shall hear me act says rich  when he spoke a speech in a most ridiculous manner and on its being concluded frodsham pettishly told him he did not visit him nor come from york to be taught nor to hear him act he came like lord chalkstone merely for a little conversation and to view his elysian fields but as mr rich loved leisure and had little curiosity he replied that unless muster frogsmire would with humble attention hear his richard he would not hear mr frogsmire at all frodsham was preparing to make an exit while rich was ruminating and proceeding with  twas an excuse to avoid me alas she keeps no bed when he was suddenly interrupted by mr frodsham with i wish you good morning and so ended unthinking frodshams second managerial visit  he returned to ebors plains and was joyfully received there  he was not forgot by garrick as he often to his performers related the story of that mad york actor as he termed him and rich without thinking of any such trifling occurrence continued teaching young pupils to act stroked his cats and the york roscius was never more by him remembered  the last night frodsham ever spoke on the stage was in october      after playing lord townly and though in apparent great spirits he died within three days after  ladies and gentlemen on monday evening coriolanus to which will be added looking seriously and laying his hand a on his heart what we must all come to which expression will serve as a pause to my imperfections and digressions and afford my reader a leisure for five minutes reflection  i will here take it for granted that the reader has ruminated on giddy frodshams exit from the worlds stage and once more resume my discourse to inform the peruser that during my few days retirement at mr bakers after the races i received the favor of an invitation from mr whitely director of the doncaster theater requesting i would perform a few nights there after the races as himself and troop were to attend that meeting and continue some weeks afterward the offer exactly tallied with my plan for convenience as it filled up the space until i should be wanted at hull and also would add grist to my mill i continued with good mr baker at my house or rather his at york till i went to doncaster and he stayed with me till then out of compliment for he usually was with the company i went and mr whitely gave bills with a long puff of walk in and see the wonderful great actor he had engaged from london dublin edinburgh etc i acted there three weeks miss whitely was the young heroine a very pretty and handsome young lady she promised well as an actress but thank her stars she is much better provided for than being obliged to rely on the stage she married mr goslin of stamford where she is happily situated and is just as irresistible a woman now as she was a girl then during my continuance at doncaster i lived entirely with mr stanuel who at that time kept the green dragon and to whose civilities i was greatly indebted and have never forgot and i am glad of this public opportunity to acknowledge them and present my thanks to him mr stanuel now moves on a larger scale and in a more exalted sphere as he is master of an elegant and much improved inn well known and genteelly supported under the name of the red lion  my benefit play there was the merchant of venice my tea and duke and no duke it was particularly honored with not only being ry full but all the genteel families came on that occaon to our little theater and no wonder for besides the compliment paid to me sir george cookes mother who was much beloved by all the families in doncaster and its neighborhood did me the honor unasked to patronize my play sir george cook lives at wheatly near doncaster his own lady inherits every virtue and endearing quality which demands and receives universal respect esteem and admiration  i returned back to york and then posted next day for beverley where my friend mr baker waited for me and after that ceremony escorted me to hull which was early in the month of november       my first appearance was in king lear i had every reason to be pleased not only from the attention and warm applause of the audience but from the civilities paid me by several of the leading inhabitants i studied zanga which character was not only there but after that at york generally looked on as my master piece in tragedy and notwithstanding the variety of principal performers it is equally spoken of and flatteringly allowed to be more than a performance of mediocrity at this day  as i have mentioned civilities at that time with which i was favored at hull mr melling i am sure will pardon the liberty i presume on when i beg leave to mention his name with that respect esteem and gratitude which from me and every one who knows him is truly his due he is  gentleman whom all must revere and the common enemy of man cannot be so devilish as to hate though he cannot but envy i glory i having an opportunity to express my heartfl steem  it is just to give applause where it is deserved indeed i wish not to be fulsome with panegyric for to strangers it is of no use and to those who are so happy as to be acquainted with that gentleman it is needless as they well know and must feel the truth of my assertions selflove and vanit must partly plead my excuse with mr melling here as i wish to inform the world that that worthy good man i boast of was my particular friend from the year      to this day he has ever been anxious and happy to serve me  though no youngster he is esteemed and revered by the young as well as the old and has proved to me a second mr chaigneau if i were to write his epitaph i would place the following lines of lord lyttletons on his tombstone which i hope for years will not be wanted for the sake of his friends and mr and mrs dorrington no party his benevolence confined no ect alike it flowed to all mankind he loved his friends forgive this gushing tear alas i feel i am no actor here he ovd his friends with such a warmth of heart so clear of interest o devoid of art such generous freedom suc unshaken zeal no words can speak it but our hearts may tell a sympathising love of others bliss where will you find anothers mind like his   hull for hospitality and plenty of good cheer with too much welcome intitles that town in my opinion to the appellation of the dublin of england  the many acts of kindness i received in that friendly seat oasions my being oftener in bad health at hull than at any other place in my yearl round an odd circumstance happened at kingston which seemed to promise good luck but was the cause of unfortunate disaster my attering introduction at that place occasioned my being introduced to a colonel appleton at beverley and strange to relate that seeming honor occasioned my losing the little jewel beverley from the crown of my york imperial diaem  it was usual for the comedians as before related after the york races to halt at beverley for a short space to the southern reader it may not be amiss to inform such lady or gentleman that beverley is not a town of trade but like york i chiefly supported by the genteel private families that s e there in a continuance york is thinned as to resort of company public weeks excepted unless the latter part of the winter season nea the i ent assizes i cannot boast of any permanet intimaces with superior persons at beverley beyond a kind of summer friendship that with the east gust drops off i lost that genteel pac of residence owing to what i will here faithfull relate though not strictly according with the time of what occurred near the period i am recording of hull as my misfortune happened in      when all my theaters were greatly supported  at that time my lease at beverley was nearly expired  i was up to the ears in building a new theater at leeds and in the interim for experiment tried beverley and hull races while the leeds mansion was finishing when to my astonishent and every persons equal surprise i was ordered by colonel appleton then mayor notwithstanding strong application from ladies and the officers of the east riding militia then assembled to march bag and baggage out of the town  an insult and disgrace i believe never offered to any regular company in this world and in a place where certainly so well established and good a company of comedians was a feather of honor rather than the contrary as from its situation they never can have a company of fixed or superior estimation  however my royalty of patents with york in one hand and that of hull in the other could not melt nor soften an obdurate rock or prevail with that upright judge to deviate so far as to wink at a breach of law by suffering a naughty play at beverley though he had evidently gone nine miles from beverley to hull for the purpose of seeing one at which time hull was not a patent theater  but as lawless as its neighbor where he exercised his supreme authority the result was maintained the company for three weeks without their being permitted to act in my own theater which of course amounted to a considerable sum why a gentleman whom i never to my knowledge offended but held in respectful esteem should have used me thus oppressively and trampled on a sufferer as it exacted from me an enormous expense bordering on one hundred pounds perhaps indeed had i urged that sensitive point my money some feeling might have found passage for the strolling plaintiff has been from that time to this inexplicable unless the following circumstance was his grand motive and reason for such ungentlemanlike and indeed such cruel behavior which surely can only be accounted for as owing to that strange turn too often seen felt and experienced from a desptic and proud disposition  two years before the said colonel had desired to have a row in a stage box for my benefit at hull  the places were set down but the colonel had not as was and is the usage sent a servant to secure them and it was and is also the custom that at the end of the first act of a play none an be kept for any rank or degree whatever the colonel id no arrive till the second act was performing consequently his eats were filled up and though the ladies and gentlemen in the boxes offered to make him every convenience he would not accept it but was highly enraged and offended at what in fact was entirely his own fault  he declared he would not continue a minute longer in the theater and departed instantly swelling with dignity almost even to the bursting and vowing vengeance on the wilkinson  the which he put in execution in the manner i have related  and it has often brought good shakspeares lines as applicable to that powerful magistrate   oh it is excellent to have a giants strength but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant  o but man proud man dressed in a little brief authority most ignorant of what he is most assured his glassy essence like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as make the angels weep   if what i have now recorded respecting the treatment i undeservedly received yet myself only to pay the piper be in the slightest particle false i will against my own selfpartiality admit he was perfectly right and it will be my real temper and pride to retract and acknowledge error or any deiation from the strictest rectitude  after my safe escape from colonel appletons magisterial authority with my baggagewaggons etc to hull races without capture where i was received with welcome i have looked upon it as a duty for the beverley residents to be here made acquainted with the true motives which compelled me to abandon that spot as i have for several years been much indebted to the inhabitants of that town of every degree for their frequent visitations to the hull theater particularly on my own benefit night for let the weather prove ever so discouraging there always has been several persons of every description on that occasion  my benefit at hull on my first visit in december      was flattering to a degree not a place in the boxes to be purchased but with as much difficulty as if mr garrick was to have acted so i may vaunt of o the days when i was young my play was the orphan of china which had never been acted there my dish of tea at which there were no qualms misconceptions or abuse  all went down glibly  the farce was love alamode  but the difference of representation and the opinion of the hull audience was so indulgent that night as made me feel overpaid for the vexations and mishaps that attended my performing sir archy at york i made my best bow my best speech and from the front of the house to the performers behind the curtain there was an instance of mutual harmony and not one amongst them was more pleased than my good genius mr baker with whom i went accidentally to york meaning to pass one week and bid in all probability that place an eternal adieu as an actor  i had engaged on my own terms with mr ivory the proprietor for the whole season at norwich till the benefits commenced at that town my quarters were secured in the london coach my baggage all packed and i was near the eve of my departure from york city that january      being the lst place of wishing to stay at or even to deign visiting in future on the thursday several gentlemen waited on mr baker hearing i was in york and informed him that many ladies and gentlemen would esteem themselves much indebted to mr wilkinsons politeness if he would assist the charity for the boys and girls play on the following saturday and favor them so far on that night as to oblige them with the farce of love alamode and perform mr macklins character of sir archy mac sarcasm  reader are you not thunderstruck  but rest satisfied it is no more strange than true mr baker referred the gentlemen to me very properly observing he had no right to make any request of the kind  the which ceremony they paid me i was then traversing the stage as a noon walk  there they repeated their peition in answer i urged the inconvenience an that y journey etc would not permit my time for being at norwich being fixed and in particu ar mentioned had that not been so urgent i had a particular aversion ever to think o acting in love alamode in future at york as the treatment i had sustained during the representation of that excellent farce in the last raceweek was such as would deter me from attepting sir archy on that stage again and from that perorance begged to be excused but added if my acting any other part either in play or farce or both could p ssibly contribute to their entertainent and assist the charity my services such as they were the public might freely command mr tasker of york was with the gentlemen and he immediately replied that several leading families were then at york for the winter season who were not there in the raceweek and those persons who were so anxious to have love alamode had seen it often acted in london that it could not be denied but a strange misconception had prevailed the night it had been presented in the raceweek but the ladies one and all who had been at the last concert night assured mr wilkinson they should be highly entertained if he would treat them with love alamode i began to relax in my sulkiness and with a little more persuasion added to my own good opinion of the piece an to regain my honor in sir archy complied with their solicit tions but told them i expected applause not insult which was readily promisd it was a debt of honor and was justly paid as they kept their words even to overbalance with added interest for the whole arce was a continued roar of approbation and laughter  o reader how is this jumble of events to be accounted for as hamlet says there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out  and what is more worthy observation that very farce of love alamode which had four months before grieved my heart in ugust should in cold january not only render bak cmpensation with excess f warm joy but was actually the sole cause of rendering york may years my agreeable place of residence with a cheerful happy home as the circumstance evidences from jnuary     to this dav june      0 his majestys birthday  god bless the king send him a long and prosperous reign  and man i live with health and happiness to repeat my yearly petition  the narration i have just now given fully proves how strange perplexed various and unforeseen and how little we can tell what properly ought to be done for the best or judge of consequences in our short uncertain date of human life  the leading persons were so pleased with their entertainment and my acquiescence that they called a consultation the day following the charityplay at which meeting they mentioned that the york theater was in a very declining state even to the disgrace of the city  dirty scenes dirty clothes all dark and dismal  as to the scenes being so tattered it must be granted as inexcuable as mr baker was a painte of eminence his knowledge and taste in drawing will ever speak for him while one of his remaining prints of york or lincoln minster is to be seen  but in defense of laziness i must mention his advanced age with two bad servants attending him as natural enemies  the gout and the rheumatism the gentlemen urged to mr tasker that as mr wilkinson was universally acquainted with theatrical matters and having been in london here there and every where it would be greatly for the advantage of mr baker and also for the public if he would make mr wilkinson such an offer as might render it worth his while on reflection to tempt him to ix his residence at york as mr wilkinson certainlv must b that time have satisfied himself with a life of rambling but in that point they were mistaken mr tasker was desired to consider that proposal and wait on mr baker with what they partially termed  the general opinion of the town mr tasker lost no time as he loved business but instantly waited on mr baker and informed him of the particulars of those gentlemens opinions mr baker though really attached to me yet hesitated on that sudden intelligence as it seemed to threaten a blow on his own consequence arbitrary sway and love of power which few have philosophy sufficient to adopt and approve he told mr tasker that his friend tate got a great deal of money at various places and that york theater could not by any means afford to pay mr wilkinson such a sufficient compensation as would induce him to give up his yearly excursions and be plagued with the neverceasing troubles that daily attend the attempt of guiding a company of comedians whose various tempers vanties and self expectations were to the full as difficut to satisfy as the public and concluded wit flatly pronouncing that the matter was impracticable  mr tasker anwered him that it was not impraicable  it might be easily accomplished  and without some essential assistance at this juncture to the theater he told mr baker he must be ruined and providence had thrown mr wilkinson there at that time perhaps for the preservation of both  he persisted with hintin to mr baker that by having built a new theater at york from his own pocket he had run into a debt that would involve him much and you say added mr tasker that you esteem  ate wilkinson as your son why then in gods name make him your adopted heir and act as his father  you have neither children nor relations make wilkinson survivor to all your theatrical property  let your dwelling house be his home  give his benefits at york hull and newcastle clear from all charges  appoint him a competent salary  and as mr wilkinson has accumulated some few hundreds borrow such sums on bond  allow him interest for his money and your property being assigned to him will be more than a sufficient securty  the money which baker wanted had with him the gratest weight in the argument as it generally has with all the human race he told mr tasker that he had a sincere regard for the young gentleman and after a short silence and sighing woefully he said if mr tasker would make such a proposal to mr wilkinson he would agree to it and hoped it would be for the comfort and happiness of both declaring had he possessed a fortune he could not have bequeathed it to any one with more satisfaction than to his adopted tate for he had proved himself a good son and he had for that worthy point of character looked on himself as mr wilkinsons parental guardian from the time of his mothers death  the dialogue thus finished mr tasker called on me to walk half an hour in the minster and soon broached related and explained all the particulars just now inserted the being exalted to the rank of general that is being created a anager struck my bewildere fancy an i glowd at the idea  it was impossible for me to conceal the eagerness with which i embraced the offer  and so i dreamt of riches honor power  twas but a dream though and that dream is over   certainly at that time i walked in my sleep and it was long before i waked or my imagination was crowded with an end to my cares little supposing they were then only beginning and my uncontrollable lordly will and my selfsufficiency prevented any apprehensions from those rocks whre other managers had split been involved and shipwrecked for my wisdom and experience i to myself pronounced would guide the vessel sately into haven well laden with honors  writings were quickly drawn signed and sealed  i lent mr aker all my money  first one thousand and at different times after four hundred pounds more thus  suddenly became monarch over a set of people that never had been accustomed to restraint but to be their own masters an their managers directors they approved not of being under monarchial sway but were of levelling principles many improvements in point of management i framed to be put into immediate execution such as regarded regulation alteration new discipline with many necessary et ceteras which like battles are easily planned and executed over a cheerful table chitchat conversation but a very different and diffiult undertaking when to be put into actual execution every geographer can advise direct and find fault it is easy to traverse the world by quikly turning round its globe but it would require more than the geographers lifetime to explore the extent in reality as  one minute gives invention to destroy what to rebuild whole ages would employ in short every table that allows of players being a subject or conversatin there each mr and mrs robe and ater and miss quicksight can engage discharge and settle the whole windings of a theater remove all difficulties and point out each proper arrangement and alteration with the uost fality  my first deut as reent was in january      corioanus for mr  benefit my gradual attempts at reformation cost me more pains and met with much more obstinate opposition from the performers than the public i shall not enter upon the various adventures that have happened in the long course of almost twentyfive years yet as i have included my entrance as commander in chief i must describe one severe edict in force when i assumed the regency reins though not altogether unnoticed in the foregoing part of this history as i recollect having hinted at something like it when speaking of the norwich company  i mean the custom of the man and his wife returning thanks on the stage  and what was truly dreadful the draggletailed andromache in frost rain hail and snow delivering her benefit playbills from door to door where piercing winds blew sharp and the chill rain dropped from some penthouse on her wretched head but use had in some measure rendered it familiar  and no wonder if hectors widow when suppliant and in tears was induced on such solicitations to accept with thanks a cheering drop when i mentioned that degrading and painful custom to the company at york previous to my being manager they seemed to lament the woes they sustained as the laborious custom of their workhouse duty for it really was little less humbling and to have heard those complaints a stranger would naturally have inquired  are all these wretches slaves and the reader particularly if theatrical will start with astonishment when  aver on my word that when i put the law in force to entirely and decidedly relieve those ladies and gentlemen from the complained of evident hardship it was received by the then york company of      with marks o disgut and a conspired combination against me their chief in consequence ensued  such is the force of habit and the use of compling with despicable meanness rather than run the hazard o losing a trifle  so how could i make those free that were by nature slaves their pleas were that the quality would not come a phrase costantl used in country towns by the loe people that the town ihabitants would be  and that mr ilkinon was not subjeed o su h supecous dty besids it was apprently to the advantage of the thatre and as the anager shared the receipts on benefit nights he had no cause to complain or be dissatisfied he reaped the advantages and the perforers only had the difficulties to encounter those aruments  trated as tutile weak absurd and not to the purpose  i gave my anwer as a determined one first i bserved the discredit they appeared in when compared with the perormers in london dublin edinburgh liverpool bath and every other theater under regular and gentlemanlike establihment and what weighed in my opinion even more materially was that i was conmed n  y own judgment that not any performer of the east distinguihed reputation gentleman or lady would ever professionally visit the york or hull theaters where such despicable compliance was to be exacted or in consequence of not obeying run the hazard of forfeiting their claim to favor and patronage from the public at large and be termed impertinent proud affected and impudent therefore i against all remonstrances or fear of public alehouse abuse which most managers have the happiness of undergoing not only made enacted and confirmed as a law that the manner of returning thanks and parading the streets with playbills should be utterly abolished and that the modes of the respectable theaters as far as practicable should be introduced and put into practice  good god what a sight to actually behold mr frodsham red as a gentleman with fine natural talents and esteemed in york as a garrick the hamlet of the age running after or stopping a gentleman on horseback to deliver his benefit bill and beg half a crown then the price of the boxes during mr bakers life i never had authority sufficient to prevent the performers from constantly attending the assemblyrooms and presenting their petitions but when i was exalted from rgent to the being sole monarch for the credit of york city and myself i was then obeyed though in all states there will be now and then refractory blackhearted rebels start up whose soul are truly malignant and not to be controuled but in the end such people m ke themselves so hated and despised that in consequence of their bad tongues and their own actions giving the lie to their fawning and dissembled goodness their services are shunned every where and they fall into the net they designed for others  a year before mr bakers death i expende no less than  00l by obtaining an act of parliament in my own name for two royal patents for twentyone years for york and hull theaters which the parliament and his majesty honored me with granting and about seven years since his majesty again honored me with renewed patents for which to my gracious sovereign and to the high assembled lords and commons i humbly dutifully and with the truest gratitude submissively hop the will honor me by their acceptance of my sincere thanks and acknowledgments by that grant it is a security for the sums i have expended besides being dubbed esquire and my troop being relieved from the subterfuge of acting nder a concert of music and presenting a play atis  if these memoirs and anecdotes obtain the mpliment of an hours perusal it is as much as can hope or expect for an history of this or any id i am not equal to treat on were it no more an that of jack the giant killer and fear the relt will prove after all that i am really a poor poet in  the full sense of the word and may add that no oy was ever so weary of his tutor girl of her bib un of doing penance or old maid of being chaste s i am with thirtyfour years rolling about in a restless theatrical hemisphere indeed my broken leg with constant confinement and indifferent health as rendered this work partly a matter of amusement  praise i am too humble to expect or think i by any ways deserve and as to abuse for my attempt in writing i fear it will be much below criticism but know the mode of the human mind full well to expect my being below ill nature contempt or scurrility  if any pen of merit think these sheets worth an attack on my feeble and acknowledged ignorance i will receive the dart as a noble unexpected and an honorable extinction of nothing but i will not like melancholy jaques moral on the time more than to observe i do not at this juncture perceive any extraordinary lght or pleasing prospect to cheer my walk down hill for i am truly weary lame and tired wit service though each month certainly presents the prospect of this worlds lessening to my view and the vast abyss more plain and ready to ingulp and swallow where we shall all be enveloped and imperceptbly view new lights for information b the permission of a superior being   men must abide their going hence even as their coming hither   the reader i think cannot on a summary of my whole life collected pronounce it has been solely that of pleasure  thanks to my god for my happy state of temper for i can declare that in the whole course of my days in the tedious round of fiftyone years i have not known nine out of the number to term those of misery or real grief and though my life has been checquered by innumerable situations in which i have been whimsically and variously placed consequently no wonder if i have often acted right that i have also oftener acted wrong and like an eager child have not only tasted but devoured the sweets and now make faces at a few bitters and wish and want to be secure of health and happiness on bond to the end of my days for adversity i do not like to get acquainted with though at times i fear the will be sending a card of invitation and compelling me to dine with her willy nilly and perchance without a clean tablecloth  and that is horrid unless truly hungry but alas  heaven does with us as we with torches do not light them for ourselves for if our virtues did not go forth of us twere all alike a if we had them not spirits are not finely touched but to fine issues nor nature never lends the mallest scruple of her excellence but like a thrifty goddess she determines herself the glory of a creditor  both thanks and use   in this jumbled work as to pursuing a york stage history it would here be wrong but i will at a future opportunity under the title of the wandering patentee as christened by mr woodfall make a collection of some particular occurrences and personages that may divert and direct the southern or northern readers theatrical or otherwise to understand as to incomes of every theatrical government also a list of such principal london and other performers as i have had the satisfaction to introduce to and grace the york stage with for the credit of myself and that city to the present time with the merits of the york performers in rotation i shall also mention particulars relative to the edinburgh theater where i had the honor to be manager for one whole season and two race weeks and many other theatrical excursions and favors from particular person also the hull leeds doncaster wakefield a pontefract theaters from the year      i ha throughout used freedom of speech without which if written under mean apprehensions many persons and transactions could never have been fairly understood and on the grund of integrity with honor truth and honesty i hope and trust i shall ever stand firm whether as an elevated or  depressed character when i walk with my memory i often get a pleasing hour by reflecting with gratitude and bowing with adoration t my god for his peculiar goodness and his snatching me from the brink of the grave when sun with poverty and every threatening approach of misery and then liting me up with his own almighty arm and restoring me to instant health accompanied with worthy and benevolent friends respect and affluence which prevented at the same time the best of mothers from sinking with her gray hairs into the grave with sorrow and blessing me with the power and the will to give comfort to her latter years and days and above all am consled with my parents confession to god that her son was the cause of that unexpected and uninterrupted happines  here let me stop my career and sincerely thank my readers if they have been enabled by patience that sweet handed maid to travel so far to receive them and candor and willing memory to recollect the traces of my origin i will conclude like othello of myself that to the year      i have faithfully ran it over even from my boyish days unto the very date that i here have told it  the many favors and friendships i have been honored with for near thirtyfour years would make me despicable to myself did i not glory in thus acknowledging and pledging assurance that acts of kindness and goodness will never be forgotten by me if i have not all i wish pray god make me contented with what i have i am not too old to larn neither am i without hopes that madam fortune will surprise me when in one of here generous frolics  i will not forget her if she will not forget me  but it is the mind should make the body rich indeed twould be presumptive for me to judge of happiness and woe shall ignorance of good and ill dare to direct the eternal will surely no  therefore will conclude with wishing every prosperity to my friends in great britain and ireland and particularly to those who are my friends and patrons in my own circuit of york hull leeds wakefield doncaster and pontefract  i am with true respect gratitude and esteem their much honored and devoted humble servant to command tate wilkinson who is i fear sure to offend uncertain whom to please york    0 the mirror or actors tablet  with a review of the old and new theatrical schools   a poor player who frets and struts his life upon the stage    and then is heard no more the mirror or actors tablet we come like shadows so depart  as in my elbow though not always my easy chair i love to prattle and tell old tales and remember with advantage what feats were done i must here entreat the patience and attention of such young persons who fix their present thoughts on stage pageantry and their views on future greatness wherein they image to their pleasing warm ideas how far they shall surpass those whom they now look up to and admire for there are many actors and actresses of the present age not yet arrived at mediocrity as professors yet are advanced in years and far on their journey to the worlds end who boldly affirm that were the actors of the old school now in being they would not please if they were to dress their characters as they did forty or sixty years ago there certainly the present actors observations would be right but in point of sterling acting surely in an error  that there are gentlemen and ladies of infinite merit in most stage departments i rejoice at as their emolument is a reward to their merits as well as for the honor and credit of the profession  as to dress i draw this conclusion that was mr garrick existing with the vigor and appearance of thirty yet if he was to act ranger now he certainly would not dress that agreeable rake as he did fortythree years before this time but as mr lewis or any other competent judge does dress that character and as to the acting i must persist and there are thousands living to back my assertion that mr garrick would have been a natural performer one hundred years ago he was the most shining general player i have yet seen and were he to act ranger an hundred years hence he would be a natural ranger then and for a very simple rule mr macklin was  the old and is now of the new school yet i never heard of his deviating from nature as an instructor or an actor  for nature ever will be nature  mr kings and mr yatess excellencies  the old school prove this  shakspeare wrote two hundred years ago and could he write in the present era he could not make the characters better in boldness or expression of language than those he wrote before  i do not impertinently or like n old stager say  could mr quin and mr ryan act now they would give the same satisfaction as they did then  the reason is evident though they pleased the audiences of that age yet the mode and manner not being natural in many characters the present good discriminating taste that pervades would not relish or suffer it mr quins tragedy was strutting pompous languid tiresome and wanted spirit but the same idea of one hundred years given just now as a supposition for mr garricks ranger would have an equal claim at present with mr quins falstaff for he was much the best any living person has seen as he had every requisite from nature and though henderson had great merit his falstaff was much inferior as all he did was the effect of study and art having neither the person the voice nor the eye in particular for that part  in each of these material points henderson was deficient now quin with a bottle of claret and a full house the instant he was on the stage was sir john falstaff himself  as the wellteaming earth with rivers and showers with smiling brings forth her fruits and her flowers so faistaff will never decline still fruitful and gay he moistens his clay and his rain and his rivers are wine of the world he has all but its care no load but of flesh will he bear he laughs off his pack takes a cup of old sack and away with all sorrow and care   quins harry the eighth sir john brute all the falstaffs old bachelor volpone ape mantus brutus ventidius bishop gardener clause gloucester were all with several others all his own nor have those characters already mentioned ever truly flourished as when inspired by him but out of his particular walk he was ever bordering on the ridiculous  his richard was very heavy laborious and unnatural and it was then thought so as i recollect reading a list of plays in a magazine for the year    0 where in the catalogue of tragedies and comedies there inserted was the following line  king richard by quin much hissed his othello macbeth lear etc all as bad he played chamont  what would our modern beaux think of young chamont as i have seen mr quin act it at the age of sixty he was equipped in a long grisly halfpowdered piwig hanging low down on each side the breast and down the back a heavy scarlet coat and waistcoat trimmed with broad gold lace lak velvet breeches a black silk neckcloth black sockings a pair of squaretoed shoes with an oldfashioned pair of stone buckles  and the youthful the fiery chamont adorned himself with a pair of stiff hightopd white gloves with a broad ol scollopd laced hat which when taken off the head and having pressed the old wig and vieng his fair round belly with fat capon lined he loked like sir john brute in the drunken scene  mr garrick brought to the worlds light the spirited chamont old ryan was the strong and lusty polydore with a red face and voice truly horrible which like portia you might quickly have distinguished he knows me as the blnd man does the cuckoo by my bad voice  ryan also added bad deportment and was not near so well dressed as quins chamont though in much the same extraordinary manner and by them stood mr barry in castalio in a neat bag wig then of the newest ashion in his bloom and prime of lie and was certainly one of the handsomest men ever seen on or off the stage with mrs cibber allelegance and neatness by his side as monimia the sight of the two ancient heroes of antiquity made such a contrast in the quartetto that it struck even my features at the age of eleven with risibility if so what a whimsical feeling of tragicomedy must it have diffused on the muscles of the pit critics who then decided all disputes damnations etc which at present to save the audience trouble the morning papers have taken most of the grand articles of setting up or knocking down into their own custody  it is incumbent to remember though ryans figure for phocyas frankley sir george airy etc would now appear extravagantly ridiculous yet on the london boards no actor for a course of years could have stood more esteemed and respectable and be it observed that in despite of al these deficiencies of voice manner person dress years etc his edgar mad scene of orestes fourthact scene of mcduff ford dumont in jane shore nay even lord townly though very likely prformed the same week by mr barry who was in every point most excellent in that character yet he never repeated the last scene of that part or the mad scenes of edgar without evincing such a strong sense and feeling accompanied with judgment as removed for the time all sight or sense of his defects and oddities mr woodward assured me that when mr garrick went with him to see ryans richard the third meaning to be inwardly merry that garrick on the contrary was astonished at what he saw working in the mind of the ungraceful slovenly and illdressed figure which told him more than he before knew and which caused garricks bringing to light that unknown excellence as his own which in ryan had remained unnoticed and buried  there are confessedly more than five to one actors of merit now to what there were in      for their cloughs vaughans dagger mars mozens ackmans andersons pagets oatss redmans wignals etc etc would not now were they living be permitted to act at the york or hull theaters so nice are they grown and there is such decent acting in general throughout the kingdom yet we must not suppose mr cibber did not understand polite life and good breeding when e wrote the characters of lord and lady townly they were judged so then and are so still  and prove that the author knew full as well what a lady of quality should be as the modern writers do indeed our fine ladies at present on the stage are trifling when compared with lady townly lady betty modish millamant maria now charlotte in the hypocrite and several others as a proof those old written characters are what every young female fashionable candidate wishes to play ask mrs abington and miss farren what characters they choose to give the first impression in they will quickly answer charlotte in the hypocrite shakspeares beatrice lady betty etc  now if cibber wrote his ladies characters and his fops well he at that time knew how to play them but that was according to the particular mode of his own which pleased but his manner would not please now i guess because that of another age his foppington was a coxcomb of that time and sir fopling flutter with sir courtley nice  now there are no such characters extant and therefore lord foppington is not so pleasing a representative of quality as he was forty years ago and i not only think but venture to affirm against many judgments of stage opinions of a modern greenroom that the celebrated mrs oldfields lady townly etc would be now pronounced excellent my imagination leads me to pin faith on this opinion because my brethren will remark her tragedy did not suit with the bombastic taste of those actors who devoted themselves at the tragic shrine and the true cause has been that she was more natural than her predecessors and her conversation and manners were universally admired as a lady which must have been the result of observation and her being admitted on a familiar and respectable footing with persons of the first distinction who admired the elegance of the actress and saw themselves in her  and persons of true taste and distinction however the dress of the times may differ will ever be easy affable attractive and engaging  nay it can be easily explained to young observers almost to a certainty for look back a very few years and they will find once a year that the ton for being seen in public in the month of january was naked and bare and another year the neck and bosom all muffled and barricaded in july and august yet to a duchess of devonshire or rutland both natives and foreigners bow with admiration in the same manner whether the behind is swelled or diminished as whatever they do ease and elegance must be attendants therefore the habiliment to such persons matters very little to a critical observer whether they are seen decked simply in an irish poplin or accoutred in all the gaudy plumes of the most extravagant chane of prevailing paris fashions and if mrs oldfields dress for lady townly or lady betty with mrs abingtons or any other fine ladys dress were now put into a fire the latter would be consumed to ashes that might help a hothouse but i fear not produce intrinsic worth  but the oldfields would prove like purest gold that is tortured in the furnance comes out more bright and brings forth all its weight   the expense for the necessary profusion of stagedresses is enormous but there is nothing real taste may be discerned that this is the period for taste in dress will be readily admitted but the money expended and all the true value rests in the word taste i know this myself perfectly by having had about twenty years ago an old wardrobe i found in the ruins of my theatrical herculaneum and which was of  antiquity and had appertained to roman emperors kings etc when not a performer lady or gentleman of the london theaters but would have involuntarily laughed at the old broad seams of gold and silver lace and have cast piteous and contemptuous looks on the country performers thus loaded with trumpery yet those despicable clothes had at different periods of time bedecked real lords and dukes and were bought at much less price than now and would produce by one days labor of stripping merely the old materials forty or fifty pounds to provide a supper if the stomach required and i can assert and prove that my present wardrobe is far superior to any out of london without excepting dublin or edinburgh and has been attended with considerable expense far beyond the bounds of prudence or commonsense it is true as a purchaser of the theater the wardrobe is of great cost and value and would show a play without fear or disgrace to any audience whatever as numbers can testify but would not in a state of bankruptcy pay intrinsically as the old despised king lears suit almost singly would have done as all now consists of foil spangles beads interwoven fast embroidery silks satins etc which soon wear an old petticoat made for a large hoop of the duchess of northumberland thirty ears ago would have served a queen in the theater everal years then descended to a duchess of suffolk afterward made two handsome tragedy shapes for an old rich spaniard and ten years after that burn and produce money to purchase thirty yards of lustring for a modern stage lady thirty years ago not a templar or decentdressed young man but wore a rich gold laced hat and scarlet waistcoat with a broad gold lace  as the miser says he carried an estate upon his back  also laced frocks for morning dress i have now worn occasionally by comedians for old characters of wealth a suit of purple oth with gold vellum holes that i frequently wore when a young man as a fashionable dress and spoke the prologue to the author gave tea etc on the london stage and after that used it as my common dress to parade the streets at noon but i must justly coincide with the point of truth and declare the characteristic dressing of plays forty years ago was very inferior indeed to what is seen in these riper years particularly the comedians at that time no more than two or three principal characters at covent garden in particular were well dressed and those not with any variety as now mrs woffingtons wardrobe had only the increase of one tragedysuit in the course of the season in addition to the clothes allotted to her unless she indulged herself and she had a new suit for sir harry wildair in which character mrs woffington looked the man of fashion and mrs jordan sports now in sir harry one of the best legs in the kingdom sir joshua reynolds is a judge of legs and has like paris with his apple given his decree on that said leg  but the gentlemen and ladies in moderndressed tragedies forty years ago at covent garden theater wore the old laced clothes which had done many years service at lincolnsinnfields besides having graced the original wearers and the ladies were in large hoops and the velvet petticoats heavily embossed proved extremely inconvenient and troublesome and always a page behind to hear the lovers secrets and keep the train in graceful decorum if two princesses met on the stage with the frequent stagecrossing then practiced it would now seem truly entertaining to behold a page dangling at the tail of each heroine and i have seen a young lady not of the most delicate form who sustained that office frequently  a miss mullart  they are now dismissed as judged unnecessary and superfluous  but luckily they were pages of honor and as truly to be depended upon as edinburgh caddies as i have never heard of any misdemeanor brought into court by their impeachment  yet theatrical lngs and queens like their brethren mortals sometimes have been frail but they were family secrets and ought not to be mentioned again i have seen mrs woffington dressed in high taste for mrs phillis for then all ladies companions or gentlewomens gentlewomen actually appeared in that style of dress nay even the comical clive dressed her chambermaids lappet lettice etc in the same manner authorized from what custom had warranted when they were in their younger days and in my remembrance not a first servant maid or unfortunate female that usurped a right of strand walk which she termed her own trodden ground from st marylestrand to exeter change but what swaggered in her large banging hoop to the terror of any young novice who dared usurp a footing of those territories  in short a large hoop was a requisite and indispensable mode of dress strict propriety of habiliment not any manager has yet arrived at even in london and though it is so highly improved these last twenty years yet the achievement not even money will ever be able to obtain that is while the stage is honored with pretty women as i sincerely hope it ever will be  or common sense reason persuasion nor entreaty will ever persuade handsome women to appear in a farmers daughter or a witch or a servant maid but with the head dressed in full fashion and the feet deckin satin shoes yet i think they would be gainers by trying dear variety for what will attract more than the simple quaker or the truly neat chambermaid and it is not every mn that wishes for a duchess besides what an advantage to be seen in a gaudy attire one night and another arrayed in pure simplicity and be viewed with propriety in a green stuff gown etc and not as madge in love in a village or betsy blossom with a french head white silk stockings and white satin shoes by such contradictions nature is as distant from the stage now as she was an hundred years ago and stuff soes and clean cotton stockings would look not only as well but better by the preservation of character  nay the plain woman if such there be would not be behind hand as she would i ear keep equal pace in absurdity and relinquish all pretensions to propriety by being as fantastical as the most beautiful young one and these contradictions of dress and manner of behavior are often beheld off the stage by chance observers and are very properly introduced and ridiculed on and receive the rod of correction from the comic muse as proper objects for the poets satire and he public mirth not any plays throughout were ever dressed as they are now  there the public enjoy a splendour indeed superior to their forefathers also in the magnificence of theaters the scenery and lighting are now beyond compare but it is evident our grannies had an idea of what they did not possess as may be proved by the orders for scenery in sir william davenants plays drydens tempest king arthur lees constantine cyrus the great etc etc except in mr richs pantomimes the public then had seldom any scenery that proved of advantage so as to allure the eye  but now frequently we have new scenery to almost every piece it was very uncommon formerly for new plays to have more than what we term stock scenery  there is one scene at covent garden used from      to this day in the fops fortune etc which has wings and flat of spanish figures at full length and two folding doors in the middle  i never see those wings slide on but i feel as if seeing my very old acquaintance unexpectedly the advantage of the nw established theaters is another useful alteration for these times though the opera house when first finished must have been noble as we are told by oley cibber it was so large they could not be heard till the cieling was lowered and the house lessened the little theater in the hay market as it was called twentysix years ago till it was beautified and put into its present form b mr foot and mr colman would now cut a very contemptible figure in most towns of england and not fit to enter after seeing bath edinburgh bristol liverpool york and many other theaters by this progress and embelishment of regular handsome wellornamented theaters with good scenery wardrobe and band at york in particular the er we may be assured that these theaters are superior to those wherein booth betterton and cibber acted for though drury lane was larger than the most of our present country theaters yet forty years ago the audience part of those london theaters were very crazy inconvenient and not pleasing to the eye and at present the staircase to the upper boxes at drury lane is so narrow that should an alarm of fire happen the persons in the two upper tier of boxes would be thrown into such confusion should they open at the same time the different doors the passage is so strait and they would so effectually block up each other that not one single soul could escape and their increasing fears would cause the situation to be alarming and dreadful to a degree indeed covent garden is not so complete in that department at least it was not so when i saw that theater before the late alterations the upper boxes at edinburgh are far preferable to those at london for seeing and indeed in that respect are better than any theater i know and it has an advantage like smockalley by the audience part being formed in a wellfinished circle drury lane like london bridge has been much frittered and patched at very great expense and after all the only way to repair will be to pull it down and erect a new one  which i understand is to be done and i wish for health to see it finished in properbuilt convenient theaters i am told paris has within these few years taken the lead though some time ago  was greatly inferior if they are like the plates which i have of those theaters they appear very noble and spacious and not surrounded by buildings but good open road for carriages round  however as a print is not always to be depended on i cannot say more in praise of those structures but by what i guess and what i have heard concerning those in paris and from the pictures sent to me from thence by mr maude of york who judged i should like a peep at those theaters being at such a distance  veu de theater italien  veu de theater francois  lopera proche la port saint martin  the opera house is far superior particularly the stage as two hundred soldiers i am informed at times appear thereon in tragic pieces when it is necessary these alterations of theaters in the country i am not clear on mature deliberation have been done for the better  so much additional finery and splendour was not requisite as tolerable decent drapery may do very well for a house near temple bar that would look despicable in grosvenorsquare  besides while those inconveniences remained the first actors and actresses would not have deigned to visit the provincial playhouses for even when the theaters were closed sixty years ago no principal performer ever played as now at liverpool birmingham etc as we may conclude from mrs centlivres prologue to her busy body  this season must things bear a smiling face but playrs in summer have a dismal case since your appearance only is our act of grace   thirty years ago mr barry or mrs cibber would not have disgraced as they at that time judged their current london stamp for being paid in july in birmingham coin on any account indeed such would have been thought by their london patrons a most disagreeable and disgraceful exploit and the londoners will be astonished to be truly informed that now mrs siddons mrs jordan and others make their true golden harvest on their summer excursions out of the metropolis bath from its great fashionable resort and consequence has of course an improving theater and though only one hundred miles distant from london causes in the londoners many a wishful look to honor bath with five or six nights in the course of a season and thereby secure a couple of hundred pounds but those bath managers act more prudently as they never permit london or any other actors however the voice of fame may have exalted them to perform a few nights only  mrs crawford for instance lived there all the last winter but she was not offered any terms of engagement only such as the theater would afford as expenditure for the whole season but no acting there for a short period to take the cream and leave the skimmed milk for the managers and performers to exist on consequently bath not being capable to pay enormou salaries the receipts being by no means adequate or proportionable as london must secure the principal performers for the winter and in case of disagreement dublin and edinburgh are equal to reward their labors by holding out a lucrative and happy asylum great theatrical personages who formerly used to look upon a city or town as a bore now on the contrary in the summer grant they are commodious respectable and even alluring and with great good manners compliance and condescension will consent to trifle away a few nights at such insignificant places even the jordan herself who at present reigns as our modern thalia has deigned to visit cheltenham reading margate richmond and harrowgate which places yielded great profits silver medals and subscriptions falling at her feet in plentiful showers and she as greatness knows itself acts naturally on such occasions  being earnest in her demands i wish her every prosperity and hope she will accumulate   london performers when in the country have only the trouble to repeat their tasks like young scholars sent for a six weeks vacation who for the credit and pride of their papas and masters are expected to return perfect and repeat when sent back to school the consequence of these visitors though it gratifies the pride of the audiences not forgetting also the managers own ostentation in the principal theaters remote from the great city is not always productive though it gives a glare to enterprise therefore every manager out of london should watch his farm with as much fear and observance as a west indian planter does a hurricane which destroys his fine prospect and he bestows three quarters of the year in hopes the fourth quarters produce may make amends for devastation  so the manager with the little overplus gained should never lay out what is so dearly bought in too lavish improvements in a theater for the absence of the reigning london favorite leaves a cold chill and omnious illfated blast on all theatrical culture for the year to come indeed there are always people and money where fashion and inclination prompt them to attend a playhouse which when not so the theater only obtains contempt false pity and less attendance it is true by these advantages which i have taken the liberty to mention plays are wonderfully altered for the better but was i asked if in consequence of such good fare are not the audiences altered for the better also i should be compelled to answer indeed they are not but far the contrary frequently seeing the best acting has destroyed all theatrical regular relish i was lead formerly to believe when i first began the mode of procuring principal performers from london it would have given information to the people in general and made more and more converts to my conventicles but there i was egregiously mistaken for people who are not blessed with affluent fortunes in the middling class of life with proud minds and little souls have but as much for pleasures as they can prudently spare therefore if they expend in one week what would serve for a month for themselves and their families purposes there is likely to be a drawback  besides its being unfashionable and then all is over with a theater  for many go to a play as the fine lady says sometimes because  because why because all the world is there  not to see the play but to be seen and it is surprising my own appetite did not inform me this for if i feed one week on pineapples grapes nectarines and peaches i would rather go without fruit the week following than eat common pears plums or blackberries indeed patents have not only been a security for theatrical property but have put the country actors on a more decent level which was highly necessary for though there are exceptions from all wellbred persons yet an actor in london is very differently respected to what he is in the country it is so in common life  we are connected with or behaved to by a dependent or independent acquaintance as interest caprice or the humor hits a cockney merely confined to london and who thinks it a journey from wapping to covent garden to see the play is certainly of all critics one of the worst for he was born in london and lives in london and any brother mechanic from a distant county is looked on as ignorant and told how to comport himself on retrospect i recollect an instance of this kind in myself for till the age of seventeen i judged every man and woman i saw ignorant and stupid who ived two miles beyond richmond and hampton court a stronger instance i remember of mr townsend whose respectable family i have so frequently beforementioned he honored me with be ng my cashier and when i mentioned wanting it as the york manager he said what a fool must you be tate to trust your money with yorkshire people for they think of nothing but to overreach us here in the south another  o vulgar cockney wisdom i was shown a few years ago when i was relating in london an history  with every respect and indeed blazoning ou orern ftes races etc and concluding my  wih the ladies going to the assemblyrooms in chairs my good sister cockney with all the elegance of one hump before and another behind fell into an involuntary fit of laughter for which i could n t apprehend the reason but the instant her pleasant convulsions gave permission she rung the bell most furiously and called aloud mr jennings mr jennings come down stairs  come down stairs  here is mr wilkinson tells me the have chairs at york  oh i should delight to se those horse godmothers those wulgar ladies get into chairs   n ed not observe to my render that the lady was not of exalted breed  but is it not strange that any person of common coprehension should let the too evident and common partiality as a londoner prevent them from naturally knowing by yearly observation that ondon would not be that extensiv and rich capital it is unless supported by the resort of ladies and gentlemen from every county in the kingdom and their own reflections in august september and october should make them naturally note why in those months in particular they exclaim o what an empty town  nobody to be seen  all the world is in the country etc  on this subject i must beg leave to intrude another instan e  some fourteen years ago i dined at the london t vern with a truly good friend of mine mr robert bell of hull and a large party of his intimates resident in the metrools  t is certainly superfluous to mention that the town of hull in the kingdom of great britain stands forward as a seaporttown for exports and imports and is certainly superior to any after liverpool and ristol  the dinner was good and mr bells guests were cheerful and agreeable  i was not known in my public capacity but only as a mr wilkinson the acquaintance of mr bell and my dialect conforming to my brother cocknes i was not supposed but as a kinsman therefore a man of knowledge being a londoner plays at length became a topic of conversation when mr bell began to pay some compliments on the good representations of which they could boast at hull under the direction of a person whom he regarded and for whose prosper he was anxious when one gentleman in particular burst into a loud laugh which was seconded by others and when sufficiently recovere begged of mr bell to inform him whether they had blankets or a green cloth as a substitute for scenery  for he never had been at a play in he country but should like to see one of all thgs it must be such a bore mr bell very gravey replied  if the gentleman judged it worth his attntion he might receive immedite information of every particular as the gentleman at his right hand mr wilkinson was the director and patentee of the hull theater this immediately turned the laugh and my brother cockney begged a thousand pardons  it served as a very good joke and often has been related by mr bell as a proof how little intelligent some inconsiderate londoners are  titumti is another notion that even london managers and critiques have of plays in the country but that is all exploded extravagance of manner and deviation from the truth too evidently prevailing that many great geniusses are bred in the country that a london theater with its rod of authority and good judgment would rectify and improve is indisputable  but i am not writing or hinting of a london audience when i speak of such confirmed cockneys within the sound of bow bell there is here and there scattered out of london a strange set of gnats or wouldbemeddling officious critiques who are merely a but for the players when they turn their backs and are the plague of their own acquaintances with their profound knowledge and experience of the drama and deal out the word minutiae and propriety which they have gleane superficially from theatrical phrases all pronounce with much selfapprobation from such sir oracles they are much attaced to reviving obsolete plays and casting and instructing the actors  i knew such a one for years and whenever i find such condescension with advancing steps approaching who if once he honors you with his advice which he means commands and acquaintance which lasts only whilst you implicitly bow and comply with his refined notions  but i avoid such a gracious person as i would a pest being well confirmed from experience if he once gts hold of my ear or time i shall be to a certainty deprived of both  one disadvantage more to the managers of country theaters arises from the roads being so excellent to what they were formerly and the various conveniences for those in middling life as well as the affluent the increase of fashionable dissipation etc are all combined causes for the ruin of country theaters  nothing is more common than to meet an acquaintance in the york theater on the saturday who if asked how he liked the play will answer why tolerable  but having seen it last wednesday night so delightfully acted at drury lane it made the comedy appear very tiresome  mr woodfall said mrs siddons spoke sensibly when she first acted portia but that her powers were unfit for a london stage and were only calculated for such small places as she in the country had been accustomed to  mr woodfall was no right as it proved and mr woodfall i sincerel and honorably declare i esteem as a man o found judgment  indeed the frequent intercourse between london and york occasioned by the facility of the roads is a fataty in fact instead of an advantage for though the mind may be theatrica i les naturally to conceit vanity and selflove and it is no wonder that the london play should throw the yorkshire one at a distance for though with every respect and high opinion i feel and acknowlege their indubitable right to preference and uperioity yet i will venture to affirm that even mr garrick uch is the force of prejudice would not have pleased the supersine cric of york or of any other place to well had he been only a provincial actor  this assertion is ol but easily evinced  mrs siddons was thought a good actrss at york when in her prime of life but not so great an actress nor olowed as the rage of the times when she was dismissed the theater as incapable of her engagement till the londoners recanted their former ill juged decisions and as a contrary effect when most  sanoned they fainted screamed and ex red whenever that lady acted a few years afterward and for the honor of country judgment be it remembered that had they in that instance followed london example often the case wh that said london ad lost the pleasure of seeing take her all in all the first actress within mory  actors are led into an error in point of dressing  servants of country gentlemen so awkwad  true such beings were in charater eighty years ago in some bye villages some traces are  o be seen but in every country gentlemans  the servants at present are as forward fine gentlemens gentlemen as the metropolis can boast  and most o them have london educations and a full as coxcombical as any sir harry lord duke or tom which the london stage produces  nor are they deicient in the grand tur as very many visit aris yearly  and bath and paris grow rich on yorkshire spoils it is astonishing the number of families from york only now at paris and bath and were they not abentees but were according to my wishes kept in their own county it would make a joful alteration in my finances and would not injure their own but happily for them they have such plenty of golden ore that they can breathe what air and in what climate they please and have a constant supply like fortunatuss purse if i had youth and spirit and boldly trod the road neck or nothing and wished to make depredations on yorkshire purses i would never hazard life by attacking persons solacing in carriages who were departing from london particularly those of flashy gemmen and ladies for carry what cash they will into london if they have sufficient to bring them back without borrowing on the bond and without being in debt they have visited london cheaply  i mention this from my own experience but not as a good example and we are too apt to judge of others by ourselves but i dare say most will agree that they never think of going to london without a tolerably supply of metal and if they do reflect at all do not expect to return with many guineas to spare  plays are hackneyed now in every town and village  the theater is not such an object for the bumpkin gazers as formerly and it is the million that must mke the playhouse answer fine theaters out of london are like an easy countenance with an ang heart  theaters in general should e under the control of an actor of judgment experience goodnature etc and though we have instances of geen f property being managers they in general have found money does not flow like a spring well though it is in truth a sinking one the profession in life of ease and pleasure as it appears to be to an unthinking auditor who will say well may these players be happy people they get money for naught but making game and picking folks pokets  but gentlemen managers very rarely succeed though the ideal riches have tempted many to rust real ore under the rubbish and dust of wardrobes scenerooms paitingrooms etc i know not one instance at present where any manager and actor makes a fortune  garrick did but colley cibber merely retired with a competency  wilkes and booth no more  betterton died very poor a man it is said ever body loved in and out of the theater and known by courtier and peasant by the appellation of honest tom  that was honor indeed as an a or and manager  it is so written down in stage history and i cannot contradict it  it is true he had the appellation from all who knew him of honest tom but neither his genius his labor his excellence same goodness nor even his honesty had procure him gentlemanlike existence as he had a chtybenefit at the age of seventyfive when he was supported on one side by mrs barry a fa ous actress at that time and the celebrated mrs bracegirdle on the other who had quitted the theater for many years in her bloom of youth with unsullied reputation and was the admiration of all who beheld her on or off the stage  mrs bracegirdle i believe has not been dead above twentyfive years  her age must have been remarkable  she was well born and brought on the stage by mr betterton was i believe the original statira and in most of rowes tragedies mrs pritchard showed me her part of clarissa in the confederacy which was written out by mrs bracegirdles own hand they were acquainted and mrs pritchard told me that venerable actress came there on purpose to see her act mrs oakley in the jealous ife during its first run  the advantages i have mentioned the london theaters flourish with at present are not all confined to what i have asserted as to the theaters dresses scenery and many accommodations but there is no alteration better than the stage in these days not being infested with persons behind the scenes in common but particularly on benefit nights  as a proof of the force of absurdity i have often wondered and so have others why new stage boxes placed where the useful stage doors used to be were frequented but in short there are persons always who would prefer such a box were it much higher on the stage so few want really to see the piece attentively  witness ladies of fashion in london thirty years ago sitting at the very backs of the performers  when i had the honor at york to wait upon his royal highness the late duke of york he said wilkinson where am i to sit  i replied in the stage box at which he smiled and said so because i am the duke of york i must sit in the worst box in the theater for seeing the play  the theaters formerly were not large enough on such occasions as frequently on the benefit of a woodward a mrs cibber a shuter and others was the case therefore the following advertisement appeared at the bottom of each playbill on any benefit of consequence  part of the pit will be railed into the boxes and for the better accommodation of the ladies the stage will be formed into an amphitheatre where servants will be allowed to keep places when a great house was not sufficiently ascertained as the perfomer juged for the places taken and the tickets sold at the bottom of the bill was  n b not y building on the stage what was termed building on the stage certainly was the greatest nusance that ever prevailed over an entertainment for the elegant and general resort of any metropolis yet london has not stood singular as its rival city and seat of elegance and fashion paris had formerly the same defects if we who have not been there may guess a few years ago  if credit is to be given to the authority of mr footes englishman in paris we saw crowds of people going into a house and comedy pasted over the door in we trooped with the rest paid our cash and sat down on the stage presentl they had a dance and one of the young women with long hair trailing behind her stood with her back to a rail just by me  ecod what does me for nothing in the world but a joke as i hope for mercy but ties her locks to the rail so when it was her turn to figure out souse she flapped on her bak  twas devilish comical  custom reconciles many things in every stage of life and though it was the most irksome to a performer that ever could be inflicted as a punishment the slavery of course was made easy to the persons whose benefit it was that occasioned the confusion the perquisite being always prevailing and if mr shuter was proud that the superflux was compliment to his wonderful abilities conscience would gain acquiescence to undertake the laboring oar for a brother or sister performer as mutual lab urers in the vineyard  but my kind reader suppose an audience behind the curtain up to the clouds with persons of a menial cast on the ground beaux and no beaux crowding the only entrance what a play it must have been whenever romeo was breaking open the supposed tomb which was no more than a screen on those nights set up and mrs cibber prostrating herself on an old couch covered with black cloth as the tomb of the capulets with at least on a great benefit night two hundred persons behind her which for ed the back ground as an unfrequented hallowed place of chaplels skulls which was to convey the idea of where the heads of all her buried ancestors were packed  i do not think at present any allowance but peals of laughter could attend such a truly ridiculous spectacle  yet strange as it would now seem and insuterable yet certain it is that i have seen occasionally many plays acted with great applause to such mummery as to general appearance and conception a strange proof and the strongest i think that can be given how far a mind may be led by attention custom and a willingness to be pleased without the least aid of probability its chief and sole object certainly tended only to create laughter and disgust nay the stage which was not thirty years ago near so wide as at present also the stagedoors which must be well remembered and the stageboxes before which there were false canvas nclosed fronts on each side of two or three seats on to the lamps for ladies of distinction which rendered it next to impossible for those ladies in the stageboxes to see at all but still it was the fashion and therefore of course charming and delightful  and whenever a don choleric in the fops fortune or sir amorous varnict in womans a riddle or charles in the busy body tried to find out secrets or plot an escape from a balcony they always bowed and thrust themselves into the boxes over the stagedoor amidst the company who were greatly disturbed and obliged to give up their seats  the actor talked of being alone amongst hundreds and sir amorous hung in a sling with mrs betty adding to the inconvenience these were faults indeed and almost beyond belief within these forty years even with all the knowledge of the bettertons cibbers booths and wilks to have cleared the way and not have left such passages of the drama to be corrected which their own honor and common sense might so easily have removed and expunged from their journals of disgrace as they must now remain a lasting stigma on their taste and judgment  to add instances of equal absurdity in the country would be superfluou and afford no wonder at all  the bod of course was ill when the great mind was overpowered with sickness debility and disorder  mr garrick was a doctor but too late to cure this evil at his setting forth  better however late than never but he only remedied the disease for the advantage of the train of actors that followed him more than for any long enjoyment that it afforded to his own pride and satisfaction as the projector or as the entire expunger and exterminator of those horrid intrusions on the mind of sensibility besides these troubles and inconveniences not even those of the first theatrical rank could be insured or protected from insult yet to this real drudgery mortification degradation and humiliation i have often seen mr garrick and mrs cibber exposed i can well remember when i was thirteen years of age viewing mr quin on monday march         for the benefit of mr ryan play the character of falstaff he was thus announced in the playbill the part of falstaff will be performed by mr quin  which was his last night of performing  the stage was at  s  pit and boxes all joined together at  s there was only one entrance on each side the stage which was always particularly crowded first they sported their own figures to gratify self consequence and impede and interfere with the performers who had to come on and go off the stage affronting the audience was another darling delight  particularly offending the galleries and thereby incurring the displeasure of the gods who showed their resentment by dispersing golden showers of oranges and halfeaten pppins to the infinite terror of the ladies of fashion seated in the pit on such public nights where they were so closely wedged as to preclude all possibility of securing a retreat or obtaining reliet till the finae when they all moved from their situation by general consent  the stage spectators were not content with piling on raised seats till their heads reached the theatrical cloudings which seats were cloed in with dirty worn out scenery to enclose the painted round from the first wing the main entrance being up steps from the middle of the back scene but when that amphitheatre was filled there would be a group of ill dressed lads and p rsons itting on the stage in front three or four rows deep other e those who sat behind could not have seen and a riot would have ensued so in fact a performer on a popular night could not step his foot with safety least e either should thereby hurt or offend or be thrown down amongst scores of idle tipsey apprentices  the first time holland acted hamlet it was for his own benefit when the stage was in the situation here described on seeing the ghost he was much frightened and felt the sensation and terror usual on that thrilling occasion and his hat flew  amode off his head an inoffensive woman in a red cloak a friend of hollands hearing hamlet complain the air bit shrewdly and was very old with infinite composure crossed the stage took up the hat and with the greatest care placed it st on hamlets head who on the occasion was as much alarmed in reality as he had just then been eigning but the audience burst out into such incessant peals of laughter that the ghost moved off without any ceremony and hamlet scorning to be outdone in courtesy immediately followed with roars of applause the poor woman stood astonished which increased the roar etc it was some time before the laughter subsided and they could not resist a repetition that merry tragedy night on the reappearance of the ghost and hamlet  mr quin aged sixtyfive with the heavy dress of alstaff notwithstanding the impatience of he audience to see their old acquaintance was several minutes before he could pass through the numbers that wedged and hemmed him in he was so cruelly encompassed around  what must the reader suppose at so barbarous and general a stm being not only yielded to but approved by the prformers  mrs cibber arrayed for juliet in a  white satin dress with the then indispensable rge hoop in all her pomp of woe thus shaken and taken prisoner as it were by foes sarcastic an bararous and in these situations they under went greater affctions of punisment and tyran than ver the mrs pritchard or woffington experienced as an arpaia or a merope from a bajazet or plionts  now mr garrick acutely felt this horrid in convenience for thuh the actor might reocie thse offensive and degrading situations for  additional hundre pounds profit yet as mr garrick on su occasins had not a felloweeling it was therefore to him more irksome the pu lic truly knew and felt the inconvenience b this was heerfully submitte to they the considered it as a reward to the avurite actor for his yearly labur toil and industry but it may eai y be supp sd that many lovers of the dram deped themselves from seeing a play so disgracefuly ac d on such occasons however well such pe sos might wish the performers but at the same time they consulted their own ease and comfort by absenting themselves on such nights ye such is the force of true good sterling acting that i do aver i have seen on very particular occasions when the stage has not been too much crowded a play performed with universal approbation  mr footes first night of the englishman in paris for mr macklins benefit stood the hazard of the die under the disadvantage of this predicamnt its value was stamped that night and a great run and establishment it met with the winter followng mr garricks lord chalkstone the  a prof what good acting humoured with  and candor will produce and the  when not interrupted on such benefit nights  in lieu surrounded by a wellbred set of ladies and entlemen have felt themselves so much at ease  specimens of goodluck for it could be  to nothing else that they have gloried in he unexpected luxury of comfort and encourageet with which they have been so fortunately reved and they have acted as well as if surrodd by their usual slaves and attendants with the addiion of scenery etc to have aied their exons  at the time this beargarden flourished in our thtres whenever on the managers nights the  overflowed in the winter season not only their acquaintance but persons of distinction and  were indiscriminately admitted behind the ns particularly at drury lane on the nights mr garrick acted his first esteemed characters of  lear bays etc but i have often seen  distreed on such nights at covent garden e same rude custom was prevalent but not unes on very rare occasions were they so much disturbed with such visitors the boxes at that theater did not so often groan with the overpowering numbers unless when one of richs rareeshws was revived as harlequin sorcerer in particular when the following paragraph was inserted at the bottom of the bill  as any obstructions in the movements of the machinery will greatly prejudice the performance of the entertainment it is hoped that no gentlemen will take it ass the being refused admittance behind the scenes  ladies are requested to send their servants by three oclock    and if the performers at either house on a benefit were moderate in their exactions or hopes from the town they cheered their wellwishers with placing the following line conspicuous  n b there will not be any building on the stage  when rich after two or three years promise and delay brought forth one of these longwishedfor pantomimes it was a rage a madness incredible seized all the londoners on such fortunate occurrences mr rich was strongly attached and tenderly tenacious of his harlequin jacket being profaned or infringed upon and kept his holy rites and mysteries of serpents lions druids etc sacred from the inspection of all curious pying inspectors nor would he have had his magical sword interrupted or his fountains and cascades stopped in their munificent flow to the admiring and astonished crowds in front to have pleased all the nobility in the kingdom and indeed the difference of performing pantomimes under mr richs direction and skill was as much superior at that time as was mr garricks hamlet at drury lane compared to old ryans at covent garden  the constant admission behind the scenes is no where more fully or better explained than by mr garrick in the farce of lethe acted first at goodmans fields where he makes the fine gentleman thus express himself  aesop how do you spend your evening sir   fine gent i dress in the evening and go generally behind the scenes of both play houses not you may imagine to be diverted with the play but to intrigue and show myself i stand upon the stage talk loud and stare about which confounds the actors and disturbs the audience upon which the galleries who hate the appearance of one of us begin to hiss and cry off off while i undaunted stamp my foot so  loll with my shoulder thus  take snuff with my right hand and smile scornfully  thus  this exasperates the savages and they attack us with vollies of sucked oranges and halfeaten pippens   aesop and you retire   fine gent without doubt if i am sober for orange will stain silk and an apple disfigue a feature     this is a proof that garrick saw and felt the evil in his younger days and he at last mustered courage by one bold stroke to put the hatchet to the tree and thereby annihilate the grievance and though he had undergone these hardships and inconveniences for many years with the utmost severity and patience yet he judged it a reformation due to his future name and fame and i may observe it is not always seen that muchwishedfor alterations even in affairs of the utmost moment are in general approved or willingly submitted to by the million with whom no reason or argument will or can convince or wear off ancient customs and prejuices  as mr garrick had three parties to encounter and each formidabe when bundled they were truly alarming first to banish the young beaux from behind the scene was judged a daring attempt though mr sheridan had proved it was to be done in dublin where the behavior sometimes had been mentioned as most savage as the managers right to rule where young men of ton wee concerned was looked upon as a vulgar law wh none but the mean spirited obeyed the or order were attached to it as going behind the cenes on benefit nights pleased young clerks and others who liked to see the aresses nearer han they were accustomed to also most of the pripal and several of the middling class of the perormers would not choose to pay mr garricks chrges for their benefit nights and be abridged o a  l or a   0l advantage accruing from the uilding and general admittance on the stage  garrick did not like the obstacles he had to encounter till a lucky thought burst in upon his  concerning that business he reflected that the theater was but in an indifferent state and that by enlarging it to the now present fom    0 it would not only immediately answe for his pecuniary advantages but also for a pub c theatrical property which he meant in four or ive years after that to part with to the best  as was the case when doctor ford mr sheridan and mr linley were the purchasers a he grew harassed and had secured affluence in an over abundance which makes it lamentable to sider how short a time he enjoyed a private  for he was snatched from his friends and all hs wrldly wealth in about two years after his age farewell  however his projected plan he put in practice altered the old drury lane into its present form which now holds considerably above  00l in front more than it did thirty years ago and after this beneficial alteration was accomplished by degrees all parties were pleased and convinced of its propriety the comedians had particular reasons to jump for joy as they received the same benefit emoluments without those degrading and irksome situations which interest had made them submit to the covent garden managers adopted the same change of measures and from that time general admittance and stage building on benefits has ever been prohibited  these stage remarks have carried my memory back to recollect that the same evils existed in provincial theaters and in a worse degree as those stages not being formed into an amphitheatre were without any order or decency merely rows of forms one level with the other for the audience part of those theaters were full large for their usual seasons of acting yet on particular benefits london furnished a plea for what might be attempted to render the bad playhouses worse than they were before and the alterations in this respect from mr garricks reformation of abuses in london i should apprehend led into the sudden wonderful improvements enlargements and aggrandizing of most of our theaters in every principal town and city  and as to the article of being freed from beaux behind the scenes a greater blessing could not be wished or more devoutly prayed for as it cannot be conceived how dreadful in the country that would sometimes prove my own situation in my history mentioned at shrewsbury is one instance the hauteur and dignity of such visitants being often so insulting and imperious as not to be described  the receipts of the theaters it is true should be mentioned in    0 two hundred pounds before the curtain at covent garden was judged an amazing sum now we hear of upwards of four hundred pounds but the profits of the season i dare pronounce are not equal to mr garricks reign the expenses are grown so enormous  at dublin in      one hundred and fifty pounds was a great house indeed in      one hundred and eighty pounds at crowstreet was juged a wonder but with the late alterations mr daly had in july     three hundred and twentyfour pounds and he mentions hundreds that could not obtain admittance  mr garrick was certainly formed to obtain favor  and the public in general willingly subscribed to his proposals though like man and wife they sometimes did not agree  his coffers were always full and he was too great an oeconomist ver to empty them by the hand of extravagance  he locked on his majestys picture with love and reverence and never parted with his kings likenes but with the greatest relu ance  the expenses of the house were not then so great as at present for when i had a benefit at covent garden    0 i only paid  0l now i believe performers pay   0l and if mrs jordan acts on that benefit it is ten guineas more  it is worthy remark that with all the boasted improvements certainly the goings out are immense in proportion to the comings in and where there was one place open against the theaters then now there are double  such as various newestablished concerts at hanoversquare ottenhamcourt pantheon besides astleys the circus etc therefore with the london managers being at double the expense of their predecessors i can never coincide with the opinions started by dissatisfied performers or as often hinted at in the news papers but let us ask is there a superfluity of principal actors certainly no are the managers in great circumstances certainly no one play got up now will cost more than three would fifty years ago i have heard great arguments of what encouragement would be given by a third theater instead of the present termed monopoly were it possible to create three industrious mr sheridans to write for the stage something might be said and done but i fear not otherwise and if people in general find their plays not all perfection with two companies i cannot conceive that divided into three the would be acted better  nay is not mr harris reduced i say reduced or he certainly would not do it to cut plays into farces and give farces instead of plays and sometimes all farce and no play with different boxers mendoza and humphreys on the stage for the entertainment of the first audience in the world in which he has ulfilled garricks prophecy for the theater royal at covent garden gives a dish of all sorts and were they twenty years since to have seen  medley playbills at a third theater or from york or edinburgh such stuff would have served the whole greenroom in london for a weeks laugh at the country strollers expense  bsies such productions if to be tolerated and approved at all should certainly be permitted only  a summer theater when the wine and the weaher is hot  garricks prophecy      perhaps for who can guess the effects of chance here hunt may box and mahomet may dance ah let not censure term our fate our choice the stage but echoes back the public voice as to gentlemen writers of genius being excluded from having their works produced i cannot think the injustice alleged is by any means founded on truth or equit for i never can believe even though many good plays were to be sunk in oblivion but that some of them would again visit the world in print to gratify the authors pride and reputation and by such means prove how indifferent managers were to merit  i do not mean to insinuate that there are not good authors at present capable of affording the highest and most improving additions to the stage catalogue i only wish to be understood that the stage is not overstocked with such offers and it is too probable that authors may have occasion perhaps to complain of indifferent and improper treatment as a london manager is not like the pope a ways infallible i am only speaking by guess not being a quainted with the facts it is certain the new pieces brought out in a general way do not please and as money is always welcome i cannot think any projector existing would be at great expense to produce a piece that creates confusion in the theater damnation to the author and if persisted in he excludes the possibility of crowded houses besides being well abused in every public print into the bargain i cannot tink mr harris would lavish money on the prophetess if he had as good a new opera to produce as the duenna the very run of such a piece as the latter would supply him for half the seas n or that mr kemble would produce a comedy only acted three nights if he had been presented with one equal to the school for scandal and indeed how few plays of late seasons reach the ninth night what a quantity of plays farces and pantomimes do the three theaters exhibit in the course of the year and how few succeed what perpetual labor and anxiety mut the performers undergo and all end in vexation of spirit  all for nothing  some few pieces excepted which need not be enumerated as those that live and are the oftenest acted prove their public estimation one great fault has crept into the benefit bills in london filling them up with such a quantity of interludes etc  i am sorry to observe mr garrick was the introducer  he led the way to what has grown to an enormous height but i am certain he never meant the ill effects it has established but his farmers return lincos travels etc wrote as interludes have considerably lessened the dignity of the drama it was the practice at my own theaters i at first on benefit nights insisted on all interludes being done as afterludes but nothing would do so as to keep the playbills it to be seen they were so loaded with trumpey so for some years past i have not had any preludes interludes or afterludes at all mr kemble wished on his night in august      at york to introduce the toy shop as an interlude which he had formerly done and which gave great satisfaction on account of his excellent performance of the master but unless he took it as a farce i was compelled not to suffer it on account of my established law which mr kemble at the head of the profession breaking through would have set aside uc law by the example from his high authority and judgment i remember his reply was that the act was good it kept in force but added he jokingly mr wilkinson the first benefit bi i shall ee o your own night i shall find it full of interludes however it has not happened yet and i dare say never will to any benefit of mine  london opinion though its stamp passes current in provincial towns as to firstrate performers yet has so fallen in reputation as to pieces that it is not a recommendation in advertising a new play but the contrary and many are never attempted so that there is no wish to see a new production unless much spoken of and it has fortunately had a very considerable run but even that was not always secure its footing i have great obligations to acknowledge to the school for scandal the poor soldier and the farmer of modern date  as i have given an account of the amazing alterations as to the manners practiced in the theaters not much longer ago than our  prime yet so quick is the transition that a few only remain now who can affirm or contradict what i have inserted a proof how we are eceived by the apparent slowness of the running sand in the hourglass which in reality  astonishing rapidity and wafts us dreaming from life to dusty death this is verified  in the course of these last forty years few are left to mock their own grinning  though mr macklin stands firm like the venerable old oak that shades the forest  and in the following tablet it affects me as if it were the history of a theatrical cathedral which gives an account of the departed dead or a transient view of the acters tombs and monuments  now good gentleman or lady i will proceed and introduce the  actors tablet it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing  this repository or journal is offered not only to young stage candidates but at the same time to the attention of all amateurs of the drama as it will be a guide and a more regular information to them and indeed to the public in general than any thing of the kind yet attempted  though i fear presented in a bungling manner still this account of old stagers must be in some degree venerable as an old coin is in higher esteem with antiquarians than the new though of less intrinsic worth  i wish it had the advantage of a better head but that is past praying for yet it will be a kind of guide and convey information by no means publicly known wherein the reader will find almost an exact list of every theatrical event with the date of most of the new or revived plays and farces produced  the performers engagements and desertions to and from ireland to the london theaters  their reengagements and the account of singers dancers burlettas incidents etc from the year      to the conclusion of       mr garricks establishment as joint manager with mr lacey was in      and few persons who have been readers of theatrical anecdotes have yet since the time of colley cibber had any accurate or regular account of those years more than in a general view though there certainly has been able writers and men of genius who have treated on more important theatrical subjects  i will here give a list of the companies at drury lane and covent garden in      that the observant reader unprejudiced may see what a number of established actors were at that period in one company and whether there are the same number of equal eminence to be called so at present at either theater  the modern critic and actor will undoubtedly admit that every fifty years will make havoc and considerable alteration and what is approved and applauded now    0 may not be sanctioned in      when mr garrick undertook the manaement the company collected was perhaps take it for all in all the most powerful ever mustered in the present century  i will first give as correct a list as i can recollect then present the cast of two or three plays and then instance the cast of the same plays in      by which means the unprejudiced reflector may draw a fair conclusion and perhaps allow it not quite improbable but the play so acted might have been seen

mr cook monsieur grandchamps madam auretti in the serious style in great estimation and mademoiselle janeton auretti  a favorite pantomime dance was served up often called the savoyard travelers  madame auretti continued only the season following when her benefit was commanded by his majesty george the second  play the stratagem  mr garrick acted archer  after which she retired from the stage and mr cook went over to covent garden the season following  the foundling by mr moore was first acted in february      young belmont mr garrick sir charles raymond mr barry sir roger belmont mr yates villiard mr sparks colonel raymond mr havard faddle mr macklin rossetta mrs woffington fidelia mrs cibber   albumazer was revived in      by mr garrick and did not succeed  from which play the circumstance of the robbery is evidently stolen and converted into tony lumpkins principal scene of dr goldsmiths very entertaining comedy of she stoops to conquer  covent garden       the company was very weak indeed  mr rich more from laziness than lack of genius had not any pantomime in force but the then very stale one of merlins cave or harlequin skeleton they played in general only three or four times in the week in january and often dismissed even in the month of february for garrick had swept most of the actors of merit from covent garden to drury lane for his triumphal entry as

from mrs necessary she sustained the  cast several years at covent garden as mrs hamilton  the season was so bad that in february the benefits commenced and late in march      mr rich brought forward apollo and daphne which drew good houses  harlequin mr phillips who supplied that character as mr richs substitute when he did not choose to perform as mr lun the scene of the sun rising had a fine effect and i am astonished so superb a constructed piece of machinery is not made use of now at covent garden as introductory to some new pantomime for the scene with morpheus mystery and slumber preparatory to the appearance of the sun in its meridian had a wonderful effect and might be displayed in any other pantomime and be a good opening one also that of daphnes being turned into a tree by the pursuit of apollo from the assenting nod of silenus the rising dome the lion in perseus the snake etc would make good incidents  in the spring      was a remarkable an dreadful fire in cornhill when mr quin came purposely from bath and acted his favorite character of cato at covent garden theater for the benefit of the poor sufferers by that dreadful conflagration  drury lane season       mr macklin and wife quitted drury lane for ireland woodward returned to the old house from dublin and soon grw into amazing popularity this year was revived romeo and juliet romeo mr barry mercutio mr woodward juliet mrs cibber   the play had a remarkable run mr victor has not taken notice of this circumstance for the strength of that play was the foundation for the desertion of mr barry in the year    0 with mrs cibber  irene by doctor johnson was acted that season also lethe which was inimitably performed not a part but was truly excellent merop was acted that year garrick looked and acte like an angel as the ladies said the part o eumenes  mr lee and mr palmer promising actor were introduced that season  the same year the emperor of the moon written by mrs behn was revived at drury lane as a second piece  harlequin was tossed in a lanket with a good effect  he had two long slips y which he held  they were imperceptible to the a ience so that harlequin seemed to the eye  violently tumbled and the galleries who  the appearance of mischief were vastly   that season mr king made his first attempt as  candidate in the herald in king lear his  was not paid any attention to by mr garck he was as is theatrically termed laid upon the shelf that year but he was engaged for the  season at bristol where mr whitehead e poet laureat and mrs pritchard saw  play the character of romeo with great apause he returned to london the winter sea and was astonished without any notice  given him to see his name in large lets advertised for george barnwell  millwood rs ritchard  he also played valerius in mr hteheads tragedy of the roman father  e continued there till the end of the season       the autumn went over to ireland and aced a very liberal offer from mr sheridan   dublin he continued till the second year after r woodwards desertion from drury lane to wstreet theater in dublin  mr king returned to fill up mr woodward department and made his first appearance early i october      in the character of tom in the conscious lovers his second part was atall an his third sir amorous vainwit  in the characte of brass churchill allowed him great merit  the play friendship in fashion was attempte to be played in the spring       mr woodwar and mrs clive were to sustain the principal characters  be it noticed dame clive was no blessed with beauty  though of infinite talents ye she unfortunately in that comedy was ideally ravished twice or thrice before the fourth act ended which the audience very properly judged to be too much for that ladys feelings and not knowing wha might truly happen in the fifth they consequentl put a violent and final stop to all farther indecen proceedings  the french ambassador was at the play an seemed to enjoy john bull engaged in a riot bu at last violation was offered to the kings arms ove the front box at which he seemed much alarme at the imagined sacrilege and precipitately retire from the theater  what an alteration in the conduct of frenchmen in forty years  my true respect duty and veneration to hi majesty leads me to hope that no similar acciden will ever occur at york on any occasion as i can bast the best finished and most elegant royal arms for neatness and perfection as to workmanship of any theater in his majestys dominions  all surprie at this assertion will cease in yorkshire when i anounce they were executed by those ingenious and wellknown artists the deserving brothers john and samuel fisher of york  covent garden        several theatrical alterations took place  mr rich was roused from his slumber  mr quin returned to the stage and mr delane mr sparks mr arthur mrs woffington and miss pit were engaged from drury lane also miss bellamy by mr victor and others falsely related to have been drawn from her lucrative and splendid s tuation in dublin by garrick was actually ngaged by mr rich  mrs bellamys first appearance was in belvira which proves mr victors account of covent garden very erroneous  mr garrick says mr victor and mr hitchcock from the many opportunities he had of seeing miss bellamys abilities when they performed together in dublin      was too well convinced of her merit not to use every means to engage her  accordingly he made her proposals which she immediately accepted and she returned to london where she remained some years in high estimation  that mrs bellamy remained for some time in high estimation is well known  but her first appearance after her departure from dublin was not at mr garricks theater but at covent garden as before mentioned a true and particular account of which with mr garricks refusal to engage her is given in her memoirs  mrs ward was also engaged  she was a handsome woman and a good actress  coriolanus by thompson was produced that season in which mr quin mr ryan mr delane mr sparks mr ridout mrs bellamy and mrs woington acted  perseus and andromeda was also produced and brought several houses  so that mr rich then had three pantomimes on the stocks the skeleton apollo and daphne and perseus the business of the petit maitre in the last mentioned was inimitably done by mr lalmaze palpably stolen by mr woodward and placed in queen mab at drury lane in the year    0 the scene of the dragon and perseus on his flying horse with andromeda chained to the rock the rising dome and the lion were the principal parts of that entertainment and all done well as was all pantomime business under the direction of mr rich  mr arthur did the clown in that pantomime in which department he was unrivalled and well understood all the mechanical parts of those kind of productions  mr low was perseus mr miles harlequin miss falkener andromeda  mr quins falstaff and several of his characters drew great audiences  mrs bellamy was much esteemed  mrs woffington was attractive in sir harry wildair etc  and though drury lane was fashionable yet covent garden was respectable as to entertainment and in general well attended  jane shore was thus cast gloster mr quin hastings mr delane dumont mr ryan alicia miss bellamy jane shore mrs woffington the entertainments of the theater were insed by the addition of two excellent dancers mr cook and miss hilliard  a scotch danc was so pleasing that it continued not only tha but three or four seasons after  this was the year of the quartbottle conjuror at the haymarket where the joke drew such  concourse at the expense of john bull   turned out advantageous to the proprietor of covent garden as at the latter part of that season harlequin to the amazement of crowded audiences not only went into the quart bottle but after that don jumpedo jumped down his own throat  these exploits were performed by harlequin phillips  the provoked wife was acted with approbation that season at covent garden for though garrick was then performing sir john brute yet there were many obstinate critics of opinion that the character was better conducted by mr quin indeed there cannot be any one part acted more differently than that character was by mr garrick and mr quin yet had the author been then living i may venture to pronounce he would have allowed both right even the petticoat scene was as opposite in dress and manner as othello and desdemona yet had mr quin attempted garrick mode or garrick quins each would have certainly failed  the play was thus cast at covent garden brute mr quin heartfree mr ryan constant mr ridout razor mr anderson colonel bully mr low tailor mr collins belinda mrs hale mademoiselle miss morrison who played it inimitably lady fanciful miss bellamy lady brute mrs woffington   in the spring      cato was acted by order of is royal highness frederick prince of wales by the younger branches of the royal family  his present majesty spoke the prologue at leicesterhouse on the occasion the conducting of the performance was entirely under the direction of mr quin his present majestys father was a great advoate for the stage and a warm patron of mr quins indeed his attachment was such that quins salary was equal to a thousand pounds his t season    0 one political reason was that a the commands of his royal highness unless on soe very particular occasion covent garden theater was honored with and chiefly out o compliment to mr quin  the emperor of the moon wrote by mrs behn was revived at covent garden as a first piece and at some expense a tapestry scene of figures was very well executed  doctor bellardo by mr sparks harlequin mr cushing scaramouch mr dunstall  miss bellamy mrs woffington and mrs ward were in it but the piece did not succeed and harlequin is the fiddle of the piece mr woodward must have been excellent and mr cushing contemptible i recollect seeing it as a farce but very wretchedly supported as to decorations scenery etc in dublin      where mr king was truly whimsical in harlequin  the following comedies were thus cast and acted with success at covent garden that season constant couple sir harry wildair mrs woffington standard mr delane vizard mr ridout beau clincher mr cibber young clincher mr collins smuggler mr arthur tom errand mr bencraft angelica miss copin lady darling mrs copin parley mrs dunstall lady lovewell mrs ward careless husband lord foppington mr cibber sir charles easy mr ryan lord morelove mr delane lady easy mrs ward edging mrs ridout lady graveairs mrs hale lady betty modish mrs woffington the season concluded with the constant couple and apollo and daphne  drury lane      0  mrs cibber did not play that season mr garrick shameful to relate encouraged mrs ward to break articles with mr rich which she was the easier tempted to do as miss bellamy was in possession of most of the characters she wished to play edward the black prince was acted that season  barry gained great ground and honor in ribemont master mattocks appeared that year in the chaplet a very pretty entertainment at that time  musical pieces then king arthur and the tempest excepted were on our english stage confined to the common ballad farces  mr beard was as a vocal performer the best actor of songs i ever remember  miss norris was a charming singer  and pastora cannot be known but by those who had the pleasure of seeing mrs clive  mrs cibber having withdrawn was a severe stroke upon the drury lane tragedies mrs ward being but a cold and inanimate substitute and it fell heavier on mr barrys plays than mr garricks as lear macbeth richard with mrs pritchards lady macbeth etc would do without mrs cibber but castalio romeo varanes etc were ruined without her helping hand indeed barry refused acting romeo with mrs ward the roman father was brought out that season where barry in publius by no means could appear as an actor though it showed his fine figure in competition with garrick gil blas was produced that year and damned and some other pieces but none of note rich not having any thing new and only repeating the old plays lady jane gray excepted and the pantomime of the fair drury lane unless on particular nights bore the beil garricks comedy characters as well as his tragedy such as ranger benedick archer bays lear hamlet etc were sure cards and all those plays were thoroughly well acted  covent garden      0  the company much the same as the year before unless the loss of mr theophilus cibber mr dyer from ireland was his substitute a very good actor in sprightly comedy not striking as to abilities but sure to please and never to offend he played several parts of mr garricks such as ranger etc and in tom was truly excellent  that was his first part at covent garden mr dyers figure was very neat not unlike that of mr lewiss of covent garden but it would be paying mr lewis a very bad complement to draw a comparison in any other respect as that gentlemans vivacity neatness spirit and energy of expression is so superior as to cast mr dyers abilities at a distance were he now living as wherever mr lewiss vapid twineall mercutio etc are meant oned which he supports with a peculiar whim and vivacity he by that means sends hundreds joyful to their respective homes in truth he needs no eulogium as the truest praise is deservedly thus that whether mr lewis had pleased the audience in   00    0 or in    0 he would have an equal claim to the generosity protection and approbation of a sensible generous and discerning public  garricks reasoning in verse will explain that idea when perhaps i should only perplex  your children cannot feel what you have known they will boast of quins and cibbers of their own the greatest glory of our happy few is to be felt and be approved by you   lady jane gray was revived by command of his royal highness frederick prince of wales as a second performance by the royal family under the direction of mr quin at leicester house it added much to mrs woffingtons reputation the parts were thus disposed of  pembroke mr delane northumberland mr sparks suffolk mr ridout gardener mr quin duchess of suffolk mrs horton lady jane gray mrs woffington   the above play was performed a number of nights the line of  i hold no speech with heretics and traitors used to strike my young imagination so forcibly at ten years old that i remember it perfectly to this very minute  that year mr rich produced a little sketch of a pantomime called the fair in which mr lun rich did harlequin lun had been the name of the famous man who represented harlequin at paris therefore whenever mr rich appeared as harlequin the name of lun was inserted in the bils mr garrick paid a compliment to mr richs harlequin in the following lines  but why a speaking harlequin it is wrong the wits will say to give the fool a tongue when lun appeared with matchless art and whim he gave the power of speech to every limb though masked and mute conveyed his quick intent and told in frolic gestures all he meant  but now the motley coat and sword of wood requires a tongue to make them understood   the famous turk on the wire was at that time introduced by mr rich in the pantomime of the fair and indeed that was the sole motive of his patching up that entertainment mr quin and mrs woffington would not play during the representation of that piece as they thought it degrading to the theater to have wiredancers etc but as it did not interfere with their plays and they were paid and as that trifle brought several good houses by which means they would have appeared to advantage they certainly acted wrong in duty to the manager the public and their own interet  the public were the only proper judges to decide on the propriety or impropriety and if they suffered the grand turk to exhibit they should have acquiesced and not withdrawn and pointed out the fault which might have worked up a fury against the theater that would have fallen upon themselves  romeo and juliet was revived in the interim between quin and woffingtons playing  romeo mr lee juliet miss bellamy mr lee had broke his article and fled to covent garden  mr lees very peculiar oddity of temper prevented him ever rising to any fixed public estimation  drury lane    0   miss bellamy was engaged from covent garden and trained as the juliet  woodward was the mercutio mr garrick divided the opinion of the town as to his performance in romeo  mr richs procession was very grand and in those spectacles he never had been equalled nor can be surpassed but garrick did not promise any procession or dirge in his bills though they gave a striking effect and an agreeable surprise  mr woodward assisted mr garrick with queen mab that season which eased garrick much and the comedies were so well sustained where mr woodward mr yates mr taswell mrs pritchard and mrs clive were capital that the fairy wand sailed with the old drury hulk before the wind a whimsical print was then produced called the steel yards in in which were placed quin barry woffington and cibber and in opposition woodward and queen mab which exultingly bore down all the greater load with the small this season mr shuter was coming forward greatly as a low comedian at drury lane  also mr palmer in the gentlemen in comedy who afterward sustained a very considrable cast of the celebrated mr wilkess comedygentlemen as sir george airy etc  he some years afterward married miss pritchard  covent garden    0   barry deserted to covent garden  mrs cibber also after a years retirement engaged at the same theater  macklin and wife came from dub also mrs elmy to that theater  quin and woffington remained  consequently garrick fund the coalition so strong that he wished to bri over quin to his interest but quin having had the command at covent garden did not sh to be controuled by mr garrick he therefore stuck to his old master rich but not without stipulating for one thousand pounds a year  the greatest salary ever then known to be complied with or i believe since except in the case of mrs billington  this collected body of imperial forces might strike the boldest with dismay  the whole conversation was that garrick would be ruined by such a powerful opposition but they did not or would not comprehend that garrick was really as he expressed himself  armed capapee in selfsufficient merit his macbeth lear hamlet richard bays etc stood alone nor as he foretold did his lear or hamlet lose their force  besides he had industry and his troops were under excellent discipline  woodward assisted him too in a material point  that of attacking rich in his deemed invulnerable part  the harlequin department  for though rich despised actors he for once in his life in this season relied on them and had nothing to produce as to novelty in the pantomime way of any kind whatever  added to that the performers at covent garden were not under any control they despised their master  he despised them  and they heartily hated each other  quin disliked barry and barry quin  and mrs cibber and mrs woffington held each other in the highest contempt  mrs cibber when called upon by the manager was often feignedly or really ill and though mrs woffington was ever ready for any undertaking for the general welfare yet that year her pride was touched and irritated so much that by a refusal one night a great riot ensued as before mentioned in vol iii  quin and barry were also averse to assist each other  king john was called to rehearsal and barry was not there quin would not attend the next rehearsal and what barry settled quin was sure when he came to contradict  the house opened that season september   th with the miser miser mr macklin lappet mrs macklin   second play was the busy body marplot mr macklin patch mrs macklin   and on friday october   was the commencement of the scene of battle between the two houses with the run of romeo and juliet romeo mr barry  juliet mrs cibber   king john was revived that season thus king john mr quin king of france mr ryan hubert mr bridgewater pandolph mr sparks dauphin mr lacey prince arthur miss mullart bastard mr barry queen ellinor mrs elmy constance mrs cibber lady blanch mrs vincent lady falconbridge mrs bambridge   two very odd incidents happened during the run of that play they are in mr daviess miscellanies but as i related them to mr davies i claim a right to insert them here  for he was not in london at the time as he played some seasons at york edinburgh and dublin they were as follows  on mr barrys endeavoring to repeat the following words in the first act of the play  well now i can make any joan a lady    he was so embarrassed in the delivery of this single line that not being able to repeat the words he was obliged to quit the stage amidst the genera applause of the audience who saw and felt his uneasiness but what is still more surprising after going off and returning three several times with the same kind encouragement of the spectators he was forced to give it up and i believe he did not recover himself till he was relieved by the entrance of lady falconbridge  mrs cibber during the representation of that tragedy at covent garden theater the year    0 was suddenly taken ill  the play was however announced in the bills  mrs woffington who was ever ready to show her respect to the public and her willingness to promote the interest of her employer came forward to the front of the pit ready dressed for the character of constance and offered with permission of the audience to supply mrs cibbers place for that night the spectators instead of meeting her address with approbation seemed to be entirely lost in surprise this unexpected reception so embarrassed er that she was preparing to retire when ryan who thought they only wanted a hint to rouse them from their insensibility asked them bluntly f they would give mrs woffington leave to act had constance  the audience as if at once awakened from a fit of lethargy by repeated plau strove to make amends for their inattention to the most beautiful woman that ever adorned a theater    the refusal was revived by macklin that winter mr lee played granger but mr garrick put the law in force for breach of his article and he was obliged to return to drury lane where garrick from that day held a rod of iron over him  she would if she could was revived  a vile play indeed  not relished then by any means  now to the credit of the audience would not be tolerated  the principal characters were performed by mr and mrs macklin and mrs elmy  mrs cibber was ill great part of the season it was the last year of mr quins playing  his benefit was about the twelfth of march  othello the play  the moor was aced alternately by him and barry when barry acted othello macklin played iago and when quin acted othello ryan was the iago  i wonder quins understanding would let him persist in acting othello where he was so inferior in every respect to mr barry indeed for his last benefit the prince of wales commanded othello  quin acted iago to barrys othello but strange to relate with the change of characters and the command the house to that old favorite was very bad there was not any farce that night nor any new play at covent garden from the year      till       the last character mr quin acted as a regular engaged performer was on the conclusive night but two in the season may  0      horatio in the air penitent  lothario barry and calista mrs cibber the best calista i ever saw and most likely at my time of life that i ever shall  barry not happy in lothario  in march       his royal highness frederick prince of wales died when the theaters were shut up for three weeks which proves miss bellamys assertion wrong as to her being at leicesterhouse and the princess of wales patronizing her benefit etc  the play to be the siege of damascus wishing to see their favorite veteran quin in his character of caled which if the reader will observe must be erroneous for that year miss bellamy was at drury lane theater and mr davies must be wrong in his date for this was the year of the run of romeo and juliet when mrs cibber was at covent garden see bill of romeo and juliet vol   page      the day his royal highness died the tragedy of jane shore was appointed at covent garden for the benefit of mr ryan gloster mr quin shore mr ryan hastings mr barry alicia mrs cibber jane shore mrs woffington and that might certainly be admitted as tolerable  so different was the practice between then and now relative to the principal performers acting on benefit nights in london that mr garrick acted every year from the first to the middling class of performers in general  mrs woffi gton the season following quitted covent garden for dublin where she was held in such high estimation as to have her salary of four hundred pounds doubled the second and third winter which the manager from an acknowledged sense of her value judged a debt due to her merit and his own interest she had also two benefits each season in dublin mr victor gives the following description of that lady  so generous was her conduct though she seldom acted less than four nights a week that she never disappointed one audience in three winters either by real or affected illness and yet i have often seen her on the stage when she ought to have been in her bed  mr hitchcock adds the following   to her honor be it ever remembered that whilst thus in the zenith of her glory courted and ressed by all ranks and degrees it made no altation in her behavior she remained the same gy affable obliging goodnatured woffington to every one around her she had none of those occasional illnesses which i have sometimes seen assumed by captial performers to the great vexation and loss of the manager and disappointment of the public she always acted four times each week not the lowest performer in the theater did she refuse playing for out of    benefits she acted in    and one of the other two was for a mrs lee who chose to treat the town with an exhibiin of her own juliet  such traits of character must endear the memory of mrs woffington to every lover of the drama    mrs cibbers benefit early in march      was zara revived ozman mr barry zara mrs cibber   mr quin took othello as beforementioned mr barry romeo and juliet  mrs woffington the constant couple  mr cookes benefit was on friday previous to prince fredericks burial when a capital blunder occurred  as mr quins name was printed in capitals for the part of young bevil  but mr barry acted the part  indiana by mrs cibber who hitherto has not been and in all probability never will be matched in that character her manner of saying to mr sealand sir if you will pay the money to a servant it will do as well  and the whole of her last scene in that play was so truly affecting expressive and natural that she really caught the ball which all other indianas have been running after in vain  i knw it is said that first impressions do a great deal but i can also assert that from mr garrick mr quin mrs bellamy mrs crawford and others i could convey to any hearer a strong idea of their manners tones etc which would be acknowledged and allowed as real traits by the most rigid observer now existing but mrs cibbers excellence was of that superior kind that i can only retain her in my minds eye not that all her characters were equally astonishing for mrs cibber was but a mere mortal yet her alicia constance ophelia indiana juliet etc were truly her own neat simplicity of manners in comedy was equally so but her fine ladies and parts of striking humor had better be as they are forgotten this is a great character but a just one  the season concluded the two last nights with romeo and juliet without any farce or dance etc  drury lane        its worthy observation that what leads historical regsters perpetually into error is the confounding the seasons for as the theaters always open in september and do not close till early in the following summer not only the public but the performers themselves are too apt to mistake one year for the other from two dates being unavoidaly connected with one season many particulars of these times are related in my first volume  the company remained much as the year before as i do not remember any particular desertions mr mossop and mr ross were added and of great additional strength for they promised greatly from their first appearances  mr mossops entree was in richard then in zanga  and much applauded mr ross in young bevil  mr dexter also made his appearance that year and astonished every one in the character of oroonoko his merit had such an effect at first as to promise wonders and he was prognosticated a powerful adversary to barry in the lovers but when he left his honest black his white promised nothing it was a vacuum and he sunk into oblivion he went to dublin from whence he came he had been educated in the college there was in high esteem as a gentleman and though not an actor of the first class was gentlemanlike in his deportment had a pleasing voice and played second to mr sheridan but he did not live many years he was rather dejected at not succeeding on the stage in a more elevated style  mr wilder removed this year to drury lane did very little at either theater but was much applauded when he sung for women love kissing as well as the men   n b mr wilder played macbeth forty nights in dublin        the fair penitent was often acted this season horatio mr mossop altamont mr ross sciolto mr berry lothario mr garrick calista miss bellamy   mr garrick was the only gentleman i ever saw make the character of lothario truly conspicuous  alfred was revived at infinite expense and succeeded likewise eastward hoe for the lordmayors day when the practice of acting the london cuckolds was abolished at that theater but the play was driven off the stage  every man in his humor was next revived and with great success that comedy increased in public estimation for some seasons indeed every part in that production of old dens was so well acted it was hard to point out how any one in that very difficult composition could be amended it was a lucky stroke for woodwards adancement with the town his performance of captain bobadil was wonderful  the shepherds lottery was a very pretty musical piece  master vernon late mr vernon made his first appearance in that little opera the duet of by the pale light of the moon was always encored at that time when sung by mr vernon and miss norris in that piece  harlequin ranger also was much admired  woodward was an excellent harlequin in his youth he had been taught that motley character by mr rich and had well observed that gentlemans inructions  covent garden        mr quin had retired from the stage may      in march      and march      he came from bath purposely to play falstaff in the first part of king henry iv for his friend mr ryans benefit he after that left him a legacy and made him a present declaring he grew infirm and would not whistle falstaff  mrs woffington continued in ireland so mr barry and mrs cibber had all their own sway  the siege of damascus was revived  barry phocyas and mrs cibber eudocia mrs cibber also played lady townly not much to her credit venice preserved was likewise acted when barry made his appearance as jaffier he had usually played pierre and his figure was pleasing and commanding beyond description in that character mrs cibbers belvidera was a nonsuch  mr rich revived that year the necromancer or harlequin doctor faustus the galleries liked such a dismal sight then but i do not think it would be now tolerated it was not pleasing to me at that time who thought no paradise could exceed a playhouse  woodward revived dr faustus with new scenery and more liveliness several years after at covent garden when it answered to the amusement of the public and the coffers of covent garden treasury  in february after several years promise out came harlequin sorcerer which made old drury tremble for any thing like the rage after that pantomime i never remember  in november        when mr barry and mr sparks were performing bajazet and i amerlane arpasia mrs cibber one of the gentlemen was so suddenly out in his part that the play could not proceed after a considerable pause mrs cibber said gentlemen it is not my turn to speak after which the play proceeded without anv other blunder this only is mentioned to prove great actors as well as small are liable to bners mrs cibber remains unrivalled in arpasia particularly in the frenzy speech of the last at  miss macklin that season played lady townly for her fathers benefit also jane shore twice early in the season  mrs cibber played lady macbeth the first time for her own benefit  the season closed with romeo and juliet and the sorcerer  drury lane        the company much as before only the los of mrs ward who was neither wanted nor regretted as miss bellamys youth fashion dress etc aided with mr garricks powerful assistance enabled her to make a tolerable stand in tragedy against mrs cibber which mrs ward was by no means equal to eugenia was acted but did not succeed on the english stage notwithstanding its being in great reputation then at paris and the rev mr frances the author or rather translator was in high rank and esteem in london  mr footes farce of taste was produced that season  lady pentweazle by mr worsendale a genius of much wit and humor but it met with a similar fate to gil blas  mr garricks speaking the prologue which he wrote for that farce of taste was judged a masterpiece and the prologue now speaks for itself though alas garrick cannot  the gamester was acted  mr garrick wonderful  ay most wonderful in beverley  boadicia  revived by mr glover  also the genii a pantomime the silent woman and the brothers a tragedy by dr young who gave the profits of his three nights as an author to a public charity  but the amount not answering his wishes and expectations he generously made up the sum to one thousand pounds  covent garden        mr barry and mrs cibber were in high estimation and to particular plays drew good houses but unless to a pantomime or something of particular attraction the boxes were often very thin at the early part of the season whereas drury lane was constantly attended  thin boxes on any night was seldom seen there as a neatness decorum and regularity pervaded the whole however mr rich was very industrious that season  mrs bland was engaged from ireland who had made great progress on the dublin stage mr giffard junior made his appearance in lear a very improper character the play was wretchedly acted when compared with the performance of the same piece at the rival theater  or indeed without any comparison at all  signor maanesi and signora bugiani were that season engaged two inimitable dancers the ladys countenance was the most expressive and strong that can be imagined their burletta manner gave strong and neat conveyance to whatever they attempted they drew a great deal of money and indeed that luck was not to be wondered at i have never seen such good comic dancers before or since  mr cook and miss hilliard who were excellent as dancers in their way were also continued the dances were in such estimation as often to supply the want of a farce  the fair was again revived that year to introduce mr madox the famous man on the wire who was in the year      drowned on his passage to ireland as was theophilus cibber and several performers  besides the dancers mentioned at covent garden that season there were several good ones above mediocrity monsieur grandchamps and madame caargo  saturday january the thirteenth the sorcerer was again produced and continued with almost equal effect to the finishing of the season it was helped by an additional fountain scene the machiry of which i thin surpased any pantomime quirk i remember and should be now intrduced  mr smiths fi appearance was on monday jan        i the character of theodosius acted four successive nghts  the arl of essex a tragedy written by mr jones an irish bricklayer was acted that year and had a considerable n  those who saw mr barry in essex eed not be reminded that for attitude and patheic expression of voice and countenance they have not beheld a parallel to that gentlemans prnouncing in the last act when the lieutenant es the arl to proceed to immediate execution ex turns to the lieutenant pointing to his countess fainting on the ground and replies  o lok there  the whole pit of critics actually burst into tears and then shook the theater with unbounded and repeated applause accompanied wih huzzas  the play was well acted  mrs nd was happy in person and manner in queen izabeth which luckily placed her in a rank of nation  to relate that mrs cibber as the countess of rutland though a short part was exllent would be superfluous her epilogue wtten by mr garrick to whom she was to rern the winter following was a powerful assistant to the play  that was to my suppsition the est eason mr rich had ever experienced in my mmory  mr barry was at that time in the prime of life as to health and vigor and mrs cibber also at er best no wonder such a pair of lovers obtand the triumph they were entitled to indeed  a pity they were ever separated for no two persons were so calculated to assist each other by voice manner and real feeling as mr barry and mrs cibber  mr smiths second part on the stage was southampton in the play of essex  mrs cibbers benefit that year was all for love with her neat little piece of the oracle  on saturday may         the season closed with romeo and juliet by mr barry and mrs cibber which proved a separation of two lovers doomed never  no never to meet again  i here publish a bill of that season to show how difficult it must have been to satisfy eager claimants for being distinguished  it occasioned much murmuring sometimes a lady took the lead and her rival was bottomed and the hero placed in the middle but all would not do and in the year      the line of performed was obliterated and the great letters for the principal were continued which mr kemble for his own ease and quiet of the theater has entirely banished  for the benefit of signor maranesi and miss hilliard  theater royal in covent garden the part of pyrrhus to be performed pylades by mr ridout  phoenix by mr anderson the part of orestes to be performed cephisa mrs barrington  cleone mrs griffith the part of hermione to be performed and the part of andromache to be performed   with several entertainments of dancing by end of act second a new dance called end of act third the scots dance end of act fourth a mock minuet end of the play a minuet and louvre   to which will be added a musical farce acted there but twice called the part of clerimont by mr low  by mr collins frederick by mr cushing wood by mr bennett lucy by miss pit and the part of harriet by mrs chambers   boxes  s  pit  s  first gall  s  upper gall  s  drury lane        mrs cibber at high terms was engaged a drury lane  her first appearance was in moimia  chamont mr garrick castalio mr ross and it is certain in love characters mrs cibber never ppeared to such advantage as when with mr marry romeo and juliet was attractive when she and mr garrick acted in those parts but still in the love scenes she wanted her former romeo mr garrick indeed in the scenes of fire had the superiority but as the lover barry was then and is unrivalled and will be till such another starts up but think i may prophecy that will not happen in my time were i to double my years with renovated youth  indeed let a theatrical historian look back and he will not find an actor so excellent as a lover from the days of betterton as mr barry to the present stagestrut hour  miss macklin was then engaged and her mother from covent garden miss m at that time was a vry fashionable actress accomplished and seemed to promise well but having acquired a sufficiency and grown tired of the profession she retired several years ago from the stage and died in some degree of affluence  that season virginia was produced in february  mr garrick did virginius mossop apus mrs cibber virginia and marcia was the rt appearance of mrs graham the late mrs yates who afterward stood forth as an honor to the british stage  her beautiful figure and merits are too well remembered to need encom or repetition here mrs graham was not considered of much promise by mr garrick as se was not retained  but mrs cibbers illnes mr murphys incessant pains with mr garricks necessities from mrs cibbers indisposition was a lucky circumstance for that lady and the pblic and produced that charming and beautiful atress who otherwise had pined unknown from e first season and never been more remembered but like a lily drooping pined and died  mr garrick wrote the following introductory lines for her in february      if novelties can please to night we have two  though english both yet spare em as they are new  to one at least your usual favor show  a female asks it can a man say no should you indulge our a new actress novice yet unseen and crown her with your hands a tragic queen ould you with smiles a confidence impart to calm those fears which speak a feeling heart  each struggle of ingenuous shame  curbs a genius in its road to fame with one wish more her whole ambition ends  she hopes some merit to deserve such friends   creusa was produced that season with a double epilogue  the one by mrs pritchard the other by miss haughton the knights by mr foot and fortunatus a very pleasing pantomime by mr woodward  madame marriot was the colombine that and for several seasons  a beautiful and pleasing figure  covent garden        mr barry having lost mrs cibber as his juliet lamented thus in his prologue  in such sad plight what could poor romeo do why faith like modern lovers seek a new and happy shall i think me in my choice if she is approved of by the public voice   miss nossiter on wednesday october  0 made her first appearance she was not much more than the age of juliet was possessed of a handsome fortune and genteel education strong sensibility and feeling and what added to the performance romeo and juliet were really in love and well known to be so she threw strokes in many passages that were not only genuine but forcible and bad fair in time to supply the place of a cibber but notwithstanding the advantages of youth and meeting wonderful encouragement nature had not endowed her with voice and powers sufficient for the arduous task to stand against her rival and they appeared weakened the more she was seen instead of gaining ground  indeed i think i never saw her play so well as the first season neither was her voice musical and her mouth was remarkably wide but she drew to all her characters she acted juliet a number of nights her second part was belvidera and in the mad scene did wonders from tuition attention and strong understanding rutland the third and philoclea brought forward and wrote purposely to show her to advantage by macnamara morgan  mr barry took infinite pains with pyrocles mr smith did musidorus but the tragedy was a strange lame sick play and with difficulty languished till the ninth day when poor philoclea died a natural death and was not basely and cruelly murdered as mrs bellamy falsely and invidiously relates as mr smith can testify for on the contrary the applause was so violent the first night of representation and the irish gentlemens party so strong in its support that mrs bland was obliged to repeat a coarse epilogue which was as coarsely spoken  constantine was also produced at covent garden that year and shared an unhappy fate miss bellamy returned here from drury lane but the relation in her book relative to that matter being far from authentic for the sake of theatrical truth and history i give the following accounts thus far indeed she acknowledges viz the frequent mistakes which i find i have made in the chronology of my theatrical anecdotes will i hope be imputed to my reciting them as i have already observed entirely from memory and the deviation i trust will be excused by my readers as the incidents themselves though perhaps erroneous in point of time are real facts and was i now to set about corecting the error by an alteration of the dtes i fear as many of the happened at so distant a period such a step would only be productive of greater mstakes i have received some corrections on this head from mr wilkinson manager of the york company for which i acknowledge myself much obliged to hi though i cannot for the reason just given avail yself of them    as ate wilkinson i here note that constantine was acted that season and shared an unhappy fate mis bellamys situation was as she has described in fluvia truth but the play was acted to a fie house on its first night of representation and the third act received loud applauses particularly from barrys conclusion of it he also received three plaudits from his manner of pronouncing these two lines in the prologue  their heroes seem of a superior state great in their virtues in their vices great after the third act it grew very languid and the crtain dropped with the audience more fatigued than enraged  miss bellamy must have been determinably wrong as to her account of constantine being damned the first night of representation it was first acted on saturday february         also on the monday and tuesday following the third ght as usual for the benefit of the author but the play was unfortunately so ill attended and disapproved that it was again put up on thursday february    the fourth night for the benefit o the author  the following insertion was at the bottom of the bill   n b the receipt of last night not answering mr rich has taken it to himself  on saturday next by his majestys command  which significantly insinuated constantine was in  decline had the play met a better fate miss bellamys situation was such as must have precluded it some time as that tragedy was with difficulty hurried through the empress fulvia being brought to bed that very fourth night and like a woman of spirit she appeared soon after in the penitent jane shore for her own benefit mr foot acted in the knights that said evening and gave an imitation of mr garrick in the prologue who had wrote and spoke that season the following lines  i read no greek sir  when i was at school terence wrote prologues  terence was no fool which lines foot thus ridiculed and in manner very like the garrick and with effect  i read no greek sir  when i was at school the usher wrote prologues  the usher was no fool   miss bellamy mentions also the great expense mr rich was at in reviving busirus which is a dream of her own invention as mr barry revived that play monday march         for his own benefit two years later than her account and was acted to a very indifferent house the stage was built but the seats were empty mr foot acted hartop in the knights that evening to oblige and serve mr barry  mrs bellamy also relates that on her return to covent garden on her appearing in juliet with barry that the tragedy had a run exceeding that of opposition    0 it is so little connected with truth and is so very erroneous that on the contrary when she returned to covent garden on the seasons opening in the autumn      miss nossiter was as beforementioned in my memoirs the juliet which character miss bellamy at that time never had acted with mr barry nor ever did till so late as the   th of december      her first appearance in      on her return was on tuesday the  0th of november in a very improper character as was her second on thursday november    her situation considered she was thus announced in the bills athenais by miss bellamy her first appearance this stage these three years after the chaste athenais the pure monimia followed which led to strange ideas that castalio most certainly had been acquainted with that lady long before the third act after that season and not before it was necessary she wisely changed the appellation of miss to mrs bellamy  that ladys life being published my own remarks and intimacy with her as an acquaintance friend and actress will not i hope make the following genuine letters unexceptionable as it draws as near to the finish of that once admired character as the feeling heart or eye would wish to penetrate  dear sir i have been so out of spirits that i have not been able to do any thing but correct my apology which i have finished with an address to her grace of devonshire who has honored me with a pension thalia has not yet visited me therefore i have laid my comedy in lavender for soe favorite of the laughing muse to fiish i am engaged in a polemical controversy which i hope to gain reputation by though my language is rather severe my leg is very bad my pocket very low and my spirits quite gone i have had a bill just brought me of sixtyeight pounds for mr willets amicable suit as well as some bils i gave which makes me very uneasy one to usher for twentynine for which he chose to introduce an officer to escort me once more to parsons and absolutely must get the rules of the kings bench if i do not pay the money on saturday i have not heard from mr  i suppose his letter and visit were only a spurt of feeling which soon subsided my son has settled a hundred pounds a year but a guinea more i cannot expect as he is really distressed himself and he was inconvenienced by advancing ten pounds could i have got a frank which i will try again for i will send you the lines to her grace but you must not show them i fear i shall never be able to walk without assistance and to add to my comforts i have a cough that tears me to pieces i am removed to my doctors no   clevelandrow st jamess and am so highminded as to lodge up two pair of stairs which really may be compared to jacobs ladder it ives me singular pleasure to hear you are better your friend mrs  has kicked down the pail i find miss brunton bids fair to share reputation with mrs siddons i had the great honor or being wrote to by mr digby to wait upon her majesty on thursday but my indispsition prevents my having that happiness at present which is doubly distressful as i am in real want on all sides at present yet with all my calamities i have the happiness of being regarded by men of the first sense whose friendship i am proud of  among the number you are st down return my regard by taking care of your health which no person more sincerely wishes than my dear tate  your friend and servant g a bellamy   the gentleman alluded to in the foregoing letter sent her  0l yet she wanted ditto ditto as the instant it was got the same instant was it squandered  my dear sir i should immediately have thanked you for your last favor but have been so afflicted with the rheumatism in my right arm i can hardly hold a pen which impedes my sixth volume were i to make so many alterations as you point out necessary as to facts i must write the whole over again as i wrote merely from memory and as i have acknowledged your wishedfor alterations in print my incorrectness i hope will be excused i hope to see you soon in london and in a happier situation than at present as every being to whom i was the least indebted has called upon m by arrest and copies of writs which has accumulated my demands to above four times what they were originally as to bell i have no cause of complaint in money affairs as he stood forth for me in my distress and as the success of the books was precarious i only am concerned he did not according to promise give me the stipulated sets for the subscribers before he disposed of his i desire you will not pay postage for i shall always be happy to hear from you as i am most sincerely  with great esteem your humble servant g a bellamy charlesstreet april the   th  my dear tate i wrote some months ago to thank you for your ham but have had no answer after having parted with my last guinea and even my necessaries to avert my present unpleasing residence in order to obtain the rules i was obliged to draw upon my son and my lovely patroness the duchess of devonshire up to michaelmas quarter the impositions are incredible as the people live by the distresses of others i am obliged to give sixteen shillings a week for an apartment  a chandlers shop in front backwards a carpenters and what with the swing of boards the screaming of three illnatured brats the sweet voice of the lady of the mansion who is particularly vociferous with all the gossips who owe her a penny with a coffeemill which is often in use and is as noisy as london bridge when the tide is coming in makes such unpleasing sounds it is impossible to think of any thing added to this i have not a place for a servant could i raise sufficient to furnish me an apartment i should be tolerably easy as i have begun a work which seems to flatter success though a great undertaking the characters of my own times  could i raise by subscription to enable me to obtain quiet i could live at half the expense and be as easy as my situation would admit they tell me it is my birth day that is the day of the month for i see nobody not even the person i most esteem upon earth and who flatters me he is my friend mr a  if you should happen to see mr  perhaps upon this occasion he might stand my friend could i borrow about thirty or forty pounds for a year i could with certainty repay it as i am determined to receive no visits and to live as frugal as possible indeed for want of exercise i have no appetite and am reduced to one old cotton gown  oh what a falling off is there but i regret it less as i cannot stir alone without difficulty  if you write direct to no    eliotsrow st georges fields and believe me most sincerely yours  g a bellamy may         dear tate i received yours yesterday and am surprised at your losing so many of your performers in answer to my not changing my lodging  i cannot without furniture for the place is overtocked and i pay sixteen shillings a week for a gkennel and have not even a bed for my id i have been obliged to draw for my annuity till christmas as every thing here is pid for beforehand i do not see bell but will convey your request to him dodsley i purpose for my man if i cannot get a friend to pay the expense upon my own account it is the characters of the time since fortyfive and hope to have permission to dedicate it to royalty  not his royal highness again how can you ask me how i came to be involved i told you before i paid part of my old debts and renewed securities for the remainder which indiscretion has been productive of every distress as well as reproach in lieu of their being sensible that i paid all i received and was most cruelly deceived in the expectation of paying every body i am as lame as ever and as the bone can never be set shall never be able to wlk without assistance i suppose mrs crawford will bring you money  such unprincipled people are generally lucky a strange remark from my friend bellamy  i fear it would be only losing time to apply to mr  as he answered neither of my letters if i could get furniture i could get a house for a trifle where at least i should enjoy quiet  i am most sincerely your affectionate humble servant g a bellamy eliotsrow may the   th  dear sir i have the pleasure to inform you mr woodward gained his cause the twentyfourth of last month by which i have not got any thing but the credit of confuting willet if you read the morning chronicle of the fourth of august you will find my letter to the rev mr gaboll which will explain the affair i have wrote an answer to willets pamphlet but am advised not to publish it till winter i was in hopes to have been able to furnish an apartment which would have enabled me to have lived cheap and enjoy quiet which is impossible in my present residence but nothing but disappointment and vexation attends me nor can i settle to any thing of consequence where i am i am greatly afraid i have some how offended mr  which would give me more pain than his withdrawing his assistance in almost the certainty of money i took a small house and disposed of her grace of devonshires quarter to put up fixtures etc but credit i cannot hope in the predicament i now stand and my annuity will not be clear till christmas i hope mr bell has sent you the beginning i very seldom see him but had i had the power i should have saved him the trouble i hope the races will bring you a good harvest  you may see me as i really am an old woman in this days chronicle and soon as a magdalen mr woodfall is an old acquaintance and has all my leisure hours  when you have time let me hear from you as ou have no correspondent who has a more sincere regard for you  i am with esteem your humble servant g a bellamy no    eliotsrow st georges fields august    i shall in winter present you with your epitaph but let the galled horse wince you have no occasion     my worthy friend you need not enforce my error i am too sensible of it for though the debts i have given resh security for were such as would not have oppressed me yet with the unexpected ideas i had of security in being able to pay i indiscreetly not only paid every guinea i received from a generous public but gave fresh securities what i shall do is now a matter of great vexation  but gods will be done  i am concerned to hear of your ill state of health i sincerely wish i had the power as i have the inclination to show myself essentially your friend which epithet you have favored me with you do not inform me if mr  received my letters if he has there is little hopes i fear from that quarter i wish you had shown him my letter the one i received with only the words god for ever bless you seemed by the great care i the envelope to speak more than the simple benediction but nothing more by the care of the messenger i did imagine it came from my worthy benedictor if you have an opportunity mention this event as i  write to a person utterly unknown   correct the affair of chalmers the  meeting in scotland is  sixth volume   understand your  i imagine you do not attend to  e se i would send you  soon to publish i have  answered perhaps in  but his ignorance and  let me entreat you to take care of yourself for the sake of your family and intimates for few indeed deserve the appellation of but believe me most sincerely so and with esteem while  g a bellamy sept     a few months after the last letter the goodnatured and unthinking bellamy by her death paid all her debts  i hope she is happy as she deavoured to promote to the comforts of others and never employed either riches or talents when  affluence and splendour to render any one miseble  bellamys letters lead me to fear that too many reasons performers and others may look back on  their former days and pronounce the only comfort the review affords is that they are past  ill fate en attends geniusses for as they possess more sales of quickness they are more subject to frailties which occasions them to feel at times a want of  more substantial than good spirits to feed and  them as the following wellfancied epistle  prove  it is an original for the which favor  stnd indebted to the ingenious dr miller of doncaster who is now busily employed on a ame composition for psalmody it was wrote by e late true son of momus the wellknown george alexander stevens and i trust the insertion of it will be acceptable as the novelty of his ideas will entertain his genius being at that time in its full vigor  yarmouth gaol dear sir when i parted from you at doncaster i imagined long before this to have met with some oddities worth acquainting you with it is grown a fashion of late to write lives  i have now and for a long time have had leisure enough to undertake mine  but want materials for the latter part of it for my existence now cannot properly be called living but what the painters term still life having ever since february    been confined in this town gaol for a london debt  as a hunted deer is always shunned by the happier herd so am i deserted by the company norwich company  my share taken off and no support left me save what my wife can spare me out of hers  deserted in my utmost need by those my former bounty fed  with an economy which till now i was a stranger to i have made shift hitherto to victual my little garrison but then it has been with the aid of my good friends and allies  my clothes  this weeks eating finishes my last waistcoat and next i must atone for my errors on bread and water  themistocles had so many towns to furnish his table and a whole city bore the charge of his meals in some respects i am like him for i am furnished by the labors of a multitude  a wig has fed me two days  the trimmings of a waistcoat as long  a pair of velvet breeches paid my washer woman and a ruffled shirt has found me in shaving  my coats i swallowed by degrees the sleeves i breakfasted upon for weeks  the body skirts etc served me for dinner two months  my silk stockings have paid my lodgings and two pair of new pumps enabled me to smoke several pipes it is incredible how my appetite barometer like rises in proportion as my necessities make their terrible advances i here could say something droll about a good stomach but it is ill jesting with edge tools and i am sure that is the sharpest thing about me  you may think i can have no sense of my condition that while i am thus wretched i should offer at ridicule but sir people constitutioned like me with a disproportionate levity of spirits are always most merry when they are most miserable and quicken like the eyes of the consumptive which are always brightest the nearer a patient approaches to dissolution  however sir to show you i am not entirely lost to all reflection i think myself poor enough to want a favor and humble enough to ask it here  sir i might make an encomium on your goodnature and humanity etc  but i shall not pay so bad a compliment to your understanding as to endeavor by a parade of phrases to win it over to my interest if you could any night at a concert make a small collection for me it might be a means of obtaining my liberty and you well know sir the first people of rank abroad will perform the most friendly offices for the sick be not therefore offended at the request of a poor though a deservedly punished debtor  g a stevens   from this facetious letter of george stevenss and mrs bellamys latter account we must remember in this stagejournal i was busily employed a few pages back with an account of the season       where i still am supposing mysel giving an account though i have been wandering on matters not relative thereto but from mrs bellamy and the other personages mentioned of at that time i must add that mrs gregory also made her first appearance on any stage in the character of hermione thursday january  0      it was falsely reported that mr barry refused playing orestes fearing her success should interfere with miss nossiters  the story gained such credit that he judged it necessary to publish an advertisement in all the papers contradicting the malicious propagation that lady grew into the highest fashion afterward at the dublin theater she married a gentleman bred to the bar in ireland a mr fitzhenry a gentleman of family and abilities and took leave of the public at dublin within these four or five seasons having wisely provided from her gains on the stage to live decently and comfortably off  after all he storms of a theatrical life i ever cast a wihful eye whenever i read success accompanied with such comfortable finishings  this was the first winter also for italian  at covent garden theater  signora nicolina better known and remembered from the character of spilletta which she inimitably performed in the opera of gli amanti gelosi wa particularly admired in the italian song  the hat which some years since has been translated introduced and sung by diana in the pleasing opera of lionel and clarissa the burlettas that year brought mr rich a great deal of money  mr garrick thus alludes to their success i as your catrer would provide you dishes dressed to your palates seasoned to your wishes  say but youre tired with boiled and roast at home we too can send for niceties from rome to please your taste will spare not pains nor money discard sirloins and get you maccaroni whatever new gusto for a time may reign shakspeare and beef will have their turn again   the season again closed at covent garden wednesday the twentysecond of may with romeo and juliet and harlequin sorcerer  mr shuter had quitted drury lane for covent garden where he grew weekly ay nightly nt favor with the public mrs bland was become mrs hamilton  it is very strange but true that shuter was only looked upon as a young man of tolerable merit at drury lane the old man in lethe his principal part  but at covent garden he seemed a sudden blaze of light  this certainly must be allowed an instance that with genius opportunity is every thing but the misfortune is without talents and genius actor will be claming the same right of ascending the throne of merit but the ladder suddenly breaks and down drops dido  drury lane        the company remained much as the year before mr garrick was truly inimitable in don john  mrs clive was equal in the mother mr yates in the old whimsical character of don antonio  and the whole comedy was supported as it might be wished every play should be  barbarossa was produced that year and was much followed  the chances revived and altered by mr garrick at the command of his late majesty had a great run  and coriolanus was gt up in which character mr mossop raised his reputation mr garrick was a quick general and it is most probable mr mossop would not have had the luck of that play being produced at such expense but that mr garrick was eager to get the start of the rival theater where it was preparing with infinite pomp and splendor the very idea of a triumphal procession at covent garden struck terror to the whole host of drury however big they looked and strutted on common occasions  the sabatinis were engaged this year at a great expense as dancers they appeared in two new ballads the one called the pandours the other the italian fishermen but they were both utterly disapproved and did not appear six nights during the whole winter  the drummer also was revived and tolerably well received and followed  the faries an opera from shakspeares midsummer nights dream was that year introduced it was well performed and with good success aided not a little by an excellent prologue and as excellently spoken by mr garrick  giordani and passerini were of great additional service a lysander and hermia  the mistake was revived for woodwards benefit don carlos mr garrick sancho mr woodward lopez mr yates jacinha mrs clive leonora mrs pritchard   mercury harlequin was the new pantomim that season  covent garden        barry was invited to dublin on a salary of  00l and two benefits mr victor and mr sowden were the desperate undertakers after sheridans abdication  miss nossiter mr barrys favorite juliet made a point of having five hundred pounds and mrs gregory who had only appeared in two characters the winter before at covent garden once in hermione and in alicia twice once for mr sparks and another night for mrs bellamy at three hundred pounds  barry on his departure from england denounced ruin on mr rich by his desertion but such threats were weak in the extreme it is true mr sheridans romeo was vain and ridiculous immediately after barrys but barry forgot that with the aid and nvelty of new performers and mr richs neverfailing support pantomime and with a theater in london where the metropolis can pour in such incredible numbers it must be the managers own fault indeed if he be ruined by the loss of any performer whatever  mr sheridan by the great riot in dublin being obliged to leave that city occasioned by the representation of mahomet in february      in which perturbation mrs woffington was supposed to have aided as a party concerned in real state politics which certainly has not any connection or business within the walls of a theater that lady was also obliged to retire from ireland at the same time with mr sheridan  it is one of the most remarkable riots that ever occurred in any theater and well worthy of being read by every admirer of theatrical history it would be impertinent to introduce it here as it must be well known or should be to all theatrical persons those who have not been made acquainted with that period of the early part of the established irish stage will find it all fully explained in a modern volume lately printed by mr hitchcock a gentleman of great ability and integrity of the dublin theater  it gives a general view of the irish theater from its commencement down to the year      and will well repay the trouble of a little attention i can answer as for myself that i often take mr hitchcocks book up for information  mr sheridan this year came over and was engaged by mr rich in the autumn      the season opened with some of mr richs stock comedies very ill acted indeed and as dingily dressed  october         mrs green made her appearance from dublin in the character of lappet a good comic actress  much the best in chambermaids mrs heidelbergs etc since the time of mrs clive  on friday october         othello was announced with an occasional prologue spoke by mrs hamilton for the introducing mr murphy a gentleman well known and admired for his talents as an author and many very respectable qualities and often mentioned in the course of my memoirs he was to appear in the difficult and dangerous part of othello rendered at that time more hazardous than the present by the well known excellence of mr barry in that character mr murphy had many other reasons to be alarmed as he had long waged his pen of war as author of the graysinn journal and had been the terror of poets and the scourge of players  the novelty held out was a charm irresistible to attend covent garden theater  mr murphys judgment then or now would be absurd to call in question and i hold that gentleman in true regard but on the stage he certainly wanted what we behind the scenes call powers etc for great effect  after that gentlemans novelty of three nights on tuesday october the twentyfirst the nonjuror was advertised  doctor wolf mr cibber his first appearance for four years and maria mrs woffington her first appearance for three years which drew a great house  so favorite an actress and so well acquainted with persons in higher life will easily gain credit to my account she was of course greatly received and played that character as well as i could be played  on wednesday the   d of october mr sheridan made his first appearance in his esteemed character of hamlet judicious without doubt but when compared to the combined excellencies of a garrick and the pleasing powers of the winning barry he was not by any means established from that nights performance as a darling of the london audience  though in dublin not any one performer whatever even the garrick at that time would not have been universally crowned with laurel as to preference or perhaps equality but as mr macklin has ad that opinion had been jerked into the irish audience from his father dr sheridan the schoolmaster he next appeared in richard without any remarkable applause till the dying scene where he was equal to any actor if not superior to any i had then or have since seen without the aid of a flounderlike flouncing as the modern richards practice to the great pleasure approbation and universal plaudits from the galleries till i broke my leg i was much attached to that tumbing exhibition and surprising featlike agility  in november      phaedra and hippolitus was revived  theseus sheridan hippolitus smith phaedra mrs woffington and had not any farce taked to i though a play consisting of five characters only it was the custom on revived plays and invariable with new ones not to have any entertainment for the first nine or twelve nights  it would have been judged disgraceful nor did any play whatever intervene unless from illness or an unforeseen cause phaedra had not any success that year indeed though the poetry is elegant it is too learned and too languid the performers and audience seemed half asleep and the candles burned dim unless at the following passage which with the advantage of mrs woffingtons figure and new dress prepared them for the chase  come let us hunt the stag and chase the foaming boar come rouse up all the horrid monsters of the wood for there even there hippolitus will guard me after which rouse all parties on and off the stage as by mutual consent unanimously returned to their evenings nap  mr moncrifes appius was acted that season on the same story of virginia produced the year before by the rev mr crofts at drury lane but destitute of every comparative merit either as to plot incident writing or any other claim to preference and as to acting lamentably deficient one speech of mr sheridans though i never saw the play but the first night out of the six i was acted i never can forget he delivered the following lines so energetic  o by the gods i hunger for revenge i thirst i thirst for blood  for blood of appius   coriolanus was revived with great pomp  mr sheridan conveyed a masterly knowledge of the character and his immortal author old shakspeare that play drew several houses but his oedipus romeo zanga lord townly sir charles easy osmyn etc did not bear equal credit italian burlettas were attempted by a new set of italians but met with very little attraction or applause  the first was larcadia in brenta on monday the   th of november      the second entitled la famiglia de bertoldi mr murphy performed jaffier only between his first appearance and the benefits in march when he acted archer young bevil hamlet macbeth etc  mr clarke made his first appearance that season in osman in zara on thursday the  0th of october an actor that must be at this time well remembered by his brethren and the public though his talents were not strong enough to let him live long after death  a mrs glen also made her appearance that year in rutland monday february         i am right as to the dates of the month etc but mr clarke and mrs glens appearances were in october      mrs glens in february       that lady i can only remember being apt to have its on the stage  indeed strange fits off the stage ladies and gentlemen are often subject to  i have sometimes been so affected myself  mr rich revived orpheus and eurydice that season wednesday january    which drew crowds but not equal to the sorcerer nor held in great estimation that pantomime has been tried twice or thrice since then but without success  mr poitier an excellent dancer indeed wa introduced that year and greatly admired he came from the opera house at paris his first appearance was on tuesday dec         i do not recollect any very particular incidents that season  mrs bellamy revived alzira for her benefit  zamor mr murphy and the season concluded on thursday may    with the constant couple sir harry of course by mrs woffington the entertainment was orpheus and eurydice  drury lane        mr mossop was this year enticed partly owing to an affront mentioned in my memoirs over to dublin by mr victor and mr sowden to play on shares and two benefits where he only acted twentyfour nights finding he could obtain more profit for himself by acting twenty than forty nights for his employers  so in fact mr mossops great drawings in was on the other nights the inevitable occasion of great drawings out from the treasury of that theater mr garrick from the unexpected loss of mossop engaged mr murphy to supply that bulwark the others absence had occasioned to give way mr murphys first appearance was on tuesday the  0th of september      in osmyn in the mourning bride mr holland started forth in the month of october monday the   th      in the character of oroonoko supported by mrs cibber in imoinda he was a shining ornament and an honest truly agreeable man was universally beloved but death snatched him in the bloom of life and improvement and deprived the stage of an actor of merit and a worthy character  he was too apt to outherod herod  by which false judgment mistaking it for genuine fire the big manly voice became too often harsh and unpleasing in consequence when powell came in view though a suckling he soon threw holland at a distance by keeping within the bounds of nature and true spirit this sacrifice of sense and sound which i glaringly gave way to for the sake of catching momentary applause would be less practiced than it is would we once consider that the opinions of the principal leaders of fashion in every place will influence the million in a great measure and by them will be allowed followed and adopted the following lines on this subject were wrote on holland  when garrick by whatever motive led fatal to taste took travel in his head grieved for i knew the players of the age grieved i foresaw the ruin of the stage no more said i oerleaping vulgar awe shall shakspeare terror raise or pity draw catching the spirit with the poet caught the very pith and marrow of his thought our garrick acted as our shakspeare wrote but now scarce understood without a note of all his more than manly vigor gelt holland must rant and whine where garrick felt thus anxious for the widowed stage my mind with much too perfect augury divined holland poor man in hamlet makes appear what cause what mighty cause we had to fear but though no actingmerit he displays his modesty must sure deserve our praise which that the piece in all points should agree desired that hopkins might ophelia be   athelstan was produced that year written by doctor brown mr garrick did his very best to support it and the play certainly had merit and was well acted but it never recovered the chilness of the spring nor has ever taken root budded or flowered from that time to this  the winters tale introduced with an excellent prologue by mr garrick had a very considerable run mrs cibbers neat simplicity in singing the song wrote by mr garrick  come come my good shepherds our flocks we must shear etc made little perditta appear of the greatest consequence  it was well cast and the performance justified mr garricks judgment in so ordering the characters catherine and petrucio was altered into three acts on the same occasion petrucio mr woodward catherine mrs clive  he threw her down on the exit of the second act which had very near convinced the audience that petrucio was not so lordly s he assumed for mrs clive was s enraged at her fall that her talons tongue and passion were every expressive to the eyes of all beholders and it was with the utmost difficulty kate suppressed her indignation  the first representation of these pieces was on the   st of january       the apprentice was introduced that year january  d by mr murphy who spoke a prologue to that farce which was afterward inimitably and constantly repeated by mr woodward in the character of dick in which part he was excellent the farce had a great run and still continues in full effect and ever ill while a clever spirited comedian like mr lewis or mr banister jun has the apprentice entrusted to his care and guardianship  the tempest as an opera in three acts with recitative etc was introduced that season with a paltry dialogue as may be seen in the magazine of feb      signora curioni an italian singer performed in it but it was dreadfully heavy  it went through with great labor eight nights but not without the aid of the garland dance well performed by sixty children at the end of the second act and the pantomine of fortunatus or the genii after that  all is well that ends well was revived  i imagine to please woodward who was ond of acting parolies  he revived that play at dublin and also when last at covent garden but i never remember any remarkable success or pleasure received from the representation of that play though here and there it must be confessed there are scenes of merit whimsicality and genius but it never will be like the master productions of shakspeare a standing dish or an alluring spectacle to the public eye  the fair quaker was also revived that winter and was well acted but the comedy of itself has not much sterling merit and its humor and the characters are too coarse for the nice discrimination of the present age however mr garrick made the play stand its ground from the good acting of woodward and mr yates in beau mizen and flip and the parts in general not a little reinforced by the good and popular pieces the manager added as a support and the new song of hearts of oak are our ships by mr beard  the chinese festival at an immense expense was produced on saturday november        by command of his majesty king george the second see vol i page    for bill of the first night  it was in the time of the war with france  the multitude conceived it was purposely got up by mr garrick to introduce frenchmen to eat up all the bread the beef and the pudding from the englishmen and they were by artful incendiaries which are never wanting to do evil so inflamed and the hydraheaded monster was so powerful as not to let the presence even of majesty secure a decent representation it was again attempted and strongly supported on wednesday nov    after the comedy of the inconstant but the fatal night of the great riot and entire overthrow of the festival was on the tuesday following nov     essex was the play that night the earl by mr murphy  the nobility mustered all their forces drawn swords etc but the mobility against reason and their own rational entertainment like a torrent bore down all before them mr garricks house had nearly been torn to pieces infinite mischief was done the theater and john bull was exulting with triumph some nights after mr garrick advertised his performance in archer when on his entrance something murmured like  pardon pardon on which he advanced with great respect and as great firmness explained how ill he had been treated by the wanton and malignant conduct of wicked individuals both in his property fame and character  he acknowledged all favors received but unless he was that night permitted to perform his duty to the best of his abilities he was above want superior to insult and would never never appear on the stage again  while he was speaking all tumult ceased  it was indeed a calm after a storm  they seemed so struck with the truth which he asserted and addressed to them the propriety of his conduct and the injury from illiberality and wicked wantonness he had actually sustained that from the idea of censuring mr garrick unmeritedly they felt the reproach deservedly on themselves and like truehearted britons burst into such an universal according applause as for several minutes shook the fabric of old drury  harmony was settled before and behind the curtain to the mutual gain and credit of all parties as mr garrick after that for years enjoyed deservedly the wellearned smiles and unbounded favors of the public and that public in return had the happiness of seeing him in a onstant round of characters three times in the week on an average  the first actor that ever did so variously and excellently perform such a contrast of capital chara ters who but for this ucky accident perhaps might have been lost to the great regret of his admirers who never did or will take him for all in all lock upon his like again  wherever there are many enemies there will always be merit to create such envy  the particulars of the riot relative to the chinese festival may be seen in mr victors second volume page     to      i do not remember any other remarkable occurrence that year at drury lane theater except that on saturday march    mr garrick gave his first performance of lord chalkstone for mrs clives benefit which had a great run and kept the house open later than usual the season concluded with mr garricks benedick and lethe  not acted these ten years  at the theater royal in drury lane esquire lord george brilliant mr woodward lord wronglove by mr palmer sir friendly moral by mr berry lady gentle by mrs pritchard mrs conquest by mrs davies miss notable by miss macklin hartshorn by miss minors lady wronglove by mrs clive being the first time of their appearance in those characters  to which will be added a dramatic satire called  part of the pit will be laid into the boxes  covent garden        mr sheridans success at covent garden the preceding winter where he had not taken any benefitnight did not occasion inducement from mr rich to propose or mr sheridan to offer his services  mr barry returned from ireland after the harvest of a wellfought field  and in his hand miss nossiter mrs bellamy then in reputation as an actress continued still with mr rich  also mrs woffington  she and bellamy were impacable enemies  negotiations were off and on between barry and rich till november before any thing definitive occurred and mr rich as usual went dreaming on with volpone way of the world country lasses etc while drury lane seemed as secure as if only one theater was permitted in the capital of london  however on wednesday november the twelfth mr barry acted hamlet to a numerous audience and was deservedly received with rapture  but the loss sustained by mrs vincent being the ophelia a useful but an affected actress in lieu of mrs cibber made a woeful comparative play to that of mr garricks at drury lane with ostrick mr woodward and ophelia and the queen by mrs cibber and mrs pritchard indeed the only person of sterling abilities i can remember in that highly finished character of opheha since mrs cibber is mrs s kemble that lady has infinite merit in a variety of playing but where the artless the feeling and the impressive to reach the soul is requisite she need not in such departments fear the most critical review for her natural representations must live on stage record and may fearless bid defiance to satire or   if sternes maria was properly introduced as an opera character i think it would prove lucky for the author to have mrs s kemble for her representative  mr barry on the friday following his hamlet acted jaffier and strange to relate with so wonderful and so deserved a favorite and in a character where he was so truly excellent there actually were only twenty persons in the upper gallery a bad pit and i may suppose many orders and only two ladies in the sideboxes on one hand and ot three gentlemen on the other side however he season on the whole was great as was mr barrys success though i now recollect his acting henry the fifth wednesday december the third where his performance was enchanting to much the same kind of house as i have mentioned to his jaffier  miss nossiter did not make her appearance till late in the season on friday december the twelfth in the character of monimia which she performed to a crowded audience barry acted castalio so excellently that he was the only one i wish to remember  some aspiring youth will smilingly observe that when folks grow ancient they pronounce excellencies and paint beauties of their old favorites which never existed because those of the present day cannot contradict them but i have proved myself far from being insensible of the high merits of the present race of performers in many instances and wish not because i praise barrys castalio to see him were he now living in the count of narbonne as mr kemble there is himself alone and shows like a great seamark standing every flaw and pleasing those that eye him  alexander was revived with very great pomp of which mrs bellamys books give a very full account and also of her quarrel with woffington  it drew crowded audienes for many nights was first acted on thursday january the fifteenth where barry really appeared himself the leading god   king lear was revived also that year in which he was highly received and a critic pronounced to barry they gave loud huzzas  to garrick only tears   barry in the pathetic scenes had infinite met and acted all well  but the character taken in general was never seen in my opinion truly depicted with that fire neatness energy quickness and every various requisite as by the inimiable garrick in tragedy king lear was his masterpiece his macbeth excepted  italian burlettas were tried a third season but did not meet with success after the first year  they had then the same set of comic sers viz signora nicolina alias spiletta her  etc as the two years preceding spiletta drew money it must be granted but her first year e ha been universally allowed the inimitable the rming the expressive she be it observed that rlettas had not been introduced at the kings theater in the haymarket the entertainments cosisted only of the serious opera and the grand dang not any comic performers whatever either as singers or dancers  the first comic opera was on monday the   th of january la comediante fatta cantatrice the second and the b was gli amanti gelosi  mr foot on tuesday february the second ter the play of lady jane gray  lady jane mrs woffington produced his new farce of the englishman returned from paris  it was well ed was much followed and filed the pockets of manager and performer  mr rich did so well with barry foot and the revived plays that he had less dependence on pantomime that season than usual mr foot shared the nights of his farce as author and actor he performed sir charles buck and acted sir paul pliant in the double dealer and other characters to help his farce  his benefit as the author of the englishman returned was on the  th of march hamlet was the play  hamlet mr barry  queen mrs woffington  polonius mr foot  and was by every one thought a man of talents but a very bad statesman he was so convinced of his error that the day before his benefit he resigned his place at court and mr arthur was his substitute for lord chamberlain  mr barrys benefit that year was on monday march the     busiris with the knights  hartop mr foot  mrs woffingtons was ulysses and the frenchified lady mr smith on saturday april   again chose the siege of damascus and acted abudah  that performer was known then and now by the appellation of gentleman smith from that upright conduct with which he set forward and has steadfastly walked in the same path to this day by which perseverance he has reached the snug retreat of content he was at that time rising rapidly into fame as an actor therefore possessed a double claim to applause and encouragement he had supported most of mr barrys characters the winter preceding and his long continued good reception and deservings are so well known that my panegyric would be futile and impertinent  wednesday may         the season concluded with the usual old bill of fare  woffingtons sir harry and orpheus  drury lane        mr mossop returned to his allegiance and mr sheridan was reinstated in his irish government not without numerous spies and lurking enemies s barry and mossop on their trips during his absence had infused different seeds of discord which rankled and kept up the smothered flames of party and ended in mutual ruin for as mentioned in my memoirs sheridan was defeated and obliged for a time to seek refuge in england  barry at covent garden was sinking for want of variety of characters he playing only in tragedy young bevil and lord townly excepted and though he may be equalled in judgment or inferior to some performers in    0 yet his voice and countenance can neither be purchased surpassed nor acquired for the lovers  garrick being reinforced with mossop gave his company the undoubted superiority and the little tyrant  looked spoke fought and was himself a war   barrys novelty was worn out in some degree and though a darling of the publics and next to impossible he should be otherwise yet garrick carried all before him  harlequin proteus or harlequin in china was the pantomime of that year  miss pritchards promised appearance      caused much conversation and expectation this season her features fixed the eye of every beholder off the stage the face was so exquisitely handsome she was not much older than a young lady now a candidate for stage favor    0 i mean miss was her public merits cannot with any pr priety be here introduced as it would be out o all ti e and place and subversive to the plan i have adopted and observed relative to others or the present publication yet i cannot refrain for the credit of the stag to be her herald and with th trumpet of truth ound forth that her purity and good conduct may challenge the breath of slander  nvy or detraction and her undeniably good character is such that the more it is investigate  like  in open air twill blea the more and whiten to the view    mr garricks lear seemed to have gained additional strength luster and fashion  mr shuter had the year preceding revived the wonder at covent garden theater for his benefit which became in consequence a stock comedy gibby by mr shuter who was there the leading char er  don felix the hero was execrably per ated by a mr gibson mr garrick revived r ealy in the season saturday nov         the play was so well conducted gibby excepted by johnson who could speak the dialect but not act that the play was perpetually called f and relished as a perfect performance partic ly mr garricks don felix and it was equ ly attractive every year when he performed that aracte which had never before been noticed in the list of capital parts he valued himel on his reputation in performing don felix to much that he fixed on it as the last mark of genius he ever gave which was on monday ne  0      for the benefit of the theatrical  on which night after the comedy he took his farewell of the stage when more tears were fied from box pit and gallery for the loss of that truly inimitable actor than at the representaon of any tragedy seen in ancient or modern  don felix died that night and i fear without issue to claim true right and do his name  honor and justice  the male coquette written by garrick was also well received the reprisal and proteus or harlequin in china by woodward were both well approved but not very attractive  miss pritchards was a most remarkable first appearance saturday oct         the partiality for her mother from the most respectable and indulgent audience in the world mr garricks patronage and tuition and her own beautiful face which was fascinating to a degree occasioned curiosity in shoals  the mother mrs pritchard leading her daughter on in juliet as lady capulet  the tears of the young lady  the good wishes and tenderness of the town all combined made an affecting and pleasing scene  but that partiality dwindled away in the early part of the season  her second appearance was on the   th of october      in the character of lady betty modish where mrs pritchard had been often seen and was incomparable in spite of person  but the daughter wanted the mothers soul her feeling her fire her whim her imagination which here plainly shows that teaching and teaching will never do unless providence has given genius and nature to be molded  in that case the master may justly claim credit and perhaps more than is his due but without that precious gift talents which must come from the universal maker alone no master can bring a pupil however learned beyond a dull languid mediocrity to public view with eclat  i do not recollect more particulars that year except mr footes producing the author which had a great run indeed not only from the good acting of mr foot in cadwallader the out es of which character he had taken from a private family in which he gave great proof of humor satire etc but from mrs clive being not  ver in mrs cadwallader the piece had great ss and wherever it is perfectly acted and the parts of mr and mrs cadwallader are done  to in the performance that farce will ever be a and of entertainment to all who are susceptible true comic force  it is not so local and  as many of mr footes pieces but is so near nature though extravagantly drawn that the piece whenever done justice to and a favorite actor and actress in the two parts it will live on the stage for an age to come  near this period or indeed two years later the stage was favored with a new candidate for fame the eldest son of the late mr fleetwood formerly proprietor of drury lane theater  his person was elegant and handsome to his undertanding and education he also possessed intrepidity with coolness and never on any occasion was thrown off his guard so as for any opponent whatever to look or speak to him but as a gentleman  this was of infinite service to mr fleetwood as a billiard player at which amusement he was by all allowed so excellent that few would venture to hazard with him  his wellknown abilities were so highly rated by all who knew him that great expectations were formed of his stage success he performed romeo at drury lane      as i recollect on his first appearance and had a grace and ase that seemed not only to obtain but command applause yet with all these advantage his voice seemed consumptive and his powers deficient and the more he played the less he pleased either the audience or himself except in young bevil however though little accustomed to the stage there was an ase accompanied with elegance and native dignity in his deportment that take it from the first rising of the curtain to its fll he displayed more merit and gentlemanlike judgment than any first rate performer i either had at that time seen or since in that difficult first rate and accomplished character  being ambitious and of strong discernment he soon found the drama would not answer in that style of lucrative superiority at which he only aimed he therefore in less than two years experiment of stage enterprise retired from the theater and engaged i have been informed in an undertaking in the west indies where he has rapidly made a considerable fortune and is i believe at this time living in that climate enjoying the fruits of ingenuity and industry points which conjoined seldom fail eing the reward of talents and strong genius  the ambitious step mother was revived for him at drury lane in      to perform artaxerxes but without approbation  not having collected this work from notes but merely from memory mr fleetwood had not occurred to my remembrance but from having lately seen a ridiculous situation on the stage at the york heatre from beholding romeos having a real sword instead of a foil to grace his gh a circumstance very wrong to trust to even er the guide of the most cautious as hurry attention the stage uror and a thousand accidents may for want o instant reflection occasion mt alarming accidents  we often receive ts from our tage battles i myself can bear  mony to an honorable car obtained in  ed  a fencers one cause and blades  well temere too often another which ocon  hiet but to incur the hazard o certain dangerous weapons is surely neither parab nor ufferable   lately aw romeo with a real sword which the fiery i balt no sooner viewed than he kept not only a preposterous prudent distance but e down dead without an attempt at battle another instance was when mr fleetwood just mentioned was acting romeo at drury lane he had forgot his foil mr austin was the paris and not knowing his danger was determined to be courageous and fought like a lion till mr romeo who fenced well and elegantly being determined to conquer in reality whipped mr austin through the guts sans ceremony swords were then prohibited in consequence and a severe penalty inflicted for wearing one on any account accidents of that sort were more likely then to happen than at present as not any gentleman of the london theaters when dressed was ever seen without a sword by his side  a misfortune of a similar kind to that lately mentioned is that of the late celebrated mr farquhar who after being on the stage as an actor obained a commission in the army in which situation he wrote several well known and entertaining comedies the beaux stratagem constant couple the recruiting officer and several others which at that time and the present are in deserved high estimation but an unlucky accident in the year     put a period to his performing  being to play guyamor in the indian emperor who kills vasquez and having forgot to change his sword for a foil he wounded a mr price who acted vasquez dangerously though not fatally the impression which this accident made on a mind so sensible and the reflecting on what might have been the consequences determined him to relinquish a profession which might perhaps expose him to like mistakes in future  i have merely introduced this matter here for every performer seriously to consider that it is no reason but that what has not yet befallen him may unhappily at some future period ensue and not trusting to the hazard is a certain preventive to the danger  from the peril of swords permit me to return to my stage calendar and relate that miss barn now mrs abingtons first appearance at drury lane was on friday the twentyninth of october      in lady pliant  sir paul pliant mr foot  her second appearance was on the third night of the wonder in the virgn unmasked  lilliput a satire written by mr garrick was excellently acted by children and the season concluded with mr garricks performance of lord chalkstone  after the play of essex mrs pritchards queen elizabeth from indisposition was read by mrs net now living that night was appropriated for the benefit of a mrs horton a celebrated actress for some seasons after the decease of mrs oldfield but i am sorry to relate though it was on a charitable occasion and mr garrick aided the performance with his powerful assistance that neither first nor half price gave any appearance of help or spirit to support the once admired mrs horton  it was no more than sans box  sans pit  sans gallery  sans every thing   covent garden        this season opened rather languid  mr barrys lear was not attractive  alexander did something nossiter was the statira as bellamy was ill and had broke her arm woffington was on the decline but she never neglected her business though her health spirits and beauty were visibly deaying  wo plays of beaumont and fletchers wt without money and the humorous lieutenant were revived at a great expense they were well conducted and met with some success  he humourous lieutenant was performed at the command of his present majesty then prince of wales on friday the  0th of december  also mrs centlivres comedy of the rover was produced and commanded by his majesty  atered this year    0 by mr kemble which alterations were requisite as in      ned blunt actually undressed to his drawers  the london cuckolds was acted for the last time i believe on the lord mayors day  the englishman returned from paris being published as was ever the custom in those days  not locked up as at present as if afraid to see the light was acted and stood its ground tolerably assisted by mr dyer in sir charles buck miss nossiter the lucinda bellamy did not play that season except almeria for the benefit of mr sparks in march  mrs woffington that year acted lothario and the frenchified lady for her own benefit  that winter mrs gregorys fame had increased o much in ireland that she ventured over to play on shares a few nights at covent garden  her calista did the most for her she had great merit an much fire  her hermione was in some scenes very capital  mrs gregory now mrs fitzhenry some years after tried drury lane boards and was innded as a curb on mrs yates this was suspected by mrs yatess friends and the public and mrs fitzhenrys person stood no chance against the beautiful mrs yatess the irish gentlemen were too sanguine  in consequence a violent opposition took place and mrs fitzhenry notwithstanding her good character and great abilities was severely and cruelly treated a circumstance seldom happening from a london audience  but what will not spleen effect  this had nearly proved of fatal consequence to her ame as an actress in dublin the ill report being trbled to greet her return but real worth and the high esteem she was held in by the worthy baffled her enemies  she was soon reinstated in her former enviable situation of public applause and private esteem and for years her emoluments were such as to make happy the remainder of her days by a laudable and wellearned independence and she now lives beloved and feels the rapture of daily testimonies of regard paid to her unfullied reputation  performers of the old and new school may here take a hint respeting mrs fitzhenrys good and ill treatment as it plainly shows how little the stability of the best audience is to be depended upon for in my space of memory i do not recollect a more favorable reception than was that ladys in hermione and though of their own london planting yet malevolence party and spleen wished to cast her public merit and her private worth like a loathsome weed away hence we may gather and surmise it is highly needful we should urb our vanities or every one has more or less so as to prevent the overpowering our wits for the entire reliance on public favor it is plainly evident too much resembles trusting to what we judge the fast gripe of a strong sppery eel which is vanished when we fondly imagine it is most secure audiences i fear resemble each other in a more or less degree all the world over and have like actors on the expanded stage of life their different change of opinions their caprices and their contradictions if that be really the case and that they do not know their own minds but are unsteady patronize one year and abandon the next what a flaming prudent beacon should it exhibit to theatrical reflection to warn against trusting too implicitly to public applause or of depending too far on our fancied or real abilities as too surely the breaths that raise can sink us and we who hold the mirror should recollect that in the wide worlds drama the ring of fickle changes are wholly comprised in that established everrunning play called the follies of a day wherein all act their parts with applause approbation disgrace or sink into oblivion the stage with all its attractive brilliancies which at a certain time of life renders it improving and bewitching for in youth even its vexations are reconciled and connected with its pleasures yet in its highest meridian had i a dozen ns it would be the last profession i should advise or wish any one of them to adopt though i never would prevent genius or strong inclination in its pursuits for lie to many are called but few are chosen my advanced reasons do not arise from a mean opinion of the art quite the reverse but from the too frequent affronts as observed in my second volume its professors are often liable to receive from the supercilous and the domineering and what is more grating to feeling dispositions they are sometimes offered from those we have been taught t believe and look on as what are termed friends and acquaintances  and surely it is the same composition of mind the same resolution and courage which make the greatest friendships and the greatest enties and he who is too lightly reconciled after high provocation which in a little time i really am may recommend himself to the world s a christian but should hardly e trusted as a friend he italians i am told have a proverb to the purpose which is to forgive the first time shows a good man the second time a fool  for i ve once past is at the best forgotten but tener sours to hate  i have been led to this digression by the having someti es met with inuling superiority uriting with dignity when perhaps such persons could not dictate a better letter than m felt nd that is bad enough every body knows it certainly will be admitted as truly provoking to hear those who are neither possessed of talents wit or humor yet authoritatively as arrogantly casting sarcastic sneers but as cibber observes the consolation should be that such illiberal behavior seldom or never proceeds from persons remarkable for good qualities  and assuredly such superficial critics should note that it would be condered rude not to add impudent in a degree were a player to tell an eminent brewer at table with a mixed company that his lat cak of allbeer was trashy or verjuice or the wine merant that his wine was muty or the woollenper that his cloth was rotten for such real  will unavoidaby happen to the most ingous and upright trader and there cannot be a ore honorable or estmable character the best mechanic is as often put out of his workmanhip by an unlucky wheel going wrong as plays from unoreeen caues are too often illacted besides good actors and actresses are not to be picked or gathered as easy as hops for very good es are much scarcer than pine apples  nor should a piece condemned by one snarler as murdering his precious time be admitted as a reason that others must think like him and neither approve nor applaud because such a play or arce is condemned and labors unfortunately under the disapprobation of one or more overbearing and dissatisfied critic and surely no great condescension even for the advantage o untwisting the features if such flinty hearts were to yield and sometimes approve and show a benevolent face as if actuated by charitable motives i am aware and sorry to say that it is next to impossible to avoid creating enemies and real judgment freely investigated i fear is more apt to err and be warped in the wisest understandings than will be readily allowed or admitted as to matters of opinion but my experience leads me to suggest that it is enforcedly implanted in our natures to be swayed by our interests and partialtes our likings and dlikings and too often we know not why as for my own part i have frequently found it next to impossible when perchance on beholding to entire strangers boxing in the street or two game cocks fighting but that i impulsively an as it were inconceivably have felt a pity and a strong preilection in favor of one in preference to the other  ruminating on theatric usage has however produced one good effect and affords comfort to my peace of mind when i consider that after a toilsome task of thirtythree years hard duty in the theatric field with many hairbreadth scapes i have been inured and reconciled to the sufferings i have undergone from my fracture and severe illness which threatened dissolution as its consequences has relieved me from the constant stage acting before the period it would probably with consistency otherwise have happened and now i rehearse solus like major sturgeon and cry it is all over with me  farewell the plumed steeds and neighing troops as the black man in the play says for like the roman censurer i shall retire to my savine field and cultivate cabbages and can say with foot  not but there are who merit all my care pleased to applaud benevolent to spare and of such noble minds which are as nice in their judgments as in their censures they are light and right i of my audiences with truth can boast now like a truant which i often was in my youth and old boy like i have stretched far beyond my bounds and justly fear the rod of deserved correction due on coming back to my proper place where i must as in duty bound repeat my task as well as i am able and turn back from my fault of digression to my account of the season at covent garden in        mr barry in the month of january attempted to encounter with the difficult character of richard the third and am sorry to relate that he was lamentably deficient in every point in his representation of that spirited and designing monarch the which occasioned no little exultation to his rival garrick  mrs stot aias lesingham made her first appearance in desdemona on thursday november         but quickly retired and did not appear on the stage again for a considerable time after  mr richs harlequinade of the rape of proserp was also produced and attended with good fortune as it filled the houses for several nights to the wekest plays  douglas was  presented in february     and was wll but not greatly received or followed mr barrys performance was good but his figure too uh for that of the stripling and he looked worse for the youth by havig orated the simpl sh perd in a rich puckered white atin shape bre ches etc mrs woffington in tragedy certainly had great merit  in hermione jane shore etc  but the woefelt gref of lady randolph niter her fine person no accomplishments aided by novelty could reach as mrs crawford has done the play pleae but no more mr sparks was approved in old norval but was not more than tolerable at that time i did not expect to see what has turned out so contrary  that douglas is and will be for the credit of the stage a lasting ornament the story is simple natural and affecting its language elegant and beautiful and the lessons that may be observed from many passages are worthy the attention and retention of the learned the gay the giddy and the wise  i will here drop my tablet as occurrences from this season begin my own particular stage story to which volumes i reer for many theatrical anecdotes ither of others or myself the tblt i have sketched to a considerable length t being meant as an informant for any reader of quality or no quality actor or no actor to know t desirous in any year from      to      what has happened either as to traged comedy pstoral pantomime theatrical revolutions etc the production has given me an amazing deal  touble prplexity and labor i wish all the materials had been in ablr hands i think ome entertaining and improving might have been then collected as it is i can only once more repeat that i am conscious of m own defey and entreat for the many neceary allwances from the publi also from my brethren  the sock and buskin i st nothing down in malice  i truly and anxiously wish them all well and that the theaters may continue to flourish the performers be deservedly graced and favored while living then handed down with respect and pleasing history for ages to come with laurels ever green is the sincere desire of theirs and the stages much honored and obliged humble servant  tate wilkinson york sept    0 end of the tablet veluti in speculum a preparatory i take for granted that it will be readily admitted any matter resembling good sense will be more gratifying and entertaining than my accumulated work i will therefore finish the combustibles which have existed within the distracted book and volume of my brain with a few letters from persons once on a time well known in life  i have placed them so as to diversity and shall be highly pleased as well as honored should they be complimented with the acceptance of the public and allowed to be passable and entertaining  i have one plea to offer to my friends that may it is possible prove creative of pity and allowance which is that whilst i have been thus busily employed i have unluckily had domestic as well as numberless theatrical perplexities to struggle with added to pain and illness to disturb my mind though blessed be god not my spirits  it is my fate of place and surely i cannot be in lack of troubles and vexations to make my blood circulate when the happier reader recollects i am the manager of a theater and a company of comedians  letters letter i to tate wilkinson esquire i have been reflecting this half hour and let me tell you that half an hour is a great while for a woman to reflect on the predominance of selflove  the eloquence of demosthenes the orations of cicero would never have been known had they not been actuated by this allruling principle when the uncle of the younger pliny fastened his pillows to his head and ascended the burning mountain did he risque his life for curiosity alone  no  the universal passion caused his death and what is love of fame but selflove when the beneficent man rescues merit from obscurity or old age from the stings of poverty what is his motive why selflove  if he did not find his passions more fully gratified by dispensing ric es than by oarding them the beneficent man had been a miser  why did cato fall on his sword while utica was fr e did he die to save or serve his country no  but to submit to caesar or to death was the humbling alternative  his pride chose the latter when virgiius murd red his daughter was it from his love of virtue no  his hatred of appius and his opposition to the decemvirate power were his darling passions when pretty miss confines the goldfinch in an embellished cage and feeds it with her own dainty hand is it her love for the bird that prevails upon her to give herself this trouble no if she did not find her own amusements in its warblings the happy commoner would be left to seek its sustenance at large  i think shaftesbury in his moral inquiry into virtue has almost proved that there is no virtue at all that there is very little independent of selfgratification  and does not that destroy its essence i half believe and till i see a miser part with his money merely because it would make another happy or a coquette cease to adorn her person that her rival may for once have an opportunity of eclipsing her i shall hardly be inclined to alter my opinion and pray mrs baker to what motive am i to attribute young having favored me with the crude indigested sentiments i have just received why to selflove to be sure i like to hear myself talk writing whatever occurs to ones mind is but talking you know the thoughts were naturally produced by a chain of ideas with which they were connected i am alone and throwing them on paper has diverted me  besides i had a mind to let you see i am not quite such a trifler as my last might bespeak me it began with a loud laugh and ended with a poole at quadrille if i am not mistaken for i seldom read what i write  it is enough for other people to do that  ay and heaven knows a great deal too much you say  thank you sir that is generous  i love my friend should be candid with me  the postmans tap  a letter from london  one from mr wilkinson  i i kiss the seals  yours etc eliza baker edin may   letter ii to tate wilkinson esquire i thank you my dear sir for your congratulations on my arrival in scotland where bythebye i have encountered more perils than in a vyage to the indies  not to mention mountains precipices savage cataacts and more savage men i was loked up for hear a week in a village dirty dismal and desolate by a deuge of snow  i think of quitting this town in three weeks at the farthest and shall certainly pay my homage to you in your kingdom of york but not with the least design of becoming your subject all my campaigns shall end with this place and my future operations be confined to my own principality i am glad to find that your theater stands its ground though you are so unfortunate as to hobble a little  i shall let you know by a line on what day i shall be likely to see you i beg my compliments to your amiable queen and the whole royal brood believe me sincerely yours  samuel foot edinb feb    letter iii to tate wilkinson esquire i am extremely glad i did not answer your last letter but one because if i had it would have deprived me of the satisfaction of knowing that my seeming neglect had vexed you but it was occasioned by my going to aberdeen where i staid three weeks saw a fine country made several agreeable acquaintances amongst whom were the arl of aberdeen and the governor of fort augustus  though last not least  and brought home enough to make the pot boil  mr ross has been ill but we expect him every instant he has sent some people buck is one of them the rest never bore arms with martial men and therefore i can tell you nothing of their prowess you shall have a particular account of all our state affairs for your amusement as they occur  i have had a very extraordinary letter from a cousin of mine who keeps a shop about ten miles from london where he sells every thing has saved a good purse bought land and built houses what could the odd soul mean by such a proposal perhaps he thought it would be doing his noble family an acceptable service if he transplanted one of its branches from the stage to the counter but it will not do i had rather be a primrose in the wilderness than a polyanthus in a hotbed a counter is by no means my natural soil though to be sure i might find some pretty amusements in his family and almost as many employments as scrub had i might scold the maids dun the tenants and serve in the shop do not you see me with fontenelle in one hand and a cheesetaster in the other then how comfortable to be seated on an excellent new pillion ambling to london in a holidayweek buttoned up close in a warm joseph and upon arriving at a friends house pull off this dainty garment let down my cherryderry gown my cousin sells cherriderries and my cambric apron the equipping myself with a cardinal threequarters of a yard too long for the fashion and a rich handsome black satin bonnet be stuffed into the gallery at the playhouse my own pockets replete with gingerbread shrimps and oranges and my little husbands provided with a bott of charming rum punch if we can but get a front seat how delightfully will the time pass away till the play begins surrounded by such substantial blessings the honest man does not know what a favor i have done him in refusing him i suppose i shall have a few remonstrances from some of my wise uncles and aunts for i can guess who put such a project into the mans head i am sure it was not his own for in the first place i know his ideas could never reach from surry to edinburgh though all the cousins upon earth lived there and besides this he repeatedly assures me that no mortal soul knows of his writing but they may say what they please let me alone to answer them now you are grumbling at me for plaguing you with such nonsense but what can i do you will not give me a subject and therefore you must be contented with such as i can find  o by the way  what took you to york  you are horridly provoking mr wilkinson but perhaps i may find a way to be even with you  yet hang it men have not half the curiosity that women have at least they say so you see i have had patience a great while dowson is at newcastle he sent for the inimitable robson thither and gave a very notable reason for so doing  he could not live without her let me know in confidence what sort of woman mrs roach is  she is here and i believe will be engaged  why do you get up salisbury it is a horrid play  the novel is worth fifty of it have you done cymon it would certainly act well i admired it all in the reading except urgandas end   0 strong proof of its merit you will say  but perhaps i had spoiled my taste for toral at that time for i had just read sideys araia though i cannot say i was quite so enraptured w th i as when i was a girl  but it is seven oclock and i have another letter to write so adieu without any professions for i hate them and i should hate you if i thought you could have a doubt of my being with the most perfect sincerity  your unalterable and affectionate friend eliza baker edinburgh oct    i have heard here but i do not much respect my author that mrs roach is indelicate in conversation if so i shun her like a viper  i do not think there can be a stronger proof of a corrupt heart i would sooner keep company with a woman of the town whose behavior was decent than with a diana in fact if i could not discourse with her without being frightened out of my wits every time she opened her lips    letter iv to tate wilkinson esquire dear tate when i thought that you had quite forgot us behold i received a letter and a letter of a very comic kind do you seriously believe that a man of my age and great gravity will turn pimp and procure a young girl for exportation mr wilkinson had wrote to mrs chaigneau to engage a  actress  how could you imagine that i would undertake such a jobb when you have not even attempted to make it worth my while this is not an age to expect services without reward in short i must shift you from friend to friend i spoke to mr alderman forbes who is the lord mayor once more and he sent his bellman about but he played me a devilish trick for next morning i had four thousand one hundred and eighteen wenches at my door to the great terror of all my neighbors however it has greatly raised my reputation with the ladies  i never go to a pay nor do i know the person of any one of them and am told i have no great loss one dawson manages the puppes in crowstreet and mr ryder in smokalley sheridan and macklin are here and have acted occasionally at high prices but this is almost over as they are in the middle of their benefits as our parliament will be up in may the town will grow very thin indeed we should all be glad to see you and mrs wilkinson and believe you cannot fail amongst us of having a tolerable bed with bread cheese and smallbeer  mr acheson is now in the gout but will write soon all my family join me in kind compliments to mrs wilkinson and believe me dear tate your faithful  affectionate servant w chaigneau dublin mar         letter v to tate wilkinson esquire ha ha ha  be all attention  the highest adventure  no  you may untwist your features from the furl curious for hang me if you shall have a word of it yet  it is too good for the beginning of a letter but it is a noble subject for the end of one  i love to have a letter and a sermon conclude as a journey in a stagecoach does with a smack and a spirited tight flourish or as captain bobadil has it with a punto or with  in short with any other phrase you like better  how strangely have you jumbled together providence workmanship admiration and monkeys  let me see if i cannot put it into a little method for you and produce a wellturned compliment suppose me speaking for you now and addressing myself to some fair lady  the agreeable mrs baker suppose  nature madam  nature is a much cleverer word in this place than providence nature when she formed your ladyship lavished on you her choicest excellencies and displayed the glorious workmanship as a perfect pattern of her art and a proper object of universal admiration  a sensible an adorable an amiable woman  but me lord madam she took a quite contrary course with me  the sly ipsey made me a man madam there  now it is in a much better form and man  man is an infinitely more suitable word than monkey that is when used as a term of reproach as i will demonstrate a monkey makes us laugh a man oftener makes us cry a monkey breaks our china a man breaks our heart a monkey plays his tricks in order to amuse us a man sometimes plays tricks which are not amusing at all we command the monkey the man presumes to command us but in revenge we dispute his commands seldom relish them and very seldom obey them i have often seen a monkey by a pat of its pretty paw procure a kiss and a lump of sugar from its mistress and i have known the same lady refuse her husband a trifling favor though made with complacency and urged with politeness  ergo she thought the monkey the more deserving and nobler animal you have so often and so strenuously disclaimed all attempts to compliment that i dare not accuse you of it and i fancy you will not give me an inclination to do so in a hurry for fear i should oppress you with as powerful a torrent of nonsense as that you have just encountered with  would you believe that i have been asked by several gentlemen here who profss a regard for me to write a novel they have promised five hundred subscribers but as i choose not to lose the good opinion they have of my abilities i do not intend to expose myself to the mortification of convincing them that i do not deserve it  take care of yourself mr wilkinson  stand out of my way sir  i have just mounted my hobbyhorse  today i may be tired of the least perhaps tomorrow and shall gallop and prance and frisk about at a deperate rate i therefore repent if you have not a mind to be horridly spashed stand out of my way  what can e the meaning of this stupid rhapsody lord how foolish that is n w why if you interrupt me i shall never finish my career i less n e sir i never had a lover yet above half his age and pray let me introduce the poor man with a pompsity suitable to his reverence and give me leave to tell you sir that we ought to respect age that it is by no means a subject for ridicule and that we must all live to be old if we do not die when we are young i make no apology for introducing these sentiments because i am certain they are extremely edifying and very new however such offers do not come every day an estate of  00l a year and my ladyship to have been exalted to the highlands  a pretty mansion  a paternal one  a little in the gothic style indeed but agreeably situated and replete with conveniences defended from the north by a hill adorned on the south by a wood  as to prospect there are neither carts nor coaches to be sure but a pleasant heath pehaps a gliding river and the whose probably termnated by a very good winmul  i love ruralities  how comfortably migt i have enjoyed my contemplations amost this pleasing scene  but  heigho my perverse stars the idea of sixtyfive threw me into  horors  a hale man however and not frightful  but it was impossible to think o him i was extremely civil to him though  it is a whimsical air women give themselves of appearing angry with a man merely because he happens to love them thanked him for his good opinion of me talked of decency showed him my weeds were not half worn never laughed once and at last spoke very plain  i know your humanity but do not be concerned i dare say my highlander will survive it  and so you call this concluding with a tight flourish do you why yes to be sure i do but not half so sprighly a one as i would have concluded my venerable inamorato with had i been mischievous enough to have married him for i should have had a mean opinion of my conjugal tenderness if i had not led him such a dance and turned his gothic mansion so topsyturvy that after a tiresome journey of about a month oh it could not have been so long as a month the poor soul should have reposed himself quietly in the urn of his ancestors  one serious word  may the bare thought of marrying a man with the hopes of burying him be far far from the heart of your friend  eliza baker edinb april  0 my next shall be devoted to business at present i have an hundred engagements and am in too great spirits to attend to it  i must go  adieu  mattadores and favorite every deal or i would not give sixpence for it    letter vi to tate wilkinson esquire as i presume you are come from london i send to you to entreat you to turn your postchaise immediately toward this metropolis where your presence will be as it always will be to me most welcome and acceptable  some of the first personages here with every friend i have have long since advised me to wipe off a long score of old and i may add imposing and fraudulent demands by taking the benefit of the scottish act of insolvency  i am now at last about to do so  this crisis will relieve me of many untoward straits in which two large bailbonds which i signed for mrs bellamy who i shall ever mention with respect and compassion continually involved me a few days will end this matter in the interim as the season here is now beginning when money ever used to come into the house i know no moment in which you can be of more substantial and critical use to yourself or me  and that i may introduce your aid in the strongest and kindest manner possible i will when you come tell the public in whose favor i stand in the best light that you visit this spot to support me in my temporary difficulty  i am certain as foot has not been here these two years that you will attract the utmost notice  but catch the tide of success  i know you need no advice about the tide of kindness  often very often have i repeated the favor to myself of drinking the health you thank me for  now you have no need to thank me for doing what i am sure was meant to be done without your hearing of it  i have a good company  when douglas was under difficulties he called upon percy for his aid and as homes prologue says  for douglas percy bent his english bow  so hasten with your abilities which are arrows that never miss i am sincerely your obedient  w digges jan         letter vii to tate wilkinson esquire dear sir be assured it was very far from my intentions to half vex you or to give you the least reason to suspect that i imagined you wanted delicacy in all my transactions public or private my chief objects are tranquillity and reputation i have no dislike to money but if that cannot be acquired with more than an equal share of the other two why then let money go to the devil for i ever prefer my private to my public character mr weston has a tolerable share of the last without a grain of the first therefore i resolve against all concerns with him but when unavoidable  as to that gentlemans performing on the  0th for mr raworth i can have no objection as i would wish to promote his interest rather than slacken it though he must be meaner then i think him if he plays at york for five guineas and especially after your absolute injunction to raworth to assure weston that he will deceive himself if he thinks of getting more let the transaction proceed upon that ground and i think it will be for the advantage of all parties  i resove if nothing unforeseen prevents to turn my back upon edinburgh on thursday the   th at noon so as to be able to sleep on the southern side of the tweed then i fancy i may be able to come into york to a late dinner on saturday    and that i may not be smoaked by any of the theatrical gentry my first dinner there shall be at an inn  you know my forcible characters as well as i do  you know the taste of the public where you preside and therefore make choice of plays and characters that seem most advantageous in your own judgment i am told your catalogue of plays far exceeds any of our theaters royal and if that be true when we meet we shall not be at a loss to choose  notwithstanding you seem to be tired of the correspondence i am resolved not to finish it so soon perhaps as you expect and therefore call upon you for three or four plays and farces that you would recommend  in london i would determine in york you shall  the greater the contrasts the more agreeable i suppose to your audience yourself and  dear sir yours sincerely etc hen woodward edinburgh mar         p s pray do not forget my compliments to mr swan and if you will introduce me to mrs wilkinson a fortnight or three weeks before i see her by jasus my sowl i should estame it as a very great favor    letter viii to tate wilkinson esquire sir i am sorry it is not in my power to comply with your request to send you the corrections lately made in hamlet but no such favor can be granted to any one as i presume the play will never be printed so altered as the are far from being universally approved nay in general greatly disliked by the million  therefore no doubt your country squires would be for horsewhipping the actor that had struck out that natural scene of the gravediggers  as to alterations there are few or none at least additions which alone make material alterations i can therefore tell you the first act being remarkably long great part of it is carried into the second  and the sending hamlet to england and the gravedigging scene is by that means cut out and the introducing the scene that has been long omitted where hamlet intercepts the officer at the head of a party going to engage the enemy for a bit of land  that scene restored and the division of the first act makes ample amends for what is cut out  no doubt hamlets consenting to go to england and being prevented and brought back by a miracle is altogether absurd when his solemn engagement with his fathers ghost is duly considered however as i have already observed the million will like nay understand shakspeare with all his glorious absurdities nor suffer a bold invader to cut them up  i shall be very glad to see you when you come next to london and at all times to do you any service in the power of sir  your most humble servant b victor  letter ix to tate wilkinson esquire dear tate it is now a considerable time since i wrote to my good friend sir john ocarroll and informed him of all the misfortunes that have happened to my family and requested that he would be so good to let you know of them as i have received no answer i am really very uneasy particularly as i mentioned something that nearly concerned his interest i must therefore request that you will inquire about it and inform me  i was in france near a year with my wife and mrs forbes whom i left at montauban and got home in june      my poor nephew jack had been a long time ill and was then at mallow waters alderman forbes went to visit his wife in october last but the ship was dashed to pieces in wales and he and many others were lost in march last my dear jack exchanged this life for a better and was soon followed by his brokenhearted mother and your good friend my poor brother acheson you may easily conceive the distraction of our family my brother john has been much affected and my niece hannah is i fear in a dangerous situation from the immense fatigue she had with her brother and mother my dear sister forbes could not support her loss and last june she followed her husband this is too melancholy a subject to dwell on i know you feel for us all mrs chaigneau and mrs acheson who lives with me and all the remainder of your old friends desire to be remembered to you in the kindest manner and believe me  dear tate your very sincere servant w chaigneau dublin aug         letter x to tate wilkinson esquire dear sir if i had not a pretty shrewd knack at guessing it would not be quite so easy a matter to answer your favor from hull  you desire to know if i had commissioned giordini to give a particular sum but whether to a horse a man or a woman does not appear for this or the next summer  your old friend shuter is locked up in the playhouse and is soliciting a letter of license from his creditors in which number i find jewel is included for ten guineas borrowed during the last season fie upon him i am glad to hear that your affairs prosper i have a piece of three acts not my own which i shall give in the month of may called the tailors  the subject is a rich one  the dispute between the masters and the journeymen of that respectable profession  and i think the author has done it exquisite justice it is a parody of the best passages in the most favorite plays conveyed with great gravity in blank verse  i think you will appear in it to advantage and i shall be glad of your assistance i cannot say i am quite so well as i had reason to expect i thought myself obliged to give barry a lift two critical nights which injured me extremely but i am now better and except the trifle of a leg as much yours as ever  sam foot nov   letter xi to tate wilkinson esquire i thank you for the florid beginning of your last letter but one though i can neither admire the delicacy of the sentiment nor subscribe to the truth of the observation for heavens sake why should not women be as desirous of sincere professions as men are or why should not even an indirect falsity told to the former be held as scandalous as it is acknowledged to be when offered to the latter  would not that man be thought the veriest poltroon in nature who should draw his sword upon one who had lost the use of his hands  what then can we say of him who by arguments equally specious and false shall endeavor to impose upon a defenseless woman who has neither understanding enough to repel his attacks nor a possibility of revenging them  so much for sincerity my dear wilkinson and be assured i have at least sense enough to prefer it when it is attended neither by ill nature nor rudeness to all the refinements which the most subtle politeness divested of it can dictate  i have had a miserable cold or i should have wrote to you before do not grumble at this for i am so horridly out of spirits you may thank me for writing to you now  beatt has taken himself to his brothers in fifeshire and lives secured from duns upon the fat of a lean land the magnanimous staley was left behind us in edinburgh where he is employed in writing madrigals to his own praise sad ones they are indeed  mr  is gone to aberdeen to paint miniatures which the originals may fancy copies of themselves and lancashire draws beer opposite st marys wynd so that you see our company is but thin yet we have found our quarters here extremely good indeed much better than could have been expected  i am sorry to hear you are inclined to gallop  depend upon it my friend you are got upon a sober demure beast that will not bear to be pranced with take care then how you put him out of his pace for fear he should throw you out of the saddle  i have no inclination to make this letter longer take it therefore by way of bon bouche you shall have a full meal presently  the conclusion of a letter often occasions more trouble than all the rest of it therefore as i am vastly inclined to be idle you must take for granted all the esteem regard friendship and affection which are usually expressed when you read the name of  eliza baker i do not know what you mean by your emphatic inquiry in regard to mr b  he is very well  but i should be sorry if you could imagine me capable of preferring a new acquaintance to an old one  or that there is a man in the world who has power to alter the real the warm friendship which i have for mr wilkinson    letter xii to tate wilkinson esquire if i had not been greatly engaged by playing every night and studying two or three parts yet i have an excuse for my silence from the impertinent conclusion of your last letter  every thing must be impertinent in friendship which is not sincere  for heavens sake why will you be perpetually teizing me with the idea of my superiority which when you have said all you can is but an idea  i look upon politeness properly defined to be only another name for humanity which can scarcely exist independent of the strictest truth in conformity to this sentiment you will not wonder if i tell you that the compliment you have paid me in your last is not only impolite but inhuman because i am sensible i do not deserve it there is no truth in it and can a generous mind suffer a more degrading mortification than from the having those merits ascribed to it which it is conscious it by no means deserves  therefore for the future a little more sincerity and fewer your professions i beseech you sir   you tell me if i come to york i must have many disagreeable things to encounter but you may believe me when i assure you with the strictest veracity that mr wilkinsons conversation and friendship would enable me to bear them extremely well without any amazing share of either sense philosophy or good humor however it will be some time before i can tell you my fixed resolves but let them be of what nature they will i suppose you can have no objection to my paying my compliments to yourself as i pass through newcastle or york in my way to london a little time hence  adieu  what satisfaction would it be to me if i thought my arrival in newcastle would give you half the pleasure that it will afford to  eliza baker glasgow july    letter xiii to tate wilkinson esquire do you know that our correspondence begins to grow extremely critical  the people here wonder what we can write about so constantly and really make some remarks which are pretty enough  your last letter but one was directed to glasgow and returned to me from thence on the same day that i received your mad one  both at the playhouse too  then what an uproar good god mrs baker what two letters from mr wilkinson in one day  both long ones too  bless me what can he find to write about  sure you must have found him an interesting subject  we always thought mr wilkinson the idlest correspondent in the world what answer do you think i give to all this  why as lady betty says i hate malicious people so in order to afford their curiosity all the satisfaction it deserves  i just raise my eyes from the paper and look at them with a vacant stare as if i was sensible something had been said but was too much absorbed by the contents of my letter to know what  then fold it up carefully deposit it in my pocket with great circumspection figure out of the greenroom with a god bless me how extraordinary for heavens sake dick hasten the rehearsal for i want to go home and write immediately  then returning  what were you all talking of just now but i do not care what i am in that harmony of spirits it is impossible to put me out of humor  but as it would be unnatural for a woman to appear always pleased for fear they should suspect me of artifice or of an intention to heighten their impatience for our mighty secret i sometimes sit sullen after reading a letter  bite my lips  read it again  then exclaim in a whisper loud enough to be heard you may be sure unaccountable and if any of them pretend to rally me or want to know what is the matter    i beg  up n my word it is very rude  i you had met with any thin to make you uneasy  should not think myself excusable in teazing you  ha ha ha  don t y u ee it  and can you blame me for playing t us with their impertinent curiosity  heavens send i may not drop one of these mysterious letters  for what a terrible figure would the poor mouse make if the mountainous secret should be blown up  i am very angry with you for your debauch you think that is the way to establish your health dear wilkinson take care of yourself  i have a thousand things to say which can be only said  mr bland and mr didier are in the room and have talked to me so much that they have bliterated every idea of what i intended to say i am so bothered that i am not even able to tell you that you have not a friend in the world that esteems you so much as  eliza baker edinburgh to the reader a considerable mistake having taken place in this work my duty calls on me to explain it in this conclusive page  it is relating to the rank i have affixed to the name of thornton and dubbing him colonel of the yorkshire blues where it was not right to do so my being an entire stranger to the county of york at the time i was honored with the acquaintance of the gentleman alluded to in my early part of lfe gave rise to the eregious blunder ut though i have unfortunately lost my patron general st ledger who could have prevented my being so wrong yet i am so lucky as to be set right by the favor of a letter o undoubted authentity from a gentleman of rank and fortune to whom i am highly indebted for his infinite politeness it is as follows  to tate wilkinson esquire dear sir i should be happy if i could give you the least assistance relative to the matter you have wrote to me about i can only speak from memory and my then knowledge of the army i was at that time at portsmouth sir robert richs regiment of dragoons to which i then belonged was all      in scotland except the light troop which marched into england on thurot with his fleet appearing off our northern coast and i marched with it as lieutenant in septem      i knew capt anthony st ledger in the  d or kings own regiment of dragoons who was then at portsmouth with the light troop of that regiment i am confident there then was not a colonel or lieutenant colonel thornton belonging the horse at portsmouth or in the english service at that time if i recollect right there was only one field officer appointed to command the light troops upon the expedition that went out that summer against cherbourg which was major george ward of the   th dragoons now lieutenant general ward in      every regiment of heavy dragoons had a light troop belonging to it which were detached corpse in order to be sent upon those expeditions so that each troop had only a captain lieutenant and cornet sent with it  you are mistaken with regard to the rank of the gentleman you mention there was at that time a lieut william thornton of the  th dragoons who was there and went upon the expedition he was a man universally known and beloved by every body who knew him he had lived much in the world was very much of a gentleman and very sensible but was rather partial to his bottle  i wish to be as particular as possible as i think he was the person you mean he was about thirty years of age about five feet eight inches high handsome face and well made  there was a circumstance happened upon that expedition captain lindsay of the   th dragoons was killed and general bligh who commanded upon the expedition and had power given him by his majesty to fill all vacancies that should happen in the army appointed lieutenant william thornton to a troop in the  0th dragoons which he commanded till they returned to portsmouth where lord newbottle now marquis of lothian came to command the troop being appointed to it by his majesty the  0th dragoons being then his fathers lord ancrams regiment  the circumstance was much talked of in the army as thornton would not return to his former regiment or rank  the latter end of that year we had in our regiment a captain who died and thornton was appointed captain in his room thornton died in london in      i remember captain st ledger afterward major general st ledger was very intimate with thornton  colonel thornton father to the present colonel thornton of the militia who was member for york used to be distinguished by being called of the yorkshire blues raising a company of men who were lothed in blue in the time of the rebelion with which he marched into scotland   the end farewell  remember me w t  errata vol i page    line   before instead read where page    line
