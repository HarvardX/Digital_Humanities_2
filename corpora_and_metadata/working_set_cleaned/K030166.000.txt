roman portraits a poem  robert jephson esquire portrait of robert jephson  roman portraits a poem in heroic verse with historical remarks and illustrations by robert jephson esquire   dion hal semper ad eventum festinat et in medias res non secus ac notas auditorem rapit et quae desperate tractata nitescere posse relinquit hor london printed by henry baldwin for g g and j robinson in paternoster row m dcc xciv  to edmond malone esquire my dear sir this short address to you is not intended as a formal dedication but having long wished for some fair opportunity of doing myself credit by publicly subscribing myself your friend none seems likely to occur more favorable than the present  from our schooldays to this hour we have lived in a state of uninterrupted intimacy and kindness natives of the same country educated under the same masters and pursuing similar studies though we have not taken exactly the same path both have been zealous in the cause of letters your labors have furnished instruction to the readers and mine perhaps in a small degree may contribute to their entertainment nor can i be insensible to the honor you have done me when i reflect that the best commentator on our greatest poet has condescended more than once to be my editor without your kind care and encouragement the following work would not probably have been made public to your protection therefore it is inscribed with every assurance of esteem and cordiality by  your obliged and faithful friend robert jephson dublin castle may         preface by various accidental causes particularly the residence of the author and editor in different kingdoms the appearance of this work has been delayed much longer than was at first intended but as time always affords opportunity for correction and improvement i find upon the whole no reason to regret that the expedition of the press did not keep pace with my wish to see the task which i had undertaken more speedily completed by this delay i had also the advantage of several judicious observations suggested by the vigilant sagacity of my editor which produced at least considerable additions to the matter contained in the text and annotations his patience indeed i have always found unwearied like his friendship and it gives me sincere pleasure to think that being now disengaged from any further kind attention to my fame he will have more uninterrupted leisure to pursue other subjects in which the public may be much more interested  whatever deficiency may be found in the execution of the following poem some small merit may perhaps be allowed to the novelty of the design to which i know nothing similar in our language unless the ingenious and learned mr hayleys history of historians in verse may be considered in some sort as its precursor  it would have been no very difficult task to have swelled the size of this volume to a much larger bulk by multiplying citations from the ancient authors where the original materials of which it is composed may be found but though some were necessary i thought too many might be tedious and of no utility such as are inserted were chosen rather for their brevity than for any other reason of preference  in some modern productions it has been the fashion to make new discoveries in the ancient history of rome and to assign new motives and qualities to several of the principal agents but the present seems to me to be too late a period for such investigations they contribute less perhaps to establish right opinions than to shake the credit of all history and to leave the mind suspended between assent and incredulity in every material point the story of the sufferings of regulus excepted for which polybius must be consulted i find all the best writers concur and i could not presume to advance any bold paradoxes when i was convinced that i should want authorities or sufficient ingenuity to support them a french writer of the present century m de st foix in his account of the streets of paris asserts roundly that our kings edward the third and henry the fifth were cowards and i think adds were defeated at cressy and agincourt he meant no doubt by a violation of truth to flatter the vanity of one nation and to mortify that of another but i could not be induced by the love of novelty to affirm that sylla was not cruel or that julius caesar was unmerciful  i cannot forbear to flatter myself that the reader will not be disappointed should he not find in this book what the author never intended it should contain it does not come within the province of poetry to attempt deep political disquisitions or the adjustment of points which have frustrated the conjectures of the critic and the antiquarys persevering researches as to the policy of the romans the penetration of montesquieu has left little for future investigation and there are even in our own language details of the events sufficiently copious and satisfactory but to understand the history of rome it is not enough to read her historians we must also acquaint ourselves with their characters otherwise we may pay the same deference to the misrepresentations of dion and the prodigies of plutarch as to the authenticity of sallust tully and tacitus  what is to be found here is not intended for the master but the student it is meant rather to incite than to satisfy my purpose will be answered and my ambition gratified should it awaken in the young mind a laudable desire of more knowledge and revive not unpleasingly in the breast of more mature scholars the recollection of those admirable writers and illustrious characters who claimed their attention in their early studies the reverence for whom seems to increase like the magnitude of mountains in proportion to our distance from them a great object approached too nearly can be but partially examined at a due removal from it we discover all its sublimity  i may presume it will not be necessary to make any apology for opinions expressed in several notes where modern politics and recent events are assimilated with ancient mine have been dictated by real admiration of and reverence for the most excellent constitution and the happiest form of government that ever regulated human affections and conduct during the short prevalence of french superiority nov      which was attended with the dispersion of the most noxious and abominable principles it seemed to me next to a tacit approbation not to endeavor to expose them to hazard the demolition of the august fabric of the british constitution in attempting to remove some trifling abuses which may adhere to its surface would be like the wisdom of pulling down st pauls or westminster abbey because a few swallows happened to plaster up their nests against the corners of the windows minute inspection is requisite to discover them and how pitiful must be the genius which can overlook the grandeur of the whole to dwell upon such blemishes  a superficial similitude between the roman republic and france in her revolutionary disorder occurred so frequently that not to perceive it would have been blindness and not to have sometimes expatiated upon it pusillanimity  there is one remark not made in the notes to this poem which ought to have a place somewhere the infidels of france when exalted into the seats of legislation began with a policy directly opposite to the practice of every other state preexistent to them they commenced by taking off from human appetites all restraint from religion and of course they dissolved with the ancient form of government every bond upon conscience and every obligation to virtue the consequences have been correspondent let me not be suspected to be a favourer or friend of the old constitution of france for i think nothing could make it appear tolerable but the anarchy by which it was succeeded yet even this they attempt impudently to varnish over by false names and perverted examples alas good brutus we have heard thy virtuous spirit thy mild genius appealed to for the sanctification of every crime which can stain the black catalogue of human villainy france has made thee the patron the tutelary god of atheists and regicides and thy fair name is invoked to reconcile the world to oppression and cruelty to robbery parricide treachery and massacre caesar would have fallen by some other hand could thou but have foreseen that such disgrace was reserved for thy memory  in june      look at the picture of french democracy as displayed in the masterly coloring of mr pit before the house of commons of england  what says that great statesman could be the effect of any negotiation for peace in the present moment it is not merely to the character of marat with whom we have to treat that i object it is not to the horror of those crimes which have stained their legislators crimes in every stage rising above each other in point of enormity but i object to the consequence of that character to the effect of those crimes they are such as render negotiation useless and must entirely deprive of stability any peace which could be concluded under such circumstances where is our security for the performance of a treaty where we have neither the good faith of a nation nor the responsibility of a monarch the moment that the mob of paris becomes under the influence of a new leader the most mature deliberations are reversed the most solemn engagements are retracted or free will is altogether controuled in every one of the stages of their repeated revolutions we have said now we have seen the worst the measure of iniquity is full we shall no longer be shocked or astonished by the contemplation of added crimes and increasing enormities the next mail convinced us of our credulity and by presenting us with fresh crimes and enormities still more dreadful excited impressions of new astonishment and accumulated horror all the crimes which disgrace history have occurred in one country in a space so short and with circumstances so highly aggravated as to outrun thought and exceed imagination should we treat with marat before we had finished the negotiation he might again be descended to the dregs of the people from whence he sprung and have given place to a still more desperate villain a band of leaders has swayed the mob in constant succession all resembling in guilt but rising above one another in point of enormity each striving to improve upon the crimes of his predecessor and swell the black catalogue with new modes and higher gradations of wickedness aetas parentum pejor avis tulit nos nequiores mox daturos progeniem vitiosiorem lord morningtons speech in the same assembly on the   st of january      will always remain as a monument of that noblemans great abilities and eloquence and as a faithful report of gods dreadful visitation of a vast kingdom which has repeatedly dared to blaspheme his name and abjure his worship our countrymen may there see the rebellious subjects of the late most christian king crowding into a period of less than one short lustrum more impiety oppression cruelty rapine and massacre than can be found in the aggregated enormities of all the rest of europe for a series of centuries cedite romani scriptores cedite graii your dionysius your pisander tiberius nero caligula domitian caracalla and commodus must retire to the background of the picture and yield an abominable preeminence to our more flagitious neighbors the crimes of these tyrants were chiefly the offspring of frenzy the guilt of the gauls is deliberation and system  france has been for four years with little intermission deluged with such torrents of native blood that in some measure they have diverted our attention from concerns less affecting and the pernicious effects of her guilt and frenzy spreading to every country in europe we have not even the melancholy consolation to reflect that the consequences of her wickedness are confined to its authors yet what friend to genius but must read with affliction the tardy measure of the convention decreeing for the first time in      an imprisonment of two years against the future despoilers of the monuments of the arts dependant on the national property what devastation must not have preceded it we have seen their churches defaced the noblest statues and monuments of their kings and heroes pounded in pieces and the god of the universe proscribed from their constitution by acts of state and decrees of their legislators not even the grave has been sacred like the pyrennean wolves described by thomson on churchyards drear inhuman to relate the disappointed prowlers fall and dig the shrouded body from the grave over which mixed with foul shades and frighted ghosts they howl   they want no huns or visigoths no scythians or saracens to cast them back to the ages of darkness and barbarity for they renew upon themselves the ancient fury of the atillas the gensericks and the omars to the accumulated horrors of their condition is superadded the internal war of religion against atheism while men who sight for their faith freedom and property by these monsters audacious in their language as their actions are called villains enthusiasts and madmen how long the ruler of all things may be pleased to suffer them to insult his providence and to afflict his creatures we cannot presume to conjecture but of this we may be certain though divine vengeance may wink it will not sleep for ever the bolt is but held back to come down with double wrath when it descends to crush them  as to the merit of this work i am too well acquainted with the disqualifications an author lies under to presume at offering any leading sentiment to the judgment which the public may be pleased to form upon it i will only venture to affirm that it was no very easy matter to give an air of discrimination to so many different characters of men who being of the same country living under the same laws and customs and mostly educated in the same manner must have among them some strong and common features of resemblance without departing from the authority of ancient historians and biographers who seem to me to be the best if not the only guides on such subjects i have endeavored to produce this variety but with what success the reader must determine we often find indeed much discrepancy of opinion in the accounts given by contemporary writers of the great statesmen and generals who lived at the same time but by discovering to what party each writer adhered or what principles he espoused we generally have sufficient grounds for abatement of praise or censure in this manner we must endeavor to reconcile tullys adulation of caesar in the senate and the private sentiments which he expressed of him in the closet as cicero always speaks from reflection he frequently writes from feeling so that we can sometimes form a better judgment of the state of his mind at the moment than of the subject on which his familiar pen is employed  tacitus with his usual brevity asserts his impartiality sufficiently when he tells us that he writes of men nec beneficio nec injuria cognitos and after all this is the best security for truth through the mists of resentment or interest she is always seen obscurely  there will be found in the following poem a few rhymes which modern custom more perhaps than reason has brought into a sort of disuse i mean where the terminating word of one line in a couplet chimes only with the last sound of a polysyllable in the next as are and similar etc but i must acquaint the critic that this is not the effect of necessity but choice we have not improved upon the rich and various versification of dryden and to produce authorities from his practice would be to transcribe little less than a third part of his poetry pope who is supposed to be rather more exact is somewhat more sparing but he frequently indulges himself in this practice and always if i am not mistaken with evident satisfaction it recurs perhaps too often in the elder poet and more judiciously in his admirer for a mode of versifying adopted for variety loses its effect by too much repetition rhymes strictly correct are perhaps indispensable in very short compositions or in such as mr addison in his preface to the georgicks calls with simplicity enough a copy of verses but not even in these should i wish to see a vigorous expression weakened or a thought maimed for any compensation the ear could receive from the most exact consonance licentia sumpta pudenter can never appear objectionable and this a good taste only can regulate rhymes which almost constitute the essence of french poetry in ours are but an adjunct and yet to what shifts what poor expedients to what identity of sounds and terminations are not the best versifiers of france often reduced take the piece in disorder from the frame and the poetical texture will be no more discernible we shall not find as in ennius disjecti membra poetae  one short argument upon this point appears to me to be irrefragable he is always considered as a good reciter of rhymes who in his recitation hardly suffers the hearer to perceive them why it should be requisite for the poet to produce what it is a merit in the reader to conceal i know not it is something almost superfluous like the present fashion in dress of wearing fine laceruffles under the sleeve of a coat which very nearly covers them the late mr quin whom i have heard recite though not upon the stage and garrick who was consummate in the science of enunciation would have turned away with disgust or pity from the repeater of verses who let them know that they were such by the mere rattling of the metrical faggot he faggotted his notions as they fell and if they rhymd and rattled all was well dryden   if this license be not in a certain degree allowable i may at least observe that it is mostly reprehended by the fastidious and best admitted by more liberal scholars swift who was a poet as he was a parson rather from resolution than choice is particularly rigid about rhymes and sometimes remonstrates with pope upon his negligence but much as the latter feared or respected him i do not recollect that the nightingale paid much attention to the admonitions of the raven a great wit sometimes makes but a subordinate poet swift i think was both  this mode of arguing i am sensible might be pushed much beyond my meaning to the entire suppression of rhymes and to the preference of the blank song upon every occasion but not so i acknowledge that they give a great grace to every species of poetical composition except the dramatick epick and mock heroic in which last the effect is much heightened by misplaced pomp and ludicrous dignity all i mean to contend for is this that very precise rhyme being not always easily found the judicious critic will not endeavor to make that more hard which is in itself sufficiently difficult and will suffer any other beauty in a couplet to atone for some deficiency in the exactness of consonance let it be a pilaster but not the prop of the building  what may be the reception of this poem however anxious i may be concerning it i cannot foresee every purchaser of a book buys at the same time his right to judge of and to censure it praise too in general comes but unwillingly and not to be pleased is considered by many as a mark of superior discernment if however it meets with half the approbation from the public which it received in the manuscript i shall have reason to be contented it would still be a higher gratification to me if i could flatter myself that the form of the present work might suggest an idea to some author of better endowments than i possess and with more inclination to produce to the world the prominent events and distinguished characters of england with superior splendor how abundant are the materials how important the revolutions how diversified the characters how many sovereigns eminent for great virtues vices and achievements what changes in religion and government what wars and factions many of her statesmen and poets may vie with the outspread names which adorn the annals and consecrate the muses of greece and italy i should not wish to see such a work brought lower than the accession of the house of hanover because though i think that auspicious event established the felicity and freedom of great britain and that her ascendency never appeared more conspicuously than at the present period i apprehend it to be very difficult if not almost impossible in the display of transactions and characters so recent to preserve candor and total exemption from party prejudice we have seen controversy spring up and not without acrimony even from the ashes of queens elizabeth and mary  in my childhood i remember well the first impressions which i received with any permanency of parts of the english history were from the historical plays of shakspeare there is no young mind so unmusical as not to be sensible to the harmony of numbers and there is little doubt but that such a summary as is here recommended if executed with brilliancy would not only be the best vehicle to communicate early knowledge but to rouse young faculties to the further pursuit of such subjects os tenerum pueri balbumque pocta figurat even verses merely descriptive which are certainly the most fugitive dwell long upon the recollection when facts character and coloring are all blended in the same piece the picture never vanishes old age seldom forgets the songs of its youth there is a sort of mechanical reason for this which though palpable enough when mentioned may not perhaps occur immediately in retaining a sentiment or proposition conveyed in verse especially rhymes we have a double advantage the memory is assisted by the ear and the ear by the memory we know the thought must be contained within a certain number of metrical feet and if we are at a loss to recover the one by pondering a little upon the other we become masters of both with accuracy it is not the superior merit of the poetry which preserves so many of our ancient popular ballads but the tune and the jingle  as to myself the shades of night are closing too fast around me to allow of my attempting a theme so arduous but i may hope to retain for a considerable time faculties sufficient to make me sensible of and pleased with the successful labors of my contemporaries  it may be remarked nor do i wish to shelter myself from the observation that whatever little credit may be conferred by my approbation has not been withheld in the notes to this poem from those of my countrymen of ireland who occurred to me as having distinguished themselves by works of genius or the cultivation of letters well would it be if a spirit of this kind were more prevalent among us much talent which now lies smothered under the despondency of neglect might by such encouragement be roused into exertion the gentlemen of ireland are jealous of the national honor and abundantly ready at the hazard of their lives to assert it for such a purpose the pen is a better weapon than the sword or the pistol one book of merit would produce more deference from the neighboring nations than twenty combats it appears hardly credible yet is true that dr edward ryan author of the history of the effects of religion on mankind a work abounding with erudition entertainment and instruction was obliged lately to publish it in london the booksellers of dublin not being willing to hazard the expense where they knew there would be so few readers or purchasers of a book which required some little time and attention in the perusal his alma matter indeed honorably distinguished him but his fame and his patron came from another country  during the administration of lord townshend in ireland the printer of the wellknown poem addressed to mr g e howard with notes by alderman faulkner being asked by mr courtenay whether there was not a great demand for that publication nothing sir in the memory of man answered with pure simplicity the worthy printer ever sold like it except watsons almanac  mr monck mason is known and respected among his countrymen as a member of parliament a commissioner of the revenue and a privy counselor but it is doubtful whether he is known in ireland even by one in twenty of his acquaintance as one of the learned and ingenious band who have illustrated shakspeare yet by that distinction is his name more likely to be transmitted to posterity    that scotland should have to boast of at least ten eminent writers for one who appears among us when too the course of study and the discipline in our university are excellent must be ascribed to the truly patriotick attention with which the gentlemen of north britain cherish and expand every bud of genius which puts forth its promise in their native region this local partiality may be and sometimes is carried rather too far but the principle generates a great increase of excellent publications much improvement in science and fresh incitement to those distinguished authors whose works while they reflect honor on their country contribute to the entertainment and instruction of mankind  it is lamentable to find in such a nation as this in many apparent respects so adapted to the encouragement of true politeness how much its great mistress and teacher literature is neglected there are indeed in our capital some wellchosen and ample libraries but they are very few and very private the collection of books is generally the least costly article in the household inventory the contents of the cellar are often more valuable than the  for the whole family in great britain the gentry however dissipated seldom entirely neglect those studies in which they have been initiated in their early years and no conversation engages or interests them more than the discussion of works of genius whether of their own day or of antiquity a person distinguished by any publication of merit ranks among them in the first class of society and there is an emulation to protect encourage and produce him for my own part says lord chesterfield in a letter to his son i used to think myself in company as much above me when i was with mr addison and mr pope as if i had been with all the princes in europe this judicious sentiment is very general among the nobility of england but there seems to be in this kingdom though with very considerable exceptions too much of a kind of vandalish pride in disowning scholarship a gentleman here who knows much more of a new book than the title pamphlet and novel excepted may sometimes as well conceal his knowledge for his communication will be drowned in claret which has a better relish than such dry aliment or he will leave an impression with his company that he is a pedant or a coxcomb yet it is but justice to those very persons to acknowledge that in their collective capacity they show great liberality of sentiment though as stewards of the public purse they jealously examine all grants of public money there is no instance of an objection being offered in either house of parliament to provisions made for writers of merit nay even for their families when they are left without other support than the bounty of the nation  the general neglect of letters is not however a hopeless deficiency for no people have naturally brighter intellects than the irish nor better dispositions it proceeds not from dullness or insensibility but from inattention if study could be made more the fashion we should see the generality of our countrymen not less polished in their understandings than they are well formed in their persons and sociable in their tempers many of our ladies at this time without pedantry or the affectation of science would make a distinguished figure in the first literary circles ireland has not lost all female talent with mrs greville that there is no want of native genius and science at this hour we can produce some bright examples we have the unrivalled and allaccomplished burke the learned and excellent editor of shakspeare the author of the best comedy produced in this century and the best translator of a great roman historian who till the appearance of mr murphys version seemed to set our language at defiance but alas they have migrated to a more congenial region when books become more our occupation or amusement all that is wanted will follow the face of most things among us is daily altering and improving the mind in its turn will become undoubtedly the principal object of

their triumphs were additional insults of the most unfeeling barbarity a queen led in chains was a favorite embellishment in these ostentatious processions the consideration of their insolence and inhumanity while a republic abates much of our commiseration for the calamities they endured under the despotism of the emperors they but suffered under them what they had before inflicted upon the

she miscalled liberty to foreign malcontents or a new form of government to nations not desirous of her interference  there will probably be ere long another resemblance the tyranny of atheistical

presents another example of still more extravagant and unnatural rigor when he condemns his son a gallant young conqueror to death for a slight deviation from discipline this barbarian after exhorting the young man in an unfeeling declamation to bear his fate with magnanimity ordered his head to be struck off and looked on at the execution of the sentence it is reasonable to suppose that the power of life and death given by the roman laws to parents over their children might in some degree have weakened the ties of natural affection and substituted in their place ideas of severity which led to excesses otherwise unaccountable parents had it in their option either to bring up a newborn child or to suffer it to perish thus what would among us be considered as the most extreme proof of inhumanity was then looked upon as a matter of indifference the whole youth of rome were in a state of actual slavery with this difference only that their masters were their fathers among catilines

somewhat less accountable but sylla was deliberate and circumspect and all his horrible cruelties may be referred to some motive of pride revenge malignity or selfinterest he besides set the first example of systematick oppression and inhumanity extirpation appeared to him to be the most compendious and therefore the most eligible mode of establishing his usurped authority had there been any

young more bold and fortunate the superiority of caesars personal character over pompeys appears in several instances in none perhaps more conspicuously than in their different conduct with respect to labienus he had been one of caesars favorite lieutenants and always victorious when fighting under his auspices however he left his old general and passed over to the camp of pompey caesar heard the account of his desertion with his usual magnanimity and generously sent after him all his money equipage and whatever besides he had left behind him pompey on the contrary received him as an acquisition of the highest value and listened with avidity to his flattering intelligence of the weak condition of the enemy till he was at last mournfully convinced of his mistaken credulity by his total overthrow lucan makes caesar thus speak of labienus    fortis in armis caesareis labienus erat nunc transfuga vilis cum duce praelato terras atque aequora lustrat luc l v      upon considering the whole of pompeys character and conduct i am persuaded that as he had more vanity than caesar so was he not less ambitious what his admirers were pleased to dignify with the name of patriotism and love of the constitution or in other words his being more willing than caesar to allow the senate sufficient authority resulted less from his own disposition than from sentiments which had been instilled into him by such men as cato tully and brutus these excellent persons seem not only to have directed his conduct but to have formed his political mind they had so often assisted him in the attainment of his objects and had extolled him so much for his moderation that he must have been divested of all feeling could he have forgot his obligations to them or had he been eager to undeserve if i may be allowed the expression the high opinion they had so publicly declared of him he found it less hazardous and more reputable to be the first of several great men than to be the only great man besides he loved approbation and good will which he knew had he avowed a passion for governing singly would have been immediately converted into flattery and hatred that this however was his object is clear from a circumstance mentioned by plutarch in his life of the younger cato whom he would not trust with the command of the fleet though he had already promised to invest him with it lest he should be enabled by this means to compel him to lay down his arms as soon as caesar was vanquished and cato himself thought that whether pompey or caesar should be victorious the event would be equally fatal to the liberty of the common wealth  the constitution of rome was as much subverted during the triumvirate of pompey crassus and caesar as when the last ruled alone but cicero complains less because pompey made a part of it the orator knew he had little chance of managing a man of such high views and such great capacity as caesar brutus in his letters probes him to the quick when he seems willing to disguise to himself and to the world his real motives for abetting octavius the chief of which seems to have been the assurance given him by that young dissembler that he would be principally governed by his advice and experience    battle of pharsalia a u c  0  now pompey to rude clamor forced to yield   cum mixto murmr turba castrorum fremuit fatisque trahentibus

dissuade pompey from hazarding the fortune of the republic on the event of a battle and produces passages from his letters to that purpose but how is this to be reconciled with his for ever complaining of pompeys dilatoriness and inactivity he seems to have been full of apprehensions and to have disapproved of every thing a man is sometimes apt to mistake his fears for his foresight pompey is known to have said of him cupio ad hosts cicero transeat ut nos timeat if he wished him not to risk a battle what objection could he have to his inactivity i think but am not certain that cicero does not say he was against fighting till after the unfortunate event of the battle of pharsalia was known however i mean no attempt to diminish any credit due to the letters of cicero which certainly contain the very best materials for the most interesting period of the whole roman story it would have been more candid perhaps to have lamented his advice than to have denied having given it or had he confined his complaints to pompeys conduct after his defeat they would have been reasonable  no age perhaps has produced together men of such genius and capacity as flourished in rome at this period this is the consideration which makes the history of these times so interesting the magnitude of the object of contention is in some degree lost in the greatness of the contenders

fled shamefully from rome at the approach of caesar whom he affected to despise and upon the rout of his cavalry early in the engagement at pharsalia he made no effort to retrieve the fortune of the

credit et perdoit en vains efforts une autorite quil faloit menager pour des occasions plus importantes  it is to be observed that the above are strictures upon the temper and judgment of cato not upon his morals and virtue  the reader may now peruse the opposite sentiments of another distinguished frenchman on the same subject  je crois says montesquieu que si caton setoit reserve pour la

great man and enters into the contest with all the virulence of a partywriter to caesar he allows no one good quality except courage and imputes to him vices and foibles which so far from being in his nature were repugnant to it he represents him as a vainboaster cruel and insolent caesar was too proud and too wise to be vain and of all conquerors he was the most merciful and generous his insolence if a bold spirit of enterprise attended with constant success can properly be called so appears but little in his writings and in the accounts we have of his discourse a great poet may put what words he pleases into the mouth of a hero and comment upon them afterward for imagination and ingenuity are not to be restricted within common boundaries yet experience will not be misled by them we consider a man as insolent who treats others with a contempt which they do not deserve and imagines he can accomplish things beyond his means or capacity how far this description is applicable to

might seize the helm against tully and good cato to combine in the juxtaposition of cato and caesar by sallust the historian gives the preference to neither one cannot well conceive two characters more strongly contrasted for except that both were well descended brave and eloquent there is between them no other feature of resemblance cato was as much superior to caesar in the practice of every severe virtue as he was his inferior in judgment talents and capacity whatsoever was caesars purpose he generally embraced the most effectual and certain means of accomplishing it while cato had but one way of attempting every thing so that the former was commonly successful and the latter as frequently miscarried he entered into many an action as he did into the theater only to get out of it caesar by the sweetness of his temper and the affability of his manners could throw a sort of grace even over bad actions while cato was distinguished by his abhorrence of them without giving our approbation to caesar it is difficult not to love and impossible not to admire him we approve of and respect cato but he is seldom amiable notwithstanding the loose morality of the dictator his soul was capable of an elevation which the strict stoicism and rigid principles of his antagonist could never attain to and it should be remembered to the advantage of the conqueror of the world that in an age and country so shamefully addicted to bloodshed and debauchery he was always merciful and temperate  with desperate clodius and fell catiline beyond the alps he ran his bold career rome was for

great military skill and wonderful presence of mind more conspicuously than in extricating himself from all the dangers with which he was environed in the alexandrian war he was involved in this by his amor with cleopatra and it seems to have been the only instance in which he suffered his passions to get the ascendancy over his wisdom    awhile he left the labors of the field she tried her varying poignancy of charms to fold him long in her voluptuous arms from balmy lips breathed forth the endearing vow and smoothed the furrows on his careworn brow but when the trumpets notes his

had formed no callous crusting round his heart there is an unaccountable proneness in several modern writers to ascribe the well known clemency of caesar toward his vanquished enemies either to policy or to his contempt of them and not to his natural disposition it is directly contrary to all the testimonies of his contemporaries and of the subsequent ancient authors it is of no service to the cause of morality to inquire too strictly into the motives of mens actions when their effects are beneficial to society and we may be content to leave caesar in possession of his title to a virtue

catilinarian conspirators preserved as it is called by sallust seem to me no very satisfactory specimens of the manner of those eminent orators he has doubtless preserved their different opinions upon the question and probably the arguments by which they were supported but there is nothing discriminating or characteristick in either and they are plainly the authors composition that is the style manner and construction of the periods are sallusts they not only do not differ in these particular from each other but they exactly resemble his diction every where it may be observed perhaps of all the ancient historians who pretend to record the orations of particular men that they make them all eloquent and all equally so thucidydes and livy abound with examples we should consider them rather as ingenious expedients used by the historian to enliven and diversify his narrative by not always appearing in his own person than as faithful transcripts of orations delivered at the time by the speakers to whom he ascribes them let the reader compare the two following passages from the speeches of caesar and cato not only with the rest of the respective speeches but with the whole structure

committed no other great crime is sufficient to transmit him to posterity as a ruffian not less insensible to the claims of genius than shamefully indifferent to the censure or approbation of mankind

whom by his own insolence he had provoked to be his enemy to estimate the whole of a character from its exhibition in a play is somewhat like forming an idea of a mans whole figure from seeing his

remembrance impressed still more by the recitation of virgil who was remarkable for reading his own verses with harmonious energy may naturally be supposed to have had such an effect on the tender and affectionate heart of octavia  how different is the picture of augustus in this scene from that which he exhibited as a triumvir seated between antony and lepidus and marking down for the knife of his butchers the most respectable and virtuous of his countrymen  in drawing the character of octavia beside the concurrent testimony of the ancient writers who mention her i was assisted by having before

peasant but education and habit have made a great deal we should be surprised to find an excellent artist in any mechanical business who was ignorant of the rudiments of the art and had served no apprenticeship then why should we expect that illiterate men whose minds have been engaged in the meanest occupations should be qualified at once to exercise the most difficult and sublime of all arts that of governing to their ignorance must be added another natural cause or impediment the spirit of revenge arising from a sense of the indignities to which they had been accustomed always engendering cruelty and the desire of retaliation  the first cause of dissensions and tumults among the romans was not so much the existence of distinctions between patricians and plebeians as that such distinctions were made too apparent by the appropriation of honors and offices in one order and exclusion in the other to encroach upon this line of separation was the continual endeavor of the plebeians while the patricians labored as strenuously to prevent the encroachment till these distinctions were removed rome was a perpetual theater of secessions feuds and insurrection it is remarkable that when the plebeians were first allowed to be eligible and to elect to the great offices of the state they did not choose a single magistrate from their own order no doubt from consciousness of their deficiency in time they turned their attention to the science of government and became masters of it  the way to honors and emoluments is open to all ranks of men in great

how different from the genius of the intellectual theater lewis the fourteenth after having been present at the representation of corneilles cinna or the clemency of augustus was heard to declare that had he then been asked to pardon the chevalier de rohan he would have consented this anecdote deserves the notice of some singularists who affect to think that the stage is prejudicial to morals comedy has been sometimes licentious but next to the divinity which presides over the eloquence of the pulpit the tragic muse has been the chief priestess of virtue i never thought those ugly beetles had any feeling says a child to its mother till i heard the pretty lady in measure for measure say so the moral of the greek stage is perhaps too much confined to prudential precept and reverence for absurd superstition the french drama till its late perversion was perfect purity even the operas of metastatio abound with the noblest sentiments and a very small number of our own tragedies excepted where can the vicious heart the sullen temper or the perverted understanding find such efficacious pharmacy as on the stage of england were a deaf man to enter the theater before a well graced actor leaves the stage he would soon discover what sentiment was prevalent from the sympathy of the audience he would see indignant scorn at succesful villainy the kind bosom heaving for distress or the

such luster over his reign diffuse as the bright record of the immortal muse virgil from the indifferent success which has attended the several attempts to translate virgil into our language one would be at first led to imagine that it is next to impossible to transfuse the spirit of roman poetry into english and to cast the blame on our tongue not on our translators did not rowes admirable version of lucan refute such an opinion whatever may be the reason no great ancient poet is less indebted to translators than virgil nor without acquaintance with him in his native language can any adequate idea be formed of his peculiar genius and excellence  dryden himself a great poet is often unfaithful diffuse licentious or negligent i have never met with any person who recollected twenty lines together of his translation while hundreds not only remember but cannot forget almost whole books of the original the version of pit is less licentious in particular passages more brilliant but upon the whole languid while trap as doctor johnson observes is now only a clandestine refuge for the laziness of schoolboys a translation of ariosto is extant which like traps of virgil retains every word of the meaning without one spark of the spirit of the author these versions may remind us of an experiment which has been attempted of turning brandy into water such is the common inferiority of translation  with respect to virgil the difficulty consists perhaps in this one of the principal charms of his poetry lies in the admirable choice of his terms the most significant and sonorous in which his images can be expressed another in the harmonious dignity and majestic stream of his numbers like his own clitumnus the course is smooth but the picture is diversified with enlivening and splendid objects he has however a style and composition peculiar to himself an imitator may have many beauties without having the beauties of virgil let the english poet for a poet he should be who attempts to resemble him first form to himself a style choice rich and glowing as his language can furnish and giving this all the variety of modulation of which it is capable adhere to it from the beginning for virgil is never unequal and after he has completed an excellent poem which can stand by itself with all the air of an original he may then assure himself that he has done some justice to maro pope has effected this with the iliad if it is not like homer as some are pleased to affirm it must at least be allowed to stand alone unimitated and inimitable  row in my opinion would have translated virgil better than dryden for though he had not equal scope and fire of genius his taste was more correct he was less careless and more pathetick and i imagine had more literature or had better improved the care employed in his education it may be doubted whether a very good taste be not more requisite to make a good translator than great genius i do not however mean to insinuate that pope did not possess both most eminently though i have lived to hear heu nefas the coarse couplets of the occasional churchill preferred to his immortal labors  happening lately to cast my eye over a page or two of drydens version of the georgicks it really appeared to me like burlesque more contemptibly ludicrous than the avowed travesty of cotton with no more resemblance to the beautiful original than subsists beween the mask of an ape and the countenance of antinous  let the reader who has curiosity and a little time to mispend turn to the technical storm in the first aeneid full of the language of the dockyard and to other disfigured passages he will not hesitate to pronounce this great poet convicted either of most vicious taste or of elaborate affectation when i reflect in particular how he has contrived to degrade that eminently beautiful passage just mentioned i can hardly forbear crying out with angelo  having waste ground enough shall we desire to raze the sanctuary and pitch our evils there o fie fie fie   the inequalities of shakspeare are not more frequent or so unaccountable as those of the literate john dryden there is indeed as much difference between virgil in his roman toga and his english doublet as between a forest tree in june and january or as between the right and the wrong side of gobelin tapestry  who that has read the late mr mickles version of the lusiad but must wish he had turned his thoughts to the aeneid he would probably have had the same success with virgil as with camoens  cervantes in the sixth chapter of the first book

y habilidad que muestren jamas llegeran al punto que ellos tienen en su primer nacimiento the lusiad of mickle is a shining exception  would the painter of the botanick garden condescend to become a translator of virgil we should see the english georgicks illuminated with the brightest radiance of poetical genius and like the clouds round a fulgent setting sun in autumn glowing with all the richness of gold and purple his profusion of fancy and luxuriance of diction would not suffer much injury from the little restraint of conformity to a model so excellent   a u c          hushed be

while he and his gods who greatly embellish the dramatis personae excite a more tender interest for their deluded and unsuspecting victim this episode as it is called appears to me almost the masterpiece of virgil a considerable part of the fourth book consists of didos speeches and there is not a single line of declamation in any of her dialogues or soliloquies the purity of virgils taste

reclined to turnus shrinking from the death designed some kindred muse breathes in each tuneful line and the verse glows with all the assisting nine how exquisite must have been the taste of the poet who could order the aeneid to be destroyed after his death as thinking it too imperfect to do him honor  one of the greatest obligations posterity owes to the memory of augustus is his not suffering the suppression of that divine poem  virgil is supposed to have employed seven years in the composition of his georgicks the most perfect poem in the opinion of many very eminent critics extant in any language the whole work divided into four books consists of little more than two thousand lines but so many beauties were perhaps never before or since comprised within so small a compass  to a mere english reader the seasons of thomson though a work clearly original will convey a better idea of the georgicks than any translation i have met with thomson in this most beautiful poem one of the greatest ornaments of his country dips his pencil in the same glowing colors with which the mantuan has painted the face of rural nature we can perceive that he often casts his eye upon the roman poet not with the servile timidity of an imitator but like a master able to think for himself to select combine and create by the vigor of his own genius  in the style of these two raffaelles of description there is very perceptible difference thomson though not more rich is more luxuriant than virgil more sententious diffusive and abounding much more in epithets the bricon perhaps might not have turned his thoughts to the seasons had not the georgicks preceded yet even allowing to the latter the advantage of the latin language it is not easy to decide which production deserves the preference for my own part i am commonly inclined to give it to that which i have read latest thomson has sometimes weak expletive lines virgil never transposition of words now and then though but rarely constitutes poetry in the seasons the structure of virgils verse cannot be altered without injuring the harmony or the image thomsons episodes are very justly commended yet the pastor aristaeus in the fourth georgick is superior to any of them  the declamatory style which loads thomsons tragedies mixes well in a poem of such length and expansion as the seasons the mind tranquilized by the scenes his muse has raised allows him to assume the dignity of an instructor and to indulge in whatever mood happens to have the ascendency we may find perhaps upon the whole more eloquence in the modern and in the ancient more energy    now near two thousand years since virgils birth the sun grown older has illumined earth and brightly his inspiring beams has shed over genius living and the illustrious dead yet still supreme unequalled and alone sits the threat mantuan on the epick throne the author does not mean that as an epick poet virgil was superior to homer who wrote so many ages before him but that he is superior to such as have appeared since his nativity the number is not considerable and of these our milton is unquestionably the greatest among many other slanders voltaire describes him as celui qui a gate lenfer et le diable du tasse etc the frenchman understood milton but little better than he did shakspeare it is remarkable that in the fastidious censures of his noble venetian pococurante in candide he praises only the three episodical books of virgil the second fourth and sixth where there is more of relation than action because he has himself attempted to follow these models in his henriade wishing always to persuade his countrymen that it is the most finished epick poem the wit of man ever produced in any language  there is certainly more bustle and less interest in the last half of the aeneid than the first and perhaps the episode in the ninth book is the most beautiful part of any of the last six wherever there is room for pathos he is inimitable the death of the stag in the seventh book nisus and euryalus in the ninth pallas and lausus and the lamentations over them must touch every heart not utterly divested of sensibility he has many sublime descriptions and passages in every book and the constant majesty of his numbers has never been equalled    tibullus the tender suavity of tibullus and his plaintive simplicity cannot be too much admired yet it has been said that his pattern was parthenius upon the authority i think of macrobius of the writings of parthenius little has been preserved too much indulgence has been given to the humor of preferring works which are lost to those which remain and of regretting the want of those originals upon which we are to suppose the excellent though inferior poems which we have in our hands were formed in this manner we must conceive lucillius to have been superior to horace varus to virgil and parthenius to tibullus no better consequence can result from this fruitless repining after unknown and perished perfection than to diminish the satisfaction of our actual enjoyment by the mixture of another sentiment not so pleasing but in our own experience we may find the true consolation there is little doubt that had we now only a few lucky fragments of chaucer and done some of our critics would prefer them to dryden and pope for dryden himself in order to recommend his beautiful tale of palamon and arcite modernized from chaucer and infinitely improved spends several pages of the preface to his fables to raise the rugged old english bard to a competition with ovid nay in his dedicatory verses to the duchess of ormond he boldly sets him above homer and virgil he matched their beauties where they most excel of love sung better and of arms as well so sings dryden but poetry without harmony is to my sense no better than a violin without strings or a cracked trumpet  the only ancient prodigy of england is shakspeare his numbers are often not less sweet than his conceptions are sublime and original had only a few of his best scenes and dramas descended to us well might the modern exclaim that the loss of the rest was irreparable yet even in this mighty genius something is to be forgiven and something to be rejected where he possesses his true inspiration he never was nor ever will be equalled nature as pope says speaks through him  neither are the praises lavished by contemporary writers on each other a sure standard at all times to ascertain their real value horace the most discerning of critics though superior to envy now and then pays a courtly compliment to the productions of a roman pen when in the hand of a great statesman or magistrate which their intrinsic merit probably would not have extorted from him lord halifax the bufo of great britain has left his verses behind him to give the lie to his flatterers to reach us to appreciate for ourselves and not to depend upon the panegyric even of an addison when the scribbler and the minister happen to be united in the same person  in tibullus the charms of elegy may be found in genuine perfection he has been well imitated and better translated by the english hammond lord chesterfield in a short preface to the love elegies seems aware that his friend may be considered only in the character of a translator and says artfully enough that he chose tibullus rather than ovid as his model it is somewhat extraordinary that dr johnson in his account of this english poet when he very justly condemns him for introducing roman imagery and heathen mythology into verses supposed to be the effusions of amorous passion does not seem to recollect that in all these passages and many more hammond is only the literal translator of tibullus had this circumstance been fairly acknowledged by himself or his noble editor he would have escaped the severity of johnsons censure to the best of my recollection there are scarcely one hundred original lines in hammonds love elegies  since the foregoing remark was written it has been suggested to me by a friend that the same observation was made soon after the appearance of the biographical work above referred to dr johnson in his late admirable lives of the english poets speaking of mr hammond observes that his elegies have neither pathos nature or manners they certainly have neither of the latter and whatever of the former they contain is the passion of a roman not of an englishman it is surprising that the cause of this defect escaped this most judicious critic in short these elegies are almost all if not translations very close imitations of tibullus in the whole number there are but four original of this any one may be convinced who will take the trouble to compare these poems with those of the roman knight for the satisfaction of the classical reader i will subjoin a list of those elegies which hammond has copied hammond tibullus el   l ii el iv         ii el vi   ii el iv      0   iii el v   i

rapture with the maid he loves horace the genius and writings of horace will probably for ever supply abundant matter for criticism and panegyric he has a claim to the latter for a species of excellence which perhaps has not been sufficiently noticed the great variety of subjects to which he has tuned his lyre to have produced above a hundred odes with little resemblance between any two of them all finished and beautiful and some of them sublime shows a very surprising playfulness and fertility of fancy he calls them operosa carmina but we see nothing but the felicity  considering his admiration of pindar whom he praises chiefly for his sublimity we might i think have expected more frequent emulation of the thebans loftiness his most distinguished performance in that style is the

nature but also talents exercised in the practice an indifferent serious ode though constructed with the most exact conformity to critical rules was never read twice willingly by any person except the

he is supposed to have been greatly addicted to gallantry and a very distinguished favorite among the roman ladies to whom he recommended himself more by his learning talents and poetry than by the gracefulness of his figure and his other personal accomplishments he had besides reduced the mystery of female seduction to a system there are few women of any natural delicacy of sentiment however little they may happen to be indebted for the improvement of their minds to education who can be insensible to the distinction which literature gives to the other sex nothing is less uncommon than to

cannot be perused without severe reprehension should have so tarnished the whole that no publication extant has been treated with so little candor it abounds however with good sense and contains many

had long been out of the authors hands and considerably advanced at the press before accounts arrived of the horrible murder of the late unfortunate queen of france exhibiting such a scene of complicated and deliberate barbarity as makes us almost impatient as she seemed to be herself for the last fatal stroke which alone could deliver her from the fangs of those merciless hell hounds by whom she had been persecuted  here follows the simple and unexaggerated detail of her sufferings after the butchery of the king her husband  a considerable time before the sixteenth of october

an empress this sister of emperors the wife of the once most powerful sovereign on the continent of europe in the very flower of her age beautiful calumniated and innocent plunged into a narrow cavern four feet under ground aired and lighted toward the top by one small irongrated window fetid damp and loathsome four ruffians all day and night pent up with her in the same abyss to witness every shocking humiliation of female delicacy fed with the worse sustenance doled out to the vilest criminals her bed a miserable pallet with scanty bedclothes not sufficient to cover her foul and tattered hurried from this gulf of desolation to a mock trial before savages predetermined on her condemnation accused of impossible crimes at the very name of which human nature shudders a nominal advocate assigned to her not to defend but to inveigle and betray her sentence of ignominious death in defiance of evidence and conviction pronounced upon her in a few hours afterward her hair cut off her hands tied behind her back to prevent her holding a book of prayer or a crucifix an indignity offered only to her dragged in this manner with her back to the horses tails upon a dungcart to the scaffold attended by an impious miscreant dressed up like a constitutional priest not to console her last moments but to insult and embitter them her head severed from her body and her poor remains thrown into a hole to be consumed with quicklime before the eyes of her inhuman subjects who stood round wallowing in delight at the bloody spectacle without a bosom on which she could drop a tear no ear to which she could impart a dying wish no hand to which she could confide a lock of hair or one last pledge of affection for her wretched children and sisterinlaw  she sustained it all to the last with heroic fortitude  thus perished the beautiful the generous the benevolent queen of france furnishing the most singular example in human records of a life so dignified by birth rank and splendor

most interesting and awful of all events to the universe the birth of our lord and savior jesus christ not from irreverence but from absolute despair of being able to satisfy my own mind or the readers by announcing it with any suitable elevation of diction and sentiment it is a theme too great for rhymes the powers of the human mind sink under it even the mighty genius of milton seems at times to be depressed by its grandeur and simplicity a god of peace propitiation and mercy may be contemplated with silent devotion and gratitude or the ways and end of his providence may be inculcated in pious discourses but to be a proper subject for poetry the messiah must be represented in wrath and in action with the attributes of homers jupiter grasping ten thousand thunders and

disappointed the previous expectations of the reverend authors admirers as it is impossible to fix limits to expectation it is equally so to determine whether the fault be in the work itself or in the unreasonableness of those who profess to have been disappointed some without doubt would rather concur in this sort of indistinct censure than take the trouble of examining into the grounds of it and to such i imagine the following remarks may not be unacceptable  it is certainly a very useful and learned work the author shows great knowledge of ancient historians and of roman antiquities and is perfectly acquainted with all the different writings of cicero of which his account is always distinct candid and satisfactory they contain in themselves no inconsiderable body of pagan erudition about a third part of the work consists of quotations and translations from cicero himself which last he says in his preface he found not the least troublesome part of his undertaking he acknowledges that the history of fabricius prefixed to several editions of ciceros works which is no more than a bare detail of his acts and writings digested into exact chronological order together with the annals of pighius which he always consulted saved him much unentertaining investigation which otherwise would have been necessary the very curious work of bellendenus de tribus luminibus romanorum as dr warton has observed was also probably of much use to him though he has not mentioned it  he makes an observation well worth remembering upon several sentiments and opinions which have been erroneously imputed to tully accounting for the mistake in this manner  many of tullys treatises are thrown into the form of dialogues and different parts in them assigned to different speakers often with no other intention than that they should advance certain notions in order to have them discussed and refuted careless readers finding such opinions contained in writings under the name of cicero are apt to look no further but to consider them as his whereas they are produced for a purpose exactly opposite tullys sentiments are too wise not to make us wish to have them genuine  middletons defect is his too great partiality for and indiscriminate approbation of cicero not of his genius and capacity for it is impossible to estimate these too highly but he hardly admits that his favorite had any human frailties or foibles and in general he admires his conduct as much as his talents it would be no less trice to expatiate on tullys vanity than fruitless to endeavor to acquit him of it it is not easy to find any page where cicero mentions himself without being obliged to agree with lord bolingbroke that his own eulogium is the topic upon which he always dwells with the greatest complacency but though he was fond of receiving praise we must allow at the same time that he was always ready to confer it as liberally his copiousness of panegyric and invective seems to be equally inexhaustible  he certainly loved virtue and was a true friend to the aristocracy of rome or the government of the senate he showed great attachment to them when with a strong persuasion in his mind that caesar would be successful he went over to the camp of pompey in daring to undertake the defense of roscius against the interest of sylla the most implacable and cruel of all tyrants he displayed the genuine spirit of an advocate and a roman how vigorous was his conduct in his consulship and how dignified in all his transactions with antony he met his death too from the executioner of that butcher with magnanimity  but he was not always clear from imputation in pecuniary matters he often flatters the man he hates and vilifies him at one time with no less acrimony than at another he had extravagantly extolled him his nature seems to have been formed only for prosperity the waves of adversity overwhelmed his spirit as much as his fortune he bore his banishment with most piteous dejection of mind and he sinks so under every domestic calamity that in the condolance of his friends even a kind of disdain for his unmanly want of fortitude is discernible his extreme sensibility induced him to think that his misfortunes were peculiarly distinguished from those of other men and that neither himself nor the world could deplore them sufficiently he was notwithstanding the most learned person of all antiquity whose works have reached us and had perhaps the most enlightened mind the most versatile and universal capacity that any roman if julius caesar is not to be excepted was ever endowed with his most elegant translator is his most rigid censurer and i should think him most likely to form a correct judgment of cicero who tempers the severity of melmoth with the panegyric of middleton  note b p     no character of antiquity having been more canvassed and represented under colors more opposite than julius caesar while some of the best masters have exhibited him in the darkest i hope to be pardoned for employing a few lines to vindicate the rather favorable delineation which i have attempted of him in the verses under his title  most unworthy would be the endeavor to recommend his example as a pattern for the imitation of any subject who has the happiness to live under a free government nor should he be suspected of harboring such an intention who declares it to be clearly his opinion that caesar was highly criminal not only for conceiving the design of enslaving his country but still more for the means he employed to accomplish his pernicious project  rome it is true gained nothing but increase of calamities by his death or by the resolution of that great patriot and truly virtuous roman who conspired against him and who was constrained by the fatality of the times to resort to a mode of removing him most adverse to his humane and generous disposition this action of brutus has been almost as variously represented as caesars character  his eloquence the gracefulness of his person his genius and taste for letters the engaging manners placability of disposition dauntless courage unmixed with rashness and consummate capacity for affairs of every kind particularly for war so conspicuous on all occasions in this daring usurper have been universally acknowledged  his contemporary tully always addresses him in the most elaborate strain of elegant encomium and writes of him with inveterate malignity sallust being his creature describes him accordingly in florus a very beautiful writer we find a brief recital of some of his great achievements but with little comment upon them the courtly paterculus varnishes like a caesarean wherever caesar is concerned the fiery lucan a perfect partywriter in verse as has been remarked in a former note observes no moderation suetonius whose tendency seems to be vituperative admits all his great qualifications and endowments and rather unwillingly allows him to have possessed some good dispositions we find in the ingenious plutarch removed from any personal interest in the subject the good and the bad as they had been transmitted to him dion cassius and appian are branded for the effrontery of their misrepresentations and all that can be picked up from ancient miscellaneous fragments relating to this extraordinary man is so evidently tinctured with the gall of prejudice that it serves rather to show how the writers contradict each other than to assist our judgment  among the french montesquieu who thinks with most depth and writes with most solidity upon roman policy from the nature of his plan has not many opportunities of detailing caesars actions or entering much into his personal character but from what may be gathered he imputes the subversion of the republic to several other causes beside the dictators ambition and as may be seen in a former quotation p     n   he is of opinion that from the superiority of his genius let julius have appeared when and where it might be he must have been the ruler  in our own language we have many roman histories essays etc four dissertations in the form of lectures by the learned dr michael kearney formerly senior fellow of dublin college are deservedly in high estimation but nothing i have yet seen appears to me comparable to the northern blackwells memoirs of the court of augustus with the fire of lucan however this able author seems to inherit his partiality to pompey and inveteracy against his rival he frankly puts him down as ready for every intended massacre the fomenter of every sedition and as being fully convicted of taking the lead in every plot and conspiracy against his country where the proofs are suspicious or at most only presumptive  it is not necessary to go beyond notoriety to convict caesar of gross immorality  though my notions of the roman government of their early republican virtues and of the unexampled depravity of caesar happen not to coincide exactly with the opinions of this discerning writer yet my respect for his learning and talents is in nowise abated by that selfish consideration for i think his volumes a most animated and interesting performance abounding with information as to the matter full of nerve and ardour in the diction and placing every period he treats of before the readers view with a masterly command of his subject the scoticisms as they are called which may be found now and then in the style and which have given offense real or affected to some of our priscians are in my eyes maculae too small to obscure the luster of so bright a production yet determined as he is to find nothing but purity and excellence among the early romans the fratricide of remus and the rape of the sabine women give him no umbrage in the character of romulus he is not startled at the first brutus or the more unnatural manlius ordering and superintending the execution of their own children nor at the cruelty of moneylenders to their insolvent debtors their barbarity to their slaves the bloody pastimes in the theater and other enormities from which i flatter myself it is no affectation of singularity in me to turn with disgust and abhorrence a general taken from the ploughtail to conquer his countrys enemies and returning to it after his triumph  a statesman planting his own turnips and feeding upon them as his favorite fare  present no very flattering picture of society and manners this is what shakspeare calls emphatically to make mans life as cheap as beasts  in the early romans we see a very fierce and warlike people frugal in poverty and cased round with some stony virtues while they had no access to the means of corruption or luxury but when these were within their reach indulging in them to excess when there was temptation they were tempted they were sanguine inconstant and cruel frequently persecuting their best citizens and benefactors under false names and specious pretenses subjugating mankind and trying to extend their unjust dominion to the utmost boundaries of the universe the dugs of the wolf were not confined to the suckling of romulus and remus with all this we find among them prodigies of valor of public spirit and of private virtue  after many pages of violent invective dr blackwell calls julius caesar the most ambitious profligate the nativities of rome ever registered and this at a time when with his usual animation he is depicting the proscriptions of the last bloody triumvirs when surely he had before his eyes three romans not less ambitious and much more profligate the whole transaction conducted with iniquity so deliberate and radical with such a spirit of inexorable cruelty as like the adjudications of the present french tribunals almost benumbs the hearers faculties into incredulous astonishment  in the second punick war roman virtue was at its meridian from which though the ascent to it had been tardy the decline was rapid caesar found his countrymen soaked and sodden in corruption but he did not introduce it the worst part of his conduct was during his consulship here he laid the foundation of that wicked greatness the superstructure of which he hardly lived to finish even the execrable sylla showed some regard to the prosperity of his country by four excellent regulations first as the constitution stood originally that no reference should be made to the people and no matter debated in their assembly which had not been first canvassed and decreed by the senate secondly by prohibiting the division and voting by tribes next by the abolition of the tribunes negative his power of convening the senate or entering into any business which did not relate to a plebeian and lastly by the disqualification of all but patricians from being eligible as judges in any cause public or private but though the wisdom of these measures is unquestionable yet we are justified by our knowledge of syllas character in ascribing them to a much less laudable motive than regard for his countrys welfare the edicts by which he abolished the turbulent tribunitial power were dictated chiefly by his enmity to marius and abhorrence of his faction every body of men every principle which had been favorable to the rival whom he detested were naturally the objects of his persecution while he was indulging his revengeful spirit which otherwise than by the ruin of his enemys partisans he could not indulge he made many regulations beneficial to patricians but these could have no confirmed operation till after he chose to abdicate for during his dictatorship he never suffered his will to be disputed his principal mental gratification was the devising of new modes of afflicting and tormenting the unhappy people who could be supposed to retain any attachment to the interest of marius this is a more consistent way of accounting for syllas acts as a statesman than the esprit republicain to which montesquieu is pleased to ascribe them  with keen alacrity caesar exerted himself to overturn these salutary ordinances all his proceedings having the same seditious tendency q catulus the prince of the senate declared aloud not long afterward that caesar was not undermining the constitution but storming it with a battering ram  but indefensible as is all this how can we forget that he was at this time in strict junction with pompey who if he did not suggest the measures certainly connived at nay sometimes openly abetted them to support an agrarian law and alienate the public revenue this moral citizen threatened to bring his sword as well as buckler if necessary to say he was deceived or managed by his associate is at best a poor palliative for his principles at the expense of his understanding an apology with which above all others that great but vain man would have been least satisfied pompey had many obligations to cicero caesar had none but they both let loose at him that monster clodius who seems to have lapped the blood of the centaur nessus to make this roman danton a more fatal implement of mischief they agreed to metamorphose him into a plebeian in devising this expedient or consenting to it the infamy of pompey exceeds caesars the latter only intended to worry an enemy pompey was base and ungrateful to a friend and benefactor had tully been without any other claim to his protection the oration for the manilian law deserved a different requital  it is perhaps no great credit to think erroneously of caesar with some of his admirers with dion cassius paterculus or st evremond but if he was the worst man in the world some of the best have taken pains to mislead our judgment for who can rise from the perusal of tullys orations for ligarius for marcellus nay from the philippicks with an impression on his mind that all this incense was offered at the shrine of virtue existing only in the imagination of the orator had the heart of julius been impenetrable to mercy cicero would not have chosen that quality which droppeth like the gentle dew from heaven as the subject of so much beautiful panegyric  he had great vices and great virtues he was intrepid and humane considerate friendly and bountiful natura ulciscendo lenissimus says the severe suetonius and he never remembered an offense or an injury when an overture was made toward a reconciliation before he ordered the pirates to be crucified a fate with which he had often threatened them while their prisoner he took care to have them first dispatched expeditiously and perhaps he was the only gentleman of rome who would have listened to any dictate of humanity in the punishment of such villains  for his own preservation he was in some measure forced into the civil war and he was certainly illtreated by the senate which was rash enough to exasperate without having strength enough to resist him  it is not true that he exulted in shedding the blood of his countrymen lucan who says it often in very fine verse is no authority though blackwell seems to have repeated it from him at pharsalia he ordered his veterans to fall upon the allies and spare the romans and miles faciem feri which florus calls vox ad victoriam efficax was perfectly allowable the slaughter of his victory filled his bosom with deep regret they would have it thus was an expression wrung from the sincere anguish of his heart and will admit of no perversion  had caesar never lived rome would have lost her liberty manners were so utterly changed her dominions so extended that the unwieldy empire could not have continued much longer under the form of a republic  when his incomparable abilities the lenity of his disposition his temperance and conciliating manners come to be fairly estimated it is reasonable to conclude that had he lived at a later era had the diadem descended to him by succession he would probably have been the most wise and excellent sovereign that ever governed the empire he was too sagacious to be perplexed by suspicion and too intrepid to admit fear that mean infirmity that nidus in the bosom of despots where so many base vices are for ever hatching to crawl out for the plague and persecution of the subject  the populace and the army were the stilts upon which julius raised himself above the laws of his country how cruelly they tyrannise in a neighboring kingdom the seat of injustice rapine desolation and carnage every day furnishes us with fresh examples from the modification and noble spirit of the british troops were their numbers trebled nothing is to be apprehended but by the enemy the dregs of mankind or the mob are pretty much the same in all nations ignorant precipitate venal and sanguinary and any appearance of their aiming at or obtaining the supremacy should be jealously watched and vigourously put down by every friend to good order and the existence of civil society every historical page of ancient greece and rome holds out a warning every murderous record of modern france speaks to us on this subject with most miraculous organ  there is no danger from a caesar for who has his means his boldness and capacity nor from such instruments as he employed for we have a wise and vigilant government but it is always a valuable occupation of leisure to examine the first seeds of revolutions and to prevent the growth of those noxious weeds which seldom fail to spring up from them  such are the notions which i have been able to form of caesars character if they are entirely ill founded i know not where to discover fresh materials for better information  note c p     prodigy is a fanciful province from which the descriptive muse does not wish to retire speedily the portents which are said to have been observed about the time of caesars assassination offered a favorable occasion to the poetical courtiers of augustus to indulge their vein and flatter the emperor virgil and ovid have accordingly described them with great force and majesty when they both write on the same subject it is not necessary to say which is most excellent some persons of acknowledged taste have been known to prefer virgil to homer but i believe ovid was never preferred to virgil yet admirable as are the verses toward the conclusion of the first georgick they are perhaps surpassed by shakspeares sublimity on the same topic in the tragedy of hamlet  the lines are in the part of horatio which being seldom filled by an eminent actor i have never happened to hear them recited on the stage and as they may possibly have escaped general notice no apology is necessary for transcribing them mr malone doubtless for the best reasons does not exhibit the fifth line as it is found in other modern editions but though i think there can be no appeal from his authority rather than produce the passage imperfectly i will give it as it stands in the copy which happens to be next to me in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman streets stars shone with trains of fire dews of blood sell disasters dimmed the sun and the moist star upon whose influence neptunes empire hangs was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse there is something wonderfully striking in the awful but obscure imagery here raised up to the imagination such beauties cannot be reached by the pencil  as to caesars death being the cause of these phenomena i think like hotspur so would they have been if his mothers cat had kittened some of the caesarean writers wish to impress a persuasion that divine justice pursued the conspirators against julius most of them having fallen by violent deaths and some by the very daggers which they had plunged into his body that providence should interpose in punishing the death of an usurper and upon men some of whom were of much better morals undoubtedly than he whom they destroyed will not be easily reconciled to the faith of christians who can account better for the fate of these conspirators by observing that the leaders in bold and perilous enterprises are of course exposed in dangerous situations  we cannot however affect the same incredulity with respect to a recent and striking example in the fate which has attended so many of the murderers of the late innocent and excellent king of france maxims principles and practices of their own introducing and a tribunal erected in iniquity and blood have turned the edge of destruction upon its inventors such of them as have not fallen by their own weapons one regicide and the deified assassin marat excepted have left their heads upon their own revolutionary scaffold after a trial which like that of their sovereign exhibits the most shameless violation of every principle of justice reason and equity shall i not visit for these things says the lord  from what we have already seen and see daily it would hardly be a rash prediction that in the same miserable manner every man of them will perish  the state of rome under tiberius bears so precise a similitude to the present wretched condition of france that the following words of tacitus seem like a prophetic anticipation of what exists at this moment nos saeva jussa continuas accusationes fallaces amicitias perniciem innocentium et easdem exitu causas conjungimus obvia rerum similitudine et satietate we have nothing before us but acts of despotism continual accusations the treachery of friends the ruin of innocence and trial after trial ending always in the same tragic catastrophe  of this single passage i have transcribed the translation from mr murphys excellent work lately published these volumes deserve the attentive perusal of every english reader as he will there find the true meaning and spirit of the roman historian without the affected quaintness of expression and distorted position of sentence which disfigure former versions and still more because he may discover in almost every section the surprising resemblance between the most hideous despotism avowed and the present chaotick french republic which with a throat of brass dares to call all the sovereigns of europe tyrants the king of great britain being included in the number  note d p     of all vices incident to human nature cruelty is the worst and at the same time the most unaccountable envy revenge avarice and other bad passions rise in the mind from objects proper to excite them and a certain degree of instinctive sense impells men to seek their gratification but how is it consistent with the least shadow of reflection with the elements of a frame endued with sensibility and feeling to find delight in devising inflicting and superintending the infliction of the most exquisite and ingenious torments yet this was the abomination to which the romans were most addicted it did not begin with nor was it confined to the emperors but long before had contaminated the lives of too many of their most illustrious citizens a propensity so general must have had some cause as general  we must consider that the romans were more constantly than any other nation engaged in wars either foreign or domestic battles were not decided then as since the discovery of gunpowder by weapons which sent destruction at a distance but every roman saw the wounds and death which he inflicted on every enemy the carnage to which they were accustomed lost its horror and indifference to bloodshed soon grew to be interwoven with their nature to this must be added the savage cast of their recreations their pleasure resulted from seeing hundreds of the most furious wild beasts tearing one another to pieces and devouring before their eyes human bodies thrown to them alive in the arena and from the combats of gladiators who were instructed to give and receive wounds with grace and agility and to expire before them in attitudes proper for the imitation of the statuary and painter the romans in short after spilling human blood in the field as their profession went to the theater to see it shed for their amusement forgiveness of injuries besides made no part of their religion that benevolent precept was reserved for a divine founder in this manner they were trained up and enticed to be wicked and they became as cruel as butchers from similar habits and for the same reason had equal care been employed to cultivate in their breasts the seeds of benignity and compassion it would have been equally efficacious the state pretense for indulging the people in these barbarous exhibitions was that by thus familiarizing them with the sight of pain and death they became more fearless and braver soldiers but it only served to make them more inhuman the emperors most infamous for cruelty and a passion for these bloody spectacles were at the same time not less notorious for cowardice  though boxing is not a science with the french as with the english the french are certainly a more cruel people and perhaps it may be ascribed to the frequency of the tortures inflicted on criminals at their public executions which were always more numerously attended in proportion to their severity and duration considerable sums were given by french ladies to secure a commodious seat to see the horrible execution of damien the abolition of the rack mitigation of the penal code and a more equitable mode of proceeding in criminal prosecutions were the only substantial advantages held out to france by the promoters of her boasted revolution of these the first is the only one which she has actually obtained and it is well known that this humane abolition originated with his late majesty  note e p     the government of athens was democratical and she stands out in the history of mankind stained with the foulest injustice and iniquity inconstant weak suspicious ungrateful and sanguinary perpetually defiled with the blood of her deliverers and most deserving citizens see them enumerated by lucian in his dialogue against giving too hasty an assent to calumny socrates phocion miltiades themistocles aristides cimon timotheus alcibiades and other illustrious characters whose very names excite reverence and admiration as a reward for their virtues and glorious achievements were condemned by their inhuman countrymen to fines imprisonment exile or death so that every athenian who distinguished himself in the service of his country seemed to be warned by the catastrophe of his predecessors that he was but accelerating his own perdition when the excellent phocion was led to an ignominious death to which he had been unjustly doomed by the people of athens he declared that he expected no better for such had been the fate of almost every illustrious athenian  the great exploits of the athenians furnish no proof of the energy of a democratick constitution for these were always performed when the people were led and governed by some eminent person upon whom at the time were devolved the whole powers of the state so that in fact the democracy was then suspended it signifies little what a government may be called when it acts on principles in nowise analogous to its denomination at athens it was easily known when the people took the helm again into their own hands for weakness confusion and cruelty immediately succeeded the first display of their power was commonly the disgrace or death of those very persons to whom they owed their renown and security the treatment of hannibal by the people of carthage of coriolanus camillus the scipios tully and other great men by the demagogues of rome and the consequences are well known repentance makes but poor atonement for ruin during the vigorous usurpation of cromwell england was called a commonwealth and was much respected but what sovereign was ever more absolute or acted under less control than the protector a nation entirely governed by one man is an absolute monarchy not a republic the common people who are afraid of tyrants mistake they are in no danger from them indigence and obscurity excite neither their apprehensions nor their envy the wise the virtuous and the opulent are as naturally the defenders of the people as they are the terror and the prey of the tyrant  the insolence of mark antony and the excesses of which he was so often guilty made tully wish that brutus had not killed caesar in like manner the friends of liberty in france consider the bastile as comparatively a less evil than the capricious and bloody tyranny of the people who destroyed it whoever expresses his disapprobation of a democracy is exposed to the calumny of furious zealots who immediately hold him out as an indirect advocate for despotism but the good subjects of great britain glory in its constitution because they know it enjoys the most perfect rational freedom that ever existed since the first institution of civil society if every kingdom in the world were to struggle for such a constitution as the english nay to encounter for it the worst of all calamities a civil war it would not be surprising but that men should be found in the very bosom of that enviable country absurd or desperate enough to disseminate notions which tend to its subversion that societies should be formed to hold up the bloody tablature of france under the false title of liberty and equality as an object to excite the emulation of rational creatures is a manifestation of human effrontery unexampled before and hardly to be credited even by those who witness it could all the injustice cruelty and oppression of french despotism since the reign of that obdurate bigot louis xi with his hangman tristan be collected together and put into one scale of iniquity and the atrocities of a single day in france since the rabble have been rulers thrown into the other they would preponderate against it it is in short a species of government which is always exerted to do wrong and which can be operative only for mischief  men may as well go out of the world as they came into it without observation or memory as when the same effects are constantly produced by the same causes to discern the last and not to prevent the former  the necessity the romans were under of creating a dictator or a magistrate without control on every great exigency of affairs either domestic or foreign shows their consciousness of the defect in a divided executive they detested the name of king but they could not exist without his functions it is computed that there are now in the city of paris above ten thousand dictators without parts property principles or experience and by these the public business is conducted events are in the hands of god and the sagacity of mortals is always fallible but if ever the grounds were laid which threatened the duration of calamity in any state when it was easy to foresee and not presumptuous to prophecy the actual condition of illfated france seems to invite the most melancholy predictions  note f p     upon a general revision of the roman history to the time of augustus it will be found to contain a series of obstinate and bloody wars either foreign or civil with a few short intervals of peace and these constantly disturbed by seditions feuds and tumults insomuch that the common expedient for securing the public tranquillity was to direct the fierce passions of the people against some unfortunate country the conquest and plunder of which might for a time at least appease their restless ambition and insatiable avarice  the internal commotions which commonly originated at rome in some pretense for the peoples advantage though they produced nominal extension of their privileges seldom ended in any material improvement of their condition nor had the revolutions in the state much other effect than to aggrandize the leaders and give additional authority to the few  by the abolition of royalty they gained nothing a power over their lives beyond what had ever been claimed by kings undefined and without limitation passed into the hands of dictators consuls and other magistrates who exercised it always with rigor and often wantonly that short but frequent formula  ne quid respublica detrementi caperet delivered over at once the lives and liberties of the citizens to the magistrates disposal  whoever will take the trouble to examine the roman annals from the first institution of the consulship to the entire subversion of the republic will perhaps be surprised to find how frequently during that period the government was under different dictators that is under the dominion of a single chief magistrate invested by the law the constitution and usage with uncontrollable authority and after the expiration of his despotick office not accountable to the people or to any tribunal for the manner in which he had exercised it who had the nomination of this arbitrary magistrate not the people but another magistrate the object always was to keep down the people in the second punick war livy says they named q fabius maximus prodictator the consul being absent but he takes care to have it known that it was the single instance  quod nunquam ante eum diem factum erat nor probably would this innovation have been thought of or permitted but at such a calamitous season as the invasion of hannibal  there were i think about sixteen dictators at different times in less than two centuries so that the roman republic was sixteen times suspended and under a domination not less arbitrary than that of louis the fourteenth over france or of the emperor of morocco over his barbarians had we no other information more direct upon the subject to evince the aristocracy of the roman government its policy profound and invariable as it was unjust and oppressive especially with respect to foreign states sufficiently demonstrates that such a system could not have been devised and prosecuted by the multitude but that it was the work of enlightened statesmen who discerned its effects by their experience and transmitted it to their successors in a clear collection of principles and maxims which could never be departed from without hazarding the whole by any partial relaxation at the intervals when the people presumed to take the reins into their own hands the machine either stood still or went backwards and when the chiefs of the senate resumed their functions their vigor and wisdom were doubly exerted to restore it again to its original capacity of progression  the tribune that great popular officer who hung like a dead weight upon the neck of the law was chiefly formidable by factious opposition to the senate when he put forth his power to do mischief democracy that is confusion was triumphant but many tribunes being intelligent and temperate their wisdom was shown in acquiescence not in thwarting the measures of their countrys most respectable assembly besides it must be remembered that these disturbers had no jurisdiction beyond the walls of the city and as the dissent of one of them rendered the proceedings of the rest a nullity it was no very difficult matter for the senate to secure that one in their interest so to react upon them all and to impede the impeders the first measure of these demagogues was to instigate the manyheaded monster to banish romes bravest commander the patrician coriolanus which drove him to take refuge with the enemy to march back in the van of a volscian army laying all waste before him with sword and fire to the very walls of the city which but for the intercession of his noble mother he would have depopulated and reduced to ashes no defense is here implied of his vindictive resentment  tully the warmest and most eloquent advocate for the senatorial bench at last declares himself of opinion that the institution of the tribune supposed for a time to be so fatal to good government preserved rome from unutterable confusion and anarchy because the extravagant views and jarring disposition of the multitude being in some measure compressed and rendered intelligible through the organ of their officer it became practicable either to defeat their opposition or to reconcile them by the management of him in whom they confided as their orator and representative  spurius cassius viscellinus the first propounder of an agrarian law which he expiated from the tarpeian rock spurius maelius who fell by the sword of ahala manlius another cassius in his ambition and his catastrophe the gracchi marius clodius caesar all were tyrants or attempted to be so not by undue influence in the senate but by corrupting and inflaming the most numerous the most despicable and most dangerous part of the community no man can love the rabble for themselves he may indeed value them as the engineer does gunpowder for the destructive use which may be made of it  the simplicity of names imposed much upon the generality of romans as it seems to have done upon too many modern writers though there was the greatest difference as to power there was little distinction of titles caius caesar and cneius pompey at the time rome was completely under their subjection were the appellations by which those great men were best known republican pride was not wounded on the surface and the ear at least was little accustomed to humiliation  to the king of great britain as the palladium of british liberty the law has taken care to give every decoration which epithets can add for his personal inviolability and magisterial honor yet titles which flow from him those annexed to professional peerages excepted are sometimes veils for insignificance mere gilded penthouses for inefficient vanity when they are ancient and hereditary unless disgraced by the possessors we pay to them an involuntary respect because they are always accompanied with some idea of superiority a person of mean endowments ennobled even in the most modern times is commonly possessed at least of considerable property and the world seems to acknowledge that wealth gives one sufficient claim to importance but this man of importance with his title and his riches can infringe no law of england with impunity while the ancient roman republican like the modern french anarchist without either we see violating all the natural and municipal rights of his fellowcitizens with the most undisguised effrontery  there is no subject upon which more erroneous notions have been formed or more illconsidered dissertations published than the roman constitution while under the name of a republic but especial care must be taken not to confound two terms populus romanus and plebes as if they were of the same import the former comprises the senators patricians knights and gentry the latter means the idle the indigent and worthless or what we understand by the monosyllabical denomition mob  the real government was in the senate or rather in a few chiefs of the senate whoever was observed to court the favor of the populace and to neglect the conscript fathers was immediately suspected of harboring designs subversive of the constitution the criterion was infallible it instantly produced unanimity in the senate they knew that the faeces populi romani could be cajoled or stimulated only to create confusion and to make the demagogue their tyrant  with respect to the interference of the lowest order in the business of legislation the sentiments of cato that selfdevoted martyr to roman liberty though he was sometimes reluctantly compelled to submit to it were little different from those of coriolanus or of the proudest patrician who reprobated the idea with disdain and indignation they were often employed as instruments to disturb but seldom to regulate and their consequence terminated with the close of an election or the suppression of a tumult unless a succession of shameless tribunes chose to keep them in a state of permanent insurrection the senate were averse to and afraid of monarchy not the populace the latter loved even the emperors the former flattered them knowing their danger and trying to shelter themselves from it the herd were safe and therefore indifferent nero was not unpopular at rome till after he had set it on fire nor was henry the eighth in england but even military despotism is less intolerable than anarchy because some subordination may be expected in the one and caprice and cruelty are for ever to be apprehended in the other  i would not be understood to assert that the people at rome had not regularly considerable power where many great offices were elective and the people electors it could not be otherwise nay where their general sense could be collected in favor of any measure not utterly unreasonable it was generally prevalent but they did not constitute the preponderating weight in the government and at all times when they got more than their proper share of subordinate influence they as constantly made a very bad use of it in england where the government is nominally monarchical in what instance has not the sense of the majority been respected but the clamor of a multitude is not to be mistaken for the sense of a nation  were i to fix upon the period of roman history in which the lowest class had legitimately the most power i should not hesitate to pronounce however singular it may appear that it was for not much less than one hundred and forty years from the time of romulus to the collecting the suffrages by centuries under the sixth king servius tullius the young horatius condemned to death by the duumviri for killing his sister auctore tullo rege was absolved in consequence of an appeal to the people the king declined trying the cause and referred it to two judges to avoid the censure of too much severity on one side and the inconvenience of unpopularity on the other and so suggested an appeal from the judicial sentence which shows the consideration in which the people were then held servius the sixth king certainly thought they were likely to prevail too much and depressed them by changing the mode of collecting the suffrages as to acts of violence by hired mobs composed at rome as every where else of the dregs of mankind it only proves that they were not the government not only the chief power of the state but all real freedom of action seemed to reside in the senate and in the persons of a few magistrates during their continuance in office did the statutebooks or the common law of great britain secure liberty only to members of parliament to the board of treasury the lord mayor and a few other magistrates what reasonable man would affirm that reform was at present a speculation idle unnecessary or factious  the consuls were annual kings invested under another name with more authority than is allowed to limited royalty why the democratick ascendency has been sometimes asserted may perhaps be thus easily accounted for writers have taken up the subject by parts without a fair examination of the whole having some favorite system to support or theory to illustrate at once flattering to ingenuity and irreconcilable to experience they find a particular occurrence or some detached passages of an ancient author which may be accommodated to their purpose and they build upon them some crude and hasty dogma which afterward is not to be relinquished their partiality will not allow them to discern their error at the time nor will their want of candor upon better information suffer the retraction to every passage which can be found countenancing the supremacy of the populace at large it is not too much to affirm that at least half a dozen may be opposed of a contrary tendency exaggeration and high coloring must be expected in orations they consitute the grace not the substance of history and often are the work of the historians invention but we see the speeches of demagogues abounding in general with complaints of the degradation and abject state of plebeians and with bitter reprehensions of the overweening ambition and jealous tyranny of the nobles  but allowing this point to remain undecided we may turn our view to another where there is no room for misrepresentation theory or the fertility of conjectural inference behold then  this nurse of heroes this delight of gods under a dictator as described already with a numerous army by sea and land scourged or cudgeled by the centurion and decimated by the general wives exposed to divorce from the avarice disgust or capricious inconstancy of their husbands usurious creditors permitted by the law to imprison lash and torture the persons of their insolvent debtors the whole youth of rome holding their lives at the pleasure of their fathers who might have cast them out at their birth to perish by cold or famine with slaves abounding in every family less in estimation than the cattle of their owners and where can be found a picture of more complete subjection and inequality for equality beyond that of protection from just laws is but a word which knaves utter and their dupes swallow yet the commonwealth of rome and roman liberty are sounds for ever in the mouth of hypocrites or visionaries  for the preposterous doctrine of equality in its most preposterous latitude the example of rome has been produced repeatedly whether for the sake of mischief or from ignorance i know not but the contest there was for the partition of distinctions not for their abolition not that there should be no offices of great power and emolument but that all orders should have a right of admission to them that plebeians should be eligible to the consulship that they should have lictors and fasces was the demand of the people not that there should be no consulship and no insignia  but we cannot be deceived the veil of imposition is too transparent not to be seen through declaimers among us mean to divert the attention of their hearers from the blessings which they enjoy to contemplate imaginary and impracticable perfection which never existed and to transfer the worship of freedoms true divinity at home to the grim and deformed idol in ancient rome or modern france which assumes her name but has not one of her attributes  after we have looked to antiquity or to the nations which surround us after we have examined the states which have been and are extinguished after we have scrutinized unreal republics sketched in the lucubrations of a grecian philosopher or a british theorist the judgment returns homeward to repose on the unrivalled constitution of our own country where a long succession of mature experiments has ended in the establishment of a system in which the best faculties have been directed to two great objects the ascertaining human rights and securing social felicity  when we contemplate the means of happiness which providence has been pleased to distribute so abundantly over the universe we must acknowledge that the grandeur and superiority of the romans were very dearly purchased to be engaged in war or in civil commotions for a period of above seven hundred years and to sink into the most abject slavery afterward was the fate of this extolled and envied people what a state for social creatures as if men were sent into the world for no better purpose than to worry and drive others out of it  were glory the most desirable end of human pursuits and actions rome must certainly be considered as the first country in the universe but if virtue and contentment are preferable perhaps it was the last  the end
