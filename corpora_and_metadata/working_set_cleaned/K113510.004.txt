effect of the rapid discharge of the waters after the destruction of the old world by the deluge aided by volcanic fury volcanoes or vestiges of volcanoes are to be seen in most parts to this day amazing caverns mountains piled upon mountains with all the testimonies of the mighty confusion we know not the antecedent form but it was evidently shattered by that great event from the top of the bay of bengal to the very pole it swept every thing before it and left a vast expanse of ocean uninterrupted by any land except the diminutive spots of kerguelin islands or the lesser speck of amsterdam and st paulo  from cape negrais the southern point of pegu the waters seem to have been impelled toward the vast pacific ocean the isles of andaman and nicobar first show that tendency in a slight degree all the peninsula of malacca was affected in a higher the island of sumatra follows the curvature of that part of the continent at java it begins to show the sury of the attracted course of the waters toward the east java cumbava timor the molucca islands and new guinea were formed by their influence at new guinea the torrent took a southerly direction and rent into fragments all that part of the primitive world even to the remotest of the society islands which like the train of a comet show the innumerable remnants of land most evident witnesses of its course the amazing island of new holland resisted the force and continues more worthy of the name of a continent new zealand remains divided from all the rest to the east is sea as far as america and remote as the pole itself on the south the north part of the vast pacific is contracted by the approximation of asia and america the crescent of islands from alaschka to kamtschatka mark the ancient union of the present continents the flood formed from the south of kamtschatka the kuril isles matmay and japan liqueo and formosa the philippine islands the great borneo and all the groups scattered over the ocean to the northeast such as the pelew the ladrones and the carolinas and the range named after lord mulgrave such is the hypothetical view of this face of the globe  sumatra sumatra the first island which strikes our eye bounds the west side of the streights of malacca the equator crosses it in the middle and divides it into almost two equal parts acheen head lies in lat      north and hogs point in     south the length is about eight hundred miles and the greatest breadth a hundred and thirty all the western side is very low and intersected with swamps insulating certain patches slightly elevated a range of mountains runs through the whole island much nearer to the western than the eastern coast in some places they are double and treble with beautiful valleys between each chain but excepting where cleared both valley and mountain are clothed with shady forests these chains approximate to the coast on the whole of the western side at their foot is low and often swampy land  some of the mountains are of a vast height ophir mount ophir situated immediately under the line is       feet high or two miles one thousand and ninetyfour yards no snow is ever seen on it yet the inhabitants of all the chains are like those of other alpine regions subject to monstrous wens or goitres this malady owes its origin to the water or the thick cold and foggy vapors which universally arise from the valleys these people are not infested with any particular disease the result of the tumors they enjoy the same health as others bad climate but the climate of sumatra near to the sea or amidst the swamps is dreadful near indrapour says lind essay on diseases p     is a place where no european can venture to sleep one night on shore during the rainy season without running the hazard of his life or at least of a dangerous fit of sickness and at podang a dutch settlement on the same island the air has been found so bad that it is commonly called the plague coast here a thick pestilential vapor or fog arises after the rains from the marshes which destroys all the white inhabitants  in all these chains are numbers of volcanoes volcanoes which are called by the malayes goonong appee they generally smoke but seldom emit flames or lava marsdens sumatra p     i believe no accurate observations have been yet made on their nature being at a considerable distance inland and the approach impeded by deep and almost impenetrable forests sulphur may be collected in any quantity about their sides  the island abounds with minerals minerals it has been long famous for its gold gold some is dug out of the earth but by reason of the unwholesomeness of the climate no europeans dare attempt to work and the natives are too lazy to go to any depth the greatest part is taken out of the rivers and washed from the sand and gravel the amount brought annually to the western parts of sumatra does not exceed ten thousand ounces menangacabow a central and principal kingdom has the greatest quantity the richest mines lying within its territory the malayes are most skilful artists in works of fillagree in both gold and silver mr marsden sumatra p     gives an ample account of the manufacture which with the coarsest of instruments is carried on to the most amazing degree of elegance and perfection on mention of that gentleman let me own my obligation to his admirable history of sumatra for most of the articles on the subject of that island  i find no mention of any silver being found here copper but it produces abundance of copper of the richest kind  tin is met with in vast plenty tin chiefly near palambang on the east coast and on the isle of banka it is a considerable article of trade and smelted into small pieces is exported in great quantities to china  iron is found in menangacabow iron where it is fused for use  coal is a production of sumatra coal naptha or earth oil is another and is principally used to resist the ravages of the terms or white ants  saltpetre is procured in abundance out of the vast caverns with which the island is hollowed and is extracted out of the dung of the swallows called layang layang which build by thousands in the roofs these seem to be the kind which make the esculent nests the dung extends often twenty feet in breadth and is from four to six feet in depth  napal or the steatites earth forms the basis of the cliffs and often the beds of the rivers  i shall now pursue the other parts of the natural history begin with the zoology and treat of it on the authority of mr marsden flinging it into a systematic form  the horses are small and hardy horses cows sheep the cows and sheep are also small the last supposed to be of the bengal breed  the buffalo buffalo or carbow the most useful animal of the island is the beast of draught and supplies the inhabitants with milk and butter there are none at present in a state of nature  domestic goats are common and are called cambing goats as to the cambing ootan or goat of the woods of mr marsden his description is not sufficient for me to ascertain the species one says he sumatra p     which i saw was three feet in height and four feet in the length of the body it had something of the gazelle in its appearance and excepting the horns which were about six inches long and turned back with an arch it did not much resemble the common goat the hinder parts were shaped like those of a bear the rump sloping round off from the back the tail was very small and ended in a point the legs clumsy the hair along the ridge of the back rising coarse and strong almost like bristles no beard over the shoulder was a large spreading tuft of greyish hair the rest of the hair black throughout the scrotum globular its disposition seemed wild and fierce and it is said by the natives to be remarkably swift  the deer seem to be the different sort of axis deer hist quad i p     mr marsden names it the hogdeer no    but certainly not the babyrossa as he supposes it which we shall hereafter show to be a hog  the wild boar is frequent wild boar the domestic is of the kind we call the chinese  the onehorned rhinoceros is common rhinoceros mr charles miller informed me by a friend that the twohorned no  0 is sometimes seen here  the forests abound with elephants elephants few are applied to use about ten are kept for state by the king of acheen and that faithful traveller mr forest voy p     adds that the inhabitants of the capital make use of them as horses in their journies into the country much of the ivory is sent to china and to europe the wild elephants collect in great herds and are very destructive in the plantations the natives contrive to poison them by inserting a fatal drug into the sugarcanes split for that purpose  of the digitated quadrupeds are found variety of apes apes the gibbon or longarmed no    in vast multitudes generally perched by hundreds on the tops of trees and very seldom descending the ourang outang is said to be found in sumatra which is probable as it is met with in the adjacent islands the pigtailed baboon no  0  is an inhabitant of this country  among the battas are numbers of small black dogs dogs with erect ears which are fattened for food wild dogs inhabit all parts of the island  tigers are numerous and very destructive tigers they annually kill in the pepper country a hundred people there are even instances of their depopulating whole villages yet the natives will not destroy them for they hold the doctrine of transmigration and fear that in the tiger they may hurt the soul of an ancestor  here are two or three species of lesser kind called tiger cats  the bear no  0  is small and black bears and devours the heart or pith of the cocopalms  otters and civets finish the list given us of the rapacious animals of this island otter mr marsden mentions an animal called a stinkard i suppose one of the mephitic weesels  the crested porcupine no     and i think the longtailed porcupine no     are found in this country  squirrels marsdens sumatra p     small and of a dark color squirrel inhabit the woods  mr marsden mentions a sloth the twotoed no     sloth and the armadillo he names it the tanqueeling which is the shorttailed manis no   0 as to the armadillo the whole tribe is confined to south america  the vast bats no     or no     swarm here bats as they do in all the islands they fly from island to island and in their passage are often seen dipping into the sea probably to snatch up the smaller fishes  it is very difficult to ascertain the birds rds i can readily suppose them to be the same with those of india or the neighboring islands i shall mention only two one the scarce species the argus pheasant spoken of before among the chinese birds outlines of the globe vol iii p      i here add that it is very common in the woods of sumatra etc  the other bird is the cassowary latham iii p  0 tab    this curious genus is related to the ostrich but is most local being confined to the torrid zone and only to that part which includes this island java banda and a few others of this great archipelago it runs fast is very fierce when in the wild state grunts like a hog and will kick violently like the ostrich its food is vegetables but will swallow iron stones or any thing that is offered  i shall take notice of only one insect insects which is the common be the apis mellifica which in these hot countries is left to itself unhived vast quantities of the wax is exported to china bengal and other parts of india as to the honey it is far inferior to the european kind  i may mention that among the lizards is the crocodile crocodile which makes dreadful havoc among the bathers who cannot be persuaded from the performance of that rite notwithstanding the danger besides they look upon these terrible reptiles with a degree of respect probably for the same reason as they do the tiger  sumatra still wants its florist i must content myself with giving a list of such of the vegetable kingdom as contribute to commercial purposes or to the general use of the natives  pepper is the great staple of the island pepper it was for the sake of that spice that we defied the wretched climate mr marsden sumatra p  0  gives a long and curious account of its cultivation he also informs us that the white is only black stripped of the outer coat  the piper betel is cultivated greatly betel and sent to the coast of coromandel and to telinga for the purpose of chewing wrapped round the areca as we have already mentioned outlines of the globe vol i p       the arundo bambos is very common bamboo and not only furnishes materials for building the houses but as i imagine produces the quantities of canes that are exported from the western side of the island  the calamus rotang rumphius rotang vol v p    tab    and numbers of the following pages and plates furnishes annually great cargoes chiefly from the eastern side of the island which the dutch send to europe and the country traders to the western parts of india the specific name rotang signifies in the malayan language a staff or walking stick the common thick canes which serve for this purpose and the small limber canes imported from india are all varieties of the calamus rotang  the former is  palmi juncus calapparius var a linn and is accurately described by rumphius amb vol v p    the texture of its wood its leaves and flowering stems bear a striking resemblance to some species of palm hence rumphius has not unaptly named it palmi juncus or palm rush its natural situation is in woody mountanous tracts there it pervades the highest trees and interlacing its branches from bough to bough forms by its innumerable ramifications and spinous stems an impenetrable thicket  in order to fit this cane for the purpose of a walking stick a single interstice of sufficient length between two joints is made choice of this is loaded with a weight or bound tight to a board for the space of a month and also exposed to smoke to diminish somewhat of its natural pliability  rumphius observes herb amb vol   p  00 that no author he had seen described this cane which he imputes to its growing only in the remote parts of india and sequestered mountains rarely visited by europeans till they acquired sovereign power over some of the regions  laurus casia outlines of the globe vol i p      casia or bastard cinnamon grows in abundance in the interior parts of the north of the island it is sometimes fifty and sixty feet high and two feet in diameter much of the bark is exported as the true cinnamon and from the root a camphor may as is said be extracted  a tree linschotten p    producing camphor camphor abounds here and in borneo it grows near to the sea and is equal in bulk to our largest oaks being sometimes fifteen feet in circumference and a hundred feet high the timber is excellent for the use of the carpenter being light and durable and resists the injury of insects this valuable drug camphor marsdens sumatra p      is as much valued by the sumatrans as by the europeans and serves for medical purposes it has very long been in use among the arabs much is sent to china as well as europe  the styrax benzoin of mr jonas dryander phil trans lxxvii p  0  tab xii  benzoin grows chiefly in the battas country but not to a great size the gum is procured by incision and sent down to the ports in large cakes a vast quantity is transmitted to europe where in roman catholic countries it is used as incense the rest is a most valuable medicine as an expectorant and styptic and forms the basis of turlingtons balsam it is burnt in all the malaye isles to perfume the rooms to expel the insects the unwholesome air and noxious exhalations i am doubtful whether this tree has been well ascertained for linschotten p     who seems well acquainted with it speaks of it as of vast height and size  coffee is cultivated in sumatra but for want of skill coffee the berries are not in any esteem  both the gossypium arboreum and herbaceum cotton may be had here in any quantities but for want of encouragement no more is cultivated than serves for the uses of the country  bombax ceiba is planted near every village and strikes the eye of strangers by its singular form being in shape of the branches like a dumb waiter so regularly do they spread one above the other  ebony diospyros melanoxylon flor coroman tab xlvi  ebony that valued wood for furniture so highly esteemed by our ancestors is common here it has been known since the days of virgil  india fert ebenum molles sua thura sabaei pliny gives us a whole chapter on this wood lib xii c    he says it was trunco enodi materie nigri splendoris ac vel sine art protinus jucundi virgil was mistaken by confining ebony to india it was also produced in aethiopia hexodotus in thalia tells us that the aethiopians paid their tribute every three years in that article to the persian kings it was esteemed the most valuable tribute after gold and ivory pompey had an ebony tree carried before him in his triumph over mithridates yet to this day we have not one to place in our celebrated garden at kew  the teek outlines of the globe vol i p    tab iv  tectona grandis teek tectona grandis the pride of the eastern forests grows in the north and east of sumatra  the pines which captain cook found in the different parts of the south seas are common here pines and are called arou they flourish in a light sandy soil and are the first trees that grow on lands deserted by the sea at page  0 tab    of the first volume of captain cooks second voyage is some account of this tree which as yet has not been classically described  sandal wood ibid vol i p   0  sandal  pterocarpus santolinus both the white and the red are produced in sumatra  the poisonous manchineel tree manchineel hippomane mancinilla catesby vol i p     is common here as well as in the west indies and furnishes a most useful timber as it resists the attacks of the terms or white ants it is also valuable in works of ornament the wood being finely veined but the juice is so noxious that if any falls on the eyes it will occasion a blindness of many days and the very droppings of the leaves after rain raise blisters on the skin standing under its shade for any length of time affects the senses  one of the sideroxylons or iron woods is common here iron wood and of great use on account of its extraordinary hardness it may be the sideroxylon inerme hort elth     tab     hort kew i   0  the pitch called dammer dammer mentioned in the article pulo condor is extracted in abundance from certain resinous trees which go under the common malayan name of canari they grow in vast plenty in the spice islands but we find that some species have extended far more west rumphius describes all of them but the species productive of this article are the dammara nigra vol ii p   0 tab    and the dammara nigra legitima     tab    quantities are sent to bengal and other places for the same uses as pitch and tar are in europe and particularly for the shipping  among the trees or vegetables productive of the necessary food for the natives esculents is the coco palm rice the padda or upland the common mayz sesamum in great quantities for the oil it produces which is used only in burning ricinus palma christi for the castor oil grows wild costus arabicus amomum zerambet and several others are raised for medicinal purposes a rumphius is wanted to pervade the forests of this vast island and bring to light the numberless hidden treasures it contains important perhaps in mechanics medicine and the luxuries of life  the cycas circinalis or sago tree outlines of the globe vol i p      begins to appear here but is not in such general use as a food sago as we shall find it in the more eastern islands the plenty of rice supersedes the necessity of it in sumatra i must not pass over the knowledge that our great traveller sir john mandeville travels p     had of this valuable tree who found it in a great isle he calls pathen  in that land says that flower of chivalry grown trees that beren mele whereof men maken good bred and white and of good savor and it semethe as it were of whete but it is not allynges of such savor and zif zou like to here how the mele comethe out of the trees i shall seye zou men hewn the trees with an hachet all

they han it to a mylle to grynde and it becomethe fair mele and white  i shall conclude this subject with mentioning that on this coast strange plant of purchase near tappanooly mr charles miller phil trans vol lxviii p     found the strange plant as purchase vol i p     calls it discovered by sir james lancaster on the island of sombrero who speaks of it as a tree which shrunk into the ground as soon as it was touched wonderful things were related of it by our old navigator it is named says mr miller by the malayes lalanlaut or sea grass it is found in sandy bays or in shallow water where it appears like a slender strait stick but when you attempt to touch it immediately withdraws itself into the sand i could never observe any tentacula a broken piece near a foot long which after many unsuccessful attempts i drew out was perfectly strait and uniform and resembled a worm drawn over a knitting needle when dry it is a coral  that sumatra was known to the ancients is most probable but that only partially this and two others which ptolemy unites seem in the opinion of mr caverhill to have been the sabaddibae of the old geographer the mohammedan travelers of the year      called it ramni they speak of its gold mines and excellent camphor and of the inhabitants being cannibals marco polo is very diffuse in his account of this island which he calls the little java he actually traveled over six of its eight kingdoms and gives various particulars long since confirmed by the later travelers he mentions the custom of eating human flesh he describes the rhinoceros under the name of licorne camphor sago the cocoa palms and the tapping them for the acquisition of the liquor toddy so necessary a drink to the inhabitants  after a very long interval the portuguese again discovered sumatra portuguese lopez sequeira in   0  by the command of his great master sailed on a voyage of discovery and arrived at the port of pedeer to the east of acheen at the northern end of the island osorio vol p      there he found ships from pegu bengal and several other countries the king a mohammedan treated him with much civility the great albuquerque visited the island in person and entered into a treaty with the king of pedeer the portuguese afterward engaged deeply in the wars between the petty monarchs of the country but i do not find that they ever made any settlement  the dutch followed them in      dutch an account of that voyage may be seen in lhistoire de la navigation de linde orientale printed at amsterdam in   0  in future i shall in my references to those voyages cite them by the name of nicolass collection who was the publisher at p    is given an account of their first descent and a plate of the dresses of the inhabitants the dutch formed several factories in sumatra which flourish to this day the principal is at padang in the neighborhood of the gold country their next is at palanbang for the sake of the tin which is dug by the natives and fused on the isle of banca on the east side of sumatra opposite to the discharge of the river of palambang the city stands some miles from the mouth it once belonged to the king of bantam in java and is even to this day peopled by javans but since the dutch have rendered that monarchy in a manner dependant on themselves they most probably may be styled its masters besides making it the magazine of the tin drawn from banca they collect vast quantities of pepper from the neighboring parts in      this city was attacked by a dutch fleet sent from batavia to revenge some most barbarous murders committed on their countrymen it was strongly fortified with trunks of trees closely put together and mounted with numbers of cannon notwithstanding this the dutch succeeded and burnt the city to the ground  the english are at present in possession of the great trade of sumatra english the reputation of its vast wealth gave rise to the first voyage ever made by our countrymen to the east indies elizabeth in the   d year of her reign issued her patent which constituted originally the east india company it is given at length by purchase pilgrimage vol i p       in consequence of this that able sailor james lancaster sir james lancaster afterward sir james was sent there and sailed from torbay on april  d   0  he commanded the dragon of six hundred tons and had with him the hector of three hundred the ascension of two hundred and sixty and one more her highness furnished her general as he was called with letters to diverse of the eastern potentates among others one to the king of acheen the chief and first object of the voyage he did not arrive at sumatra till may  d   0  the fame of elizabeths victories over the spaniards had reached the kings ears and in consequence lancaster was most favorably received he presented gifts of great value on the part of his mistress and received others in return the portuguese did all in their power to prevent a good understanding between the english and the king but to no purpose lancaster even made a short cruise and took a rich ship from saint thome on the coromandel coast belonging to the portuguese which was deemed a lawful prize that kingdom being then in possession of our great enemy philip ii our general got in part of his lading of pepper in this island the rest in malacca and after obtaining many valuable privileges from the king of acheen returned with a most friendly letter from the sumatran prince he met with a dreadful storm off madagascar in the midst of the confusion he thought of the services he might render to his country by this remarkable notice the passage to the east indies lies in    degrees  0 minutes by the northwest on the american side after encountering many difficulties he anchored safe in the downs on september   th   0  sir james acquired great wealth and reputation by this voyage which he lived thirty years after to enjoy as he well deserved  we followed the advantages of this enterprise the dutch who had settled themselves in the island entertained the highest jealousy of our rising commerce and gave all possible opposition they even once expelled us from bantam where we had a factory we then turned our thoughts toward acheen and met there some of the island chieftains in the year      who invited us to settle on their lands this gave rise to our establishment at bencoolen bencoolen which became the supreme factory the fort called fort marlborough was founded we are now the principal traders in the island and export from thence annually twelve hundred tons of pepper the greatest part to europe the rest to china this settlement is unwholesome the air full of malignant vapors the mountains continually clothed with thick heavy clouds which break out in lightning thunder rain and shortlived storms the fort is tolerably healthy during the sickly season and to that place the merchants should make their retreat  in the year    0 the french admiral destaign destroyed this fort and all our other settlements on the island in order to drive us from the lucrative pepper trade but they were soon reestablished and our possessions secured to us in      by the treaty of paris  on the coast of the battas country are two settlements natal one at natal and another on a small isle in the noble bay of tappanoly which penetrates deeply inland and is capable of containing all the navies of europe so as to ride securely in any weather with such a multitude of harbors that a large ship could remain concealed so as to elude all search in this bay is found plenty of that enormous shell the keemo or chama gigas bonan i       argenville tab    fig e  it is often three foot broad and of the weight of five hundred pounds and is taken in deep water by thrusting a long bamboo between the shells while they are gaping which close and then are drawn up the shell is quite white and worked by the natives like ivory the fish weighs often thirty pounds and is excellent when stewed  sumatra is divided into numerous little kingdoms acheen but that of acheen is the most powerful it once had a strong and numerous fleet with which it contested the superiority of the sea with the adjacent princes acheen was the great emporium of the island and the resort of the arabs for the gold camphor benzoin pepper and all the commercial productions of the country the government is entirely feudal being founded on the malayan plan as to the genuine sumatrans they are called orang ooloo or countrymen from their residence in villages the sultan of the empire of menangecabow empire of menangecabow for a long time reigned lord paramount over all the other princes who owned their authority to be derived from him at present his real power is not superior to that of a common rajah yet still a superstitious regard is paid to his person he is sovereign pontiff the opinion of his sanctity is supported by the mohammedan priests and an air of mystery surrounds his court he issues out dictatorial edicts which are received with respect but attended to no farther than is consistent with the interests or pleasure of them to whom they are addressed all the sumatrans are originally derived from the malayes or inhabitants of the peninsula of malacca when spoken of in this island the word malaye implies the mahometans who chiefly inhabit the coasts mahometanism is the religion of all the malaye governments all observe the feudal system feudal custom and commute the punishment of crimes for money which have their price as customary among the germans and britons murder as well as other crimes having its price this custom is a dreadful encouragement particularly since the daltoos or magistrates receive the ransom our factory was desirous of putting a stop to the frequent assassinations but was told by the daltoo that he should be a loser as he got twenty dollars a head when the families prosecuted some of these governments are very ancient being formed soon after the first population of the island menangecabow is one which received the mohammedan faith in later times from the malayes of malacca who had made a conquest of their antecedent brethren  in p    of the preceding volume i have given the general description of the persons of the malayes i cannot help thinking that those of malacca were a distinct people who drove the ancient inhabitants of the peninsula to take refuge in sumatra where they retain their language and alphabet and that the malayes in future times reconquered the descendants of these refugees and each still retain their peculiar language and writing  i shall not attempt to give an account of the various nations into which this island is divided natives of the battas that of the battas is too remarkable to be overlooked they are of smaller stature than the rest of the sumatrans and their complexions fairer their religion is paganism yet from very ancient custom they hold in respect the sultan of

undertake a journey into the interior parts of the country i refer my reader for the particular account to the lxviiith volume of the philosophical transactions from this expedition is verified the circumstance of the natives being anthropophagi and eat the flesh of prisoners of war or of offenders condemned for capital crimes as soon as the man is put to death they rush on the body cut pieces

marco polo bergeron p     tells us that in the kingdom of dragoiam they eat the bodies of their relations and best friends who chance to die thinking it a peculiar respect to the deceased they then

together and the seam filled with pitch their houses were circular supported on stakes of ironwood they had no sort of fowl cattle or rice they lived on cocoa nuts sugar canes and sweet potatoes or fish dried in the smoke the fish they caught with their lances or in nets very neatly manufactured by themselves their behavior was hospitable nor did they give any sort of umbrage till some imprudent

of the western and southern side of sumatra surf such as vexes the western coasts of africa it begins says mr marsden sumatra p     to assume its form at some distance from the place where it breaks gradually accumulating as it moves forward till it gains a height in common of fifteen to twenty feet when it overhangs at top and falls like a cascade nearly perpendicular involving itself as it descends the noise made by the fall is prodigious and during the stillness of the night may be heard many miles up the country it forms sometimes but a single range along the shore at other times there is a succession of two three four or more behind each other extending perhaps half a mile out to sea the number of ranges is generally in proportion to the height and violence of the surf  java

of batavia batavia seated in a swamp as like as possible to their boasted capital amsterdam but here overhung with pestilential vapors that would soon by their fatal effects depopulate the native

describe the fatal effects of the injudicious selection of situation of this proud capital on some of the british subjects who unfortunately put in here during the sickly season at batavia a boat belonging to the medway which attended on shore every night was three times successively manned not one having survived that service they were all taken ill in the night when on shore or when returning on board so that the officers were at length obliged to employ none but the natives of the country on that business  on the arrival of the europeans in this country jacatra a town then called calappa and about the year   0  changed to that of jacatra stood on the site of batavia the regulus of the place had made an alliance with the english which gave great umbrage to the dutch who had likewise their settlements here under the protection of a fort or two the rivals came to action for a time we had the superiority and in the year      after a successful battle at sea compelled the dutch commodore koen to retreat to amboina but he soon returned in such force as to oblige the english by capitulation totally to evacuate the place this was not a national war but carried on entirely between the two companies  koen utterly destroyed the town of jacatra founded in    0 and built in its place the present batavia on a far more extensive scale the anniversary is observed in honor of the founder to this day the streets are regular each has its canal which in the dry season emit a most horrid stench from the filth flung into them and the closeness of the trees planted on the banks prevent the due circulation no place could possibly be selected more unwholesome so that what purchase relates of bantam may well be applied to this city sickly climate that it is not a place to recover men that are sick but to kill men who come there in health the jacatra and other rivers which creep through the city almost stagnate a dead buffalo or hog flung into them is perhaps many days in reaching the sea these streams pass through a fenny plain rising from the blauenberg or blue mountains about forty miles distant for the benefit of a quick and easy conveyance of such as

the dutch support him with a splendour equal to that of most crowned heads nor does he go out without his guards magnificently dressed this is to instill respect into the natives the town is prodigiously populous but neither the public or the private buildings are particularly fine they possibly are in the same state as they were in the time of mr nieuhoff who in his travels churchills

have had in the year      two thousand four hundred houses in the city and suburbs some of which were the best in batavia many of them were levelled to the ground in the infamous massacre of this nation in the year    0 it began on occasion of the celebration of a festival in honor of their idol the jootsje de batavia a hideous likeness of the devil the dutch only worshipped him in private the enthusiasm of the devotees created disorder they grew riotous and a guard sent to restrain their zeal executed its commission with great vigor which excited the rage of the chinese so that much blood was shed the governor and council under pretense of public security ordered every chinese to be put to the sword women and children excepted reduced to despair they set fire to their own houses numbers perished in the flames and those who rushed out were put to death by the soldiery above twelve thousand perished in this horrible affair the dutch published their account which is left to the judgment of the reader to believe or disbelieve they would make the cause to have been a regular conspiracy yet the governor two of the counselors of the indies and the attorney general were deposed and imprisoned the dutch certainly thought them guilty the wealth of the chinese seems to have been the inducement to the bloody business the governors effects which he was endeavoring to carry to europe amounted to half a million sterling so little were the dutch apprehensive of any harm from a new colonization of the chinese that they permitted any number which pleased to settle again in batavia and multitudes resorted there as if nothing had happened the governor thought proper to send an apology to the emperor of china which he received with unconcern considering that his empire was overcharged with inhabitants and indifferent to subjects who had deserted the tombs of their ancestors  the chinese seem to have been on the best footing with the dutch in      they gave a proof of

and his own ruin to be certain collected all his treasures and with his young son wives concubines and a few select friends fled to borneo in hopes of an asylum he was closely pursued but by putting into creeks and inlets for a short time escaped the unhappy fugitives set sail in the night and retreated into their hiding places in the day at length to their great joy they saw a ship with english colors they flung themselves on the protection of the commander who received the prince and his treasure the dutch guarda costa came up with him as he knew force could not prevale he by treachery

contests rendered dependent on the dutch who having deposed the usurping sovereign placed the rightful heir on the throne but they chose for him his place of residence secured his allegiance by a citadel and supplying him with every convenience for his pleasures rendered this weak prince entirely subservient to their will in this part of the island is plenty of teek and timber for the building of ships or for exportation to other parts of india here they have their docks besides they carry on great commerce in rice salt pepper and many other valuable productions  java wants its marsden but with such lights as i can procure i shall attempt a brief description of this important island marco polo is very concise in his account of it which he names simply java bergeron p   0  in his days there was only one monarch it was greatly frequented by merchants for the sake of the pepper and other spices he mentions nutmegs which probably have been since extirpated by the political dutch james bontius bontius a physician of great eminence who flourished here very soon after the foundation of batavia by koen has furnished very good materials for the medical and natural history of the island it is from a variety of authors i must select accounts relative to other subjects  java extends from west point in lat      south extent of java long        from paris to east point in lat      long     near seven hundred miles in length the course is west and east with an inclination to the south the greatest breadth is about forty leagues and nearly of equal diameter except where the bays make some small contractions  the land on the coasts varies at the western and eastern extremities it is high but i believe in general the shores are low swampy and unhealthy a lofty chain of mountains runs from west to east through the middle with numbers of branches issuing from each side to uncertain distances from the sea some of the mountains are very lofty and the air cool and salubrious among them are very active volcanoes volcanoes the mountain of parang is the principal and said to be very productive of gold the dutch spent near a million in attempting the discovery but were disappointed in their search these mountains produce besides rubies and sapphires earthquakes are frequent and dreadful  i am not qualified to give any account of the natives of these appennines of java natives the general description is that their faces are flat their cheeks broad their hair short and black their eyebrows large their eyes very small they boast that they are descended from the chinese if true we may account for the probability of that nation migrating to this island they may have been from the beginning in the constant habit of frequenting the coasts the manners of the mountaneers are said to be fierce and barbarous and their rites idolatrous the inhabitants of the cities and coasts are mahometans representations of the persons of the javanese in different characters are given by

reported of its dire effects and illustrate the relation with certain melancholy proofs after which will be given the more than apocryphal tales of the manner of procuring that infernal juice  the tree strange account of so long famed in many of the east india islands for the wonderful and almost incredible effects of its poisonous juice has hitherto eluded the prying eye of the naturalist and consequently its class in the botanical system has never yet been ascertained notwithstanding the indefatigable researches of europeans to obtain full information upon so interesting a subject all we know for certain of the tree itself is the figure of its leaf and fruit which the learned and accurate rumphius has exhibited in the herbarium amboinense after much entreaty and persevering application to the dutch governors of celebes the most noted of all the islands of the east indies for the production of this tree rumphius was favored by de cops governor of macassar with a branch of it and a specimen of its poisonous juice an ensign of the army was deputed in form to be the messenger of so rare a present of such a penetrating and malignant nature was this found to be that the very touching with the hand the bamboo in which it was enclosed occasioned a tingling and numbness like that felt in a limb that had been exposed to intense cold and suddenly brought to the fire  nature has wisely ordained that this baneful tree should be extremely rare and its situation the most sequestered from the busy haunts of men amidst mountains of difficult access and inhabited by the most barbarous tribes they alone are acquainted with the effects that this subtle poison has upon the circumambient air and such animals as approach its tremendous shade the atmosphere is here said to be so infected by the deleterious quality of the effluvia of this pestilential tree that birds which accidentally perch upon its boughs are seized with torpor and drop down dead no man dares approach it without his hands feet and head being well shrouded with linen cloths were this precaution neglected he would become benumbed and presently lose the use of his limbs the dripping of rain water from the tree upon the body causes it to swell and should it fall upon the bare head the loss of all the hair would ensue no other tree can exist in its vicinity and the earth beneath it is parched and withered so that death seems eminently to have fixed his station here  it is no wonder that the love of the mavelous natural to mankind has added somewhat to the truly astonishing scenes that the environs of this tree exhibit hence the rude nations of this mountanous tract have made it the habitation of a serpent whose eyes glare like fire in the night and remind us of the fabled gardens of the hesperides in classic lore whose stationary sentinel was a watchful dragon  the dutch call this tree macasserne giftboom or spattenboom and in the malaye language it is termed cajuupas that is to say poisontree and the fruit simply upas by the people of macassar and throughout celebes both the tree and its poison are called ipo  the darts to which the natives apply this poison are a foot or eighteen inches in length very slender made of reed or light wood and armed with the tooth of the lamia shark smeared with poison these are fixed in a tube five or six feet long and blown by the breath of the assailant with great force to the distance of pistol shot upon reaching the destined object the barbed tooth adheres and the wood only can be extracted or sometimes detaches itself and falls to the ground the effect of the poison is to produce a sensation of heat in all parts of the body and oppressive vertigo in the head which is presently succeeded by a total debility and death within the space of half an hour is the certain consequence nay so rapid are its effects in some instances as to prove fatal in less than a quarter of an hour and farther so instantaneously does its virus pervade the whole human frame that by experiments made upon malefactors it has been proved that if the thumb or the foot only be wounded by the poisonous dart and amputation immediately performed upon the affected member astonishing to relate death infallibly ensues  after a long intercourse and many bloody contests with the natives of celebes which may be styled the colchos of india being an island noted for many other sorts of poison the dutch acquired the knowledge of some specifics among the indigenous plants which disarmed this tremendous weapon of much of its terrors here are said to be two species of the ipo distinguished by the names of male and female and that the poison of the latter is much less efficacious than that of the former and used chiefly for the destruction of game the juice is extracted from the tree by piercing the bark of the trunk and inserting therein long bamboos sharpened at the point four or five of these are fixed to one tree and remain three or four days that the sap may leisurely distill into them and when filled they are removed for use  mr n p foersch a dutch surgeon stationed at batavia in      gives the following account of the situation of the tree and the manner of collecting the poison the reader is left to form a judgment of the writers authority and how far his credulity is to be censured it is says he seated about twentyseven leagues from soura the seat of the emperor encircled by high hills and mountains and the country around to the distance of ten or twelve miles has neither tree nor shrub or even the least plant or grass i have made the tour all around this dangerous spot at about eighteen miles distant from the center and i found the aspect of the country on all sides equally dreary the easiest ascent of the hills is from that part where the old ecclesiastic dwells i had procured a recommendation from an old malayan priest to another priest who lives on the nearest inhabitable spot to the tree which is about fifteen or sixteen miles distant the letter proved of great service to me in my undertaking as that priest is appointed by the emperor to reside there to prepare for eternity the souls of those who for different crimes are sentenced to approach the tree and to procure the poison from his house the criminals are sent for the poison into which the points of all warlike instruments are dipped it is of high value and produces a considerable revenue to the emperor  the poison which is procured from this tree is a gum that issues out between the bark and the tree itself like the camphor malefactors who for their crimes are sentenced to die are the only persons who fetch the poison and this is the only chance they have of saving their lives after sentence is pronounced upon them by the judge they are asked in court whether they will die by the hands of the executioner or whether they will go to the upas tree for a box of poison they commonly prefer the latter proposal as there is not only some chance of preserving their lives but also a certainty in case of their safe return that a provision will be made for them in future by the emperor they are also permitted to ask a favor from the emperor which is generally of a trifling nature and commonly granted they are then provided with a silver or tortoiseshell box in which they are to put the poisonous gum and are properly instructed how to proceed while they are upon their dangerous expedition among other particulars they are always told to attend to the direction of the winds as they are to go toward the tree before the wind so that the effluvia from the tree are always blown from them they are told likewise to travel with the utmost dispatch as that is the only method of insuring a safe return they are afterward sent to the house of the old priest to which place they are commonly attended by their friends and relations here they generally remain some days in expectation of a favorable breeze during that time the ecclesiastic prepares them for their future fate by prayers and admonitions  when the hour of their departure arrives the priest puts them on a long leather cap with two glasses before their eyes which comes down as far as their breast and also provides them with a pair of leather gloves they are then conducted by the priest and their friends and relations about two miles on their journey here the priest repeats his instructions and tells them where they are to look for the tree he shows them a hill which they are told to ascend and that on the other side they will find a rivulet which they are to follow and which will conduct them directly to the upas they now take leave of each other and amidst prayers for their success the delinquents hasten away  the worthy old ecclesiastic has assured me that during his residence there for upwards of thirty years he had dismissed above seven hundred criminals in the manner which i have described and that scarcely two out of twenty have returned he showed me a catalogue of all the unhappy sufferers with the date of their departure from his house annexed and a list of the offenses for which they had been condemned to which was added a list of those who had returned in safety i afterward saw another list of these culprits at the jailkeepers at soura charta and found that they perfectly corresponded with each other and with the different informations which i afterward obtained  i was present at some of these melancholy ceremonies and desired different delinquents to bring with them some pieces of the wood or a small branch or some leaves of this wonderful tree i have also given them silk cords desiring them to measure its thickness i never could procure more than two dry leaves that were picked up by one of them on his return and all i could learn from him concerning the tree itself was that it stood on the border of a rivulet as described by the old priest that it was of a middling size that five or six young trees of the same kind stood close by it but that no other shrub or plant could be seen near it and that the ground was of a brownish sand full of stones almost impracticable for traveling and covered with dead bodies after many conversations with the old malayan priest i questioned him about the first discovery and asked his opinion of this dangerous tree upon which he gave me the following answer  we are told in our new alcoran that above an hundred years ago the country around the tree was inhabited by a people strongly addicted to the sins of sodom and gomorrha when the great prophet mahomet determined not to suffer them to lead such detestable lives any longer he applied to god to punish them upon which god caused this tree to grow out of the earth which destroyed them all and rendered the country for ever uninhabitable  such was the malayan opinion i shall not attempt a comment but must observe that all the malayans considered this tree as an holy instrument of the great prophet to punish the sins of mankind and therefore to die of the poison of the upas is generally considered among them as an honorable death for that reason i also observed that the delinquents who were going to the tree were generally dressed in their best apparel  this however is certain though it may appear incredible that from fifteen to eighteen miles round this tree not only no human creature can exist but that in that space of ground no living animal of any kind has ever been discovered i have also been assured by several persons of veracity that there are no fish in the waters nor has any rat mouse or any other vermin been seen there and when any birds fly so near this tree that the effluvia reaches them they fall a sacrifice to the effects of the poison this circumstance has been ascertained by different delinquents who in their return have seen the birds drop down and have picked them up dead and brought them to the old ecclesiastic  mr foersch gives us an account of the fatal effects in the following melancholy narration in the year      in the month of february i was present at the execution of thirteen of the emperors concubines at soura charta who were convicted of infidelity to the emperors bed it was in the forenoon about eleven oclock when the fair criminals were led into an open space within the walls of the emperors palace there the judge passed sentence upon them by which they are doomed to suffer death by a lancet poisoned with upas after this the alcoran was presented to them and they were according to the law of their great prophet mahomet to acknowledge and to affirm by oath that the charges brought against them together with the sentence and their punishment were fair and equitable this they did by laying their right hand upon the alcoran their left hands upon their breasts and their eyes lifted toward heaven the judge then held the alcoran to their lips and they kissed it  these ceremonies over the executioner proceeded on his business in the following manner  thirteen posts each about five feet high had been previously erected to these the delinquents were fastened and their breasts stripped naked in this situation they remained a short time in continual prayers attended by several priests until a signal was given by the judge to the executioner on which the latter produced an instrument much like the spring lancet used by farriers for bleeding horses with this instrument it being poisoned with the gum of the upas the unhappy wretches were lanced in the middle of their breasts and the operation was performed upon them all in less than two minutes  my astonishment was raised to the highest degree when i beheld the sudden effects of that poison for in about five minutes after they were lanced they were taken with a tremor attended with a subsultus tendinum after which they died in the greatest agonies crying out to god and mahomet for mercy in sixteen minutes by my watch which i held in my hand all the criminals were no more some hours after their death i observed their bodies full of livid spots much like those of the petechioe their faces swelled their color changed to a kind of blue their eyes looked yellow etc etc though the recent information obtained in the course of lord macartneys embassy to china vol i p     totally invalidates the authority of foersch yet it appears evident that trees of a most deleterious nature and productive of the most active poisons really exist in java such also was the opinion of the author of this work whose depth of judgment placed him far remote from the imputation of credulity i have therefore ventured as in other instances to publish a faithful copy of the original manuscript e   this tree did not escape the notice of our great sir john mandeville he makes the poison produced from it to be taken inwardly i shall give his words and also the horrible opinion held at that time against the hebraean race whom he accuses of a design of poisoning all christendom with this infernal juice after speaking of the trees of beneficent use he says travels p      and there ben other trees that beryn venym azenst the which there is no medicyne but on and that is to taken here propre leves and stamp hem and tempere hem with watre and than drink it and elle he schalle dye for triacle will not avaylle ne

mighty god they fayleden of hire purpos but all weys they maken great mortallitee of people  in respect to the other trees and plants of java i can only say that they agree with those of sumatra and other islands of the great archipelago most will be found in my flora indica let me only remark that the earliest dutch navigators have given tolerable descriptions of several in the often cited old book published by nicholas from p    to p    accompanied with plates as expressive as could be cut on wood  the vast island of borneo is divided from the northern coast of java by a sound between two and three hundred leagues in breadth borneo according to m danvilles scale the island is in length from south to north near three hundred leagues and its greatest breadth two hundred the circumference is estimated at two thousand miles so that it may justly be considered as the greatest island in the world it is of a pyriform shape its shores rude with projecting promontories and is divided by the equator into two unequal portions the far greater part of borneo next to the sea especially the northern consists of swamps covered with forests of trees of numberless species and great sizes which penetrate for scores of miles toward the center of the island these unstable muddy flats are divided by rivers which branch into multitudes of canals and are the only roads into the interior parts lofty mountains are said to rise in the middle of the island many are volcanic and often occasion tremendous earthquakes  this great island is little known except merely on the coasts and even those remain yet so imperfectly explored that less can be said of it than of many smaller tracts so unstable are the swampy outskirts that in the attempts to establish factories the europeans have been obliged to build them on piles driven into the ground or after the manner of the country to erect in the rivers their houses on posts fixed to floats formed of bodies of great trees and those moored by rattans to those growing on shore to prevent their being carried away by the floods in such a manner are many of the towns of borneo constructed they rise and fall with the tide which here flows but once in the twentyfour hours and that only in the day at spring tide these towns on the banjar river experience the rise and fall of twelve feet  the whole coasts are in the hands of malayans moors inhabitants macassars and even japanese who have perhaps for centuries driven the ancient inhabitants into the interior parts the aborigines are of a black complexion a middle stature with long and black hair and generally better featured than the guinea negroes feeble in their bodies and very indolent and inactive the women small handsome and of a better color than the men their general religion is of a mongrel kind of mahometanism these maintain a feudal government under chieftains miscalled by our sailors kings the seat of the principal is at tatas near to bandar masseen some miles up the country on the northern side and seated on a great river which for many miles is twice as broad as the thames at gravesend and bounded by trees of most stupendous height it is navigable far beyond bandar masseen for the largest ships and is greatly frequented by the chinese jonks the river is called china for that reason we are not acquainted with the length of its navigation but it rises in the very middle of the island and runs all the way due south on this river we attempted to form a settlement under the mr cunningham we have before mentioned but by some imprudencies gave offense to the inhabitants and the greater part of our people were massacred the same fate has attended other factories of different european nations who have endeavored to form settlements at succadana samba and many other places tatas has its sultan these sovereigns command the trade of the island and furnish the european ships who happen to arrive with cargoes of pepper the staple of the country that article is brought down from the interior parts and sold to the europeans or to the commercial asiatic nations  it is to captain daniel beeckman that we owe the best account of borneo he visited it in the beginning of this century and published his account in the year      at p    he gives the following list of the productions of the country productions of which abounds with pepper the best dragons blood bezoar most excellent camphor pine apples citrons oranges lemons water melons musk melons plantains banana coco nuts and all sorts of fruit that are generally found in any part of the east indies the mountains yield diamonds gold tin and iron the forests honey cotton deer goats buffaloes wild oxen wild hogs small horses bears tigers elephants and a multitude of monkies  the pepper grows far up the country pepper and is collected by the very poorest people only they have all the different sorts black white and long  sanguis draconis sanguis draconis or dragons blood is a gum the exudation of certain trees of a bloody color there is a conjecture that this is the cinnaberis of dioscorides lib v c    pliny lib xxxiii c   says that the name is indian and then fables that it is the sanies of the dragon oppressed by the weight of an elephant expiring with the bite and that the cinnaberis is the mixed blood of each animal the ancients procured under this notion the real drug and used it in medicine it was often adulterated with the blood of goats the genuine kind was sold at a great rate  the trees or shrubs which we know to produce this medicine in our dispensatory are the dracaena draco of which vandelli has given a good figure in his monograph on the subject according to kaempfer amoen exot     another of the vegetables it is extracted from is a palmapinus rottani dsierenang one of the rotangs described by rumphius under the name of palmijuncus draco v p     tab    fig   this grows in the thick and almost impervious forests of java  another kind is the produce of the santalum rubrum sandal wood or red sanders and again from the dracoena terminalis of linnaeus rumph iv p    tab    called in ternate ngassi or hassi this species grows in borneo and bears a fruit says beeckman as red as a cherry the juice the best in the world is extracted from the tree and the color tried by rubbing it on paper the natives bring it in drops wrapped in leaves but are so apt to adulterate it that we do not choose to purchase without previous examination  another kind is procured from the gladiolus odoratus indicus rumph v p     tab    for further accounts i must refer to that pliny of the indies in the places cited to vol ii p     and to kaempfer     to     the drug from whatsoever tree or plant it be gotten maintains its place in our dispensatory  at times a considerable quantity of gold has been brought here gold which is found in the mines in the interior parts of the country some is melted into bars and usually adulterated by a cover of base metal the natives have a very just notion of the lord of the irritamenta malorum for they say that the devil is sole master of the gold and diamond mines  diamonds form another article of commerce diamonds but they are far less valuable than those of golconda  beeswax beeswax in cakes of about thirtyfour pounds is common at sambas which being the common money of that part of the island was wont to be bartered with the chinese for various necessaries pearls of considerable beauty are said to be another article of exchange in the same country  the bezoar found in the monkies has a most superstitious value bezoar and is sold for four or five times its weight in silver  the unrefined camphor of borneo camphor is reckoned superior to any in the world we are not acquainted with the tree which produces that valuable drug  the edible swallows nests are found in vast abundance edible nests and the bambu walking canes form two other articles of trade  in the list of quadrupeds is the ourang outang ourang outang there appears to be two species one that never exceeds two feet and an half in height see mr vosmaers account p    tab xiv xv and hist quad i p   0 tab    which i have taken the liberty of copying from m vosmaer mr beeckman speaks of some species growing to the height of six feet he bought a young one which was stronger than any man in his ship but it died before it was a year old borneo has abundance of these animals it swarms also with variety of baboons and monkies so this celebes and another island may probably have been the insulae satyrorum of ptolemy  the ourang outang is found also in java hamilton account of the east indies ii p     saw one in that island which was four feet high and mentions a smaller species called oumpaes he confirms the account of the grave or melancholy habit of the greater species of its lighting a fire and blowing it with its mouth and of its broiling a fish to eat with its boiled rice imitative of the custom of the human race  the aborigines of borneo are called byajos byajos they inhabit the interior parts live under chieftains and are an independent people possessing their proper language and religion the last is called paganism yet they pay no respect to idols but offer sacrifices of sweet scented wood to one supreme beneficent deity who in other worlds rewards the just and punishes the wicked they marry only one wife are strictly faithful to their nuptial vows and have the character of general honesty mr beeckman makes a different report but fairly confesses that he received it from the banjareens who will not suffer the europeans to have any intercourse with the natives and tell many frightful tales of their barbarity the byajos often come down the river to the port of masseen in ill shaped praws with gold dust diamonds rattans bezoar and other articles of commerce of which the banjareens are sole factors and consequently highly interested in keeping the pretended savages from our knowledge  the byajos are taller and stronger than the other inhabitants they go naked excepting a small wrapper about their loins they stain their bodies with blue and by weights affixed to their ears when young stretch them till they fall on their shoulders the chieftains pull out their fore teeth and substitute others of gold and by way of ornament fling strings of tigers teeth round their necks and bodies their arms are lances and poisoned arrows some of them lead a piratical life in the great rivers and are most formidable enemies  let me here observe that tigers tigers those cruel animals swarm in this island beyond which they happily cease nor are they known in any of the islands to the north or to the east of borneo  after navigating along the northern coast of the island we arrive sambaar point in lat      on the point of sambaar between this and the isle of billetou to the west is a channel of a hundred and fifty miles in breadth near to the west of that island is the small isle of salt island of salt and banca and then the isle of banca all belonging to java  from sambaar point the coast turns toward the north in lat succadana and sambas 0    south is succadana and in lat   north is sambas both at times frequented for the sake of commerce from tanjong point the island trends to the northeast the city of borneo stands in about lat city of borneo      north on a large river in the bottom of a bay  when the famous navigator von noort was there in   0  it consisted of three thousand houses all built on posts and floating planks in the manner we have described so that whenever the sultan chose to change his position he would move with all his city to another part of the river von noort found this port much frequented by the chinese who to this day seem to be the greatest and most constant traders to borneo of all the asiatic nations  from lat   north to tangio sampanmangco the most northern promontory of borneo in lat   the coast changes its nature being skirted all the way with a lofty chain of mountains and within are appearances of others of very uncertain extent that northern headland has another correspondent called inorantang facing likewise the north between both is the deep bay of malbordoo penetrating far to the south opposite to the last headland is the small island of banguey island of banguey lofty and mountanous as if rent from it by some violent convulsions  a little to the west of that island in lat    0 island of balambangam is the isle balambangan composed of sand and swamps and famous for the intention of the east india company in      to form on it a vast emporium of the commodities of china and of all this great eastern archipelago we got the cession of this little spot then uninhabited from the king of soolo we took possession of it at a vast expense according to raynal hist vol ii p     it cost us l   000 a company of european troops and a number of seapoys were detained for the protection of the settlement and a colony of malayes from bencoolen and another of chinese were induced to establish themselves there we could not have fixed on a more unwholesome situation the diseases of the climate attacked both the military and the colonists and very few survived the sickly season so that scarcely one in ten outlived the monsoon the abbe raynal asserts that we were attacked and the factory destroyed and insinuates it to have been done by the instigation of the dutch or spaniards jealous of their commercial interests in that neighborhood  at a small distance to the north manilla ians about lat   begins the vast group of the philippine islands these are much more probably the maniolae of ptolemy than the lesser andaman which danville supposes it to have been these islands were known to the ancients by the indian name which is still retained in manilla ptolemy speaks of them as ten islands immediately beyond the tres insulae satyrorum or borneo etc they were first discovered by the great magellan who came in sight of them on april   th      and named them the archipelago of st lazarus he landed on one of them called mactan near to zebu where acording to pigafetta a companion and eye witness he with eight or nine of his men was slain in an encounter with the natives  the discovery of these islands was completed in      when discovered by a spaniard of the name of ruy lopez de villalobos who named them the philippine in honor of philip prince of spain afterward philip ii we choose to retain the ancient name the manillas  the first settlement made by the spaniards in these islands was not till the year      when michael lopez de lagaspi built a town in the isle of zebu zebu he secured it by a small garrison and then proceeded to the conquest of other islands more worthy of his arms he sailed into a fine bay in the island of manilla or luconia island of luconia and was in      the founder of the city of manilla so celebrated for its opulence and for being the common repository and place of exchange of the productions of both the indies one may also say those of the old and the new world of europe of india and of china and in return it receives the silver of potosi the indolence of the spaniards will not suffer these islands to produce any one article of commerce gold a little gold excepted brought down the sloods into the channels of the rivers the group certainly contains rich mines of the precious metal but as wealth flows in such abundance with very little trouble to the colonists they will not be at the pains of exploring the veins luconia also produces abundance of excellent iron and copper  the fruitfulness of soil is a perpetual reproach to the slothfulness of its lords a very few exceptions are to be found one friend to the island introduced the coco tree theobroma cacao catesby suppl tab   which is cultivated with such success as to become almost the support of the inhabitants by giving them the favorite food of the spaniards chocolate indigo indico which grows spontaneously owes of late years its use in their manufactories to the sagacity of an individual it was not till the year      that the sluggish spaniards ever knew the culture of european grains or esculents as to the native productions it possesses every tree or fruit common to the torrid zone and numbers probably peculiar to itself few only of which are brought to view and that by the industry of a sonnerat  the unwise expulsion of the jesuits will long retard possibly for ever prevent the improvement of the manilla islands the domains of that intelligent order were covered with cattle innumerable their meadows stretched numbers of miles watered and fertilized by the rivers of the country  manilla city of manilla by being the mere repository of the goods of other nations grew into a most flourishing city the streets regular the churches and public buildings superb a splendid luxury pervades every part in the appearance of dress and equipage and inside of the houses of the proud and lazy colonists  the port of manilla is at cavite three leagues distant and is subject to many inconveniences being greatly infested with the worm the teredo navalis which in a little time would render the galleons and the vessels which trade to manilla incapable of keeping the sea neither is it secure from the north and northwest winds besides ships lying there are obliged to send far for water and to employ for that purpose the flat boats of the country  the city of manilla is fortified well built and the streets very regular but the third part is occupied by convents the number of christians is computed at about twelve thousand gomez peers de las marignas surrounded it with walls in    0  it is from hence the great commerce between manilla and acapulco acapulco shits on the coast of mexico is carried on in one and sometimes in two ships sent annually fitted out at the expense of the king but freighted by the merchants they are of an enormous size heavy and unwieldy as big as a first rate man of war and having a complement of twelve hundred men the lesser is above twelve hundred tons burden has from three hundred and fifty to six hundred hands passengers included and carries fifty guns but often mounts only thirtysix it leaves manilla the middle of july but does not reach acapulco till the middle of january one miracle of this voyage is that notwithstanding they put on board all the water they can stow consistent with the full cargo they depend for a supply from the heavens between lat  0 and  0 and hazard the most dreadful of deaths should their expectations be disappointed when they arrive in these latitudes they prepare their mats which they spread to direct the deluge of rain into various vessels and wonderful to say there is not an instance in which their hopes have failed  manilla is the great magazine of all the goods of india china and europe which are laid up here annually to be conveyed across the pacific ocean to supply the wants or luxuries of the new world there are as the editor of lord ansons voyage informs us at p     spices all sorts of chinese silks and manufactures particularly silk stockings of which i have heard that no less than fifty thousand pair were the usual number shipped on board the annual ship vast quantities of indian stuffs as callicoes and chintz which are much worn in america together with minuter articles as goldsmiths work etc which is principally done at the city of manilla itself by the chinese for it is said there are at least twenty thousand chinese who constantly reside there either as servants manufacturers or brokers all these different commodities are collected at manilla thence to be transported annually in one or more ships to the port of acapuico in the kingdom of mexico  the return from the new world is only in silver either in specie or virgin metal the author of lord ansons voyage confesses to only         pieces of eight and       ounces of virgin silver or l 00000 of our money having been sound in the manilla ship out of which the family have realized their vastestate even when the ship arrives safe the treasure is of little advantage to the spaniards it is instantly dispersed over half the world to pay for the merchandise of its outward voyage  the city of manilla was besieged and taken by the english in      manilla       our little squadron under vice admiral cornish appeared before it on september   d our land forces were under colonel draper after a short resistance the city was taken by storm with as little slaughter as the nature of circumstances would admit the island of luconia and every island dependent on it surrendered to our arms a large sum was accepted to save the place from plunder hostages given for the payment and bills drawn by the archbishop or viceroy which in part were never accepted and our soldiers and seamen deprived of the reward due to their valor  this archipelago consists of about twelve or thirteen greater islands with small ones innumerable divided from each other by narrow channels of very difficult navigation all of them mountanous and many of them volcanic manilla the largest and most northern is a hundred and fifteen french leagues in length not reckoning the peninsula of camarines which juts irregularly from the main body and extends far to the south raynal represents all the islands as terribly majestic they are covered with basaltes with lava with scoriae with black glass with melted iron with gray and friable stones filled with the wrecks of the animal and vegetable kingdoms with sulphur kept in a state of fusion by the continual action of subterraneous fires and with burning waters which communicate with hidden flames all these great accidents of nature are the effect of extinguished volcanoes of some that are still burning and of others that are forming in these deep cavities where combustible materials are perpetually in agitation  earthquakes are frequent and sometimes tremendous earthquakes mr pie in the philosophical transactions vol xlix p      gives an account of one of uncommon horror in    0 which lasted for three months with almost continual tremblings and at last broke out in an eruption from a small island in the middle of a lake round which the bottom is unfathomable the third day after the commencement of the eruption there arose four more small islands all burning and about a mile distance from one there is a continual fire which issues from the water where there is no ground for upwards of an hundred fathoms deep  it is generally supposed that before the arrival of the europeans the chinese had possessed themselves of the sea coasts of these islands the japanese also boast of having been once lords of the philippines and the vicinity to both those empires may make it probable  the chinese were so numerous in manilla about the year   00 chinese  as to excite in the spaniards the greatest fear of the danger arising from any plots they might enter into against the colonists the spaniards assisted by the japanese and other foreigners took the usual method of preventing them by putting no less than twentyfive thousand to the sword the massacre of these people was far greater than that of batavia the spaniards assert that the chinese had actually begun to revolt and had murdered several of the europeans the chinese charge the horrible transaction on the europeans and say it was excited by their avarice in order to make themselves masters of the rich effects of their countrymen the emperor sent an ambassador to demand satisfaction and spoke in high terms of the revenge he would take all ended by a pacification the chinese fleets resorted to manilla in as great a number as ever and the suburbs were soon repeopled with inhabitants the wealth that we are told the chinese brought into the islands was unspeakable the jesuits were expelled the country in      and in the year following by the bigotry of the governor every one of the chinese were banished from the philippine islands since which trade and the arts have declined and depopulation and distress promise to be the consequences of so imprudent a measure  in the mountanous parts of the islands are remnants of the original inhabitants natives a most singular race of men who through an excessive love of liberty have relapsed into a state of nature those who inhabit the foot of a mountain are mortal enemies to those that reside at the top and both are equally hated by those who live in the middle happy picture of enthusiastic independency they are seen wandering singly amidst the woods armed with bows and arrows naked excepting the skin of a goat flung over their shoulders they lodge in hollow trees or hollows of the rocks have no notion of society and like the primaeval inhabitants of the world venerem incertam rapientes more serarum  these men are strongly made curled headed indians of haggard countenances black with curled hair like the negroes and called by the spaniards negrillos they certainly are of the same race as the papuans or people of new guinea who might originally have spread themselves over this tract these curled headed tribes are found in most of the other islands navarette mentions other black indians the men paint themselves with white the women with other colors these and other indian people often descend on the spanish settlements and commit horrible murders some of them like the ancient scythians make drinking cups of the sculls of their enemies  there are other indians that profess a sort of dependency on the spaniards and have an alcayde among them yet their manners are barbarous they are brave but ferocious and appear to have been descended from the malayans settled here in very early times they are called tagalese and the negrillos pretend that they had been originally their slaves their arms are bows and arrows they took part with the spaniards during the siege of the capital and ignorant of the laws of nations slew in the most savage manner our admirals secretary carrying a flag of truce and even the nephew of the spanish governor who attempted to rescue him from their fury the strength of their arms was satally experienced by that gallant officer major more who fell transfixed by an arrow in leading our troops to the storm  i shall now mention a few particulars respecting the natural history of the manillas natural history it is not to be wondered that in one so abundant in volcanoes there should be found springs of hot water the most noted is that which appears two leagues from calamba the stream which runs from it is of a boiling heat and raised the liquor in m de reaumurs thermometer to the height of    degrees even at the distance of a league from the source m sonnerat observed five shrubs the roots of which were drenched by the stream and the top enveloped in the vapor yet grew with vigor at the same time the swallows which happened to skim the brook at the height of seven or eight feet from the surface fell down motionless  the bashee islands lie midway between manilla and formosa bashee islands the middlemost of them is according to lord anson in lat     north i speak of them here notwithstanding they belong to neither one or the other dampier in the year      being engaged in these seas in a buccaneering expedition wished for a temporary concealment he had seen in certain charts the figure v which denoted their number dampiers voyage i   0  he sailed to the spot and found them to correspond in position and number none of them had names so he bestowed on them those of orange grafton monmouth goat and bashee the last from a sort of beer made of the boiled juice of the sugar cane and some small black berries which was put into jars to settle and was thought by our seamen an excellent liquor capable of giving the pleasure of ebriety without the bad effects the natives sold it to them in plenty for which reason they made it the general name of the islands  monmouth and grafton isles are very lofty singular villages with a numerous succession of precipices one above another on these the natives build their villages which affords the singular prospect of three or four rows of small houses erected on posts and wattled with boughs they have no other way of getting to their habitations but by a ladder which is pulled up after them if they mean to ascend to the upper villages or to secure themselves from an assault these two islands are the most populous as they have more of these precipices bashee island has but one precipice and in consequence only one town orange is lofty yet so plain as to furnish no spot sitted for the site of their villages and is therefore uninhabited  the produce of these islands are a few of the tropical fruits produce pine apples sugar canes plantains bananas calabashes yams and potatoes these are planted in the valleys which are well watered with small streams they are also well wooded but the trees do not grow to any large size their animals are hogs and goats in plenty their poultry sew among the wild fowl parroquets and some other small birds  the natives are short and squat round visaged natives with low foreheads and thick eyebrows short low noses eyes small and hazel but larger than those of the chinese lips and mouth of a middle size hair black thick lank and cut short so as just to cover the ears the description of these people agrees so exactly with that of the japanese given by kaempfer hist of japan i p     that there cannot be any doubt of their origin  their government is quite patriarchal government their religion has no exterior rites but probably is mental as is common with many orientalists there is no appearance of idols on any of their islands they certainly have laws for dampier saw the crime of thest punished in a young man who was buried alive in the presence of a great multitude assembled on the occasion their manners were innoffensive friendly and honest not only among themselves but to the new visitants who possibly were the first europeans they had seen  in general the men went naked excepting the usual wrapper about their loins some had jackets of plantain leaves the rudest says dampier of all clothing the women had a strong thick short petticoat of cotton made of the lesser cotton plant the product of their own isles both sexes wore large earrings of a yellow metal which was found in their mountains it was heavy and gold like the paler gold it faded with time but the natives restored it to its original brightness by smearing it over with a red earth and flinging it into a fire till it was red hot our navigator had no means of proving whether it was gold  to the women was left the care of the plantations boats the men were engaged in fishing they built with much skill their small boats which resembled the deal yawls formed of very narrow planks fastened with pins and nails they had also larger boats which carried forty or fifty men and were rowed by twelve or fourteen oars on a sie it seems as if they went to the island of manilla for their iron which they manufactured at home arms from thence they get their other only import pieces of buffaloes hides with which they make their defensive armor or buff coats their sole offensive weapons are lances headed with iron all this implies the fear of enemies and makes it probable that they are subject to the attacks of the piratical indians  after this digression manillas again let me return to the great group of the manillas the island of mindora lies south of that of manilla and is very lofty and mountanous many of the natives pay tribute to the spaniards sonnerat voyage aux indes ii     says that most voyagers assert that there is a race of men in this island which have tails the same is feigned of certain people in borneo but the fact turns out that they happen to have the os coccygis a little more elongated than is usual in the human species  south of mindora is the cluster of small isles called the calamianes with others still smaller to the east of them calamianes the island of paragua stretches from the calamianes near seventy leagues in length and at the southern end approaches the isles of balambangan off the coast of borneo the spaniards have here some tributary indians part of the island is said to be subject to a sultan in borneo  all these islands form the western boundary of a great gulf great central bay in the midst of the manillas the rest of the manillas and the soolo archipelago are on the north and east sides the end of borneo is on the south a few small isles are scattered over the middle to go on with the farther account of the island manduque masbate and numbers of small isles fill the part next to luconia or manilla samal a large island faces the ocean on their outside to the east its promontory

panaybuglas or isle of negros zebu and leyte panay with the lesser isle of bohol range nearly east and west parallel to each other a little to the south of the preceding the principal settlements of the spaniards are hoho and antigue in the island of panay but off antigue is the sole anchorage and that only in the months of november december and january the inhabitants of this island are infinitely more industrious than those of luconia they have a manufactory of handkerchiefs and a sort of linen composed of cotton and the fibers of a certain plant of the country they clothe themselves with the coarser kinds and dispose of the rest among the neighboring isles this island is most exuberantly fertile and very populous some authors make the numbers of inhabitants to exceed sixteen thousand and assert that there are fourteen parishes belonging to the monks of st augustine three benefices of seculars and formerly a college of jesuits notwithstanding the happy soil of panay the inhabitants are discouraged from taking advantage of that blessing by reason of the neglect of the government which leaves them unprotected against the depredations of the piratical malayes who land plunder and carry away prisoners all those who cannot escape into the woods these pirates are mahometans of borneo mindanao and other islands between the manillas and the moluccas they infest the coasts to a high degree and will carry away people almost from under the walls of the capital and sell them for slaves in borneo and even in batavia they not only seize the smaller fishing vessels but even ships richly laden  the country abounds with deer animals wild hogs buffaloes oxen and horses the two last run at liberty and are common to the whole island  zebu is a small island zebu but remarkable for having been the first which the spaniards colonized it is pretended that there were at the time the europeans arrived three thousand families of warlike indians the spaniards have had wherever they came a happy talent in reducing the redundancy of people  here in      philip erected the town built by logaspi into a city and dignified it with an episcopal foundation an augustine pietro de agurto first filled the sea this island was indulged with sending ships to calao in peru but after the spaniards had made the conquest of luconia and given to its capital the privilege of the manilla ships the trade of zebu declined fast insomuch that its city is now sunk into a village the passage from hence to the new world was far more expeditious than that from manilla having been performed in two months and the return in three and seldom without the discovery of some islands in the vast pacific  we have before said that on matta or mactan mactan or possibly the masbate of modern maps a small adjacent island magellan like his illustrious compeer cook met with a premature death from the hands of savages  the island of mindanao or magindanao isle of mindanao is the last and most southern of the great group many writers separate mindanao from the manilla or philippine islands among others our judicious countryman mr dalrymple though so very near as evidently to form one of that vast archipelago the inhabitants may differ in manners but the productions of all are nearly similar the spaniards have on it some unprofitable settlements the chief is at sambouange in lat      n on the south side of the island they have fortified it with a citadel of stone and bricks and with a wooden fort erected to check the excursion of the corsairs of yolo but in vain they cannot even protect their own subjects who happen to be out of the reach of their cannon  the island extends east and west about ninety leagues extent is triangular and the shores greatly indented by bays the circumference is said to be about eight hundred miles it is very mountanous the valleys consist of a rich soil black fat prodigiously fruitful and finely watered with the purest rills the sides of the mountains rocky yet well clothed with trees of large growth the beauty of scenery in various parts is unspeakable we are obliged to mr forest for giving us some idea of it in his voyage

archipelago productions i shall just distinguish the few that with great uncertainty are thought peculiar to mindanao gold is common to all it has its saltpetre cave from which much of that article is extracted on the roofs are infinite clusters of small bats the dung of which is supposed to be one cause of the salt a brook of a most offensive taste and smell and of a sky blue color issues from the

mandible hanging far over the lower  parrots are very numerous and of various species they enliven the woods with their brilliant colors and deafen people by their cries  the jacana tab    is most

the indian archipelagos  respecting the trees plants shrubs or plants of the manillas i must content myself with giving the few engraven by m sonnerat or described by that most industrious naturalist  the sapotte negro tab    a species of achras is a small tree with a round green fruit containing four kernels in shape of an almond much admired by the indians  the berkias tab    is a shrub bearing a

cacao cocoa tree i imagine that linnaeus must have been a great admirer of chocolate as he names the tree which produces it theobroma or the food of the gods this tree is a native of the antilles and hotter parts of south america and has been introduced into these islands by the spaniards from the great fondness that nation has for its produce otherwise they would not have given themselves any

many others in the south sea  dampier i     first discovered it in guam one of the ladrone islands and gives a very faithful description of the fruit and its uses lord anson and his great follower

manna to our wretched negroes a satan counteracted under the feigned form and name of the most beneficent of sects this great benefit to our hardfated brethren like his great prototype he succeeded in the onset but the adventure is resumed under the auspices of the same faithful leader and i hope that i do not make a false prophecy if i presage success  this fruit is the bread of the islands on which it has been bestowed it grows on a tree of the size of a middling oak and to the bulk of a childs head and even to the diameter of twelve inches rumphius distinguishes the varieties into granosus lanosus and soccosus the first is the parent tree and has in it seeds john reinhold forster plate    a gives us an idea of the whole fruit with the rind hexagonally reticulated the majority have no seeds as we find is often the case with the barberry and a few other fruits these therefore are incapable of propagation except by suckers in the generality of the islands the seeded sort is quite lost the other kind cultivated in orchards the account of the fruit as given by dampier abnormis sapiens is worthy the readers attention when it is ripe it is yellow and soft and the taste is sweet and pleasant the natives of this island use it for bread they gather it when full grown while it is green and hard then they bake it in an oven which scorcheth the rind and makes it black but they scrape off the outside black crust and there remains a tender thin crust and the inside of it soft tender and white like the crumbs of a penny loaf there is neither seed nor stone in the inside but all is of a pure substance like bread it must be eaten new for if it is kept above twentyfour hours it becomes dry and eats harsh and choaky but it is very pleasant before it is too stale this fruit lasts in season eight months in the year during which time the natives eat no other sort of food of bread kind  the fruit which m sonnerat p    calls le rima ou fruit a pain and which he has engaven in tab          and  0 is the perfect fruit or soccus granosus just beneath the rind is a series of large almondlike kernels adhering to a central placenta and of a farinaceous substance which

calls the ducdu and seems to make it a separate species  a minute orange tab    orange resembling the citrus trifoliata of linnaeus is found here the fruit is very small of a bright red color it has

mindanao soolo isles and the northeast point of borneo is a chain of small isles extending about two hundred miles in length called the soolo from the name of the chief island the principal was about the middle of this century governed by a sultan according to m sonnerat the very counterpart of peter the great endowed with the same abilities the same thirst after knowledge and the same ambition of applying it to the improvement of his subjects like peter he quitted his throne and took to traveling during several years he went afterward to batavia where he concealed his name and quality and associated himself with the common sailors to learn their business he next changed his company for that of the carpenters to be instructed in their art he bought tools of all sorts and instruments of husbandry and then returned to his throne still he wished for more intellectual improvement sailed for mecca to learn the law of mahomet made himself master of the arabic tongue brought home the use of letters and introduced money the first ever known in the islands  this monarch obtained possession by conquest of a small part of borneo next to his dominions which involved him in a quarrel with some dutch who pretended they were allies to the bornoese our prince found he never could be a match for these people without the use of firearms he fitted out a few ships loaded them with articles of commerce and sailed to manilla in order to supply his wants the rapacious governor seized on the monarch and all his treasure under pretense that he intended the conquest of the island the sultan remonstrated in vain he endured a long captivity his subjects enraged at the treatment their prince had met with made horrible ravages on the coasts of luconia the governor did not dare to complain as he knew his court would not approve his conduct he stipulated with the prince that he would restore him to liberty provided he would consent to establish in his dominions a mission of jesuits he refused to comply the jesuits determined on revenge and conquest obtained an armament and taking the soolo monarch sailed for sambouange and from thence to soolo where they landed and laid siege to the only fort on the island the warriors of soolo surprised them and drove them with disgrace to their ships at sambouange he found means to escape on board an english vessel which conveyed him to soolo his subjects crowded to him and he remounted his throne to the great joy of his people he ceded a small island to the english and declared his ports open to all piratical adventurers to encourage them to revenge his cause on the treacherous spaniards mr forest visited this island and found there an english factor it was then governed by israel son of the captive sultan who had received his education at manilla  mr dalrymple visited these islands and left us some account of their natural history they are particularly rich in pearls pearls the banks on which the different shells are found containing those gems are of great extent the pearl is not confined to one species of shell mr dalrymple describes several but as he does not do it scientifically i am at a loss to define the kinds excepting the mytilus margaritiferus every one of these shells have in them two small lobsters to which the indians attribute the formation of the pearls the banks were once private property and belonged to several individuals but by the mohammedan law they are now common even to strangers the diverse are slaves to the sultan they seem to be hired out and to receive a certain portion for their share pigafetta the companion of magellan in his circumnavigation visited these islands in      he calls soolo zolo and says from report purchase i     that two pearls had been taken there the property of the king of borneo which were round and as big as hens eggs  the swallows with edible nests swarm here they build in caves open at top but with their sides communicating with the sea beneath its surface the nests are got by diverse who plunge through the entrance and rise within the vast caverns which are inaccessible from above  the upas or poison tree is found in soolo  mr animals foorest has given us a brief account of the animals the soolos have plenty of horses which the ladies of fashion have learned to ride with much grace here are abundance of goats and cattle but the people do not milk the cows wild hogs swarm and with the wild elephant do great mischief the elephants are not aboriginal but bred from some that had been sent as presents to the soolo princes the spotted deer or axis is found here  soolo is thirty miles long and twelve broad length of soolo and very populous which obliges the inhabitants to have recourse to agriculture in a far greater degree than others of the adjacent isles the whole chain is said to have sixty thousand inhabitants the soil is very fertile and productive of most of the tropical fruits teek trees abound here the rainy season is very uncertain for which reason the crops of rice cannot be depended on yams potatoes and other esculents are cultivated to supply the defect the natives have learned the art of engrafting from the chinese settled among them mr forest says that the cinnamon tree is found amongst these islands  the soolos are a polished people natives probably from the examples of their two monarchs both sexes dress with elegance they are fond of music and dancing sultan israel and his niece could perform a tolerable minuet and some of the people of fashion could go down a country dance they have many slaves to whom they are said to be very cruel and besides are reckoned perfidious in their general dealings  another chain of islands sangir of far greater length than the former runs from the western cape of mindanao quite to the most eastern cape of the great island of celebes the chief of which is sangujan or sangir between lat    0 and    0 north most of them are inhabited and governed by their chieftains forest p   0  the dutch have now possession of sangir and some others as outguards to the spicy isles these part of mindanao the soolo isles borneo and celebes bound a great and open gulf of clear navigation  celebes or macassar extends north and south between lat celebes or macassar      north and lat    0 south it is of an oblong form but almost divided by two deep bays one which penetrates far west into the country near the north end and another which penetrates still most extensively from the north running above a hundred and fifty miles due south  this island is prodigiously mountanous volcanoes and lofty the mountains increase in height toward the central parts and are generally richly clothed with wood in macassar as well as in mindanao are some active volcanoes mr dalrymple in the   th plate of his elegant views of land gives a fine idea of the country mr loten informed me that none of the indian islands had such grand and beautiful scenery it abounds with rivers which spring high in the mountains and precipitate down vast rocks among a sylvan scene of lofty and singular trees the lakes and more still parts of the rivers give security to numberless water fowl of the larger and more clumsy kinds which retire there by fear of the crocodiles which haunt the lower and marshy parts those are not deserted by the lesser palmated birds such as ducks and teal which being quick sighted and nimble easily evade the approach of the enemy  this island was discovered in      by antonio de britto and garcias henriguez who at that time commanded in the moluccas celebes was reckoned one of the greatest of those islands the portuguese established themselves here and whether their conduct was more moderate than in other places i know not but they gained the good opinion of the inhabitants who preserved toward them the most inviolable fidelity they kept their ground here till the year    0 when the dutch with a strong squadron landed and defeated them and their faithful ally the king of macassar a potent prince on the west side of the island and near the southern end here the portuguese had their colony the dutch expelled them rased their churches to the ground and seized all the effects of the jesuits whom they justly considered as their greatest enemies the king made one more attempt to expel these invaders but was unsuccessful and obliged to submit to the batavian yoke the english had also for a long time great intercourse with this island for the sake of the rich productions of the spicy isles till at length the subtle dutch succeeded in preventing all commerce with macassar the dutch have now the monarch of this island and all its other princes at their command so they may more truly be said to be the governors of the country the chinese are the only people who are permitted to trade here to supply the wants of the islanders the macassars have a great commercial fishery around their island they go in fleets of more than a hundred sail which consist of proas from twelve to twenty tons burden and carry from sixteen to twenty men they go out with one monsoon and come in with another and send their fish to the china market the produce of its own seas not being equal to the demand of that overstocked empire it is remarkable that all these proas carry dutch colors the island itself exports gold rice sago wax and slaves but its chief use to the dutch is to keep other nations at a distance from the great repositories of spices our old voyagers seldom failed of touching at celebes to profit of the trade  i am sorry to observe slaves in the account i meet with of all the islands even from sumatra itself that the infamous slave trade prevales in almost every one they are either brought to market by the piratical malayes or buggesses who make them one object of their cruizes or petty invasions or they are kidnapped by the coinhabitants of the same islands the mahometans think they have the same right to hunt down and catch a pagan as the gentry of liverpool or bristol have to encourage the trepanning of a curledpated negro and all these bring them to market with as little remorse i call as evidence mr marsden sumatra p      captain forest p     in his voyage to mergui and old dampier voy i p      slaves from celebes mindanao and even java itself are seen at batavia in numbers incredible let me do the batavians the justice to say that some of their slaves are kept with great neatness and are instructed in mechanical trades the dutchman fortunately for them finds it his interest to employ them in the loom rather than consume them under the pressure of labor beneath a vertical sun  our able officer captain carteret in his return from his circumnavigation attempted to put into macassar but was repulsed by the jealousy of the dutch his distress passed expression most of his crew near the point of death by the hardships of his long voyage nothing could equal the unfeelingness of the dutchmans heart there seemed to be little difference in its temper in the year      and that of its rudest days mr carteret by amazing resolution at length got leave to anchor and procure refreshments in bonthain bay about thirty miles from the capital there he suffered all kinds of extortion and observed every species of insolence and cruelty to the natives phlegmatic constitutions never feel for the suffering of others their callosity is incorrigible warm tempers may do wrong but they soon return to their native milkiness as to the dutch they forced the refreshments from them at a small price and contented themselves with a thousand per cent profit from our commander what captain carteret tells us from p     to p     is worthy of perusal excepting his voyage which was most ably written by himself all the rest of the three volumes is mr hawksworths compilation from the journals of the navigators  mr carteret could observe that the city of macassar city of macassar in lat    0 was large and most delightfully situated it is said also to be very strong about bonthain bay are numerous villages and the country abounding with provisions and timber  great quantities of sualloo or sea slug sualloo an animal of the mollusca tribe is fished up here especially about the thirteen small isles called the paternosters in the straight between celebes and borneo it is supposed to be a species of actinia and lies on the sandy bottom and often on that which is environed with coral rocks the fishers strike it with fourbearded iron prongs placed parallel to each other on the surface of two iron shot of six or nine pounds weight fastened to a strong line this sualloo sometimes weighs half a pound numbers of boats with the crew and family on board subsist by this business and dry it in the smoke the black or best kind is sold to the chinese who use it in their nice dishes for forty dollars a pecul whereas the worse or white only brings in four or five  the people employed in this fishery are chiefly badjoos badjoos people they inhabit many of the shores of the smaller islands around the greater they may be called the tartars of the sea some few are stationary living in stilted houses close to the waters edge others live altogether in boats and with their families shift their quarters and change their residence along with the monsoons mr forest computes that they have about seven hundred boats and adds that they live chiefly on fish have a squealing voice and most savage appearance he supposes them to have been originally fugitives from macassar java and other places  the buggesses buggesses or native macassars are the bravest people in india of proved fidelity if treated with confidence of the deepest revenge if insulted they spread far and wide on the ocean in character of freebooters and attack vessels with most astonishing desperation especially when inspired by opium on land their arms are lances or slender arrows pointed with the teeth of fish dipped in the fatal poison of the upas tree which grows in this island these arrows they blow out of hollow trunks and hit their mark at a considerable distance so subtle is the venom that it almost instantaneously effects destruction nor do the macassars themselves know any remedy nicuhoff saw several dutch soldiers cured by swallowing human dung by way of a vomit but others died notwithstanding the filthy remedy a certain root is spoken of growing in the island which is used as an antidote  m tavernier was eyewitness to the rapid effect of this poison effect of upas poison which i think too singular to be omitted one day says he travels p      an englishman in heat of blood had killed one of the king of macassars subjects and though the king had pardoned him yet both english hollanders and portugals fearing if the englishman should go unpunished lest the islanders should revenge themselves upon some of them besought the king to put him to death which with much ado being consented to the king unwilling to put him to a lingering death and desirous to show the effect of his poison resolved to shoot the criminal himself whereupon he took a long trunk and shot him exactly into the great toe of the right foot the place particularly aimed at two surgeons one an englishman and the other a hollander provided on purpose immediately cut off the member but

which to choose he convened a general assembly and after a most fervent prayer to heaven resolved to prefer the religion of that party which should first land on his dominions possibly the mahometans

points to the southwest timor island and with the adjacent isle of anamboa forms a large triangular basin of which the isle of sandel bosche or sandal wood is the western side timor was discovered in

concordia they keep this island merely for the sake of making it an outport to the spicy islands of which they have the most extreme jealousy for there is nothing they apprehend so much as the intercourse of other nations with their usurpations in these parts timor yields so little profit that except for the reason just given it would have been long since abandoned length the length of this island is near two hundred miles the breadth about sixty it is divided into many kingdoms such as cupang and others in dampiers time there were many portuguese settlements or rather of the mixed breed

a deep bay full of small islands about two miles from shore the land was low and even with dunes at the water edge skirted with rocky points  the inhabitants were the most miserable our countrymen ever saw natives without any clothing except the rudest cover for their nakedness consisting of nothing more than the slip of the rind of a tree for a girdle and a little grass stuffed into it before as an apron they were tall strait and thin their limbs very small and long their heads large their foreheads round they had great bottle noses wide mouths full lips and their eyes perpetually winking or kept shut from their being so greatly annoyed with flies that from habit they never open them like other people but are obliged to hold up their heads if they wish to see any thing above their level they have no beards and the people of both sexes universally want two of the upper fore teeth which they draw out their visages are long and their general aspect the most disagreable imaginable their skins are coal black their hair short and frizzled like the african negroes they had neither houses or dwellings but lay in the open air and associated in companies of twenty or thirty men women and children their arms were wooden swords and lances dampier found many on one of the islands they had not the appearance even of a canoe but must have swam from place to place and as to food they could only collect the shells and animals flung up by the sea they were exceedingly timid dampier attempted to make them work in carrying water to the ship but they had not strength or dexterity

yellow dampier saw others very long and slender others as thick as a mans leg with a red head this reminds me of the species described by arrian in his periphus maris erythroei to which he gives black skins and bloodred eyes i dare say his account is just only his informer confined the color of the head to the eyes  on land was an avosetta with the head and neck red avosetta and a sea pie exactly resembling ours only those parts were totally black  dampier voy iii p    also discovered a species of kangaroo kangaroo an animal with very short fore legs which it went jumping on but his guano was an horrible animal too disgusting even for him to eat who had been used to food of all sorts as snakes alligators and crocodiles so offensive was this in look and smell his description is so forcible that we may well give him full credit at the rump instead of the tail there they had a stump of a tail horrible lizard which appeared like another head but not really such being without mouth or eyes yet this creature seemed by this means to have a head at each end and which may be reckoned a fourth difference the legs also seemed all four of them to be forelegs being all alike in shape and length and seeming by the joints and bending to be made as if they were to go indifferently either head or tail foremost they were speckled black and yellow like toads and had scales or knobs on their backs like those of crocodiles plated on to the skin or stuck into it as part of the skin they are very flow in motion and when a man comes nigh them they will stand still and hiss not endeavoring to get away their livers are also spotted black and yellow and the body when opened has a very unsavory smell  i have little doubt but that this is the horrible animal figured by seba mus vol i tab  0  under

purpose by the states he named it van diemens land gave names to several islands and bays and made some remarks on the country if he was accurate they prove a variety in the inhabitants he says they were a largemade people of a color between brown and yellow their hair long and almost as thick as that of the japanese and that like them they combed it up and fixed it at the top of their heads with a pin they covered their middle with a mantle some with a kind of mat others with a sort of woollen cloth their ingenuity might reach the fabricating a mat but i doubt the possibility of the latter  in      tasman after a long interval captain furneaux in      was followed by captain furneaux who had been separated from captain cook and directed his course for the purpose of pursuing the discovery of the dutch navigator he fell on the very same country and found the same bays and headlands observed by tasman he saw the land eight or nine leagues distant it was rather high broken and with bold shores but beaten by a most violent surf it probably having the whole weight of the antarctic ocean from the very pole rolling on this great headland  the soil here was black rich but thin cooks last voyage i      soil the sides of the hills covered with trees and the view greatly beautified by the vast cataracts tumbling from immense heights and a rock with fluted pillars possibly

tinder  in january      captain cook in      this country was visited in person by our great navigator who had the good fortune to meet with some of the natives who came to him with the utmost confidence and without any sign of fear natives they were of the common stature slender black and with hair as frizzled as any negroe but not distinguished by remarkable thick lips or flat noses and their features far from disagreeable their teeth were good but very dirty nor did they want any of the upper fore teeth as dampier observed in those whom he saw the hair of these was clotted with a sort of red ointment and their faces were painted with the same they had bushy beards on their chins and upper lips which was another variation from the most northern people yet the eyes of these were by no means affected like the miserable natives of the environs of sharks bay the hair of the women was cut or shaven sometimes wholly sometimes partially and some had a circle of hair left like the tonsure of the roman catholic clergy the men were quite naked the women had the skin of the kangaroo tied over their shoulders and round their waists the skins of both sexes were marked with scars  their habitations were little wigwams made of sticks covered with bark dryades others reminded you of those of the dryades of the poets they formed a hollow in the vast trees of the country to the height of six or seven feet which they effected by fire they left so much untouched that the tree grew most luxuriantly and gave the image of tassos enchanted grove this is the only forest tree of the country the bark is white the stem quite strait and clear of branches to the height of sixty feet it yielded a transparent gum or resin and the leaves of the lesser branches had an aromatic smell the wood is very long and tough fit for spars oars and even masts for which purpose could it be made ligther none would be better  no other species of quadrupeds were observed here but the opossum hist quadr no     and the kangaroo no     captain cook very humanely turned into the woods a boar and sow pig which if they escape the sight of the natives for some years may prove the stocking of the country with animals equally useful to the inhabitants and casual visitants  abundance of fish are found on the coast as the elephant fish rays soles flounders and the atherina hepsetus br zool iii no

doctor solander were his philosophical companions tropic bird a tropic bird was seen in lat       an uncommon sight as it very rarely exceeds the limits of the tropics proceeding northward he passed by a mountain he called the dromedary on the twentyseventh he observed the wondering natives collected on the rocks in admiration of the novel sight botany bay and on the   th anchored in botany bay of later years well known as the common retreat of the unfortunate brave  the natives of these parts differed very little from those observed in the more southern latitudes natives there can be no doubt but our appearance was very hostile they were diffident of us to the highest degree declined all intercourse and refused all our presents our navigators certainly did not use the arts of conciliating their affections after frequently treating them with a volley of small shots on their legs or more muscular parts we are not to wonder at their dislike to the strangers who had visited their coasts their wants by reason of the happiness of the climate did not demand clothing and their minds were superior to the accepting of gewgaws but they were frequently pressed by hunger  in endeavor river they boldly came on board the ship and seeing plenty of turtle wished to have a share they seized on two trusting to the rites of hospitality or the justice of partaking of the provisions found in their own seas to which they had a natural title instead of that they were roughly treated and so highly irritated as to take an instant revenge by setting fire to the grass that surrounded our tents they were brave to a degree of temerity two have been known to oppose the landing of forty of our people their offensive weapons were swords made of some hard wood and darts or lances armed at the end with fishes bones or the spine of the sting rays their defensive arms a round buckler they were painted like the people of van diemens land and as an additional ornament had a great bone of some bird stuck through their noses and another through each car mr parkinson gives a good representation in plate xxvii of two of the natives armed for fight and in the attitude of combat as to clothing neither sex made the least attempt to conceal their nakedness  these people savage as they may seem are not ignorant of the rudiments of drawing mr phillip voy to botany bay p  0  observed on many of the rocks figures of animals shields weapons and even men and one in particular of a man beginning to dance and this in rather a superior style surely it must be admitted that people thus tinctured with a liberal art are capable of civilization under proper treatment  what religious rites they have is unknown but it is evident from the same authority ib p      that they burn their dead  their habitations are most miserable they lie under the protection of some great pieces of bark flung over a ridged frame made of boughs of trees ib p  0  tab     their food are fish shell fish or any thing they can collect on the shores they have a most artless species of canoe made of bark stretched on a frame and tied together at each end two sometimes more will venture in one of them they keep along the shoals to strike the fish which appears to be their principal subsistence they also eat the fowls or the few quadrupeds they can contrive to take on many of the tall trees were cut notches in the stems to facilitate their ascent they seemed to conceal themselves on the top and by that means surprise the birds as they alight or catch them at roost or from this situation kill with their lances any beast that chances to pass beneath as to their cookery they content themselves with eating their meat raw or at best with giving it a slight broiling over their fires  the country is hilly but not mountanous part covered with tall trees quite clear from underwood in some parts near the shores were extensive tracts hid by brushwood and in many places swamps full of the mangrove or rhizophora mangle catesby ii tab     many rills discharge themselves into botany bay but it wanted depth of water to give room for ships of large size the soil in places was black and fat and gave captain cook reason to believe it would be productive of any sort of grain the trees were filled with birds of most beautiful colors particularly those of the parrot tribe the country abounded with plants and from that circumstance the harbor was called botany bay all this coast was named new south wales from the extreme south to the extreme north a denomination given near two centuries ago to part of the territories adjacent to hudsons bay  in the year      our convicts sent there when we began to be at a loss about the disposal of our criminals legislature was advised to banish into this country all those who had been by royal mercy reprieved from death or who had been convicted of crimes liable only to the punishment of transportation to our late colonies  an act was passed for that purpose in the same year and in consequence a fleet was prepared to convey to this distant country as many convicts as at that time fell under the penalty of the law the syrius frigate was fitted out to convoy the governor the gentleman selected for the arduous charge was captain arthur phillip who had long served in our navy with great credit governor phillip and for some time was engaged in the service of portugal during part of which he with great good conduct and humanity performed a duty similar to that his country now committed to him for he was employed once if not oftener in conveying the criminals of that nation to its colonies of the brazils  the governor sailed from spithead on may   th      on june  d he and his fleet reached teneriff on august  th anchored off rio de janeiro on october   th in table bay at the cape of good hope which he left on november   th in the supply reached botany bay on january  d      having performed in a bad sailer a voyage of seven thousand miles in fiftyone days the syrius and the whole convoy anchored safely in the bay on the   th and  0th of the same month  it is a popular opinion that the expense of transportation of the convicts amounted to three hundred pounds a man including the provision made for their clothing and support for some small time after their landing i was in hopes that two pamphlets published by debrett in           under authority of government would have confirmed or refuted the report especially as one of them pretended to give an account of the expenses but the detail is so very imperfect that i am not able to satisfy either my own or the readers curiosity  mr phillip had previously taken a most exact survey of every part of the proposed place of settlement he found it bad as a port and from the wet nature of the environs suspected that the air would affect the health of the new colonists he observed that captain cook mentioned a bay in lat      south very little distant from the other which he had named port jackson port jackson and where he thought there was good anchorage mr phillip lost no time but made a thorough examination of that also he found it equal at least to our celebrated harbor milford haven in old south wales it opens with an ample mouth and after some space divides into two most extensive meandering branches with numbers of other small bays creeks or coves pointing again to the right and to the left so as to form the finest and most secure harbor in the world capable of containing the navies of europe itself  here mr phillip determined to establish his colony sydney cove and fixing on a place which he named sydney cove began immediately to trace the outlines of the first street of his intended town the officers live in huts but houses are building of brick and stone the governor is very moderate in that designed for himself which contains only six rooms the land allotted for cultivation has been found to be very good and to return on the first trial two hundred bushels of wheat and sixty of barley the following state of agriculture and the amount of live stock belonging to the governor and to the settlers at the colony of new

           the destruction made by rats was very great in a short time they destroyed not less than twelve thousand pounds of flour and rice brought over with the first transportation there are also vegetables in plenty from seeds brought from england i cannot enter into the account of the whole proceedings by the detail given in the two pamphlets published by j debrett imperfect as they are may be seen the humanity of government in providing every necessary for the use of the convicts yet i fear it has been disappointed in its hopes the immense expense we have been at in sending provisions from hence from the cape of good hope and from china notwithstanding the glossing over several particulars gives reason to imagine that our colony has been at the point of starving  the kangaroo and others of the opossum tribe may be eaten but those animals which never were numerous will soon become extinct in the neighborhood of the colony and we dare not for fear of the natives trespass beyond our bounds the new hollanders still continue very hostile fish is found in plenty but the turtle on which we seemed to have some dependence is a very precarious article  the colony looks up for support to a little spot called norfolk island norfolk island in lat    south long     east it contains from twelve to thirteen thousand acres and does not exceed in circumference sixteen miles is very mountanous and covered with a thick wood choked up with underwood it is surrounded with cliffs forty fathoms high and quite perpendicular excepting at a few creeks dignified with the name of bays to which often a raging surf denies all approach  the island is happy in many streams of fine water some copious enough to turn a mill the mold in places freed by our people from trees is the richest and deepest in the world abundance of pumicestones and porous red lava is scattered over its surface and even mixed with the soil giving strong reason to suppose it to have been of volcanic origin  a small colony was detached colonized on february   th      from jackson port to this island in hopes of its contributing in time to the support of the parent state it consisted only of a subaltern officer a surgeon two men who understood the cultivation and dressing of flax nine male and six female convicts and over them was appointed lieutenant king of the navy sole governor of this seagirt

however a plant that serves the inhabitants instead of hemp and flax which excels all that are put to the same purposes in the world of this plant there are two sorts the leaves of both resemble those of flags but their flowers are smaller and their clusters more numerous in one kind they are yellow and in the other a deep red of the leaves of these plants with very little preparation they make all their common apparel and of these they also make their strings lines and cordage for every purpose which are so much stronger than any thing we can make with hemp that they will not bear a comparison from the same plant by another preparation they draw long slender fibers which shine like silk and are as white as snow of these which are also surprisingly strong the finer cloths are made and of the leaves without any other preparation than splitting them into proper breadths and tying the strips together they make their fishing nets some of which as i have before remarked are of an enormous size  norfolk island is peculiarly happy in its climate climate the air is pure salubrious and delicious freed from excessive heat by the constant breezes from the sea and of so mild a temperature

the distance of twelve leagues another rock is circular at top so as to look like a spread fan the rest so low as to give these rocks the form of islands mr ball says that it abounds in cabbagepalms

says the historian hawksworth iii     of the most remarkable kind about the size of a minnow and had two very strong breast fins we found it in places that were quite dry where we supposed it might have been left by the tide but it did not seem to become languid by the want of water for upon our approach it leaped away by the help of the breast fins as nimbly as a frog neither did it seem to prefer water to land for when we found it in the water it frequently leaped out and pursued its way upon dry ground we also observed that when it was in places where small stones were standing above the surface of the water at a little distance from each other it chose rather to leap from stone to stone than to pass through the water and we saw several of them pass entirely over puddles in this manner till they came to dry ground and then leap away  two crabs are described of a new species crabs and one of most exquisite beauty it had all its claws and joints of the most lovely ultramarine

small distance of eight miles to the north of port jackson is broken bay broken bay a name given by captain cook when he passed it by on his departure northwards it was examined by mr phillip in march      voy p     found to be extensive and to have two mouths one impeded by a bar so that the entrance is impervious except by small vessels the other capable of admitting ships of the greatest burden the land here was higher than that about port jackson more rocky but equally covered with timber trees of great size grow on the tops of the most inaccessible mountains the country was populous and it was observed that most of the women had the two joints of the little finger cut off most of the men wanted the right front tooth their septum narium was perforated and had a bone or stick thrust through it the want of language kept our voyagers ignorant of the cause of these strange customs their skins were singularly scarred from the crown of the head to their feet the scars prominent and seemed as if filled with wind  in another excursion mr phillip made to this bay hawkesbury river he discovered a very considerable river which he named the hawkesbury it was from three hundred to eight hundred feet wide and navigable for the largest merchant ships as far as a hill named richmond hill about fortyfive miles from its discharge into the bay but it is not safe for ships to go so high up because of the heavy rains the water rises thirty feet above its usual level the vessels therefore ought not to approach nearer than fifteen or twenty miles from the foot of the hill where they may lie secure in fresh water richmond hill is called the head of the river for there it divides into two branches grows shallow and was seen for some way till lost in the wooded rocks of the country  another river was discovered nepean river which mr phillip named the nepean from three to four hundred feet broad which also overflows its banks in hard rains to the same height as the former into which it is supposed to fall the soil on both these rivers is excellent the banks well wooded wild ducks inhabit these waters in great numbers and here were first seen the black swans a cataract at the foot of richmond hill prevented the party from proceeding any further in boats that hill is the termination of a chain of mountains which runs northward and probably joins those that range nearly parallel to the coast from fifty to sixty miles inland the difficulty of reaching these hills is very great for after the first days journey is such a succession of ravines many with sides inaccessible that our people could not proceed above fifteen miles in five days they therefore returned to await the arrival of the floods to swell the nepean when they hoped they could reach these mountains by water  from the entrance into port jackson as far as lat      indian head the coast keeps due north from a point called indian head it begins to incline to the west  a little farther is

threatened speedy destruction to the whole crew the rising tide which might remove her out of the present situation redoubled the anxiety for probably she would then instantly sink into the depth of ten or twelve fathoms a thought suggested by mr monkhouse a young midshipman saved them from destruction he advised the dropping a sail covered with oakum and wool over the outside and hauled under the ships bottom with ropes till it reached the leak they executed his plan and from the suction of the sail by the water into the most dangerous of the leaks the ship was enabled to keep afloat when it was released from the rock by the tide and the redeemed to get into a secure place to repair the damage on this critical occasion not an oath was heard among our sailors the habit of profaneness

intolerable thirst but as soon as their safety was ensured their minds and their bodies returned to their wonted tones no cape or river was distinguished by the title of providence or any grateful

of earth and is about six feet high  a little to the north of endeavor river are cape bedford and cape flattery cape bedford and cape flattery off them is a cluster of small isles and most numerous reefs let me here acquaint the reader of the very perilous situation of our illustrious seaman during his three months navigation he sailed all that time in a channel bounded by the land on one side and to the seaward by a reef of rocks or coral banks not less tremendous extending the length of three hundred and sixty leagues within this reef he was obliged to anchor at night with the thunder of the surge foaming over it expecting inevitable destruction from the breaking of the cables or from the driving of the ship which she often did to a certain degree the man at the chains was perpetually heaving out the lead without omitting it a moment and under such circumstances did our navigator escape it was natural for him to wish to enjoy the open sea soon after he left endeavor river by ascending a lofty isle he saw the opening in the reef in lat      which with consummate abilities and courage he attempted and with success the instant he got beyond the breakers he met with a rolling sea and no ground with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line a certainty he had obtained his wish the island from which he had made his observation was one of the three called the islands of direction that strangers in future might find the passage  new dangers now awaited him a vast sea came rolling from the east and brought him nearer and nearer the perils he sought to shun the same billow which had washed the side of the ship broke to a tremendous height upon the adjacent rocks leaving beneath an unfathomable watery valley no broader than the base of that single wave two light breezes saved them from the jaws of death after the most arduous efforts they got through another favorable opening in the reef through which the ship was carried by a current of amazing rapidity they now exulted in recovering that very situation they had so long labored to extricate themselves from the opening was not more than a quarter of a mile wide yet the force of the torrent carried the ship exactly in the midway here it was impossible not to be grateful to heaven captain cook called this salutary gap providential inlet providential inlet and this proof of piety remains both in the book and in the chart the impiety of expunging it would have been too glaring  these coral reefs are most surprising operations of nature coral reefs they rise like a wall almost perpendicularly out of the unfathomable deep and at low water are dry in many places here the enormous waves of the vast southern ocean meeting with so abrupt a resistance break with inconceivable violence in a surf which no rocks or storms in the northern hemisphere can produce  to form these stupendous works nature makes use of no other instruments than a little worm contemptible to vulgar eyes well may we join in the fine apostrophe of pliny in his tam parvis atque tam nullis quae ratio quanta vis quam inextricabilis perfectio  these reefs are composed of various kinds of coral the tubipora musica is mentioned among them and they give shelter to numbers of beautiful shells and mollusca among the former are the chamae some so large that two men can scarcely move them  within the reef from the inlet to york cape the whole channel is filled with small isles rocks or coral rocks  york cape is in lat  0    south the land trends from it fast to the west the sea to the northeast is full of islands one beyond the other these captain cook called prince of waless islands and supposes they reach quite to new guinea the passage between new holland he called endeavor streights endeavor streights exulting in having been the first who proved the entire insulation of this vast land the length of the streights was ten leagues the breadth about five except at the northeast end where they were contracted by the isles to two leagues the depth from four to nine fathoms and the tide rose twelve feet he now hoisted british colors took possession of the country in the name of his majesty and called the isle on which the ceremony was performed possession island most of the islands were well clothed with herbage and wood apparently well inhabited and the natives of both sexes quite naked  captain cook now pursued his voyage to new guinea the distance between the opposite point of new guinea and the most northern of new holland is only two hundred and ten miles we here nearly rejoin the place we left to perform our circuit of the country the land on the western extremity of endeavor straight and the eastern point of arnheim land forms the entrance into the great gulf of carpentaria carpentaria which runs due south far into the land it received its name from the dutch general carpenter the zealous promoter of discoveries in these parts about the beginning of the last century  spicy islands we now proceed to the molucca islands arrou isles and taking a course due north pass between those of timorlaut and arrou the last is the most eastern of the timorian chain and forms a group consisting of three or four larger isles and a multitude of little rocks and reefs closely clustered adjoining the east end of arrou proper we are now arrived within reach of the perfumed air of the molucca or famous spicy islands a land of romance where nature assumes a new shape in picturesque scenery and in the beautiful and singular form of numbers of the animal and vegetable creation whether inhabitants of land or water  the long celebrated manucodialae birds of paradise or birds of paradise first begin to appear in these islands these birds so singular in the structure and disposition of their feathers so elegant in their form and so romantic in their history gave occasion soon after their discovery to the supposition of their having been the celebrated phoenix of the ancients the learned forster with his usual depth of judgment has collected every thing relating to that ideal bird in his latin and german translation of the indian zoology and effectually disproved that the invention originated from any one of this genus i refer the reader to his disseration and barely mention that the ancient describers of the phoenix give it the form and size of an eagle with an exquisite richness of coloring they say that it lived dclx years and at the completion of that period formed its nest with the twigs of the most odoriferous trees and died upon them a young one sprung from its remains and conveyed them to panchaia the city of the sun performed the funeral rites and placed them on the altar pliny from whom this relation was taken adds that it was reported one had been brought to rome but with his usual good sense stamps on it the charge of fiction  notwithstanding the remoteness of the native country of this whole genus i cannot absolutely affirm the impossibility of the ancients being acquainted with some of the species they had from distant times a regular trade with india before the days of ptolemy they pushed their navigation beyond the peninsula of malacca to cattigara the modern ponteamas and the metropolis sina the present cambodia notwithstanding the ancients might have penetrated no farther yet as the indians were extremely commercial the romans might receive from them accounts of the most distant isles their commodities and even their curiosities the birds of india were known to the romans it is possible that they might have seen or at least heard of those of paradise no words could better suit these most singular species than discolores maxim et inenarrabiles plin lib  0 cap     birds of different colors and not to be described and few are more difficult to be represented in words than those of this genus  the time in which they were brought to europe was very early and i suspect long before they were observed by any naturalists there is reason to believe that the turks received them by means of the arabians who procured them from india by their commerce on the red sea or persian gulf and sold them for ornaments to the turbans of the great officers of the janissaries belon first took notice of them and credulously believed them to have been the phoenix in one place he supposes them to have been the rhyntaces he justly describes them as forming a vast mass of feathers issuing from a small body out of which the arabians had extricated the flesh which agrees with the usual method of preparation nicholas de nicholai actually gives the figure of a captain of janissaries ornamented with its plumes gesner is the first who caused this bird to be engraven and his figure and that of clusius was long copied by succeeding naturalists  few birds are more circumscribed in their limits than the birds of paradise they are confined within the papua islands and that of new guinea and are found only from latitude   south to lat   north of the equator and between longitude     and   0  such is the general view of these wonderful birds common the paradisea apoda lin syst     pl enl      of which there are two varieties called the greater and lesser birds of paradise chiefly inhabit the arrou isles edw   0 latham ii      they are natives of both new guinea as well as of these islands are supposed to breed in the first and to reside there during the wet monsoon but retire to the arrou isles about a hundred and forty miles to the east during the dry or western monsoons in the east monsoon they moult their long feathers but recover them in the west they always migrate in flocks of thirty or forty and have a leader which the inhabitanss of arrou call the king he is said to be black to have red spots and to fly far above the flock which never desert him but settle where he settles they constantly avoid flying with the wind which ruffles and blows their loose plumage over their heads and often forces them down to the ground from which they are unable to rise without some advantage hard showers of rain are equally destructive to them when they are surprised with a strong gale they instantly soar to a higher region beyond the reach of the tempest there they float at ease in the serene sky on their light flowing feathers or pursue their journey in security during their flight they cry like starlings but in the distress of a storm blowing in their rear they express it by a note resembling the croaking of ravens  when they alight it is on the highest trees the king taking the lead they prefer the varinga parvifolia rumph iii tab  0  on the berries of which these birds and various sorts of parrots feed some say that they feed on nutmegs on butterflies and even small birds the strength of their claws favors that opinion yet that circumstance may also be requisite to birds which are always to live perched the natives of arrou watch their arrival and either shoot them with blunt arrows or catch them with birdlime or nooses when taken they will make a vigorous resistance and defend themselves stoutly with their bills they are instantly killed exenterated and the breast bone taken out then dried with smoke and sulphur and exported to banda where they are sold for half a rixdollar but on the spot for a spike nail or a bit of old iron they are exported to all parts of india and to persia to adorn the turbans of people of rank and even the trappings of the horses as i have before mentioned they even reach turkey in the spring of      they formed an additional ornament to the elegant head dress of the british fair e   no birds have ever had so much fable mixed with their history it was believed that they remained always floating on the spicy indian air and of course not to be in want of legs or feet of which they were supposed to be destitute that when they wanted to sleep they hung themselves by their two long feathers to the boughs of a tree that they performed the act of love during their flight and that even ovation and exclusion of the young was discharged in that element the male receiving the egg in an orifice nature had given it for that purpose that they lived on the dew of heaven and had no evacuation like other mortal birds from their being so much conversant in the higher regions the portuguese styled them passaros da sol or sparrows of the sun the islanders manucodewata or the birds of god and most of the europeans name them the birds of paradise so happily did the opinion work on the little kings of the isles that seeing them descend as it often happened dead from the heavenly regions they became converts to the truth of the immortality of the soul  the next that may be supposed to belong to this genus king is chiefly brought from arrou and sopeloo it is called the king of the birds of paradise and by the people of arrou wowi wowi our classical ornithologists style it after linnaeus paradisea regia le roi des oiseaux de paradis sonnerat     tab    pl enl     edw tab iii  i do not know what title it has to king for it never associates with any other species never aspires to lofty trees but flits solitary from bush to bush to feed on berries it is supposed to migrate to arrou in the dry monsoon and to make its nest in new guinea it is taken in snares of gumatty or with birdlime prepared from the juice of sukkom bread fruit or artocarpus communis  notwithstanding voyagers give an exact locality to the different species of these birds i cannot readily assent to the opinion as the whole extent of the residence of the genus is so small that it is improbable but that each of them must at times trespass beyond their pretended bounds  the arrou islands have been under the jurisdiction of banda since the year      they are low flat and well peopled with blacks it was reckoned that in   0  there were about two hundred and forty christians off one of the islands is a fishery of small pearl but the chief trade is sago and slaves which they kidnap in new guinea and sell to the dutch at banda  i am so deficient in materials that i must hasten to the next isles or those of banda let me premise that the intervening expanse of water has sparingly scattered over it several small islands distant from each other one of them called by dampier the burning isle and was when he passed by it in      voyages iii p   0  a most fierce volcano  the banda islands lie in about lat    0 banda islands  south and are included under the general name of the spicy islands their names are gonnipo banda which gives name to the whole group lontare poolaway and pooloroon these and the neighboring moluccas were discovered at the same time in      by francis serrano and antonio dabreau who were sent on that service by the great albuquerque they spent some years in the discovery the portuguese to deter other nations from paying attention to these sources of wealth and luxury gave out that they were scarcely approachable by reason of the shallowness of the seas pigafetta disproved the report by sounding the coasts and finding a depth of a hundred and two hundred fathoms  the chinese were the first who had made themselves masters of these islands chinese the javans and the malayan moors next succeeded and with them were introduced the religion and language of mahomet which in these and the moluccas found their most remote but wonderful extent portuguese the portuguese arrived after them at the period just mentioned argensola represents some of the kings of these little islands as incredibly powerful and asserts that they could collectively raise above a hundred and twenty thousand fighting men the prince of ternate was the most potent he was lord of seventytwo isles  the portuguese by violence or treachery established themselves in these valuable possessions the spaniards indeed laid clame to them under the false pretense that they were first discovered by magellan the spanish fleet in the reign of charles v sailed to the moluccas the portuguese were engaged in war with the king of ternate and the monarchs of tidor and gilolo who sided with the spaniards but about that time john iii thought proper to make his brotherinlaw charles a present of three hundred and fifty thousand ducats on condition the portuguese should remain in quiet possession till the sum was repaid notwithstanding this charles offered them to sale to henry vii but the bargain never took place  it is ridiculous to consider that charles v clamed these islands by virtue of the famous line of demarcation by which pope alexander vi in      divided by his infallible power between the spaniards and portuguese all countries which should be discovered on the side of a certain meridian drawn by his holiness from pole to pole allotting one part to ferdinand and isabel of spain the other to john ii of portugal and their successors osorio ii      this alexander did in hopes of preserving peace in the world but the effect proved the reverse i must refer to osorio and others who have treated on the subject  the dutch dutch after some unsuccesful attempts for the discovery of a northeast passage to the east indies determined to follow the course of the enterprizing portuguese in      they resolved to share in the rich adventure four ships with no more than two hundred and fortynine men sailed from the texel on april  d they saw the cape of good hope on august  th touched at madagascar and on january  st      reached the streights of sunda near bantam they met with their ancient enemies the portuguese who had long been master of these seas they instantly attacked some of their merchant ships one of which burnt by the portuguese themselves had fifty tons of cloves on board another which they took had twenty this foretaste of the riches of the islands whetted their resolution of pursuing their plan and of supplanting the tyrants in this invaluable branch of commerce the second voyage was performed under the conduct of the great heemskirk in      from bantam he sailed with four ships to the very moluccas found the most cordial reception from the monarchs of amboina and ternate and returned laden with cloves nutmegs mace pepper and cinnamon fleet followed fleet the dutch attacked the portuguese in all parts of the islands and never desisted till they had in   0  completed the conquests of both the banda and molucca islands at this period portugal was subject to the crown of spain in   0  philip iii determined to recover these distant territories he sent his orders to don pedro dacunha a gallant officer governor of the philippines to take the command of the expedition he sailed with a numerous fleet attacked ternate took that island and in a short space reduced the whole to his master this conquest was but short lived the dutch returned in great force and favored by the reguli of the islands repossessed themselves of the whole and to this day remain entire masters of what is justly styled the gold mines of holland they immediately destroyed every nutmegtree they could find on the adjacent islands built small forts on every one that lay to the south and to the west as out posts to prevent the access of other european nations executed with the most cruel rigor all smugglers and to this day became sole masters of the trade in nutmegs mace cloves and cinnamon  the english visited the spice islands in the year   0  english in their first voyage to the east indies sir james lancaster during his stay at bantam purchase vol i p      fitted out a small pinnace and furnishing it with such articles as he thought would be acceptable to the natives dispatched it to the moluccas under the command of mr william starky the pinnace returned after the departure of lancaster and forwarded to england the first cargo of nutmegs and cloves it ever received in a bottom of its own  in our second voyage the fleet was commanded by sir henry middleton knight who in   0  after a months stay at bantam sailed directly for amboina leaving two ships to take in a cargo of pepper from amboina the admiral went to the moluccas and dispatched the other ship commanded by mr colthurst to banda we are not told the circumstance of this voyage any more than that sir henry returned to england and that the dragon his principal ship lost by sickness fortythree out of fiftythree men between bantam and the cape  william keeling commander of the expedition which was made in      was the first who began a regular commerce with the spicy islands he reached banda on february  th   0  delivered his monarchs james the firsts letter and presents at nera the capital town and obtained leave to establish a factory at puloway he actually built a house but the jealous hollanders pulled it down when keeling returned to england with a rich cargo of spices we persisted in our lucrative voyages and notwithstanding the numberless obstructions we met with from the dutch formed a settlement in these islands the natives of banda on a quarrel with the dutch by a formal instrument made a resignation of their island to us and those of lantore did the same in    0 puloroon and puloway were also added to the british dominions and our peaceful monarch assumed the title of king of those islands he also received the most friendly epistles from his brother kings of ternate tidor and bantam the accounts given by old purchase vol i from p  0  to  0  are well worth the readers perusal these cessions were confirmed by treaty between james i and the dutch in      notwithstanding which at the very conclusion of a treaty they determined on our expulsion they attacked with a strong force lantore and poleroon they ravaged the islands seized our factories and magazines and after stripping the factors naked first whipped them loaded them with irons and after all massacred them by flinging them over the walls and in the most savage manner dragged their remains in chains through the streets the quantity of spices seized by these barbarians will serve to give an idea of the extent of our commerce they found in our magazines twentythree thousand pounds of mace and a hundred and fifty thousand pounds of nutmegs the narrative of these proceedings are preserved in the eighth volume of churchhills collection but it is too horrible to be repeated and the apology of the dutch so futile and so false as not to merit the recital cromwell in      had the glory of compelling the dutch to restore to us the island of poleroon and to make ample satisfaction for their barbarities at amboina as to poleroon it was kept but a very short time for in      in the inglorious reign of his profligate successor it was taken from us by a single ship  the abbe raynal gives the following description of these islands they seem says he vol i p      to have been thrown up by the sea and may with reason be supposed to be the effect of some subterraneous fire lofty mountains the summits of which are lost in the clouds enormous rocks heaped one upon another horrid and deep caverns torrents which precipitate themselves with extreme violence volcanoes perpetually announcing impending destruction such are the phenomenon that give rise to this idea or assist in confirming it by the sequel of my account it will appear that the abbes description and inference seem to have been very well founded  this is the general view of them i collect the following particulars of those of banda the moluccas i reserve till my arrival on their coasts the first called gonnapo or goenongapi goenongapi in      emitted fire smoke and cinder and had perhaps long before left neither woods fruits or water the eruptions have been at times so violent as to carry desolation to part of the neighboring island of banda overwhelming the woods and greatest trees and to fling stones of three or four tons weight from one island to the other even in the last year      we are informed that it made a very considerable cruption in the phil trans abridg vol ii p     is an account of a most horrible eruption of this mountain in november      attended with noises like the discharge of artillery it cast up such a quantity of stones as entirely to fill a noted fishing place in the neighboring sea of the depth of forty fathoms so as to leave it entirely dry the same volume fully accounts for the appearance of these islands and the banda so graphically described by the french abbe in the year      and      several other islands as if by consent raged with volcanic fury the mountains of celebes sorea ternate banda and neyra at one time cast up fire lava ashes cinders and boiling water there was no approaching the water by reason of the excessive heat in sorea the ground sunk in and discovered a great lake a fiery deluge fed with everburning sulphur unconsumd which spreading farther and farther threatening the whole island terrified the inhabitants so much that they unanimously transported themselves to banda leaving their movables behind for want of vessels all these islands are subject to terrible earthquakes which affect the sea so greatly as particularly to endanger the ships lying at anchor in the fine harbor between this island and banda i am not certain that goenong is inhabited since the dreadful eruption  banda is defended by a strong castle the name of the capital is nera a powerful garrison is kept in this island it being the seat of government notwithstanding it is not above twelve leagues in circumference  lontoir lontoir the largest of all the group is inaccessible on most parts by reason of its lofty precipitous shores yet the dutch have given it the additional defense of a castle it has not a tree on it but which bears fruit and is particularly productive of nutmegs  pulo aya or puloway says my old informant humphrey fitzherbert purchase i      is the paradise of all the rest entermitting pleasure with profit there is not a tree on that island but the nutmeg and other delicate fruits of superfluity and withal full of pleasant walks so that the whole country seems a contrived orchard with varieties they have none but rain water which the keep in jarres and cisternes or fetch it from the abovenamed islands which is their only defect the sea shore is so steep that it seems nature meant to reserve this island particularly to herself there is but one place about the whole island for a ship to anchor in and that so dangerous that he that lets fall his anchor seldom sees the weighing of it again besides he incurreth the imminent dangers of his ship  poloroon or more properly poeloron is the last poloroon  these islands are the ancient seats of the nutmegs nutmegs as the moluccas were of the cloves at first they grew spontaneously on most of the neighboring isles and possibly we shall have occasion to show that they spread much farther than is generally known marco polo bergeron     speaks of the noix dinde and the des clous de girosle or cloves as being found on the island of necuram but where that island stood i am not certain originally the arabs engrossed this rich trade and conveyed the spices up the red sea and from thence to alexandria from whence they were dispersed to all parts of southern europe the general original name of the nutmegtree is pata the arabs called the fruit giauzhant and gjeuzottibi or the aromatic nut it was never mentioned but by the later greek writers who named it  and the latins nux moschata so that it was not known till long after the clove we retain the use of them in our dispensatory they are an agreeable aromatic and used as astringents in diarrhaeas and dysenteries even in india they are prescribed in the same disorders gerard informs us that in his days they were chewed to correct a bad breath that it is good against freckles in the face quickens the sight strengthens the belly and feeble liver it takes away the swelling in the spleen stays the laske breaks wind and is good against all cold diseases in the body  it is often used as an aphrodisiac especially among the negroes the europeans in india apply it as a philtre in cases of love the eating the raw fruit is often attended with most dangerous consequences idiotcy and even phrenzy ensues and sometimes death this boasted perfumed air which salutes the voyager at great distances from land is pregnant with the most fatal diseases few countries are so very unwholesome as the spicy islands  as soon as the dutch made themselves masters of the banda islands they began with extirpating the nutmegtrees and cloves on all those adjacent in some by force in others by employing the natives for hire some of the princes of the moluccas reduced by wars consented to receive pensions for that purpose the king of ternate had about six thousand pounds a year and the monarch of tidor about five hundred this treaty has been twice renewed  when the dutch first took possession of the islands they met with some difficulties the natives were impatient of the yoke and killed the governor william verhoeven as they could not see the justice of having their nutmegwoods robbed by strangers they thought themselves justified in putting to death any thieves they met within their limits but the captain general the great koen

most abandoned principles often sent here by their relations so that banda itself is called the house of correction these are the colonists who repeopled the island and who get slaves from the neighboring places to cultivate the land happily the climate is so unhealthy that very few of these exiles we may call them ever return to be a pest to their country or their relations  in the banda group the nutmeg trees are permitted to grow only on that island lontoir and pulo aya the best are those of lontoir among the lofty and rocky mountains and on the edges of the precipices which makes the gathering of the fruit a work of great danger  pulo aya is only two miles long quite flat and so destitute of water either rain or spring that they are obliged to get it from the neighboring isles and preserve it in cisterns yet here grow the loftiest trees and so productive are they that the whole world might be supplied from hence gardens of nutmegs the island seems one beautiful garden of nutmeg trees  the trees are laden with fruit the whole year either mature or ripening but it is gathered only at certain times the principal harvest is in the middle of the rainy season or in part of july and august there is another in november and a third in march and april the nuts are carried home and cleansed and the mace carefully taken off with a knife and exposed to the sun to be dried the exterior coat is thick like that of a walnut the mace is the immediate covering of the nutmeg and possesses the same virtues the oil is a wellknown article in our shops  after some time the nutmegs are divided into three heaps the first consists of the finest and largest which are sent to the european markets the next is reserved for that of india and the third which is composed of the damaged nuts is never sent abroad but reserved for the oil which is expressed from them  the green or unripe nuts are frequently preserved with sugar and disposed of in all parts of india and china and even some are sent to europe  there are besides the genuine species six others of the wild kind called palae with some distinguishing epithet and also palalae after saying that these trees are of little or no use but for the wood i refer to rumphius who vol ii p       has given descriptions and plates of the several sorts  the references to this plant among the best botanical writers are as follows nux

the common method of sowing the pigeons pull off the external coat before they devour the nut the mace is digested but the kernel passes through them entire such as falls among the thick grass is sure to succeed by this accident the trees are spread over all the islands and some which are very distant so as to elude the utmost diligence of the dutch to effect the total extirpation of the nutmeg

how remotely this spice may be disseminated what folly it is therefore in the dutch to endeavor to consine it to the narrow bounds of the mollucca or banda groups when the very fowls of the air are

northwest of the banda isles amboina this is in respect to cloves what those are in respect to nutmegs the dutch have made it the great and sole plantation of that valuable spice they destroy with the same zeal all that they can find on the islands within their reach or bribe or compel the natives to do it for them the governor of amboina makes annually in great state the tour of the islands with a fleet of perhaps fifty sail of corocoros the vessels of the country to enforce obedience and to show his power to the people and the inhabitants of the ten islands dependent on it  some gold dust

state of the produce this island has also its volcano the brimstone mountain called wawani in      made a dreadful eruption  amboina lies in lat      south and is divided very nearly in two by a long bay which with the sea contracts it into two peninsulas joined at the eastern end by so very narrow and sandy an isthmus that small vessels may easily be dragged over the larger or more northern portion is called hitoe the other ley timor the whole island is full of mountains covered not only with woods of clove trees but with the richest productions of flora for variety and singularity of vegetation no part of the torrid zone can in even far greater space vie with it in numbers and elegancy the whole length of the greater portion of this double island i may call it is seventy miles the intervening space of water is a most secure and beautiful meandering bay with numberless streams falling from the hills a blessing enjoyed by every side of the island dampier voyages iv p     tells us that the sea surrounding it is a hundred fathom deep the bottom sandy and unfit for anchoring except at the ley at the west end where it may be done in twenty fathoms  amboina was discovered by antonio dabreu lonquetes des portugais vol iii p     when discovered about the year      it is said to have been even then peopled with malayans and possibly some of the aborigines represented as a most barbarous race their present religion is mahometanism mixed with paganism by the wooden print given at p  0 of the old edition of heemskirks voyage some of the people had no more than a wrapper round their middle others were clothed in long garments and the military in a shirt and sort of short breeches their weapons were spears scymetars poisoned darts blown out of tubes and even matchlocks as early as the year      which last they probably got from the portuguese their first masters their defensive arms were shields very long and narrow nieuhoff gives a print of an amboinese soldier in the dutch service at batavia many amboinese are settled there and are represented as a most dangerous and turbulent people  the conquest of amboina by the portuguese arose from this circumstance conquered by the portuguese in      galoun governor of ternate had observed great numbers of small vessels resorting from java macassar banda and even this island to the moluccas for the sake of the cloves this trade he resolved to suppress sitted out his fleet and by his admiral defeated that of the indians landed and forced the natives to submit to his will and in the year      the sovereignty of amboina was vested in the portuguese by the king of the island stephen de sa built a fort there in the same year and his countrymen kept possession till about   0  when the dutch made themselves masters of amboina and of all the spicy islands the english laid in their clame for a share of the commerce and after many disputes in      a treaty was signed between the two nations stipulating that the moluccas amboina and the banda isles should be common to both that the english should have one third of the produce and the dutch two at a fixed price and that each should contribute to the defense of the islands in proportion to the benefit received the inquisitive reader may find the whole of this curious treaty in rymers foedera vol xvii p   0  it has often been remarked that after a treaty so well calculated to establish lasting peace and harmony between the two companies nothing could interrupt those blessings the reverse took place the dutch actuated by their insatiable avarice determined by the most diabolical means to free themselves from all competitors massacre of the english they forged a plot of the english against their lives and liberties but such a plot that none but idiots could have been supposed to have projected the charge was that ten factors and eleven foreign soldiers were to seize on the castle garrisoned by two hundred men a foolish question asked by an indian soldier as to the strength of the place was the foundation of the tragedy he was seized and put to the most exquisite tortures that hell itself could invent and in his agonies answered the artful interrogatories in the manner the fiscal could wish our countrymen and the eleven foreign soldiers underwent the same horrid torments which were continued at intervals during eight days the means are too dreadful for the humane pen to recite or the humane ear to bear the constancy of the poor sufferers was often overcome they made such answers as they thought would soonest free them from the rack and which they recanted as soon as the torture ceased they were then recalled to their torments at length the record of examination was read and the greater part were relieved by a speedy execution those who were reprieved could drag but a miserable life with mangled bodies or dislocated limbs the sufferers before death were confronted with each other english with indians both bewailed their infirmity for accusing the other under the pressure of torture and mutually exchanged forgiveness a full account is given of this horrid transaction by the ingenious campbel vol i p      in his collection of travels we could well excuse his speaking to our eyes by a most horrible print the foreign soldiers vol ii p  0   from good authority he supposes to have been koreans an adventurous naval people even in that early time  the name of the castle after this cruel deed victoria castle was changed to victoria dampier was shown the place into which the bodies of our unhappy countrymen were thrown for the savage dutch did not think them worthy of the rites of burial the natives who live in the mountains are a brave race of men disdain a dependent life and never fail to sacrifice the dutch to their fury whenever they make their descent from their heights  by means of the arabs cloves the clove was introduced into europe by the common passage over the isthmus of suez but before their conquests toward the indian archipelago it was carried to the ports of western hindoostan and from thence by roman merchant ships to myoshormus the great emporium on the red sea i cannot but think that the clove was early known and that the garyophyllon of pliny lib xii c   was the spice which he might truly say tradunt in indico luco id gigni advehitur odoris gratia the romans were particularly fond of aromatic perfumes pliny may not be over accurate in his description but he is exact in place and property and the name except in one letter agrees entirely with the latin retained to this day  the native place of the clove is said by rumphius to have been machian one of the molucca islands which we shall have occasion soon to mention the dutch thought proper to confine the growth of them to amboina and to extirpate them in every other island in the manner we have related there are none here growing wild but all are raised from the seed and disposed of in plantations they are also disseminated and propagated by the pigeons hornbills and casuary in the same manner as the nutmegs of quadrupeds hogs and deer are found in this island  no country was ever so happy in a florist as amboina of rumphius the celebrated george everard rumphius made it his residence a great number of years he was born in      and became doctor of physic in the university of hanover he went over to this island in character of conl and merchant and applied his leisure moments to the study of botany but by the vast fruits of his labors he must be supposed to have dedicated his whole time to that pursuit buy his continual researches after plants and other objects of natural history on this burning soil he had at the age of fortythree the misfortune of losing his sight notwithstanding this he persevered in his pursuits and being deprived of his visual faculties acquired that of distinguishing plants by the senses of feeling and smell he formed a hortus siccus in ten folio volumes and in    0 dedicated them to the governor and council of the east india company who deposited it in the india house of amsterdam with them he probably deposited his description of fishes and other animals of the island his botanical labors were not printed during his life they had the good fortune to fall into the hands of that able naturalist doctor john burman who published the first volume of the celebrated herbarium amboinense in    0 and completed the whole by the year      it consists of six folio volumes and an auctuarium which are illustrated with seven hundred plates relative to the subject besides two portraits one of rumphius in the sixtyeighth year of his age in a state of blindness he is represented feeling the plants and shells placed before him on a table the other portrait is of his publisher doctor burman i do not know for certain the time of his death it probably was at amboina for he dates the dedication of his hortus siccus from the castle of victoria    0 in the   d year of his age  governor loten gave a curious anecdote in respect to the fate of his drawings and description of the fishes of the island there is reason to suppose that they were sent into the world in      in a work published by francis valentyn a dutch clergyman who had resided in the molucca and bonda islands baron imhoff governor general of the indies communicated to mr loten his suspicions that valentyn got the materials out of the india house by means of his soninlaw who was first clerk to the secretary of the company these valentyn basely applied to his own use not daring to make the acknowlegement certain it is they never could be found notwithstanding the most diligent search has been made after them valentyns work was published under the title of india orientalis antiqua et nova in five volumes folio the figures of the fishes lie under the imputation of being fictitious from the extravagancy of their forms but i am told it is far from being the case nature having sported wonderfully in the construction of those of the amboinese seas  the other works of the great rumphius were the imagines piscium testaceorum first printed at leyden in      and reprinted in      the figures are finely executed he might have added crustaceorum for there are besides in that work numbers of the lobster and crab kind no sort of letterpress attends this work except a catalogue of the subjects with the names in different languages especially the indian from the immensity of his labors he justly left behind him the title of the pliny of the indies  the west end of ceram is at a very small distance from amboina ceram that island stretches across the channel from east to west a length of about eighty leagues ceram and buero divide nearly in two equal parts the spicy sea this the geographers will find to be a new name but i think fit to distinguish by that epithet all the space which comprehends the banda isles the molucca the papuan with ceram and buero the central isles bounded on the south by the timorian chain on the west by celebes and on the east by new guinea the inhabitants of its water of the air and the vegetation of the islands are all most singular which make it merit a title of distinction from all the rest of the indian ocean the breadth of ceram is inconsiderable the land near the sea is low swampy and wooded within it rises into mountains of great height it is wonderful how little i can collect concerning this great island mr forest says that it produced clove trees possibly in places inaccessible to the dutch on the authority of rumphius herb amb i p     we may say that there are vast forests of the sago tree on this island the pith is prepared there into bread and is exported to other places in great quantities let me add from dampier voy i   0  that it is much used in mindanao and our honest traveller gives us the process of preparing that useful viand  manipa and keylan are two small islands but very lofty manipa and keylan seated a little to the west of the western end of ceram in the time of dampier they were well inhabited by malayes on the first was a dutch corporal and six soldiers employed to cut down the clove trees on manipa grew abundance of those valuable trees and also of rice both which were sent in quantities by the little dutch garrison to amboina  the island of buero is a few leagues to the west of manipa and keylan buero the sea round it is of a vast depth from whence the shore rises gradually and surrounds the whole island like a steep wall the mountains seemingly rise to the very sky and in some parts are so lofty as to aspire above the clouds and may sometimes be seen at the distance of twentyeight leagues the circumference of buero is about sixty leagues near the coasts it is extremely well wooded and productive of most of the tropical trees a green ebony and an iron wood is mentioned among them the ground in general is very fertile but like the other islands much subject to earthquakes  the inhabitants are almost black and both sexes go naked excepting when a wrapper covers their waists they were nominally subject to the king of ternate but in    0 the dutch built a fort and compelled all the natives to live about the bay of keyel in fourteen villages neatly built of cane they also compelled them to cut down and burn the woods and turn them into fields gardens and orchards before that time they lived in the most wretched hovels they bemoan their dead relations with great lamentations but after the corpse is buried they make great rejoicings they

that it is found wild in buero only it may possibly be domesticated on some adjacent isles as to those of new guinea the papuan isles and the moluccas i cannot find sufficient authority for their existence in those places mr forest never speaks of this singular animal he gives figures of those of the papuan isles but not the least intimation of their differing from other hogs they are made in their bodies like our common hog and have not the elegant deerlike form given it by nieuhoff they are sometimes kept tame in the indian isles live in herds have a very quick scent feed on herbs and leaves of trees never range gardens like other swine their flesh well tasted when pursued and driven to extremities rush into the sea swim very well and even dive and pass thus from isle to isle in

tidor and batchian had relapsed into mahometanism these three monarchs firmly believe that their ancestors were the wise men of the east who visited our savior at bethlehem and who are so well known

violent wars waged between that prince and the king of ternate which the europeans took advantage of in the time of charles v the portuguese and spaniards fought against each other for the possession of these rich spots and with great animosity the people of ternate sided with the first and those of tidor and gilolo with the latter by the cession of the moluccas to the portuguese by charles these seas were for a time left in peace the dutch next arrived in   0  and made a fruitless attack on the spaniards they even suffered a signal defeat in    0 off this very island their admiral willert was defeated and slain and three capital ships taken by the gallant spaniard don juan de sylva but at length by the assistance of the king of ternate the hollanders made themselves masters of the fort and were received by the monarch of tidor in the most friendly manner the island had been four times most barbarously ravaged by the portuguese and castilians the tidorians naturally considered these new europeans as their deliverers from most inveterate enemies here are twentyfive mosques the chief of which belongs to the sultan as to his temporalities he possesses besides tidor great part of the

mr forest gives p    a regular list of the number formerly furnished exactly proportioned to their size or population as we do at present in the regulation of the militia to be raised in each british county the sum total amounted to  0 00 the naval power was also very considerable and they and the tidorians have had some wellcontested battles with the europeans soon after the arrival of the portuguese they burnt at once all the forests of cloves but they speedily revived with as much vigor as ever the portuguese rendered themselves masters of the island and built a strong fort the natives thrice abandoned their country till at length desperate with the oppressions of strangers in    0 they returned in the night and burnt and destroyed even their own habitations  the dutch on their arrival were received as deliverers but the natives soon discovering that the object of every european was the same they took to arms and had a long and severe contest for independency at length the invaders effected by fraud what might have cost too dear to obtain by violence in      they wisely entered into a league with the king of ternate and the lesser princes as we have before mentioned this treaty has been twice renewed but in order to enforce the observance three strong forts with suitable garrisons are established in ternate and others in the neighboring isles  the sultan resides at ternate in great state sultan but neither he nor the prince of tidor are better than fettered monarchs the dutch pay to him all external respect but at the same time curb him in every commercial attempt if he fits out a proa of any size the dutch must know the place of its destination if bound to any distant parts for cloth or other species of merchandise they immediately say they are happy that they can supply him with better from their own magazines and all is at his service if his majesty continues obstinate they send him a present of the finest callicoes such as they know will be acceptable to his ladies and add bribes to his favorite females who generally divert him from his design if that fails they always obtain leave to send a trusty officer with the vessel for the dutch

the rima or bread fruit i have before mentioned that useful tree the cycas circinalis sago or libby tree which appears first in siam grows in sumatra borneo johor java and mindanao is continued through all the islands and becomes in these countries a vegetable of the first importance for the subsistence of the inhabitants it is as wheat to the europeans mayz to the americans dates to the arabs and rice to the hindoos the use of rice the great food of india ceases either the ground is unfit for the cultivation or the natives are too lazy to sow it when nature offers them a more ready food the sago trees grow in great numbers in every one of these islands it sometimes attains the height of thirty feet and the branches extend twenty the circumference of the stem is as much as a man can embrace the head spreads into leaves like a palm to which genus it bears a great resemblance but linnaeus chooses to fling it among the ferns rumphius who is very diffuse in his account of it places it among the palms under the name of sagu and palma farinaria rumphius i    to    tab     mr forest gives the best account of this most necessary article i shall therefore borrow from him what is to be said on the subject  the sago or libby tree has like the cocoanut tree no distinct bark that peels off and may be defined a long tube of hard wood about two inches thick containing a pulp or pith mixed with many longitudinal fibers the tree being felled it is cut into lengths of about five or six feet a part of the hard wood is then sliced off and the workman coming to the pith cuts across generally with an adze made of hard wood called a neebong the longitudinal fibers and the pith together leaving a part at each end uncut so that when it is excavated there remains a trough into which the pulp is again put mixed with water and beat with a piece of wood then the fibers separated from the pulp float at top and the flour subsides after being cleared in this manner by several waters the pulp is put into cylindrical baskets made of the leaves of the tree and if it is to be kept some time those baskets are generally sunk in fresh water  one tree will produce from two to four hundred weight of flour no wonder then if agriculture be neglected in a country where the labor of five men in felling sago trees beating the flour and instantly baking the bread will maintain a hundred i have often found large species of the sago tree on the seashore drifts from other countries the sago thus steeped in the salt water had always a four disagreeable smell and in this state i dare say the wild hogs would not taste it the leaf of the sago tree makes the best covering for houses of all the palm kind it will last seven years coverings of the nipa or common attop such as they use on the southwest coast of sumatra will not last half the time when sago trees are cut down fresh ones sprout up from the roots the wild hogs frequent the places where sago trees have lately been cut down and the flour or pith has been taken out they there feast and fatten on the remains  we seldom or never see sago in europe but in a granulated state to bring it into this state from the flour it must be first moistened and passed through a sieve into an iron pot very shallow held over a fire which enables it to assume a globular form  thus all our grained sago is half baked and will keep long the pulp or powder of which this is made will also keep long if preserved from the air but if exposed it presently turns sour  the papua oven for this flour is made of earthen ware sago oven it is generally nine inches square and about four deep it is divided into two equal parts by a partition parallel to its sides each of those parts is subdivided into eight or nine about an inch broad tab    so the whole contains two rows of cells about eight or nine in a row the sago bread fresh from the oven eats just like hot rolls bread thus baked will keep i am told several years i have kept it twelve months nor did vermin destroy it in that time  other writers who have treated of this useful tree are kaempfer amoen exot     thunberg fl jap     raii hist pl    0 seb mus i    tab    dampier i

inhabited but much frequented by parties from gilolo for the sake of cutting the trees for the pith the dutch therefore to prevent the smuggling of the spices constantly keep some of the country vessels cruizing between the two islands morty belongs to ternate  we now arrive at the papuan islands papuan islands the group which lies between patany point and new guinea they take their name from the land of papua or new guinea and as low as the island of ceram the names of the principal are waggiou gammon patanta salwatty and myxoal surrounded by others small and of little note unless by being the places where the adventurous forest touched in his voyage in search of the nutmeg trees he had the double hazard of falling into the hands of the dutch or perishing by the fury of the wild natives but the first he fortunately escaped and by his own prudent and conciliating behavior added to his having a crew entirely indian excepting two he sailed not only unmolested but even befriended by these apparent barbarians  the most western of these islands is gibby gibby under the equator to the southeast of patany hook and about six leagues distant its length is four or five leagues its breadth small and its appearance like two hills divided by a low isthmus and full of inhabitants visited by the french the french actuated by the laudable spirit of improving their colonies by the introduction of nutmeg trees made more than one voyage for the procuring that valuable spice the first was in the year      in which the celebrated naturalist m sonnerat and the more celebrated philosopher m le poivre embarked and sailed from the isle of france they studiously concealed the names of the islands they visited and the means they used to accomplish the ends of their mission m sonnerat went a second time in      has published the account of his voyage but has given us only a description of the more curious birds and of the papuans the natives of the isles and of new guinea the french touched at the island of gibby which they call gweby during their stay there they were visited by the rajah or prince of patany the sultan of tidor and even received an embassy from one whom they styled the emperor of salwatty they were most respectfully treated by these potentates and by the friendship of the prince of patany obtained the object of the voyage they carried forty thousand nutmeg trees to the island of bourbon and others were sent to the isle of france another cargo was sent to the isles of sechelles if i recollect right we found on the grenades nutmeg trees when we took those islands which had been planted by the french those which had been transported to the isle of france bore fruit but i believe not to that perfection as they do in their native soil  gag is a small uninhabited island in lat 0    south gag but has the advantage of a safe bay of fresh water and of timber which induces people to touch there syang syang another little isle north of

south of the line in about long     east from greenwich may be mentioned to show the indefatigable industry of our countrymen such are ruib and even or fish isle to the north ruib and to the south is waglol a small flat isle the residence of a synagee waglol or chieftain of the country distinguished by having half his coat and long drawers clouded with red white and yellow the other half with blue white and green the turband was of white calico pinked the clouded part of the dress was hindoostan calico dyed by the natives of the moluccas some of these chieftains are men of most polished manners  tomoguy and the two islands of patang and pally tomoguy form between them the safe harbor of manafuin a straight four miles long with a mud bottom piamis and tamuay are isles of no note salwatty still more south but salwatty the most remote of the papuas and of a considerable size is divided from the coast of new guinea by the narrow straight of galoway it is of a lozenge shape very populous and governed by a rajah in    0 the rajah with more than a hundred of the papuan boats from that island arrou and myxoal made the tour of the isles and sailed up the streights which divide gilolo from batchian the dutch apprehensive of some mischief made their chieftains presents of cloth etc their stay was short for after fishing and hunting a few days they dispersed and went home the rajah excepted who with a few of his people remained behind without offering the least offense the dutch treacherously inveigled him to ternate and even made him a present of a bag of dollars to be laid out in any of the european articles he chose out of their magazines he entered the fort with a few of his men and was immediately informed that he was a prisoner his people instantly gave signs of running a muck to save their master or to sell their own lives dearly the generous rajah whispered to them an order of forbearance and to endeavor their own escape which they effected the prince gave up his cris and was soon transported to the cape to join the miserable exiles on robben island  the dutch might have some cause for their fears it being customary for the papuans of new guinea and salwatty to assemble in great numbers in the months of march and april when the seas are generally smooth and make war on gilolo ceram amboina and as far as aulla bessi in      they plundered the isle of amblou near buero and carried away many of the inhabitants  the papuans the inhabitants of these isles papuan people and of the land of papuas or new guinea and according to mr forest p    the internal parts of the moluccas are a most singular race of men of a horrible appearance and great ferocity brave says m sonnerat lovers of war cruel suspicious and treacherous mr forest saw them frequently but his account of them is brief they behaved to him easy and familiar and even furnished him with fish or such provisions their islands afforded forest conciliated their affection it is highly probable that sonnerat received his accounts from some europeans who had provoked them by their insults they live chiefly on fish or turtle of which they have abundance and neglect every species of agriculture when they want bread they carry live turtle and sausages made of their eggs dried fish etc to the island of waggiou where they exchange them for sago baked or fresh their own isles furnish the trees in quantity but so lazy are they that they very seldom will give themselves the trouble of cutting them down they also bring with them tortoiseshell and suallo which they sell to the chinese whom they find trading in the different islands their wives and children accompany them in these voyages which are performed in boats like those we call punts square at each end and furnished with an outrigger of a single frame they row with very broad oars they take with them their bows arrows and lances and for fishing are provided with a small round net distended at the end of a pole of the same kind as our english landing net add to this two or three foxlooking dogs for the purpose of pursuit by sea or land for the papuans have a most singular water chase which is that of hogs water chase of hogs they follow those animals as they are swimming among the small islands and shoot them with their arrows or transfix them with spears the swine swim in a line and the hindmost hogs rest their snouts on the backs of the preceding mr forest tab xi gives us a representation of this kind of hunting and also of the persons boats and the naval apparatus of these sportsmen they are excellent archers their arrows are often six feet long the bow is generally of slit bamboo and the string of split rattans  the aspect of these people is frightful and hideous form of the papuans the men are stout in body their skin of a shining black rough and often disfigured with marks like those occasioned by the leprosy their eyes are very large their noses flat mouth from ear to ear their lips amazingly thick especially the upper lip their hair woolly either a shining black or fiery red m sonnerat imagines the last to be owing to some powder it is dressed in a vast bush so as to resemble a mop some are three feet in circumference the least two and a half in this they stick their comb consisting of four or five diverging teeth with which they occasionally dress their frizzled locks to give them a greater bulk they sometimes ornament them with feathers of the birds of paradise others add to their deformity by boring their noses and passing through them rings pieces of bone or sticks and many by way of ornament hang round their necks the tusks of boars the heads of the women are of less size than those of the men and in their left ear they wear small brass rings the men go naked excepting a small wrapper round their waists made of the fibers of the coco the women use a covering in general of the coarse surat baftas tucked up behind so as to leave their bodies and thighs exposed to view the children have no sort of clothing  on an isle in lat      women schouten observed that the women were more hideous than the men their face resembled that of a monkey their

king williams island the northern boundary of the new straight or as he names it dampiers straight king williams island is very mountanous and woody and greatly resembling that of patanta dampier visited a small low island off the western part of king williams which he called pigeon isle from its swarming with a species of those birds  the third he named cockle isle cockle isle from the number

is esteemed very good stewed and with the sago bread of these islands may at any time be a sure relief to navigators by reason of the size of these shells it is unsafe to attempt taking them into a small canoe the method of managing them in such circumstances is to put a pole into the gaping shell which instantly closes and holds so fast that it may be drawn up to the surface of the water the fish on being stabbed with a cutlass dies immediately and may be taken out and the shells dropped into the sea m da costa says that sometimes a pair of shells weigh six and even seven hundred pounds mr gmelin lin syst   00 relates that the fish is large enough to feed a hundred and twenty men and that the shells are able to snap a cable in two or to cut off a mans hand the last i can credit possibly the first is an exaggerated proof of their strength  mr born p    from davila informs us that from the ligament of the hinge is made a gem called pavonium by lithologists  north of patanta is

great bays which penetrate deeply into the country the northern side is gently incurvated and bends at each end toward the south the equator passes over the middle of the island the land is very lofty

saying that mr forest met with the utmost hospitality from the natives and from the moodoos land of papuas or chieftains even a species of politeness these islands command a view of the lofty mountains of the land of papuas or new guinea  here the reader may be told that this country was discovered in      when discovered on the day of the epiphany by don alvar de saavedra who sailed from a port in mexico by order of the great ferdinando cortez who was instigated to it by an ecclesiastic of the name of juan darragzaga in order to promote a farther knowledge of the spicy isles he reached the moluccas where he found some remains of the fleet of magellan from tidor he took his departure on his return to mexico and fell in with the papuan isles and the land of papua itself which he called new guinea on the mistaken opinion that it lay in the same meridian circle as the african guinea  the first remarkable place on this part of that vast island is the cape of good hope forest

finely wooded mountains of arfack those of arfack are the most distant from the coast and appear to soar above the rest numbers of fires were seen possibly made by the mountaneers  the shores were planted with coco palms papuan houses and varied with the grotesque inhabitants and their singular habitations built over the water on stages erected on posts far projecting into the bay and constructed exactly like some of the stairs on the river thames a few yards from this is another stage in deeper water on which stands a small more elevated hut the first tenement is the largest and contains fourteen cabins some are lesser seven on a side besides a common hall in the last the women sit some making mats others pots out of the ductile clay which they afterward burn with dry grass or brush wood the women do most of the work they often are seen with an axe preparing the timber for the stages while the men indulge in indolence or preparation for the chase of wild hogs the married people with their families live apart from the batchelors in the greater houses the batchelors in those on the end of the stage such is said to be the case with the battas on sumatra and the moroots on borneo the frontispiece to mr forrests book gives a full idea of these tenements and the surrounding scenery and in tab    is a beautiful view of the entrance with one of those little roundheaded buttonshaped islands covered with wood to the water edge and which characterise the archipelagos of these parts of the indian seas  in the inland part of the country is a race of men called haraforas haraforas who are a sort of gardeners and cultivate the plantanes and some other esculents these they supply the papuas with by a certain tenure for if a papuan presents a harafora with an axe or chopping knife his lands and labor are subject to a tax for ever to the donor if the harafora loses his axe he is still subject to the tax if he breaks or wears it out the papuan must supply him with another or the tax ceases the haraforas wear long hair but are pagans like the papuans they live in trees which they ascend by a long notched pole which they draw after them to prevent surprise  i can give no account of the religious rites of either of these people tombs the papuans form tombs of the rude coral rock mr forest saw one with the wooden figure of a child about eight years old completely dressed a real scull with a wooden head was placed in the upper part  their commerce is chiefly with the chinese commerce from them they purchase their iron tools chopping knives and axes blue and red baftas china beads plates basins etc the chinese carry back misory bark which they get to the eastward of dory at a place called warmasine or warapine it is worth thirty dollars a pecul on java they trade also in slaves ambergris suallo or sea slug tortoiseshell small pearls black loeries large red loeries birds of paradise and many kinds of dead birds which the papuans have a particular way of drying as to the misory bark the chinese carry it to the island of java and sell it to the natives who reduce it to powder and rub their bodies with it as the gentoos on the coromandel coast do with the sandal wood  after this extract let me observe how very prevalent is the infamous trassic in our fellow creatures for it reaches possibly to the remotest part of new guinea the man i mention at p    of this volume engraven by le brun was one of six seized on the coast of new guinea in   0  by the commander of the vink a dutch ship who brought them to batavia where they were treated with great humanity it having been the design of the dutch to send them back to their own country in order to conciliate the affections of the natives the papuans trade in their brother papuans and carry them to any chance customers they may meet with captain forest met with a boat with only four men two of which were slaves for sale each had round his neck a rattan collar with a log of wood cut into the form of a sugar loaf and of five or six pound weight pendant behind these were offered very cheap to the captain but he declined the purchase he seems to have been

say that when the natives observe where they come to drink they poison the water with the cocculi indici which so stupifies them that they are caught readily they love to feed on the fruit of the tshampedeh which they pierce with their bills and extract the kernel the natives preserve them by drawing the entrails and searing the inside with a hot iron after which they put them in the hollow of a bamboo for their security the papuans call them shag or shague they differ from the former in being residentiary birds otherwise i might have been tempted to have joined this and the former as

seas of new guinea as well as the spicy sea have all the pelagic birds of the tropical regions pelagic birds tropic birds besides those which wander within them from the north and from the south tropic birds are here seen hovering at amazing heights or darting on the flying fishes driven out of their element by the pursuit of the bonito albicore and other of their congenial enemies sometimes resting on the water or on the backs of the sleeping tortoises stupidly suffering themselves to be taken by the navigators who happen to pass by they breed in several places within the tropics in the atlantic and pacific oceans both on the ground and in trees along with the frigates and in such numbers that the trees are laden with these picturesque birds in a most singular manner  the frigate birds appear gliding in the air at times at stupendous heights frigate and often making the clouds their place of rest sustaining themselves long motionless on their vast expanse of wing then from a situation so lofty as to render them scarcely visible will by virtue of their penetrating eyes see and dart down on a fish with astonishing rapidity and with their prey as suddenly regain their former aerial situation gulls are often their attendants and dispute the booty with them  petrels of different kinds are seen skimming the surface petrels some are accustomed to snatch the fishes as they pass along others collected in multitudes suddenly dart in concert beneath the water for their food rise again and repeat their exercises in long succession  pelecans pelecans and the duller corvorants keep near to the shores the pelecans are often seen in the air shifting from place to place their snowy color and vast bulk of body and expanse of wing render them astonishing objects they fly like wild geese in wedgeshaped phalanxes and afford a most amusing variety in the animated atmosphere  the finwinged pinguins keep erect on the shore pinguins till compelled by hunger they are driven in search of food into the sea their rapid diving is among the wonders they are seen beneath the transparent waves darting after their prey with all the swiftness of the albicore or bonito  water spouts are phenomenon most frequent in these seas water spouts they appear hanging out of the clouds in a funnel shape the base uppermost but at times assume different forms let me speak to the

water an accident that never has been well proved to have happened dampier who was most conversant in maritime phenomenon of any man in his or perhaps any other time confesses he never knew of any damage done by a water spout except once vol i p          and that appears to have been by the cause and not by the spout itself which fell into the sea near the ship with a vast noise and agitation of the water the mizen mast fore mast and boltsprit were snapped short off but this injury arose entirely from the rage of the whirlwind which formed the spout its first blast blew the ship all along on one side and almost overset her then suddenly whirling round with the same fury very nearly overset her on the contrary side sailors are always full of terrors at the appearance of spouts they discharge cannon into them in order to break and make them fall at a distance but never with effect the experienced dampier concludes with saying that the fright was always the greatest harm  i now resume the element of earth off the harbor of dory extends the island of manaswary it is about five miles in compass and full of trees here captain forest accomplished the end of his mission he found on it abundance of nutmeg trees p       0  and paid five pieces of baftas his promised reward to any person who discovered them the fruit was pendent on the old trees and the young plants growing under their shade he took up above a hundred put them into baskets with earth round them and then hastened on his return to balambangan  captain forest finished his voyage at port mansingham port of mansingham at a very small distance from dory harbor the land from that port recedes deeply to the south and forms a large bay gradually narrowing to the bottom in mr arrowsmiths map the lower part is under the suspicion of being an island it is marked on each side with double dotted lines expressive of streights which opens southerly toward the arrou isles the promontory of dory and geetvinks point are the two horns of this bay long island lies at a small distance to the north of geetvinks point long island schoutens and in lat 0    s is schoutens named in honor of the great circumnavigator who discovered it in      it is about twenty leagues in length high and fertile populous and the inhabitants an active race the coast extends far to the east off it is a succession of small isles several of them volcanic and called by schouten vulcans and by dampier burning isles jamna and moa are other small islands jamna and moa well inhabited and abounding with cocoa nuts and various fruits captain forest gives us two prints representing the natives and their canoes their hair is flatted on the top of the head some decorate it with a feather and others bind a wreath round their temples and head they wear great earrings and bones stuck through their ears and nostrils men women and children go armed with bows and arrows  after proceeding along the coast farther eastward the discoveries of our famous navigator dampier thicken on us an archipelago appears with the crown island that of sir robert rich another long island sir george rookes and several others sir g rooke many of which were active volcanoes  in lat      s dampier discovered a new land to the north divided from new guinea by a straight from six to seven leagues wide each side marked by a lofty cape to one he gave the name of king williams to that on the north side cape anne and within each was a very high mountain sloping gradually to the sea the mountains and lower lands finely clothed with trees intermixed with beautiful savannas of the most flourishing verdure new britain this northern land he named new britain  we will follow his track as far as will prove it to be an island or possibly more than one let me observe that dampiers approach was the reverse from that which we now take in lat    0 south he put into a bay named by him port montagu port montagu the country was mountanous wooded full of rich valleys and pleasant streams of fresh water the trees were of various kinds some in flower others bore berries and others large fruits and cocoa palms in abundance but the nuts were small here were also yams and other good esculent roots and ginger the quadrupeds were hogs and dogs possibly it was from hence that the south sea isles were stocked with those animals being the nearest place they could be supplied from among the birds were parrots cockatoos pigeons crows and abundance of other species there was also fish in plenty how unfortunate were our convicts that this rich island was not thought of as the place of their involuntary retreat  a very little to the north of montagu bay was discovered in      another straight of small breadth but which severs new britain into two islands leaving the northern the largest it was not dampiers fortune to discover it he passed it by and in lat      south cape orford saw a headland he named cape orford the country continued very mountanous full of people the men armed with lances their head gay with feathers the women had no sort of ornaments and nothing to hide their nakedness except a bunch of green leaves behind and before there were tame hogs in great abundance which ran about near the hovels of the natives  within cape orford was an inlet which dampier supposing to be a great bay named by him that of st george and a cape on the northern side in lat   south long        east correspondent to cape orford cape st george he called cape st george these two headlands proved the distinguishing mark of the entrance into a straight which divided new britain into a second island this discovery was made by that able officer captain carteret september  th      on his disastrous return from the south seas when he got into st georges bay he found so strong a current to the northwest that he could not return to pursue dampiers track captain carteret soon after he doubled cape st george met with several islands in the southern side of the streights the nearest about three leagues from the cape he named walliss which lay before an harbor he called gowers walliss isle the island was lofty well wooded and inhabited farther on were two coves with fresh water rivers falling into their bottom about four leagues from walliss isle still to the west was a good harbor on which was bestowed the respectable name of the discoverer across it lay cocoanut isle on this coast were trees of enormous growth all the kinds of palms the betel tree aloes bamboos rattans a fruit the sailors call a jamaica plumb and probably many of the tropical fruits and plants he also found the nutmeg tree in plenty possibly this place is its most remote situation to the north  the country abounded with land birds seemingly the same with those of new britain among them was a large black bird that made a noise like the barking of a dog which i suppose to have been a buceros  mr carteret pursued his own discovery and sailed directly westward new ireland he gave the name of new ireland to the island on the northern side and distinguished three capes on the southern by the names of buller palliser and stephens cape stephens between cape palliser and cape stephens is an island to which mr carteret gave the name of the duke of yorks quite level deliciously clothed with lofty woods in the inland parts and near the shore planted with cocoa groves intermixed with the houses of the islanders  to the east of cape stephens is in midchannel an isle he called the isle of man cape stephens is the supposed most extreme western point of new britain all that side as far as cape gloucester still remains undiscovered a little to the south of cape stephens are three singular hills the mother and daughters and behind them a vast volume of smoke arose out of one of the numerous volcanic hills of the country the land like the rest of new britain was very lofty and wooded with many clear spots the signs of plantations and frequent fires the marks of inhabitants the general breadth of these streights are about fifteen leagues hawksworth iii      no bottom was found with a line of a hundred and forty fathoms captain carteret modestly declined giving his own name to this important discovery but called it st georges channel st georges channel the streights properly end at cape stephens as soon as that promontory is passed there is one expanse of sea probably quite to new guinea but the name of st georges channel is continued along the shores of new ireland to its western extremity where it is broken into a smaller isle named by our navigator hanover and the extreme point in lat      south long        east queen charlottes foreland the approach to it is through a narrow passage between an isle called sandwich and new ireland the land of hanover isle is high finely covered with trees mixed with plantations exhibiting a most beautiful landscape  the whole length of st georges channel length of from cape st george to queen charlottes foreland is three hundred miles that of new ireland from cape st george to cape biron the western extremity is two hundred and forty miles cape biron is possibly the same with that we see in dampiers map under the name of cape solomaswar as to the form of new ireland it is extremely narrow the whole way the greatest part runs northwest but toward the east end reverts and bends like a hook to the south terminating in cape st george  beyond these was a group of small isles mr carteret named the admiralty in lat      south long        east by the views of them they appear less elevated than hanover isle and we may collect from the multitudes of canoes that sallied out to attack our commander that they must be very populous they were manned with people nearly black with woolly heads the natives were very hostile natives and flung with great force lances headed with flint they chewed betel went quite naked but their bodies were ornamented with shells their faces streaked with white and their heads as finely powdered with white powder as an english beau ready for a bal pare one of their canoes apparently the least was taken yet it measured full fifty feet in length in it were specimens of their arts such as earthen pots in which they dressed their victuals and a quantity of matting which served for sails and awnings there were besides cocoa nuts and other fruits unknown to our people  some of the canoes of new ireland were ninety feet long canoes formed out of a single tree a proof of the vigorous growth of timber in this country they were manned by three and thirty men black and woolly headed but they had not the thick lip or flat nose in ornaments and powdering they resembled the former some had cocks feathers in their heads a proof that they did not want poultry they had lances by way of arms and cordage and fishing nets very skilfully manufactured all this country is probably well inhabited and very fertile in trees and fruits the sea abounding in turtle and fish the very distressed state of captain carteret and his crew is the sad but true apology for our wanting from his able pen a fuller account of this interesting island  on july  th      m bougainville anchored in the same bay as captain carteret did and named it port praslin he observed here the pepper plant and found wild hogs numbers of birds and among others the great crowned pigeon variety of snakes scorpions and the singular insect the walking leaf  among the serpents was the sea snake of that species which at p     is suspected to have been poisonous this was verified here a sailor was bitten as he was hawling the seine he was very soon affected with violent pains all over his body his side the part on which he received the wound became livid and swelled greatly the blood taken from him appeared dissolved he suffered much for five or six hours at length by the assistance of the venice treacle or theriaca andromachi with flower de luce water he fell into a violent perspiration and was quite cured bougainvilles voyage translation p      the natives of otaheite assert that the bite is mortal  dampier coasted the whole northern side captain carteret in his approach to the eastern end fell in with a group of little isles to which he gave the name of the nine isles he passed between two larger the more southern he called lord ansons the more northern sir charles hardys in lat    0 south was flat verdant and appeared well inhabited he soon after saw st johns isle st johns island etc discovered by schouten and seen by dampier it is nine or ten leagues round rises into high hummocks full of lofty trees with plantations and groves near the shores and seemingly very populous we now fall in with dampier with cape st marys in lat     south the country was mountanous high and wooded with many points of land running into the sea forming between them as many fine bays here a man of large size approached the ship and spoke a language different from those dampier had before seen proceeding northwestward the whole extent of new ireland or the coast opposite to st georges channel afterward traced by captain carteret appears before us at some distance from it is a chain of isles of which st johns may be deemed one they had been all named by the dutch antony caves is lofty gerard denniss gerard denniss is the next fourteen or fifteen leagues in circumference high wooded and mountanous thick set with plantations and full of cocoa trees the shape was irregular full of points forming sandy bays the ground cleared for plantations and the soil of a brownish red color the next island named wisharts wisharts resembled the preceding dampier also discovered two other islands somewhat farther to the west one ten leagues long he named mathias like many others mountanous and woody mixed with savannas and cleared land and near that a low and plain island clothed with tall and large trees as close to each other as they could stand this he called the squally from the violent gales he met with off the coast  in respect to the north shore of new ireland i find that our navigator attempted to touch at only one place which he named slingers bay this country seems prodigiously populous slingers bay his ship was surrounded with prows filled with men who assaulted him with stones flung out of engines and the shores were lined with the natives from end to end natives all the inhabitants of this and the adjacent isles were a warlike race hostile to strangers and very suspicious they were tall even above the size of the common race of men strong and well made had curled short hair often shaved in different forms and stained with white red and yellow their heads were round faces broad they had great bottle noses and substances stuck through the gristle passing from cheek to cheek their weapons were lances swords slings and bows and arrows their speech clear and distinct all these are the same kind of people from the remotest of the papuan isles to this island varying a little in the dressing of their hair and other trifling matters  their prows were very neatly built prows with outriggers on one side the head and stern elevated and most ingeniously carved with figures of fish fowl and on one was a mans head done most surprisingly well considering the rude instruments of stone they had to work with for they seemed ignorant of the uses of iron their paddles were very neat and they made their way with amazing swiftness through the water  a very legendary tale is told in lhistoire de navigations aux terres australes p      respecting the origin of the negro race in these asiatic isles which is first met with in some of the manillas continued through the papuan isles and new guinea and even through new holland i have mentioned them before in my account of the manillas and if i recollect right one of these islands is called the isle of negroes from its being inhabited by a curled headed people  i now return from cape biron or solomaswar taking a course due south along the western coasts of the isles of new britain near the extreme western part of the farthest is an headland called by dampier cape gloucester at a small distance to the west is a little island which at the time our navigator passed it was a raging volcano it flung up columns of flame twenty or thirty yards high attended with a noise like thunder followed by an overflowing of redhot lava which ran down the sides of the mountain till it reached the sea this continued two days and nights or as long as this tremendous phenomenon continued in sight  i now repass dampiers streights eastward and turn to the south in mr arrowsmiths excellent map of the world new guinea is continued by dotted lines farther to the east and on the south side near the extremity of that line the uncertainty is taken away by a tract of land discovered by m de bougainville in      which he named la louisiade and the extreme eastern point le cap de la deliverance in memory of his narrow escape from a violent tempest the great bay which he calls le golfe de la louisiade is just to the south of the cape such a confusion occasioned by the fears and distresses of the great french navigator is so apparent in this part of his voyage that nothing more can be collected respecting this portion of new guinea  we must therefore steer along another dotted line till we arrive at prince of waless islands prince of waless isles lat  0    south long     east the largest is long and narrow and lies parallel with the coast this part of the sea between new guinea and new holland is called torress streights torress streights for having been passed in   0  by don baes de torres admiral under fernandez quiros correspondent to them beyond another set of islands named also the prince of waless is the endeavor straight passed as i have before mentioned by our boasted cook  in proceeding along the coasts i find names of places but nothing more captain cook on his quitting the coast of new holland crossed the intervening water and touched in lat      at a place on this side of new guinea to which he has neither left a name nor yet even the mark of landing in his chart we are told that it lay sixtyfive leagues to the northeast of waelche cape the country was low but covered with such a luxuriancy of wood and herbage as scarcely can be conceived and among them such numbers of aromatic trees as perfumed the air even at a distance from shore the natives were hostile went quite naked and had much the appearance of the new hollanders they shouted defiance and from a short stick or hollow cane they swung in their hands firearms was emitted flashes of fire exactly like the effect of gunpowder these explosions were innocent nor could our navigators ever learn the cause after each explosion which was done by a single man his companions flung their bearded darts all that we learn farther of this country is that it produced sine cocoanuts plantanes and bread fruit  cape waelche or walsh the most western point of this coast cape waelche lies in lat      south long     east from hence the land runs strait inclining to the northeast when it takes another turn toward the northwest the space between the trendings is occupied by the tract marked in mr arrowsmiths map as pervious by two streights the arrou isles lie transverse at some distance from this part of new guinea  farther to the northwest nearly parallel to the end of ceram is freshwater bay in lat      south this was visited by dampier in      the country was wooded and mountanous like the other parts of new guinea and the trees of great size here his people killed one of those magnificent pigeons called the crowned the bay received its name from the plenty of fresh water and another a little farther north was called mackerel bay from the great quantity of that fish mackerel bay or one resembling it which was taken there  opposite to this bay in lat      south is pulo sabuda pulo sabuda a lofty island about three leagues long and two broad not far from the coast of new guinea it is in general rocky but so mixed with rich yellow and black soil as to be productive of many of the tropical fruits and trees the sago tree and the jacca are found there the natives gave dampier two or three nutmegs seemingly fresh gathered but he could not tell whether they were the produce of the isle or of new guinea the inhabitants do not seem to be aboriginal they are tawny have long black hair and differ little from the mindanayans and the people of the other eastern isles the women wear a callico covering the men go almost naked and are very skilful in striking fish they have great boats in which they often visit new guinea where they procure slaves beautiful parrots etc which they carry to goram and exchange for callicoes they keep many of the poor papuans for their own use to do the laborious work this island has the same birds as the main land and bats of an enormous size  i cannot quit this part of the coast without mentioning a singular communication made to captain forest p     by the natives of essbe in the island of mixoal that on the coast of new guinca not far from a gulf about a days sail from wanim or onin a place about twenty leagues from the northeast of the isle of goram was a set of people who wore large turbans he imagines them to have been the posterity of a colony of arabs arabs if this is true their discovery will be just as important to the world as that of the race of owen gwynedd long lost to the britons till it has been lately credited that they still exist in america under the title of padoucas or welsh indians  that the western side of new guinea probably all parts plenty of nutmegs if properly examined abound with nutmeg trees is very certain a portuguese ship which was forced by a storm from its anchorage at timor was driven to this coast and there anchored in order to repair the damage she had received the captain during the interval procured a sufficient loading of nutmegs with which he sailed directly to macao and sold them without ever returning to his former place of destination  from mackerel bay the coast trends to the northwest as far as the streights of galowa and salwatty island from thence it turns to the northeast terminating at the cape of good hope thus have i performed the circuit of the great island and concluded this the last great labor of my life  downing october         flora indica monandria
