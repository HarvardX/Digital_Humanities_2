praefatio london printed for t cadell in the strand mdcclxxxv  an essay on old maids part v on christian and other modern old maids chap i on saint gregory of nyssa and his panegyric on virginity i return from the chaste and pious poets to the prosaic encomiasts of virginity on examining the ecclesiastical writers who have merited this title i find they are such a host that i fear the attention of my reader would desert me if i attempted to enumerate and describe them i shall now therefore confine myself to four succeeding fathers of the church who are entitled to our regard by the highest reputation for sanctity and eloquence and from these i shall only select as briefly as i can such passages as seem to throw a particular light on the sisterhood and are at the same time remarkable for strength and originality either of thought or expression  the first of the four is st gregory of nyssa a younger brother of the great st basil and a friend and correspondent of the poetical st gregory who formed the principal subject of our last chapter the st gregory of whom i am now to speak was ordained bishop of nyssa in cappadocia by his brother st basil in     in     he preached the funeral sermon of the empress placilla and by a late writer he is said to have died in     with the venerable title of father of he fathers  the panegyric which this saint composed on virginity is the more remarkable as we have positive evidence that he was himself a married man this circumstance however is very far from having rendered him a languid advocate for the excellence of a single life on the contrary he begins his encomium by declaring that whoever ambitiously hopes to bestow such praise on virginity as is adequate to its merit resembles a person who foolishly supposes that he may increase the magnitude of the ocean by a drop of his own sweat  sanct greg nyss de virginitate op tom ii p     edit par        the sisterhood will i hope excuse in their holy advocate the indelicacy of this expression for the flattering energy of the sentiment  but to proceed with st gregory  having asserted the dignity of this celestial excellence he laments his own grovelling condition in being precluded by marriage from a share of this glory a knowledge of the charms that belong to celibacy is to me says st gregory what food is to the ox when turned to a full rack he is prevented from reaching it by his harness  having forcibly described his own mortifications by this striking image he enlarges on the various evils that arise trom matrimony which he considers as a great source not only of unhappiness but of guilt  look says he at the passing scene  marriage is the general prologue to all the tragedies of life  after painting the conjugal state in the most gloomy colors he delineates with a brilliant pencil the pure delights of virginity which he represents as a certain art and power of eluding all the vexations of earth and attaining even on this side the grave the beatitude of heaven  having declaimed against wedlock with much freedom or rather contempt and scorn the saint seems to apprehend that his zeal for chastity has carried him too far and he makes the following remarkable apology  let no one says he imagine that i intend to censure the establishment of marriage for i am aware that it has not wanted the approbation of god but since nature sufficiently instigates mankind to people the world by this connection it would be superfluous labor to compose an encomium on marriage which finds in the alluring voice of pleasure an eternal advocate and patron while virginity is in some measure the antagonist of nature  s greg nyss p      my sentiments on matrimony continues the saint are these  we ought to prefer to it the care of our celestial interest and yet not to despise the person who makes a wise and temperate use of this institution  though the saint in the preceding sentence has consulted his own personal credit as a married man he very heartily proceeds to declare that although marriage may be regarded as a kind of safe port against the tempests of licentious passion yet virginity affords a securer refuge and a more tranquil harbor  he contends that man as originally created was perfectly free from all animal desires and instead of receiving pleasure from the gratification of sensual appetite delighted only in the contemplation of his maker he alleges it is evident from scripture see genesis chap iv  that adam had no connubial intercourse with eve till after their expulsion from paradise when woman was condemned to the pains of childbirth as a punishment for disobedience therefore continues the saint as we lost paradise by the sensual offense of our first parents it is in our own power to regain it by a voluntary sacrifice of all sensual pleasures as the persons who have wandered from their own country and wish to return to it begin by quitting the place to which they have strayed in the same manner since marriage was the last step which completed our separation from paradise i would advise those who are ambitious of returning thither to begin by relinquishing marriage the last stage   as it were in the road between earth and heaven  st gregory proceeds to prove the dominion of virginity over death which he accomplishes by a singular mode of reasoning  the production of children says he does not minister so much to life as to death since their birth only leads to their dissolution but they who devote their persons to virginity place themselves as a kind of isthmus between life and death to stop the fury of the latter the devastation of death is thus prevented for as the power of fire cannot subsist without fuel so the force of death cannot prevail unless marriage supplies him with his prey  the saint now enters on a more minute description of virginity which does not he says consist merely in personal purity but in discharging all the duties of a tranquil and spotless mind he borrows on this occasion from his brother st basil the remarkable simile which i have already mentioned of the successive circles produced in water by the impulse of a single stone an image which he uses to illustrate the agitation produced in a peaceful mind by the admission of any one inordinate desire  let virginity says the saint be the foundation on which the works of virtue are raised for excellent and honorable as it is if this purity of person is not united to integrity of mind  if the whole life of a virgin does not correspond to this professed excellence  if she is blackened by incontinence of spirit  her virginity is but an earring in the nose of a sow or a pearl trodden under the feet of swine  sanct greg nyss p       i must not omit the whimsical conceit with which st gregory asserts the honor of miriam the sister of aaron as the primitive model of true virginity having described her dancing with a timbrel in her hand after the miraculous passage through the red sea he imagines that this musical instrument is mentioned in scripture as a symbol of her chastity on account of the similarity which he discovers between virginity and the timbrel  a wonderful similarity which gregory has explained in language that i forbear to copy lest the chaste eyes of the modern sisterhood should be shocked by the expressive images of this fanciful saint  in a former part of my work i had occasion to remark that miriam was not entitled to this distinction as she in all probability was a married woman the genius and talents of this fair hebrew seem indeed to have operated like those of a modern fine lady who eclipsing her husband by the brilliancy of her spirit reduces him to such insignificance that he is rarely mentioned  but to conclude this brief account of st gregory in the subsequent part of his discourse he endeavors to settle the just medium between luxury and extreme abstinence as he is far from being a friend to that rigorous discipline by which the health of many a monastic recluse has been destroyed the twentyfourth and last chapter of his treatise is very remarkable for instead of declaiming like most of the fathers against the depravity of the times he speaks of his own age as abounding in good examples  sanctity says he is now if ever in so flourishing a state that it wants but little to reach the summit of perfection  he concludes by recommending it to those who wish to lead a virgin life to put themselves under the guidance of an experienced and venerable conductor  chap ii on st ambrose and his several compositions in praise of virginity the latin fathers of the church were by no means inferior to the greek in the zealous veneration which they paid to virginity the chaste devotees of italy found an ardent indefatigable advocate and patron in the celebrated st ambrose who was unexpectedly raised by the voice of the people from a civil station to the rank of an archbishop and having filled the episcopal throne of milan about twenty years ended his active and glorious life in that city at the age of    in the year      this eminent writer devoted several distinct performances to the consecrated virgins there are three of his productions that particularly claim our attention and of these i shall speak as they occur  the first and most elaborate is a treatise on virgins divided into three books and addressed to his sister marcellina who hearing that he had preached with singular eloquence on this interesting topic and being unable to attend his public discourses requested from her brother the particulars of his doctrine  saint ambrose begins his treatise with singular humility in comparing himself to the speaking ass of balaam he then takes occasion from the festival of st agnes to celebrate the excellence of that virgin martyr a roman damsel distinguished by her rank and beauty who with miraculous fortitude at the age of thirteen preferred the tortures of persecution to the rich offers of a pagan lover and perished by the sword in the beginning of the fourth century it may be worth remarking that the merits of this infant martyr have given rise to many the most spirited of pious panegyrics and that her name has been extolled by a succession of bishops saints and poets from the vehement ambrose to the tender and elegant massllon bishop of clermont whose works contain a most beautiful and pathetic sermon on the festival of this lovely martyr  from the praise of agnes st ambrose proceeds to a general encomium on chastity which was unknown he says or imperfectly preserved through all the nations of the heathen world  but how says the saint very heartily can the human understanding comprehend what nature has not included in her laws quis autem humano eam possit ingenio comprehendere quam nec natura suis inclusit legibus divi ambrosii de virginibus lib     he then endeavors to prove that celibacy is an institution of god and heaven the true country of virgins he expressly asserts that the preservation of chastity makes an angel and the loss of it a devil qui eam servavit angelus est qui perdidit diabolus  he compares the condition of the wife condemned to the pains of childbirth with the happy freedom of the consecrated maiden he makes a very subtle and powerful address to parents persuading them to atone for their own offenses by the early consecration of their virgin daughters an exhortation which must have contributed very cruelly to increase the number of wretched and involuntary old maids as many superstitious and selfish parents were undoubtedly ready to make their own peace with heaven at the expense of their unfortunate offspring  saint ambrose mentions with exultation the swarms of pious damsels that hastened to receive the veil from his hand not only from the neighboring cities of italy but from the distant regions of mauritania he exhorts the young virgins to disregard all domestic impediments to their religious desires and to embrace a monastic life in express opposition to the authority of their parents he endeavors to justify this bold advice by a remarkable anecdote which concludes the first division of his treatise and which i shall copy to render my fair readers acquainted with the singular style of this saint  if you believe not the words of heaven cries ambrose yet believe examples in our memory a damsel once noble by her worldly rank and now more ennobled by her attachment to god being urged to marriage by her parents and relations fled for refuge to the altar and where can a virgin seek a better asylum than that holy spot where the sacrifice of virginity is presented but even here she was troubled with impious importunity she stood by the altar of god as the offering of modesty as the victim of continence why are you so anxious for my nuptials she exclaimed to her relations  i am betrothed already you offer me a husband but i have found a better exaggerate the riches boast the nobility proclaim the power of the party you propose i have chosen him to whom no one can be compared rich in the world powerful in dominion preeminent in heaven if you have such to offer i do not refuse the option but if you find not such your conduct toward me is rather envious than provident  one of her relations observing the rest were silenced abruptly said what if your father were living would he suffer you to remain unmarried  the virgin answered with new religious fervor and more temperate piety on this account perhaps he died that he might not prove an impediment to the sanctity of his daughter  this reply concerning her father proved a kind of prophecy to her relation as he also expired soon after it and the virgin succeeded in her holy purpose observe ye maidens this reward of devotion beware ye parents of a similar offense  saint ambrose having thus magnified the excellence of virginity in the first division of his discourse proposes in the second to instruct the young virgin in the particulars of her duty and to guard himself from the imputation of arrogance he offers to his fair disciples not a collection of severe precepts but of splendid examples having exhorted them to imitate the humility of the virgin mary and the fortitude of the martyr thecla he relates a recent instance of female chastity and resolution in the interesting adventures that befell a young and beautiful virgin of antioch who on her refusal to worship the pagan divinities was dragged into a public brothel where her chastity was exposed to the most imminent danger but was happily preserved by the fervor of her eloquence and the sincerity of her virtue she made a convert and a friend of the heathen soldier who had taken an active part in the outrage she endured and inspired her persecutor with such pity and esteem that he attempted at the hazard of his own life to preserve the purity which he had designed to violate by an exchange of dress he contrived the escape of the virgin but was himself condemned to die for the pious deception the heroic virgin bravely rushed from her concealment to intercept the fate of her generous deliverer they mutually contended for the glory of dying for each other their religious heroism was derided by the barbarity of persecution and the only indulgence they obtained was that of perishing together  it is remarkable that this pathetic little story has employed the pen of a famous french poet and of an english philosopher of equal eminence the theodore of corneille as he informs us himself was founded on this anecdote related by st ambrose and among the juvenile works of our great boil we find the martyrdom of theodora and didymus but the tragedy of the sublime poet and the narrative of the benevolent philosopher are both sunk into similar neglect a circumstance sufficiently accounted for by a lively remark of voltaire who observes very justly on this play of corneille that he chose the subject because he had more genius than taste an observation perhaps as applicable to the english philosopher as to the french poet and certainly still more applicable to the latin saint for ambrose has related these adventures in a quaint and conceited style full of indecency and affectation i have therefore declined a translation of the passage from the persuasion that my readers would be more entertained by a shorter and more simple recital of this affecting story i shall add to it the curious remarks which corneille has made on st ambrose to console himself for the ill success of his tragedy   certes il y a de quoi congratuler a la purete de notre theater de voir quune histoire qui fait le plus bell ornement du second livre des vierges de saint ambroise se trouve trop licentieuse pour y etre supportee queuton dit si comme ce grand docteur de leglise jeusse fait voir theodore dans le lieu infame fi jeusse decrit les diverses agitations de son ame durant quelle y fut fi jeusse figure les troubles quelle y ressentit an premier moment quelle y vit entrer didyme cest ladessus que ce grand saint fait triompher son eloquence and cest pour ce spectacle quil invite particulierement les vierges a ouvrir les yeux corneille edit de voltaire tom iii p     certainly says this great though unequal poet we may congratulate ourselves on the purity of our theater in seeing that a story which forms the most beautiful ornament in st ambroses second book upon virgins is found too licentious to be endured what would they have said if like that great doctor of the church i had exhibited theodora in a house of infamy if i had described the various agitations of her soul while she remained in that scene if i had expressed the trouble that she felt in the moment when she saw didymus enter it is here that this great saint displays the triumph of his eloquence it is for this spectacle that he particularly invites the virgins to open their eyes  such are the reflections of corneille in the epistle dedicatory to his unfortunate theodora and doubtless it was a consolation to the poet in his recent disgrace to recollect that he was infinitely more delicate than the canonized archbishop of milan  in truth the ancient fathers of the church were so free in their anecdotes and expressions that in giving the most guarded account of their discourses i am not without fear of sometimes offending my more dainty readers but if that misfortune should happen to me i earnestly conjure them to let their censure fall not on the humble undignified author of this essay but on those high and hallowed prelates whose compositions on this nice topic i thought myself obliged to review i would not willingly admit into this chaste work a single expression that could force even the prudes to blush but if those ladies of nice imagination should ever find me betrayed into such an offense i entreat them instead of censuring me to congratulate themselves on the happy refinement of the times in which it is impossible to transcribe the compositions of many a saint without incurring the charge of indelicacy  the third book of st ambrose opens with a recital of many pious precepts delivered to marcellina the sister of our saint by the pope liberius on the day when she received the veil from his hands the points which the pontiff particularly recommended were temperance and taciturnity the latter is perpetually enjoined by the fathers as one of the capital perfections in a consecrated virgin st ambrose pays his sister the compliment of acknowledging that her virtue had not only equalled but even exceeded the discipline of liberius and specifies her great merit in the articles of abstinence and prayer yet notwithstanding the extreme sanctity of her character he presents to her a long admonition concerning the dangers that attend the gaiety of nuptial entertainments and the wanton enormity of dancing he then answers a question of marcellinas on a very delicate topic whether the religion which forbids selfdestruction allows the virgin to destroy her own life for the preservation of her faith and her virginity st ambrose decides the point by the example of pelagia a virgin of antioch who at the age of fifteen threw herself into a river to escape from licentious persecution the particulars of pelagias death are singularly striking and the flourishes of st ambrose in relating her story not less so the spirit of this young martyr induced her virgin sisters and even her mother to share her fate st ambrose describes this heroic family advancing hand in hand to the brink of a torrent with their persecutors behind them and he makes these undaunted females address the river in the following expressions  behold the water who forbids us to be baptized let the water receive us which is the source of regeneration  let the water receive us by which virgins are made  let the water receive us which opens heaven closes hell hides death and produces martyrs ecce aqua quis nos baptizari prohibet excipiat nos aqua quae regenerare consuevit  excipiat nos aqua quae virgins facit  excipiat nos aqua quae coelum aperit inferos tegit mortem abscondit martyrs reddit   the saint relates that they added to this address a short prayer for the decent preservation of their bodies after which says he unbinding their garments so as to guard their modesty and yet leave their steps free and then joining hands as if to lead a dance they plunged together into the deepest part of the flood incincto finu quo pudorem tegerent nec gressum impedirent consertis manibus tanquam choros ducerent in medium progrediuntur alveum ubi unda torrentior ubi profundum abruptius illo vestigia dirigentes divi ambrosii de virg lib iii   besides the example of pelagia st ambrose reminds his sister of the resolution displayed by a chaste female of their own family who perished he says in the severest tortures without a groan or a tear  in the close of his elaborate treatise st ambrose enters into a long and very warm vindication of his own conduct he had been accused it seems and certainly with justice of alluring young maidens to relinquish the natural idea of settling themselves in marriage and to take the monastic vow instead of denying he glories in the charge can that conduct exclaims the saint be considered as a crime in me which has always reflected honor on the priesthood to sow the seeds of perfection and promote an attachment to virginity  he then proceeds to examine whether his doctrine can be censured either as dishonest or new or unprofitable and his reasoning on these three points is highly curious  if you call it dishonest says the saint you must also apply that appellation to the life of the angels for they neither marry nor are given in marriage can it be condemned as a novelty i consent to abjure all things as novelties which are not taught us by christ but does he not deliver the same doctrine when he says there are eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven matthew chap xix  virginity is therefore sanctified by a celestial voice and recommended by the precepts of our lord  but since we have thus proved that the doctrine of continence is neither dishonest nor new let us enquire if it can be reckoned unprofitable i have heard many people exclaim that the world is perishing  that the human race will become extinct  that wedlock is ruined i only ask in reply did ever any man seek a wife without being able to find one  if any one thinks that the human race will be diminished by the consecration of virgins let him consider that where there are few virgins there are fewer men where the devotion to virginity is frequent there the number of men is much greater observe what multitudes are annually admitted to the veil in the churches of the east and of africa the men born in this country are fewer than the virgins that are consecrated there discite quantas alexandrina totiusque orientis et africana ecclesia quotannis sacrare consueverint pauciores hic homines prodeunt quam illic virgins consecrantur divi ambros de virg lib iii   with the citation of this curious fact i shall close my account of st ambroses larger treatise on virgins as the residue of that work consists only of passages from scripture very whimsically united  the second composition of our illustrious saint on this interesting topic is entitled an exhortation to virgins it was written as a compliment to juliana an opulent widow who having devoted her whole family consisting of a son and three daughters to a religious life employed her fortune in building a church at florence which she requested st ambrose to consecrate upon this ceremony the saint introduces juliana in his discourse extolling to her children the excellence of virginity in opposition to marriage he makes her declare that although she had a good husband she laments that she was ever married and that nothing can console her for having forfeited in her own person the grace of virginity but the hope of proving the mother of holy virgins but the most remarkable passage in this singular work is a very whimsical pun st ambrose deriving the word nubere to marry from nubes a cloud pursues his conceit with great solemnity and gravely demonstrates the similitude between a married woman and a heavy exhalation et vere graves nubes quae sustinent sarcinam matrimonii nam etiam gravari alvo feruntur cum semina conceptionis acceperint divi ambrosii ad virg exhortatio p  0  edit basil  the discourse contains many sentiments and precepts exactly similar to those of the preceding treatise and concludes with an encomium on the piety of juliana  the third work which st ambrose devoted to the holy sisterhood has two different titles being sometimes called the institution of a virgin and sometimes a discourse on the perpetual virginity of the virgin mary which st ambrose very zealously supported against bonosus a bishop condemned by the council of capua for the opposite opinion the saint alleges six arguments in favor of the point which he intends to prove but as the catholic critics justly observe that some of these arguments have more wit than solidity i shall decline an account of them from a reverence to the hallowed personage of whom they speak  chap iii on st chrysostom and his panegyric on virginity if the pious virgins of italy had reason to admire the zeal which the holy ambrose displayed in their behalf those of constantinople enjoyed a patron and pastor yet more admirable in the famous st chrysostom who equalled the archbishop of milan in his enthusiastic veneration for celibacy with the insinuating advantage of a superior eloquence this talent from which he received the appellation of chrysostom or the golden mouth had raised him from the condition of a sequestered monk to preside over the clergy of the eastern empire but his elevation though propitious to his glory was fatal to his peace the austerity of a hermit was ill suited to the manners of a corrupt metropolis the inflexible prelate engaged in a dangerous quarrel with the empress eudoxia and after sustaining his episcopal office nine years under the vicissitudes of triumph and disgrace he expired in  0  at the age of sixty and in the midst of hardships inflicted on him as a persecuted exile  i have already had occasion to quote some passages from this accomplished saint in speaking of the unorthodox cohabitation of priests and virgins a licentious or at least an offensive custom which chrysostom had the honor of suppressing by his eloquent invectives in these we have seen that the holy father bestowed on virginity the most magnificent praise but i am yet to give an account of a long and regular panegyric which he composed expressly on this favorite topic  he opens this elaborate treatise with a severe condemnation of all heretical virgins whom he sinks to a condition below that of the christian adulteress he uncharitably represents the pagan old maid as an immediate minister of the devil nay he will not allow that she could be a virgin for although her person was pure yet her soul the more important part was corrupted  and what cries the animated saint what is the advantage if the temple be demolished that the vestibule stands entire  he proceeds with great subtlety to show that he who condemns marriage diminishes the glory of true virginity and that he who praises wedlock does the highest honor to celibacy for that which is considered as good on a comparison with evil may be not eminently good but that which is better than a blessing of universal estimation must be supremely excellent and in this light continues the saint we recommend virginity matrimony is good and on this account virginity is mavelous because it is better than good  sanct chrysostom tom iv p     edit par  and if you wish it i will inform you how far it is better as much as heaven is better than earth and angels than men  in this comparison st chrysostom only echoes the sentiment and expression which we have already seen in more than one of his predecessors but this eloquent encomiast of virginity was of a spirit too animated to content himself with a servile repetition and we accordingly find him pursuing this idea with address and vigor peculiar to himself  after saying that virginity is as much superior to wedlock as angels are to men he exclaims or to speak with just energy yet more for the angels if they neither marry nor are given in marriage are not compounded of flesh and blood they have no settlement on earth they feel not the perturbations of desire they neither hunger nor thirst they have no organs which can be softened by music or fascinated by beauty but as the meridian sky where no clouds are collected appears pure so their nature unclouded by mortal passions must of necessity be clear and lucid  the saint proceeds to show that virgins under the disadvantage of mortality engage in a successful competition with these celestial spirits and equal them in purity and perfection  but this he exclaims with indignation this touches not you ye worldlings who waste this lovely treasure  the portion of the unprofitable servant is reserved for you but to the virgins of the church many and great rewards shall be allotted such as neither eye nor ear can perceive nor human understanding comprehend  he then attempts to refute the objections which have been urged against celibacy by affirming that marriage is by no means necessary for the preservation and continuance of the human race and as a proof of this he asserts what other saints have also maintained that adam had no connubial intercourse with eve till after their expulsion from paradise  he goes yet farther and affirms it is not virginity but sin that has a tendency to diminish and destroy the human species and supports his remark by the history of the deluge  the saint proceeds to make many severe reflections on those who treat virginity with contempt he expatiates on the excellence and the merits of the maidenly condition he dwells on the severe bondage of wedlock and particularly on the hard case of that wife who may wish to live in a state of continence and yet cannot lawfully refuse those caresses to which she has no inclination he contrasts the single and the married life in every point of view and uniformly decides in favor of the first  chap iv on st jerome and his various compositions in praise of virginity i shall close my catalogue of holy panegyrists with the mention of a saint who was equal and perhaps superior to all his sainted brethren in extent of learning in vigor of genius and above all in vehemence of zeal for the support of virginity i mean the passionate and the witty st jerome who passed a great part of his singular life either in struggling with his own turbulent desires in a lonely wilderness or in preaching continence to the devout and rich ladies of a luxurious city he was born about the year     on the confines of dalmatia received his education at rome and traveled into gaul he then proposed to settle in the metropolis of italy but the religious activity of his spirit soon hurried him into the east and having visited the most hallowed places of that country he devoted himself to a state of severest mortification in the deserts of syria sickness drove him to antioch from thence he was led to constantinople by his desire of conversing with st gregory nazianzen ecclesiastical business now carried him to rome and it was at this advanced period of his life that he became the favorite preceptor of many roman ladies who while they attended his exhortations to chastity were very wantonly censured for their devout familiarity with this eloquent enthusiast the attachment of his female disciples though probably very innocent was undoubtedly very strong as some of them followed him into the holy land where he ended an unquiet but illustrious life at the age of fourscore among these disciples a widow whose name was paula attracted the notice of the world by her rank and fortune and still more by the fervency of her devotion the ardent friendship which st jerome professed for this lady had a considerable influence on his life and writings what he suffered and what he enjoyed in the pious connection he has himself very forcibly described in a letter addressed to asella a religious maiden of peculiar sanctity in speaking of the roman ladies he says pene certe triennium cum eis vixi multa me virginum crebro turba circumdedit divinos libros ut potui nonnullis saepe disserui lectio assiduitatem assiduitas familiaritatem familiaritas fiduciam fecerat dicant quid unquam in me aliter senserint quam christianum decebat pecuniam cujusquam accepi munera vel parva vel magna non sprevi nihil mihi aliud objicitur nisi sexus meus et hoc nunquam objicitur nisi quum jerosolymam paula proficiscitur antequam domum sanctae paulae nossem totius in me urbis studia consonabant omnium pene judicio dignus summo sacerdotio decernebar dicebar sanctus dicebar humilis et disertus numquid domum alicujus lascivioris ingressus sum numquid me vestes sericae nitentes gemmae picta facies auri rapuit ambitio nulla fuit alia romae matronarum quae meam posset edomare mentem nisi lugens atque jejunans squalens sordibus fletibus pene caecata quam continuis noctibus misericordiam domini deprecantem sol saepe deprehendit cujus canticum psalmi sermo evangelium deliciae continentia vita jejunium nulla me potuit alia delectare nisi illa quam manducantem nunquam vidi sed postquam eam pro suae merito castitatis venerari colere suscipere coepi omnes me illico deferuere virtutes sanct hieron tom iv p    i lived among them almost three years and was frequently surrounded by a crowd of virgins to some i often explained the scripture my lectures produced attention  attention familiarity  and familiarity confidence but let them say if they ever observed in me any thing unbecoming a christian i accepted indeed the money of some their presents whether small or great i did not despise yet nothing was ever alleged against me except my sex and even that was never alleged against me till paula traveled to jerusalem before i became familiar with the house of the holy paula i had gained the general applause of the whole city and by the judgment of almost all i was regarded as worthy the highest rank in the church i was called a saint i was called humble and eloquent  did i ever enter the doors of any gay or wanton lady were silk and jewels a painted face and a profusion of gold any attractions to me  there was no matron of rome who could conquer my mind except her distinguished by mourning and mortification coarse in her attire and almost blind with weeping  whom the sun often finds imploring through successive nights the mercy of her god  whose songs are psalms  whose conversation the gospel  whose luxury continence  whose life a fast no woman could delight me except her whom i never beheld in the act of eating but as soon as i began to esteem to revere and look up to her for the merit of her chastity from that moment all my own virtues forsook me  the saint proceeds to vent his indignation against the envy and malice of those who had accused him of a criminal intrigue with this devout lady and he closes his letter with all the animation of injured innocence professing in spite of the censorious world an everlasting attachment both to the widow paula and her maiden daughter eustochium to the latter he has addressed one of his most remarkable compositions and of this i shall now give a brief account it is entitled an epistle on the preservation of virginity  i do not intend in this discourse says the saint to his fair disciple to rehearse to you the praises of that maidenly condition which you have found to be most excellent nor to enumerate the troubles of matrimony there will be no adulation in this little treatise no rhetorical pomp of language which may invest you with the dignity of an angel and by describing the beatitude of virginity lay the world at your feet i do not wish that the life you have embraced should inspire you with pride but with caution travel laden with treasure it is therefore your business to avoid a thief onusta incedis auro latro tibi vitandus est epist ad eustoch   after this friendly admonition the saint proceeds to speak of the incessant danger to which virginity is exposed and to alarm his tender pupil in the highest degree he says with a temerity of language which his zeal i think can hardly excuse though god is all powerful he cannot raise up a virgin that is ruined he is able indeed to deliver her from punishment but he will not bestow a crown on the corrupted audenter loquar quum omnia possit deus suscitare virginem non potest post ruinam valet quidem liberare de poena sed non vult coronare corruptam epist ad eustoch  virginity continues the saint may even perish by the simple offenses of the mind and be lost only by harboring a licentious idea  st jerome is very candid in adding to this rigid maxim a striking history of his own turbulent and wanton thoughts in the wilderness to which he retired in spite of the severe mortifications by which he there endeavored to subdue the propensities of nature in the midst of fasting solitude and prayer his ardent imagination he confesses hurried him from the silent desert to scenes of roman luxury and the society of girls from this honest confession he draws a forcible argument in favor of temperance  if they says the saint who reduce their bodies by abstinence are thus tormented by their fancy what must the damsel suffer who is indulged in every delicacy if therefore i have any right to advise if you can credit experience this is my first admonition this my most earnest entreaty that the consecrated virgin may fly from wine as from poison  the saint expatiates on the necessity of abstinence both as to food and liquor and he concludes his advice on this topic with these remarkable expressions  it is not that heaven is delighted with the rumbling of our intestines but chastity cannot otherwise be safe non quod deus intestinorum nostrorum rugitu delectetur sed quod aliter pudicitia tuta esse non possit epist ad eustoch   this caution is followed by a very striking picture of the dissolute manners which prevailed in that age the ladies and the clergy are treated with equal severity by the indignant jerome their vices are described with that singular vehemence of angry wit that energy of metaphor by which the writings of this eloquent father are peculiarly distinguished i am ashamed to say exclaims the animated saint how many virgins are daily ruined what illustrious maidens are lost from the very bosom of our mother church over what fallen stars the proud enemy rears his throne pudet dicere quot quotidie virgins ruant quantas de suo gremio matter perdat ecclesia super quae sydera inimicus superbus ponat thronum suum quot petras excavet et habitet coluber in foraminibus earum  he proceeds to strike at the cohabitation that i have mentioned before between the priests and the canonical virgins how was this pest cries the angry jerome introduced into the church whence are these harlots who confine themselves to a single man they are contained in the same house in one chamber aye and often in one little bed and yet call us suspicious if we suppose any thing unde in ecclesias agapetarum pestis introiit unde meretrices univirae eadem domo uno cubiculo saepe uno tenentur et lectulo et suspiciosos nos vocant si aliquid existimamus epist ad eustoch   the saint proceeds to contrast with these licentious manners the extreme purity of his young disciple in which he exhorts her to persevere with various precepts he dwells chiefly on abstinence and nightly prayer he recommends to her several authors who had written on virgins  tertullian st cyprian his friend damasus the roman pontiff who celebrated virginity both in prose and verse but above all the treatise of st ambrose of which i have given an account and which st jerome extols as a masterpiece of eloquence he cautions her at the same time against all profaner studies and particularly the amusement of poetry  there is a very pleasing peculiarity in this generous saint i mean his custom of relating a little history of his own frailties to form a more forcible lesson for the use of his disciple of this we have already seen one example in the narration of his wanton thoughts in the desert a second now occurs on the subject of profane literature he confesses to his fair pupil that after spending some time in his sacred studies in fasting and prayer he used to amuse himself with the comedies of plautus which delighted him so much that when he returned to the perusal of the prophets he found them insufferably dull a fever attacked him and at the height of his distemper he was transported in a vision before the tribunal of a judge who upbraiding him for his attachment to the literature of the gentiles commanded him to be scourged the conscious jerome acknowledges the justice of this sentence and supports the reality of his punishment by appealing to the stripes which he continued he says to feel after his sleep had left him  in speaking of literature st jerome has some curious expressions concerning the literary magnificence of his age parchment says he is tinged with purple gold flows into letters and books are arrayed in jewels he ascribes this passion for splendour to the roman ladies whom he represents in general as full of ostentation and destitute of virtue  from hence he takes occasion to put his fair disciple on her guard against luxury and avarice  at the distance of thirty years from the composition of these instructions to the tender eustochium we find the ardent st jerome addressing with the same zeal for chastity another roman virgin of equal or superior eminence i mean the celebrated demetrias the granddaughter of proba a matron of the highest rank and character in rome who flying from that city when it was taken by the goths escaped with her family and the wreck of an immense fortune to the coast of africa the young and lovely demetrias  inflamed with a pious passion for the palm of virginity or alarmed perhaps by the fate of many illustrious roman damsels torn from their exiled parents and basely sold to syrian merchants by the infamous count heraclian who commanded in africa  sought an asylum in the church by assuming the veil the holy maiden was complimented by the most eminent saints of the age on this act of devotion nothing can more forcibly show the high consequence of canonical virgins in that period than the epistle of st jerome to demetrias after some praise bestowed on her own character and that of her family he represents her consecration as an event which diffused such universal joy throughout the roman world that it compensated in a great measure the late overthrow of the imperial city he affirms that the delight and exultation of the roman people on this occasion were superior to what they had formerly displayed both when their country was delivered from the ravages of the gauls and when after the fatal battles of trebia thrasymene and cannae they first heard of the victory which marcellus obtained at nola this surely is one of the most hyperbolical compliments that was ever paid to a fair devotee and affords us a curious proof how far the imagination of our lively saint would sometimes outrun his judgment but though his zeal has overcharged the picture we must remember that he painted from life and his description of the effects produced by the consecration of this noble damsel exhibits in the strongest light the maidenly enthusiasm of that period after declaring that the joy of demetriass family was such as the eloquence both of cicero and demosthenes would be unequal to describe st jerome exclaims good god what was their exultation as from one fruitful root many virgins shot forth quasi ex radice foecunda multae simul virgins pullularunt  a multitude of female dependants pursued the example of their lady the profession of virginity prevailed in every house per omnes domos fervebat virginitatis professio parum loquor etc sanct hieron epist ad demetriadem  i speak too faintly all the churches of africa exulted the fame of the pious virgin pervaded every city every town every village to the most lonely hut all the islands between africa and italy were filled with the joyful tidings then italy threw off her garb of mourning and the halfdemolished walls of rome recovered a part of their pristine splendour her god being deemed propitious in this perfect conversion of her daughter you would have thought the race of goths extinguished and all her base enemies struck dead by the avenging thunder of heaven  having represented the effects of her consecration in these flattering colors st jerome proceeds to favor this illustrious virgin with many precepts for the maintenance of her purity he dwells on the usual topics of temperance and prayer he ingeniously compares the virgin who lives chastely in the warmth of youth to those holy persons who continued unhurt in the fiery furnace to the rich virgin he observes that it is more meritorious to employ a large fortune in charitable donations to the poor than in building a costly and splendid church he advises his fair pupil to amuse herself with manual work he cautions her against the insidious doctrine of the heretic rufinus he exhorts her never to hear any conversation between a man and his wife as such dialogues are of an infectious nature ne audias quid vel maritus uxori vel uxor locuta sit viro venenatae sunt hujuscemodi confabulationes epist ad demet  choose her for your companion says the saint who never suspects that she is handsome who never throws back her cloak to discover her neck but covers even her face so carefully that she has hardly one eye when she is walking in public sufficiently unveiled to discern her path  the saint then speaks of his own former composition on the preservation of virginity a work he says which raised to him many enemies on account of the honest freedom with which he arraigned the vices of the time he is still however equally severe on female licentiousness many says he affect the sanctity of canonical virgins that they may more quietly indulge their impure desires these things continues the saint we see and suffer and when dazzled by a piece of gold we even rank them in the catalogue of good works haec videmus et patimur et si aureus nummus affulserit inter bona opera deputamus  he concludes with exhorting his chaste disciple to love the scripture and what has a ludicrous tendency to overthrow all his favorite doctrine he entreats her to revere her grandmother as a model of perfection  the respectful love which st jerome had conceived for virginity was so great that it appears to have been the ruling passion of his life and may be traced in almost all his writings in his letters to different friends who had consulted him on the education of their female infants he discovers the most ardent and anxious desire to form from the cradle a religious old maid in advising a lady whose name was laeta to teach her little daughter to read by letters of box or ivory he gives her a particular caution to let no boys come near the infant maiden the whole letter is curious as it circumstantially describes the very singular cautions which st jerome thought necessary to form a female character of accomplished purity  but i must hasten to speak of the two more elaborate works of this saint in which his predominant passion may be said to burst forth with the greatest fervency the first of these is a treatise on the perpetual virginity of the virgin mary in opposition to helvidius who had attempted to prove by passages from the gospel that after the birth of our savior the virgin mary had other children by her husband joseph after replying to all the arguments of his adversary with great acuteness and strength of reason st jerome indulges himself in a rhetorical description of the two opposite characters a virgin and a wife and he concludes his treatise by magnifying the preeminence of the former with all the lively spirit of eloquent enthusiasm  the second is a work in which the zeal of our saint for the honor of virginity arose to a still higher pitch i mean his answer to jovinian this italian monk of a moderate and respectable character had very heartily asserted that the married women and virgins who lived in equal obedience to the laws of the gospel were equally meritorious the indignation of the zealous jerome took fire at this assertion he could not bear that those objects of his idolatry the pure virgins of the church should be thus placed on a level with women debased in his idea even by a legal cohabitation with man he is so hurried on by the vehemence of his anger that he exclaims in the opening of his reply how shall i check myself and not indulge the weapon so impatient to strike in the cause of virginity unde cohibebo cursum nec indulgebo mucroni jam nunc pro virginitate ferire cupienti s hieron adversus jovinianum lib i  indeed the warm saint appears utterly unable to conduct the controversy with any degree of temper comparing the candid doctrine of his adversary to the hissing of the old serpent he threatens to crush him as the most vile and pernicious of reptiles  the passionate compositions of a bold and vigorous mind enriched with extensive learning are generally entertaining though full of error and absurdity there is an attractive energy in satirical wit however destitute of truth when it is sharpened by indignation or envy it is owing perhaps in some measure to this forcible charm that some unjust compositions of two very different authors voltaire and dr johnson have been read with peculiar avidity in many strokes of personal character and in the compact vigor of their style these great writers both resembled st jerome sarcastic imagination and literary pride were perhaps the predominant characteristics of this singular triumvirate they all delighted to exert the talent which they all possessed of blowing an adversary to pieces with a sparkling explosion of irritable wit  the mild and unfortunate jovinian though he had mercy and justice on his side sunk under the vindictive eloquence of st jerome who supported against his antagonist the preeminence of his favorite virginity by a variety of arguments and a torrent of sacred and profane erudition the saint very artfully perverts many texts of scripture to his purpose and from some of them draws a wonderful inference against the purity of matrimonial duties si abstinemus nos a coitu honorem tribuimus uxoribus si non abstinemus perspicuum est honori contrariam esse contumeliam sanct hieron  he dwells on the authority of st paul in his famous exhortation to celibacy he affirms that virgins are more beloved by heaven because their sacrifice is not enjoined but voluntary he declares there is as much difference between marriage and virginity as between not sinning and doing good  having made the utmost of those texts in scripture which could be converted to the honor of virginity he proceeds to show that a state of continence was no new establishment introduced in opposition to nature by the christian church but of ancient and universal estimation in this part of his treatise he gives an ample catalogue of the most eminent supposed virgins of the pagan world not omitting the camilla and harpalice of virgil he mentions the tradition of the indian gymnosophists that the founder of their religious institutions was generated from the side of a virgin he condescends to repeat even the grecian fable concerning platos mother who was said to have been impregnated by a phantom of apollo phantasmate apollinis   there are several points of religious doctrine which st jerome disputes with his antagonist but i touch only on that which is particularly connected with the subject of this essay this indeed is the point for which the angry saint most vehemently contends his indignation seems to have been particularly roused by the great eagerness with which the roman ladies had embraced the liberal maxims of his opponent some canonical virgins convinced by jovinian of the innocence and the merits of matrimony had dropped the veil and preferred the warm protection of a husband to the chilling shelter of the church st jerome in the close of his invective very forcibly describes the popularity of his antagonist he laments that the rich and noble received him with deference and affection he represents him as the preceptor of impurity surrounded by multitudes of lascivious women who have lost not only their modesty but all sense of shame and who display more wantonness says the saint in the argumentative defense of their desire than in its actual exertion  he concludes with a spirited address to rome as the mistress of the world he beseeches the imperial city to act in conformity to her ancient reputation to be exalted by virtue and not humbled by pleasure  though jovinian seems to have had a large majority of the fair sex on his side his mild doctrine concerning them was formally condemned by ecclesiastical authority and he died in exile st jerome arose triumphant from the contest yet we find that many pious critics in rome arraigned his composition for extolling virginity to such a pitch by the degradation of wedlock in some of his letters he treats these critics with the utmost contempt he asserts in support of his own doctrine that the apostles were either unmarried or continent after marriage apostoli vel virgins vel post nuptias continentes sanct hieron epist ad pammachium tom iv p     edit par   0   he concludes one of his epistles on this topic with an air of jocularity by saying to explain my sentiments on wedlock completely i would have all those provide themselves with wives who from their nightly fears are unable to lie alone volo omnes qui propter nocturnos forsitan metus soli cubitare non possunt uxores ducere sanct hieron epist ad domnionem   such was the doctrine and such the success of st jerome as the eulogist of virginity it may amuse the english reader to see this eloquent and chaste enthusiast in the character of a poet i shall therefore close the chapter with a translation of the epitaph which he composed on his great friend and patroness the illustrious paula  this lady after residing about twenty years in bethlem where she had founded three monasteries for virgins and one for monks  and after acting as a mother to all the christian pilgrims who then crowded to the holy sepulcher  ended a life of the strictest piety in the year  0  at the age of fiftysix the faithful st jerome lamented her with the most passionate affliction and placed on different parts of the rock which was converted into her tomb the two following inscriptions  scipio quam genuit pauli fudere parents gracchorum soboles agamemnonis inclyta proles hoc jacet in tumulo paulam dixere priores eustochii genetrix romani prima senatus pauperiem christi et bethleemitica rura sequuta in

lay in bethlems holy rock her head cradle of christ a scene the magi trod hailing with mystic gifts our human god chap v on some miracles ascribed to monastic virgins the enthusiastic eloquence of the different saints whom we have just reviewed had undoubtedly great influence in augmenting the multitude of religious old maids but it was not the only cause which produced this effect  to the exhortations of the holy fathers we may add the universal and dazzling idea of supernatural power supposed to reside in the monastic virgin of immaculate purity many females would enter with ambitious zeal into a state which gave them a fair prospect of acquiring the very flattering privilege of working miracles and in those ages when diverse miracles were ascribed to the chaste and pious daughters of many a convent every nun of lively imagination who had the slightest acquaintance with the legends of her sisterhood might readily hope for a privilege of which examples were so common the lives of the female saints contain an infinitude of miraculous incidents in honor of virginity my readers would hardly thank me for reviving a large collection of these forgotten wonders yet let me observe with the great montesquieu je crois bien que cest une faussete says this bold and manly writer on a passage in the life of an obscure saint mais cest une faussete tresancienne le fond de la vie et les mensonges se rapportent aux moeurs et aux loix du temps et ce font ces moeurs et ces loix que lon cherche ici lesprit des loix lib xxx chap     that the lies contained in these lives relate to the manners of the time and it forms a part of my design to exhibit in this work the manners and sentiments of different ages relating to that interesting condition of female life which i have chosen for my subject every author must allow a place to many absurdities if he means to give a history of human opinions though on a single topic the more ridiculous an ancient legend may appear to us the more forcibly will it show us the extent and influence of popular credulity i shall therefore select a few supernatural anecdotes of pious virgins and to render them the more interesting i shall confine myself to the holy maidens of our own country if we wished to produce the strongest example of miraculous power ascribed to martyred chastity we might pitch on the adventures of st ositha a religious and royal virgin of essex who being murdered and beheaded by danish pirates in the ninth century is said like some poetical heroes of romance to have carried her severed head in her own hands to a church at a considerable distance from the spot where she was slain dani infideles ipsam sanctam ositham capite obtruncant at corpus exangue mox sese subrigit et caput humi jacens manibus apprehendit rectoque gradu et firmis vestigiis progrediens usque ad ecclefiam apostolorum sanctorum petri et pauli per tria fere stadia illud deportat quod accidit circa annum   0 du monstier martyrologium p       the memory of this fair and chaste saint was held in peculiar veneration as appears from a circumstance recorded in one of our early monastic chronicles alfward bishop of london was afflicted with a leprosy and his distemper was supposed to be a punishment which he drew upon himself by inspecting this buried virgin whose body lay within his diocese with a profane curiosity and pilfering some relics from her grave cum virginis martyris corpus ausu temerario inspicere et aliquas inde reliquias auferre presumeret divino ut creditur judicio tantae temeritatis poenam solvit historia ramesiensis edit gale p       among the most meritorious of our holy maidens we ought perhaps to reckon the chaste st bridget of scotland who having resolved on perpetual virginity and being persecuted by the addresses of an ardent lover prayed to heaven that she might be relieved from his distressing importunities by the sudden loss of her beauty her pious biographers inform us that this singular petition was immediately granted  her lovely countenance was instantly deformed and the dangerous luster of her eyes was drowned in blood but we have the consolation of being told by the same authority that she recovered her charms as soon as her purity was perfectly secure  not to dwell on the legends of mere martyrologists i shall relate from the most respectable of our ancient historians a miraculous anecdote which not only shows the wonderful estimation in which monastic virginity was held but even proves that the king himself was not safe if he presumed to question or deride the continence of a canonized virgin  the celebrated william of malmsbury has enlivened the history of english prelates with the following account of a religious and royal maiden whose name was editha this lady the daughter of edgar a monarch distinguished by his military spirit and his amorous adventures was early devoted to a life of monastic purity and is said to have displayed all the gentle virtues in the monastery of wilton though a professed nun she ventured to indulge herself in splendid apparel and when reproved by st ethelwold for her finery she defended herself with a pious vivacity by a quotation from st augustine affirming that pride was often seen in a sordid habit and humility in a golden vest in her devotions she was so fervent that the great st dunstan who beheld her during the consecration of a church which she had built was enraptured with her piety on observing that she frequently extended her thumb to make the sign of the cross this prophetic saint exclaimed may that blessed finger never decay and burst into a tender passion of tears so violent as to shake with his sobbing the deacon who stood next him on being asked the reason of his disorder he replied this blooming rose will soon wither this dove so dear to heaven will fly away from us in six weeks from this day his prophecy was accomplished the royal virgin expired at the precise time he had foretold and the same holy man beheld her in a vision walking hand in hand with the sainted martyr to whom she had dedicated the church and commanding that such reverence should be paid to her on earth as she received in heaven  miracles became frequent at her tomb at last it was ordered that her body should be brought forth from its grave and her whole frame was found converted into dust except her finger her stomach and the parts below it while the holy man was amazed at these wonders he was relieved by an appearance of the virgins spirit who said that those parts of her body were justly free from putrefaction for having preserved themselves unpolluted by the two sensual sins of wantonness and gluttony the curious reader may wish to see the whole account of this singular apparition which i have softened and abridged  ita crebrescentibus ad tumbam miraculis edictum ut efferretur virginis corpus inventumque totum in cineres solutum praeter digitum et alvum alvoque subjecta unde sancto dubitanti virgo ipsa per visum assistit dicens non mirum esse si parts illae corporis putruerint quod usus habeat exanimata corpora in quosdam arcanos naturae sinus defluere et

pontificum lib ii p         at a subsequent period when king canute the dane who was apt says the same pious historian to satirize the saints of england happened to visit wilton he treated the memory of the chaste and holy editha with jocular contempt affirming that he could never believe she was justly sainted for chastity as she was the daughter of edgar the most wanton of princes while he spoke thus with the irreverence of a barbarian he was reproved by the archbishop ednodus canute growing angry orders the sepulcher to be opened that he might see what appearance of sanctity the dead virgin would discover the mausoleum being burst asunder the deceased spreading her veil before her face as low as her girdle was seen to arise and attack the insolent monarch effracto ergo mausoleo defuncta oppanso ante faciem velo cingulo tenus assurgere et in contumacem regem impetum facere visa  overcome with terror throwing back his head and losing the strength of his knees he fell to the ground and remained breathless so long that he was supposed to be dead but his faculties returning by degrees he rejoiced to find that although severely chastised he had a season left him for penitence the festival of the chaste editha is therefore held venerable in many parts of england and no one can think of profaning it with impunity  such are the anecdotes which the most sensible and accomplished of our ancient historians has related of one royal and pious maiden several incidents of a similar cast might be easily collected but i apprehend the preceding is sufficient to show in a very strong point of view the ideas of our ancestors concerning the supernatural powers of a spotless virgin what real influence such ideas may have had in augmenting the multitude of genuine old maids i shall leave the contemplative sisterhood to consider  chap vi on the decline and fall of monastic virginity ages have existed in which a passion for monastic chastity appears to have spread like an epidemical disorder through the female world and ladies of the most elevated rank seem to have been particularly exposed to this religious influenza the great historian who has lately exhibited a magnificent picture of declining rome delineates with his usual spirit the pious pomp and ostentation with which the three daughters of the emperor arcadius dedicated their virginity to god he informs us that the obligation of their vow was inscribed on a tablet of gold and gems which they publicly offered in the great church of constantinople their palace was converted into a monastery and all males except the guides of their conscience the saints who had forgotten the distinction of sexes were scrupulously excluded from the holy threshold gibbon vol iii p     edit        a female sacrifice announced to the world with such dazzling splendour must have had great effect in extending the contagious passion for monastic virginity and in the succeeding ages we find that many queens and princesses in different kingdoms of europe preferred the chaste comfort of monastic continence to all the parade and pleasure of royal dignity we have seen in a former chapter of this essay that the married royal fair ones as well as the single aspired to that celestial crown of virginity which was considered as superior to every earthly diadem and many of these virgin wives to give them the strange appellation which they coveted appear to have obtained from the religious complaisance of their husbands a very plausible if not an unquestionable title to the prime object of their ambition in this wonderful species of purity the royal fair ones of england seem to have surpassed those of other countries  a very amusing italian author who has attempted to prove that the modern world is not inferior to the ancient in virtues of every class among his examples of the most singular modern chastity has mentioned the english queen ediltruda whom he considers as the wife of three husbands yet justly canonized as a virgin see a curious book entitled lhoggidi overo gl ingegni non inferiori a passati venetia      part seconda p        the extraordinary merit ascribed to this royal old maid of england made me search minutely into the history of so interesting a personage i find that the ediltruda of this courteous italian writer is the lady celebrated by our venerable bede under the name of aedilthryda a lady whose adventures i have mentioned in a preceding chapter on a different occasion i will here add that our honest historian who allows her only two husbands yet vouches for her virginity in the following remarkable terms  after saying that she resided twelve years with ecgfrid the king her last husband and yet remained a perpetual virgin of glorious integrity he thus proceeds  to me and to some others who doubted if this were really so bishop wilfrid of blessed memory declared that he was himself a perfect witness of her integrity for ecgfrid had promised to give him an ample estate and a large sum of money if he could persuade the queen to admit his embraces being assured that she loved no man better nor should we doubt continues the honest bid that a circumstance could happen even in our time which faithful historians inform us was very frequent in the preceding age cujus consortio cum duodecim annis uteretur perpetua tamen mansit virginitatis integritate gloriosa sicut mihimet sciscitanti cum hoc an ita esset quibusdam venisset in dubium beatae memoriae vilfrid episcopus referebat dicens se testem integritatis ejus esse certissimum adeo ut ecgfridus promiserit se ei terras ac pecunias multas esse donaturum si reginae posset persuadere ejus uti connubio quia sciebat illam nullum virorum plus illo diligere nec diffidendum est nostra etiam aetate fieri potuisse quod aevo praecedente aliquoties factum fideles historiae narrant hist eccles p     edit cantab        frivolous and nonsensical as anecdotes of this kind may appear to a fastidious critic they particularly deserve the attention of the truly philosophical as they instruct us in that most interesting branch of useful knowledge the history of manners although the opinions and practices of our age afford but little countenance to the fact so heartily supported by the venerable bede the most skeptical reader may incline to admit the truth of it when he considers that in the days of aedilthryda to lead the life of a nun was esteemed the height of human happiness and the surest passport to celestial beatitude nay to become the parent of a nun was regarded as a blessing of such importance that some good ladies were contented to sacrifice for this blessing the glory arising from that continent virtue in which they prided themselves so devoutly this remark is grounded on an anecdote as curious as the preceding which dugdale has inserted in his monasticon from the manuscript chronicles of john the vicar of tinmouth this pious historian has recorded that a nobleman whom he calls wolfhelmus having children by his wife resided with her for eighteen years in perfect continence when an angel appeared and exhorted this chaste couple to cohabit once more for the sake of producing a spouse for christ and then to persevere in their former purity of life ex uxore sua liberos procreans cum conjuge sua octodecim annis usque ad provectam aetatem coelibem vitam duxit angelus autem domini trina visione utrumque hortatus est ut convenirent quia sponsam christi generarent et de caetero propositum servarent monasticon anglicanum tom i p      the suggestion of the angel was not disregarded and this heavendirected intercourse gave birth to wolfhildis who became a nun of such signal purity that she rejected the rich offers and escaped from the amorous pursuit of king edgar although wenfleda the aunt of that licentious monarch condescended to act as the base minister of his pleasures and employed the most ungenerous artifice to ensnare this resolute and illustrious virgin  but if there were times in which monastic chastity appeared so firm as to resist and triumph over the importunities even of royal intrigue we must confess that in other seasons it assumed a very different appearance and turned at last into the most deplorable frailty  the venerable bede has himself given us a very striking picture of monastic enormities in his epistle to ecgbert from this we learn that many young men who had no title to the monastic profession got possession of monastery where instead of engaging in the defense of their country as their age and rank required they indulged themselves in the most dissolute indolence and did not abstain from the virgins that were devoted to god ideoque vacantes ac sine conjugio exacto tempore pubertatis nullo continentiae proposito perdurent atque hanc ob rem vel patriam suam pro qua militare debuerant trans mare abeuntes relinquant vel majore scelere atque impudentia qui propositum castitatis non habent luxuriae ac fornicationi deserviant neque ab ipsis sacratis deo virginibus abstineant epistola venerabilis bedae ad ecgbertum antistitem   we learn from dugdale that in the reign of henry the second the nuns of amsbury abbey in wiltshire were expelled from that religious house on account of their incontinence monasticon vol i p      and to exhibit in the most lively colors the total corruption of monastic chastity bishop burnet informs us in his history of the reformation that when the nunneries were visited by the command of henry the eighth whole houses were found almost all with child i quote the words of the bishop see his history of the reformation vol i p   0   when we consider to what oppressive indolence to what a variety of wretchedness and guilt the young and fair inhabitants of the cloister were frequently betrayed we ought to admire those benevolent authors who when the tide of religious prejudice ran very strong in favor of monastic virginity had spirit enough to oppose the torrent and to caution the devout and tender sex against so dangerous a profession it is in this point of view that the character of erasmus appears with the most amiable luster and his name ought to be eternally dear to the female world in particular though his studies and constitution led him almost to idolize those eloquent fathers of the church who have magnified monastic virginity his good sense and his accurate survey of human life enabled him to judge of the misery in which female youth was continually involved by a precipitate choice of the veil he knew the successful arts by which the subtle and rapacious monks inveigled young women of opulent families into the cloister and he exerted his lively and delicate wit in opposition to so pernicious an evil the writings of many eminent authors have been levelled against the abuses of the monastic life but several of these like the noted work of the humorous rabelais appear to have flowed from a spirit as wanton and licentious as ever lurked in a convent and abound in language offensive to every decent reader it is not thus with erasmus his two dialogues entitled the virgin averse to marriage and the penitent virgin are written with admirable pleasantry and seem to have been dictated by a chaste and angelic desire to promote the felicity of woman  in those nations of europe where nunneries still exist how many lovely victims are continually sacrificed to the avarice or absurd ambition of inhuman parents the misery of these victims has been painted with great force by some benevolent writers of france and particularly by that admirable novelist madame de genlis in her letters on education in most of these pathetic histories that are founded on the abuse of convents the misery originates from the parent and falls upon the child the reverse has sometimes happened and there are examples of unhappy parents who have been rendered miserable by the religious perversity of a daughter in the fourteenth volume of that very amusing book the causes celebres a book which is said to have been the favorite reading of voltaire there is a striking history of a girl under age who was tempted by pious artifice to settle herself in a convent in express opposition to parental authority her parents who had vainly tried the most tender persuasion endeavored at last to redeem their lost child by a legal process against the nunnery in which she was imprisoned the pleadings on this remarkable trial may perhaps be justly reckoned among the finest pieces of eloquence that the lawyers of france have produced monsieur gillet the advocate for the parents represented in the boldest and most affecting language the extreme baseness of this religious seduction his eloquence appeared to have fixed the sentiments of the judges but the cause of superstition was pleaded by an advocate of equal power and it finally prevailed the unfortunate parents of marie vernat for this was the name of the deluded girl were condemned to resign her for ever and to make a considerable payment to those artful devotees who had piously robbed them of their child  when we reflect on the various evils that have arisen in convents we have the strongest reason to rejoice and glory in that reformation by which the nunneries of england were abolished yet it would not be candid or just to consider all these as the mere harbors of licentiousness since we are told that at the time of their suppression some of our religious houses were very honorably distinguished by the purity of their inhabitants the visitors says bishop burnet interceded earnestly for one nunnery in oxfordshire godstow where there was great strictness of life and to which most of the young gentlewomen of the country were sent to be bred so that the gentry of the country desired the king would spare the house yet all was ineffectual history of the reformation vol i p       in this point of view much undoubtedly may be said in favor of convents yet when the arguments on both sides are fairly weighed i apprehend that every true friend to female innocence will rejoice in those sensible regulations which our catholic neighbors have lately made respecting nunneries and which seem to promise their universal abolition see a judicious account of such regulations in the grand duchy of tuscany in the annual register of      history of europe p        an event which we are told by experience would be far from diminishing the purity of the female world since i can safely assert to the honor of the sisterhood that at this day there are more genuine old maids existing in england than could have been found here at any period of our history when our island abounded in convents when every county contained a multitude of nuns and virginity was the most fashionable of all professions  chap vii on some monastic old maids distinguished by literary talents when we consider what innumerable multitudes of virgins have passed their lives in the leisure of a convent  when we reflect on the active ingenuity of the female mind and remember that convents during many ages were the treasuries of all the learning that remained upon the earth  we may be surprised in observing the very small number of monastic old maids who are said to have bequeathed to us any literary production perhaps indeed many a fair and chaste author has existed whose name and works have been unjustly buried in sudden oblivion i am led to this conjecture by finding that one monastic and maiden prodigy of literature has been strangely overlooked or misrepresented by our best antiquarians i mean the poetical saxon nun hrosvitha or rosovida this lady who flourished about the year   0 exerted her poetical genius to confirm and increase the number of monastic old maids she wrote six dramatic compositions in imitation of terence but on subjects very different from those of the roman dramatist as the plays of the virgin author were chiefly intended to animate her sister nuns to the preservation of their virginity  it is strange that these dramatic curiosities are so imperfectly known among us especially as some of our ablest scholars have lately employed themselves in elaborate researches on the obscure origin of the modern drama  mr warton in the emendations which he has added to his second volume on english poetry has indeed mentioned the name and title of this chaste and pious dramatist but attributes her compositions to her first editor conradus celtes who published her plays and other sacred poems at nurenburg   0   such inaccuracies are inevitable in a work so various and extensive as the excellent history of english poetry and i am confident that its learned and amiable author will thank me for pointing out this mistake and thus enabling him to correct his involuntary injustice toward this literary phoenix of the cloister though her works were republished at the beginning of this century they are still so rare that i have searched in vain through the libraries of our two universities and through some of the most curious private collections of books in this kingdom for a copy of her chaste and interesting dramas i have for some time delayed to close this chapter of my essay in the hope of receiving rosovida from a friend on the continent but the rare dramatist not arriving as i expected and these pages being called for by the press i can only afford the curious reader the imperfect gratification of knowing that these early plays and an engraved portrait of the chaste maiden who wrote them actually exist the subjects of her six dramas are mentioned by fabricius bib med et infimae latinitatis the most striking is the fifth paphnutius on the conversion of thais a courtezan   i should particularly regret the loss of an opportunity to enrich this essay with translations from this rare dramatic old maid had i not the hope of doing ample justice to her merits on a future occasion for if the chaste sisterhood bestow on my labors in their service that animating favor which i am inclined to expect from their curiosity and goodnature i mean to devote to them the residue of my advanced life and to execute a work to their honor which the republic of letters has long wanted a biographical dictionary of eminent old maids  having this grand performance in contemplation i shall not in these little books attempt to expatiate on the teresas of spain saint teresa wrote her own pious memoirs containing a full account of her various interviews with angels and the devil the best edition of her works is in two quarto volumes madrid      she died      and was canonised by gregory xv       the schurmans of germany anna maria schurman eminent for her skill in languages was a native of cologne she resided at utrecht and declined an offer of marriage from the famous dutch poet pensionary cats she died in friesland      the most remarkable of her productions is a logical treatise in latin to prove that the female mind is fit for learning and science  the scuderys of france magdeleine de scudery perhaps the plainest and most ingenious of old maids her romances etc amounted to fortysix volumes she died in   0  at the age of ninetyfour her poetical compliment to the artist who drew her picture shows us in a lively point of view both the homeliness of her features and the sweetness of her character the compliment may lose some of its elegance but i think none of its goodnature in the following translation nanteuil what wondrous magic grace must in your pencil lurk for in my glass i hate my face yet love it in your work   the bourignons of flanders antoinette bourignon born at lisle      was a visionary old maid though deformed from her birth she surmounted many difficulties and hardships to preserve her chastity and sustained an equal portion of literary labor in the hope of illuminating the world by the publication of her pious reveries they were printed in twentyone volumes octavo with a life of the chaste author written by one of her disciples bail has given a very lively account both of the adventures and opinions of this wonderful lady who seems to have entertained an idea as whimsical as that which bail has quoted on the occasion from the count de gabalis that a demon can by a detestable artifice make a virgin with child in her sleep without prejudice to her virginity the flemish old maid does not appear to have met with any mischance that could tempt her to adopt this idea from a vain hope of repairing a ruined reputation she was not only endued with the most perfect chastity herself says her biographer but had the faculty of communicating that virtue to others a faculty which the philosophical bail has taken the liberty of treating with much spritely ridicule this singular virgin died in friesland at the age of sixtyfour  or in short on any of those voluminous virgins who have astonished the different kingdoms of europe by the fertility of their pious or romantic pens  but there are two monastic old maids so very remarkable yet so little known in our country that i must embrace the present opportunity of introducing them to the acquaintance of my fair readers the first is a pious visionary virgin of venice the second a poetical nun of mexico to the venetian virgin who is known in france by the name of mere jeanne the famous french traveller guillaume postel was indebted for most of those singular ideas by which he excited universal astonishment in the age of francis the first postel was patronised for his extensive erudition by that munificent prince to whom the learned enthusiast very confidently promised universal dominion by this prophecy in favor of france postel excited the enmity of some spanish jesuits in rome which obliged him to depart from that city and repair to venice it was here that the wonderful mere jeanne whom he describes as a little old woman of forty une petite vieille femmelette de lage de cinquante ans  imparted to him those mysteries which he communicated to the world in a little book written in italian whose long title is so curious that i shall insert an entire translation of it the first news of another world that is the admirable history and not less necessary and useful to be read and understood by every one than stupendous entitled the venetian virgin  part seen part proved and most faithfully written by william postel firstborn of the regeneration and spiritual father of the said virgin       octavo  of this very rare volume france is said to contain only two copies but there is a french publication by the same author containing the same doctrine which consists in announcing to women an universal dominion over the world this dominion however is purely spiritual and means nothing more than the establishment of a more perfect reason which beginning according to the author in his venetian virgin was to extend over the universe and thus confirm and perpetuate the sovereignty of woman how far the doctrine of postel may have been verified and how far the sisterhood in particular may have enjoyed that sovereign purity and perfection of reason which this learned man first discovered in his celebrated venetian old maid are delicate points which the experience of my fair readers will best enable them to decide  while they are settling the matter let me hasten to mexico and present to them from that city sister jua inez de la cruz a religious virgin so eminent for her poetical talents that she has been honored with the title of a tenth muse  juana was born in november      at the distance of a few leagues from the city of mexico her father was one of the many spanish gentlemen who sought to improve a scanty fortune by an establishment in america where he married a lady of that country descended from spanish parents their daughter juana was distinguished in her infancy by an uncommon passion for literature and a wonderful facility in the composition of spanish verses her parents sent her when she was eight years old to reside with her uncle in the city of mexico she had there the advantage of a learned education and as her extraordinary talents attracted universal regard she was patronised by the lady of the viceroy the marquis de mancera and at the age of seventeen was received into his family a spanish encomiast of juana relates a remarkable anecdote which he says was communicated to him by the viceroy himself that nobleman astonished by the extensive learning of the young juana invited forty of the most eminent literati that his country could afford to try the extent and solidity of juanas erudition the young female scholar was freely but politely questioned on the different branches of science by theologians philosophers mathematicians historians and poets and as a royal galleon i use the words of his excellency the viceroy says my spanish author as a royal galleon would defend herself against a few scallops that might attack her so did juana inez extricate herself from the various questions arguments and rejoinders that each in his own province proposed to her  the applause which she received on this signal display of her accomplishments was far from inspiring the modest juana with vanity or presumption indeed a pious humility was her most striking characteristic her life amounted only to fortyfour years and of these she passed twentyseven distinguished by the most exemplary exercise of all the religious virtues in the convent of st geronimo her delight in books was extreme and she is said to have possessed a library of four thousand volumes but toward the close of her life she made a striking sacrifice to charity by selling her darling books for the relief of the poor few female authors have been more celebrated in life or in death more lamented the collection of her works in three quarto volumes contains a number of panegyrics in verse and prose bestowed on this chaste poetess by the most illustrious characters both of old and new spain the most sensible of the spanish critics father feyjoo has made this general remark on juanas compositions that they excel in ease and elegance but are deficient in energy a failing the more remarkable as the pious enthusiasm of this poetical nun was so great that she wrote in her own blood a profession of her faith let me observe in answer to her critic that most of juanas verses are written on subjects where poetical energy was not to be expected many of her poems are occasional compliments to her particular friends and in her sacred dramas the absurd superstitions of her country were sufficient to annihilate all poetical sublimity  in one of her short productions she describes the injustice of men toward her own sex i shall close my brief account of this admirable maiden with an imitation of this performance taking the liberty however to omit several stanzas it is i think the most pleasing specimen that i could select from her poetry and has a particular claim to a place in this essay since it may be regarded as a vindication of old maids composed by a virgin of eminence and authority  hombres necios que acusais a la muger sin razon sin ver que sois la ocasion de lo mismo que culpais etc  weak men who without reason aim to load poor woman with abuse not seeing that yourselves produce the very evils that you blame you against her firm resistance strive and having struck her judgment mute soon to her levity impute what from your labor you derive of womans weakness much afraid of your own prowess still you boast like the vain child who makes a ghost then fears what he himself has made her whom your arms have once embraced you think presumptuously to find when she is wooed as thais kind when wedded as lucretia chaste how rare a fool must he appear whose folly mounts to such a pass that first he breathes upon the glass then grieves because it is not clear still with unjust ungrateful pride you meet both favor and disdain the firm as cruel you arraign the tender you as weak deride your foolish humor none can please since judging all with equal phlegm one for her rigor you condemn and one you censure for her ease what wondrous gifts must her adorn who would your lasting love engage when rigorous nymphs excite your rage and easy fair ones raise your scorn but while you show your pride or power with tyrant passions vainly hot she is only blessed who heeds you not and leaves you all in happy hour chap viii on some old maids of the new world several of the spanish writers in giving an early account of the western world which they had just discovered and were eager to make known have described the wantonness and the servility of the american females in colors that are disgraceful to human nature the relations of peter cieca de leon in particular exhibit these indecent yet beautiful savages in the most deplorable point of view and might almost lead us to imagine that rich as the new world appeared in many valuable productions it never produced an old maid happily however for the honor of the sisterhood there arose in that country a spanish historian who being descended from a princess of peru engaged with patriotic ardour in the noble task of vindicating the purity of the peruvian ladies the inca garcilaso de la vega opens the fourth book of his royal commentaries with a circumstantial account of the virgins devoted to the sun  in the false religion of peru says the historian there were many things truly great and respectable one of these was the profession of perpetual virginity which the women preserved in many houses of retirement built for them in many provinces of the empire and that it may be understood what women these were to whom they were devoted and in what they were exercised i shall describe them minutely because the spanish historians who treat of this point pass over it according to the vulgar proverb like a cat over coals como gato por brasas   this illustrious author then enters into every particular relating to these religious virgins describing from his own knowledge the exact situation of the building in the city of cusco where they had formerly resided  he contradicts the general opinion concerning them and clearly proves that they never dwelt or officiated as priestesses in the temple of the sun on the contrary he asserts that the incas took particular care that no men should enter into the mansion of these sequestered maidens and no women into that of the sun  two distinct buildings at a considerable distance from each other which garcilaso tells us he had seen entire as they were preserved with particular veneration by the peruvians in that memorable conflagration when revolting against their spanish oppressors they burnt the city of cusco  these virgins although they did not reside in the temple of the sun were still considered as the wives of that radiant power whom they respected as the progenitor of their princes they were all of royal blood  their number was not limited but commonly amounted says the historian to more than fifteen hundred  these ingenious maidens employed themselves in working assiduously for their nominal husband the sun and as he had no immediate occasion for the splendid vestments they fashioned for him it was their custom to present his natural heir the reigning inca with the rich and elegant productions of their manual labor it is remarkable that these sequestered virgins were liable to that inhuman punishment which was inflicted on the frail vestals of rome and toward the person who seduced them from their vows of chastity the peruvian law was still more severe than the roman it not only took the life of the daring offender himself but extended to all the unfortunate beings to whom he was related all his possessions were to be laid desolate that the earth might retain no traces of a wretch who had impiously violated a hallowed spouse of the sun  but whether the maids of peru were purer in constitution than the roman vestals or whether the peruvian heroes had not like those of rome that audacity of character which delights to plunge into the deepest guilt we are assured that cusco was not inured like rome to the horrid spectacle of burying frail virgins alive  such was the law says the historian of peru but the execution of it was never seen because no person was ever found to have offended against it  the horror and indignation with which the peruvians regarded those spanish ruffians who profaned this virgin sanctuary are happily expressed in those spirited verses of dr warton entitled the dying indian  the warrior thus exults at his death in the idea of having avenged the injured maidens of his country  o my son i feel the venom busy in my breast  approach and bring my crown decked with the teeth of that bold christian who first dared deflower the virgins of the sun  i marked the spot where they interred this traitor and once at midnight stole i to his tomb and tore his carcass from the earth and left it a prey to poisonous flies preserve this crown with sacred secrecy dodsleys poems vol iv p  0   the community of holy virgins had subsisted for some centuries in peru before that unfortunate empire became the victim of spanish avarice hypocrisy and oppression yet those historical skeptics who delight to start a doubt on the existence of distant virtue might intimate with some plausibility that this numerous community of nominal virgins never contained perhaps a single genuine old maid they might say that as the reigning inca had the privilege of visiting these sequestered ladies as he was the acknowledged representative of that radiant luminary to whom they all professed a connubial obedience every virginwife of the sun would be eager to consummate her marriage by receiving the caresses of his imperial proxy  but to invalidate such a skeptical objection against the perpetual virginity of the peruvian nuns it may be sufficient to observe that besides the fifteen hundred virgins who were confined in cusco there were many houses of retirement in different provinces of the empire where the most lovely damsels were sequestered as the wives or concubines of the reigning inca and such was the religious veneration which the fair peruvians entertained for their prince that if we may believe their historian every beautiful virgin considered it as the height of felicity to be made a captive during life for the mere chance of contributing to the pleasures of her royal master  the courteous garcilaso is so solicitous to vindicate the chastity of the fair peruvians that he informs us there were other ladies who did not live in a state of seclusion from society yet were bound by vows of perpetual virginity which they most faithfully observed he assures us that he was personally acquainted with a most respectable old lady of this class who was both a friend and a relation of the princess his mother whoever considers this honorable testimony in their favor will readily i trust admit that primitive old maids existed in the western world before it was enlightened by its european invaders  i cannot quit this part of my subject without paying a just compliment to that immortal though fictitious maiden of peru the zilia of madame de graffigny  whoever wishes to be more acquainted with the virgins of the sun may find both information and delight in the peruvian letters a work that for delicacy of sentiment and vivacity of description is inferior perhaps to no performance which the literary world has received from the tender and lively imagination of woman  chap ix on the reverence paid to old maids by our northern ancestors of all people on the globe those to whom the sisterhood of old maids have been most indebted are undoubtedly our brave progenitors of the north the manly and generous goths have acquired a degree of glory above all greek above all roman fame by paying the most tender deference to the fair sex and by setting the highest value on the virtue of chastity according to the religious creed of these gallant tribes the virgin who died chaste like the warrior who fell in battle was immediately admitted with distinguished honor into their valhalla or palace of the dead in ejus freiae aulam etiam veniebant e sequiore sexu quae virgins obiissent keysler antiq septent page   0  among the goddesses enumerated in that amusing collection of gothic fables the edda we find the two virgins fylla and gefione the office of the latter was to preside over maidens after their death the hall of odin and the paradise of mahomet bear a striking resemblance to each other the beatitude which departed warriors were supposed to enjoy in these two regions of eternal delight appears to have consisted chiefly in being attended by virgins and the learned keysler supposes that mahomet was indebted to the ancient scythians for this alluring idea mahomed enim nihil novi hac part essinxit et pollicitus est asseclis sed quod in vicinis gentibus scytharum progeny et turcis imprimis forte videbat suis arridere id in novam quam adornabat religionem transtulit ibid page       the gothic maid who persevered in her chastity had indeed a peculiar claim to distinction in the regions of the dead since according to the popular creed of her country she was exposed when living to trials of the most extraordinary and tremendous nature arising from the influence of runic spells in the singular little poem in which odin enumerates his own magical powers he declares that he is possessed of an incantation by which he can change the mind of any coy maiden and bend her entirely to his wishes bartholin antiq dan p       and long after the age of odin says bartholine it was believed that by a certain runic composition the mind of any damsel however averse to love might be rendered pliant to the entreaties of her admirer  but if the lover who attempted to form this amorous spell made any mistake even in tracing a single letter of the charm instead of inspiring his fair one with love he deprived her of health and loaded her with such bodily infirmities as could be cured only by a more skilful master of this interesting magic who might discover the errors of the imperfect spell and remove the evil it produced by a new incantation  to confirm his account of this popular opinion my author has quoted a little story which shows what a severe misfortune it was to a gothic lady to be beloved by a blockhead  the sum of the story is this  helga the daughter of thorfin was reduced to great infirmity both of body and mind by one of these amorous runic spells imperfectly written by a bold but ignorant rustic who had first vainly sought her in marriage and afterward as vainly courted her to an illicit connection the source of the ladys malady was detected and she was restored to health by the superior magical talents of egill the poet  if the heroes of the north endued as they were with great bodily strength possessed also this magic influence over the minds of the fair sex they certainly deserve our esteem for having used their double powers with admirable moderation and generosity the goths in particular were not only attentive to female honor in respect to the women of their own nation but they paid the highest regard to the chastity of their fair captives in the most licentious hours of victory and plunder when the gothic king totila made himself master of rome he exerted so much care in preserving the women from violation that according to the historian procopius not a single virgin or matron or widow was dishonored ita ut non virginis non matrisfamilias non viduae ullius corpori illusum sit unde magna illi modestiae fama  procopii lib iii  grotii hist goth p       before that event an italian named calaber had complained to the gothic monarch that his daughter had been ravished by a powerful chieftain of his army the magnanimous sovereign doomed the offender to death although the gothic nobles interceded for him on account of his military talents totila replied to their intercession in a speech truly royal  the nobles acquiesced in the justice of their king the distinguished ravisher suffered death for his offense and his property was given to the maiden whom he had injured persuasi dictis gothi pro satellite haud ultra deprecabantur sed regem sinebant de eo quod vellet agere is haud multo post homini vitam ademit pecunias quaecunque ejus fuerant stuprum passae dedit grotii hist goth p       a tender veneration for the fair sex was a characteristic of the northern barbarians to which caesar and tacitus have borne a more early and a very honorable testimony the latter has preserved the names of two northern old maids who appear to have been idolized by their gallant countrymen for their prophetical sagacity the most eminent of these was veleda a virgin who had extensive authority over that warlike tribe the bructeri according to the custom of the germans says tacitus which led them to worship their prophetic females as goddesses veleda maintained her dignity with all the circumspection that is proper for a maiden of a character so important she resided in a lofty tower and admitted not to her presence the roman emissaries who wished to converse with her sed coram adire alloquique veledam negatum arcebantur aspectu quo venerationis plus inesset tacitus hist lib iv  yet sharing the misfortunes of her brave countrymen this chaste prophetess fell a victim to roman tyranny and is supposed to have been a captive in rome during the reign of vespasian she had however a virgin successor in her religious office whose name was ganna and from this circumstance mr pellontier in his elaborate history of the celts has supposed with great probability that in the german tribe of the bructeri there was a regular succession of prophetical old maids histoire des celtes livre iv chap      the active valor and the enthusiastic gallantry which the manly barbarians of the north discovered even in their rudest state produced in process of time that singular and gorgeous monument of gothic genius the institution of chivalry an institution superior in some points of view to every thing that we find in the antiquities of greece and rome an institution peculiarly interesting to the sisterhood of old maids as one of its capital objects was the preservation of virginity  a literary prelate of our church has attempted in a series of letters to elucidate this noble institution and to vindicate the glory of the gothic character  but he has unluckily made two remarks which would greatly debase the very character that he wishes to exalt if they were not like many of his critical opinions entirely devoid of all solid foundation as these two remarks relate to virgins and their chaste gothic admirers and defenders i shall dwell a little on both the learned bishop asserts that the grecian hero or demigod and the gothic knight were characters completely similar or to use his own words that the grecian bacchus and hercules were the exact counterparts of sir lancelot and amadis de gaul hurds letters on chivalry letter iv  he quotes indeed the great authority of spenser for this comparison but a slight resemblance in valor and conquest was sufficient for the purpose of the poet the critic attempting to aggrandize the gothic name ought instead of adopting this poetical similitude to have shown how the grecian differed from the more noble and more virtuous goth in the great point of generous chastity the difference was extreme in the greek poem that records the adventures of bacchus one of his principal exploits is that of violating a sleeping nymph nonni dionys lib xlviii  and the incontinence of hercules was so notorious that not to mention his robbing an amazonian princess of her girdle he is said by herodotus to have cohabited with a female monster in scythia herodot lib iv  if the gothic heroes sir lancelot and amadis could start into life what punishment would they think severe enough for a critic who had rashly dared to call them the exact counterparts of these grecian ravishers in fact no comparison can be more injurious for in the heroic ages the grecian hero appears to have taken the most unwarrantable liberties with every virgin that fell into his power and the gothic knight on the contrary not only defended the purity of every maid in distress but was often bound by the most solemn oaths to remain a virgin himself  the second remark of the learned bishop is equally injurious to the pure and liberal heroes of the gothic or feudal ages for it supposes that feudal gallantry was the offspring of the privilege which the ladies then possessed of feudal succession letters on chivalry  or in other words that the gothic knights idolized the fair for their rank and riches and not for their beauty and their virtue we can believe indeed that such ideas might influence the courtly manners of a priest in the eighteenth century but a very slight acquaintance with history and romance is sufficient to convince us that such ideas were never harbored by any true knight in the purest ages of chivalry  how far the virtue of the ladies was more respected than their rank by the gallant gentry of this period we have a striking example in an anecdote related by that indefatigable searcher into the records of chivalry mr de saint palaye  this curious author informs us that the chevalier de la tour in his instructions addressed to his daughters about the year      mentions a knight of his time who in passing near the castles inhabited by ladies affixed a mark of infamy to the mansion of those who were not worthy to receive loyal knights pursuing honor and virtue he bestowed at the same time a just encomium on those whose merits entitled them to public esteem memoires sur lancienne chevalerie tom i p      that insinuating platonic love which mingled itself with the manners of chivalry has often perhaps undermined the chastity of a resolute virgin it would be a curious speculation to consider how far this refined passion has proved a treacherous destroyer of old maids and to trace its prevalence or decline in different ages but as i fear it might lead me to swell this little work into a formidable size i shall content myself with pointing out the subject as worthy the researches of my philosophical brethren and only remark that this chaste yet dangerous affection was highly fashionable at the court of england in the year      as we learn from one of howells familiar letters vol i page      and that it is ridiculed with much lively spirit in a play of sir william davenants called the platonic lovers represented in       let us return to the ages of chivalry  notwithstanding the prevalence of this perilous platonic love in those ages the spirit of the times gave such fidelity as well as vigor to all the generous affections that i am persuaded many a lovely damsel of that period became a perfect old maid from a faithful attachment to the memory of her gallant deceased admirer i consider the tender melesinda countess of tripoli in palestine as a most respectable old maid of this class the romantic troubadour geoffrey rudel became enamoured of her beauty by the mere report of her charms he crossed the sea to throw himself at her feet illness seized him on the voyage and when they carried him ashore he was supposed to be dead the singular passion of the knight touched the tender soul of the countess she hastened to visit this gallant victim of love he still breathed  received her compassionate embraces and expired with expressions of delight on the felicity of dying in her arms the countess honored his remains with a magnificent funeral and retired to lament him during her life in the chaste solitude of the cloister histoire des troubadours tom i p      strange as it may sound the virginity of woman will be often found to have derived its firmest support from the gallantry of man a paradox sufficiently explained by the preceding story  as the greeks were utterly unacquainted with the spirit of gallantry according to the confession of their learned historian mr mitford history of greece p      this may be one among other reasons to account for the extreme scarcity of elderly virgins in greece for our superior politeness and that happy mixture of frankness and delicacy in our manners toward women by which the modern world is exalted above the ancient we are certainly indebted to our noble ancestors of the north who exhibited in the earliest period of their history the most generous attention to female honor in general and a particular veneration for their intelligent old maids  end of the fifth part part vi containing miscellaneous matter chap i on certain passages in english poets concerning virginity  on the medical influence ascribed to it  on various devices supposed to ascertain it etc having examined at large in a former part of this essay the many brilliant compliments which the fathers of the church have paid to virginity i shall now consider the terms in which the greatest poets of our country have spoken of this delicate and interesting subject as enthusiasm is the essential quality both of saints and poets we might from hence conjecture that the genuine old maid would be treated with equal reverence by both but alas the poetical enthusiast is subject to a certain gay and wanton levity of spirit which tempts him now and then to fail in the respect that we all owe to the sisterhood this remark is particularly applicable to chaucer and shakespeare i am happy however in being able to add for the honor of the english muse that two poets of equal eminence have treated virginity with all the modest and tender veneration which we have seen it receiving from so many eloquent saints it will i trust be amusing to compare the language of these four illustrious bards on our favorite subject  let us begin with chaucer though he flourished at a time when the convent and chivalry those two professed guardians of maiden purity were in fashion he does not seem to have entertained any very high reverence for a perpetual virgin at least we find him treating that character with much sarcastic jocularity in the long and lively prologue with which his wife of bath introduces her tale the following lines seem to indicate that the poet himself possessed a spirit as amorous as that of the buxom lady in whose character he is speaking  what rekketh me though folk say vilanie of shrewed lamech and his bigamie i wot well abraham was an holy man and jacob eke as fer as ever i can and each of hem had wives mo than two and many another holy man also where can ye seen in any manner age that high god defended marriage by express word i pray you tells me or where commanded he virginitee i wot as well as ye it is no dread the apostle when he spoke of maidenhede he said that precept thereof had he non men may conseille a woman to ben on but conseilling is no commandment he put it in our owen jugement for had god commanded maidenhede than had he dampened wedding out of dread and certes if there were no sede ysowe virginitee than whereof should it grow tyrwhitts chaucer vol i p     it is remarkable that the argument against virginity contained in the last couplet appears also in a greek epigram by paulus silentiarius an author of the sixth century who has described the church of sancta sophia at constantinople in a very singular poem and who says in the epigram to which i allude virginity is wealth but if by all this wealth were hoarded life itself must fall  anthologia lubini  to page       let me observe for the credit of chaucer that he appears desirous of atoning for the freedom with which he had treated virgins of every class by his verses on that mavelous holy maid st caecilia a composition in which he engaged if we may believe the following introduction to it to preserve himself from the perils of licentious indolence and for to put us from swiche idelnesse that cause is of so great confusion i have here don my feithful besinesse after the legende in translation right of thy glorious lif and passion thou with thy gerlond wrought of rose and lilie thee mean i maid and martyr seinte cecilie tyrwhitts chaucer vol iii p     but if chaucer appears to have failed now and then in his veneration toward the sisterhood his transgressions against the chaste community are very trivial when compared with those of shakespeare the old maid may applaud herself for possessing a charitable spirit if she perfectly forgives this saucy prince of dramatic poets for the following passage in his comedy of all is well that ends well  it is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost that you were made of is metal to make virgins virginity by being once lost may be ten times found by being ever kept is ever lost it is too cold a companion away with it there is little can be said in it it is against the rule of nature to speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible disobedience he that hangs himself is a virgin virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate offendress against nature virginity breeds mites much like a cheese consumes itself to the very paring and so dies with feeding its own stomach besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of selflove which is the most inhibited sin in the canon keep it not you cannot choose but lose by it out with it within ten years it will make itself two which is a goodly increase and the principal itself not much the worse  away with it  it is a commodity will lose the gloss with lying the longer kept the less worth  off with it while it is vendible answer the time of request virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out of fashion richly suited but unsuitable just like the brooch and the toothpick which wear not now your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek and your virginity your old virginity is like one of our french withered pears it looks ill it eats dryly  marry it is a withered pear it was formerly better marry yet it is a withered pear all is well that ends well act i scene     let us observe as an apology for our inimitable poet that he has given us the preceding sarcasms against the sisterhood as the language of a poltroon  since the personal history of shakespeare dark as it is must be still peculiarly interesting to every english reader let me hazard a few conjectures concerning it that were suggested by the passage i have quoted  mr malone in his very ingenious and amusing attempt to ascertain the order in which the plays of shakespeare were written has allotted the comedy of all is well that ends well to the year      i was at first inclined to suppose that this elegant and accurate commentator was mistaken in this article from an idea that shakespeare could not have written such an invective against old virginity in the reign of elizabeth who prided herself on being the queen of old maids but reflection has led me into a conjecture which fanciful as it may seem to others to me appears to confirm the date assigned by mr malone to this comedy and to give also additional spirit to the passage as directly pointed against the queen herself from an honest indignation of the poet in behalf of his great friend and patron the liberal earl of southampton mr malone in speaking of this nobleman has observed that he attended lord essex on the expedition to cadiz in      as a volunteer and afterward to ireland as general of the horse from which employment he was dismissed by the peremptory orders of queen elizabeth who was offended with him for having presumed to marry miss elizabeth vernon in      without her majestys consent  now it appears to me highly probable that when his patron was thus injuriously treated by the antiquated maiden queen merely for marrying a lovely young woman it appears i say highly probable that shakespeare might at this juncture point all his wit with a generous acrimony against that old virginity which equivocal as it was his tyrannical sovereign considered as the highest of her titles in the following year      when essex was in confinement lord southampton and lord rutland as we learn from a letter of that period came not to the court at nonsuch but passed their time in london merely in going to plays every day rowland whytes letter to sir robert sidney  if the comedy in question made a part of their entertainment as it probably did they must have enjoyed with peculiar relish this spirited caricatura of old virginity as highly applicable to that malevolent affected old virgin who had so recently excited their anger and derision  this conjecture may at first appear inconsistent with the tradition that shakespeare wrote the merry wives of windsor in the year   0  at the request of elizabeth yet it is possible that her majesty might enjoin our poet to exhibit a caricatura of love in the person of falstaff to atone for the satirical freedom with which he had delineated old virginity in the speech of parolles we must at the same time confess that this imperious old maid would have probably corrected the dramatist in a manner much more severe had she ever suspected him of pointing his satire against her own princely person although she owed him much indulgence for the sublime compliment which he had formerly paid her as a fair vestal throned by the west see midsummernights dream   but it is time to quit our uncertain conjectures on this inimitable sovereign of the drama to speak with more certainty of a poet who has treated the sisterhood with superior courtesy i mean the gentle spenser who has not only celebrated the virginity of his queen in the introduction to his legend of chastity see the third book of the faerie queen  but in his character of belphoebe has given us the following beautiful description of this female perfection  that dainty rose the daughter of her morn more dear than life she tendered whose flower the girlond of her honor did adorn ne suffered she the middayes scorching power ne the sharp northern wind thereon to shower but lapped up her silken leaves most chair when so the froward sky began to lowre but soon as calmed was the crystal air she did it fair dispred and let to flourish

am tempted to add another portrait of virginity by his neglected but spirited disciple phineas fletcher who was once called the spenser of his age in his allegorical poem entitled the purple island after giving a description of agnia or chastity in the married to use the words of his own illustration he proceeds thus with her her sister went a warlike maid chastity in the single parthenia all in steel and gilded arms in needles stead a mighty spear she swayed with which in bloody fields and fierce alarms the boldest champion she down would bear and like a thunderbolt wide passage tear flinging all to the earth with her enchanted spear her goodly armor seemed a garden green where thousand spotless lilies freshly blew and on her shield the lone bird might be seen the arabian bird shining in colors new itself unto itself was only mate ever the same but new in newer date and underneath was writ such is chaste single state the purple island canto x edit      p        after a long description of this heroine the poet concludes her character in the following stanza a thousand knights wooed her with busy pain to thousand she her virgin grant denied although her dearsought love to entertain they all their wit and all their strength applied yet in her heart love close his scepter swayed that to an heavenly spouse her thoughts betrayed where she a maiden wife might live and wifely maid   but of all the poetical compliments that virginity has received none i think are so truly beautiful and sublime as those which have proceeded from the chaste enthusiasm of milton let the reader judge from the following passages of comus  the elder brother in speaking of his lost sister says she has a hidden strength         which if heaven gave it may be termed her own it is chastity my brother chastity she that has that is clad in complete steel and like a quiverd nymph with arrows keen may trace huge forests and unharbourd heaths infamous hills and sandy perilous wilds where through the sacred rays of chastity no savage fierce bandite or mountaneer will dare to soil her virgin purity yea there where very desolation dwells by grots and caverns shaggd with horrid shades she may pass on with unblenchd majesty be it not done in pride or in presumption  some say no evil thing that walks by night in fog or fire by lake or moorish fen blue meager hag or stubborn unlaid ghost that breaks his magic chains at curfeu time no goblin or swart faery of the mine has hurtful power over true virginity  do ye believe me yet or shall i call antiquity from the old schools of greece to testify the arms of chastity hence had the huntress dian her dread bow fair silvershafted queen for ever chaste wherewith she tamed the brinded lioness and spotted mountain pard but set at naught the frivolous bolt of cupid gods and men feared her stern frown and she was queen of the woods what was that snakyheaded gorgon shield that wise minerva wore unconquered virgin wherewith she freezd her foes to congealed stone but rigid looks of chaste austerity and noble grace that dashed brute violence with sudden adoration and blank awe so dear to heaven is saintly chastity that when a soul is found sincerely so a thousand liveried angels lacky her driving far off each thing of sin and guilt and in clear dream and solemn vision tell her of things that no gross ear can hear till often converse with heavenly habitants begin to cast a beam on the outward shape the unpolluted temple of the mind and turns it by degrees to the souls essence till all be made immortal comus ver        again the lady herself in her address to comus vindicates with great spirit the dignity and power of maiden excellence  to him that dares arm his profane tongue with contemptuous words against the sunclad power of chastity fain would i something say yet to what end thou have nor ear nor soul to apprehend the sublime notion and high mystery that must be uttered to unfold the sage and serious doctrine of virginity while we admire the transcendant grace and energy of miltons language let us remark in justice to an elder and admirable poet of our country that most of the preceding ideas which relate to the prerogatives of the genuine and confirmed virgin are copied from that neglected but very beautiful pastoral drama the faithful shepherdess of fletcher in this drama clorin a tender and pious nymph having buried her lover and being determined to die an old maid resides by his grave in a wood and is attended by a modest and obedient satyr the cause of this obedience from such a creature she expresses in the following speech to which milton has paid the highest honor by more than one imitation of it  what greatness or what private hidden power is there in me to draw submission from this rude man and beast  sure i was mortal the daughter of a shepherd he was mortal and she that bore me mortal prick my hand and it will bleed a fever shakes me and the selfsame wind that makes the young lambs shrink makes me acold my fear says i am mortal yet i have heard my mother told it me and now i do believe it if i keep my virgin flower uncropt pure chaste and fair no goblin woodgod fairy elf or fiend satyr or other power that haunts the groves shall hurt my body or by vain illusion draw me to wander after idle fires or voices calling me in dead of night to make me follow and so tole me on through mire and standing pools to find my ruin else why should this rough thing who never knew manners nor smooth humanity whose heats are rougher than himself and more misshapen thus mildly kneel to me sure there is a power in that great name of virgin that binds fast all rude uncivil bloods all appetites that break their confines then strong chastity be thou my strongest guard for here i will dwell in opposition against fate and hell the faithful shepherdess act i sc    we find in the same drama that the poet has ingeniously availed himself of the popular opinion concerning the medical power of the true maiden his holy shepherdess clorin says in describing herself of all green wounds i know the remedies in men or cattle be they stung with snakes or charmed with powerful words of wicked art or be they lovesick or through too much heat grown wild or lunatic their eyes or ears thickened with misty film of dulling rheum these i can cure such secret virtues lie in herbs applied by a virgins hand ibid    the salutary influence ascribed to virginity appears to have been very extensive in the old poem on sir bevis of southampton we find that noble knight preserved from his enemy the dragon by luckily stumbling into a well of miraculous purity for some time dwelled in that land a virgin full of christs sand that had been bathed in that well that ever after as men can tell might no venomous worm come therein by the virtue of that virgin wartons essay on spenser page  0 vol i    but the idea that medical powers belong to the true maiden though it was cherished by our romances of chivalry and still more by our monastic legends did not first arise from modern superstition we learn from a passage in aelian that some of the ancients admitted even the apparel of a genuine maid among the articles of their materia medica nor did they suppose the efficacy of this singular medicine confined to the human frame a horse says the author i have just mentioned may be cured of the strangury if a virgin will unloose her zone and apply it to his head that dreadful disease of man which has been supposed both in england and france to admit of no cure but from the touch of the sovereign might be healed according to the opinion of the ancients by the purer hand of virginity but as these maidenly remedies have long ceased to be fashionable in the medical world i shall not swell these volumes by enumerating the different maladies to which they were applied or the various modes of application  ceasing therefore to consider virginity as a nostrum let us proceed to remark that it has sometimes been the patient as well as the instrument of quacks it is one of the most striking foibles in man that he will often attempt to ascertain by insufficient tests many doubtful points which it would be much wiser to admit entirely upon trust hence have arisen many fanciful and fallacious devices to prove the integrity of a virgin pliny the naturalist informs us that the stone gagates of lycia was used for this curious experiment and albertus magnus is still more explicit in speaking of its wonderful property de miner lib ii de gagate  aiunt autem de expertis esse quod si colatura et ejus lotura cum rasura detur virgini bibita retinebit eam quod non minget si autem non est virgo statim minget et sic debet probari an aliqua sit virgo  a similar power of proving the fidelity of a wife is ascribed to the magnet in the pleasing little greek poem on precious stones which bears the name of orpheus ver     p    edit tyrwhitt   but the most surprising evidence that ever bore testimony against a frail woman was a bird called porphyrio which is said to have had so delicate a sense of honor that it put an end to its own existence if its mistress offended against the laws of chastity athenaeus lib ix  aelian lib iii cap      on this subject we ought not to omit the serpent kept in a temple of juno which disdained to accept any food unless offered by the pure hand of a virgin this dainty animal is mentioned by aelian and alluded to by the poet propertius who tells us in elegant and picturesque verses of which the following are an imperfect copy in pale suspense the fearful damsels gazed who to the serpents mouth rash offerings raised from the chaste maid the proffered food he takes while in her trembling hand the basket shakes talia demissae pallent ad sacra puellae cum temere anguineo creditur ore manus ille sibi admotas a virgin corripit escas virginis in palmis ipsa canistra tremunt propertius lib iv eleg      in the greek romances we find various trials of virginity circumstantially described chariclia the heroine of heliodorus is represented by that elegant and lively writer as passing with intrepid innocence through a fiery ordeal the lovely maiden arrayed in a delphic robe with her hair dishevelled and with a countenance expressing religious transport leaps on a blazing altar and stands unhurt amid the flames attracting universal admiration as more like a divinity than a mortal heliodori aethiop lib x   achilles tatius has delineated a scene of a similar kind still more picturesque he tells us that in a grove belonging to diana there was a cave of peculiar sanctity devoted to pan just within the portal of this cave a miraculous pipe was suspended formed of those reeds into which the nymph syrinx was metamorphosed when she fled from the wanton pursuit of the rustic god  a wondrous power resided in this pipe and rendered it an unquestionable test of maiden innocence whenever a true virgin entered the cave sounds of the sweetest melody proceeded from this instrument but if one who had lost her purity was rash enough to approach it the pipe continued silent and instead of music a groan of lamentation was sent forth from the cave  leucippe the heroine of tatius being accused of impurity is brought to ascertain either her guilt or innocence by this awful experiment she is surrounded by solicitous spectators her malignant accuser her anxious father and her lover suffering still stronger agitation  confident indeed in the virtue of his mistress yet trembling lest she might suffer from the wantonness of pan thus attended the virgin with a meek and modest yet intrepid dignity descends into the cave what a group for the pencil new pictures succeed  the doors of the cave now close upon her what a moment of universal anxiety  the pipe begins to sound with peculiar sweetness  the doors unfold and the virgin ascends to honor and to love what a scene of triumph and ecstacy for her father and her future husband  in the same romance we have another trial of virgin purity entitled the trial of the stygian fountain the ceremonial of it is thus described  a maiden accused of impurity swears that the accusation is false her oath is inscribed on a small tablet and with this suspended to her neck she descends into the fountain if she has sworn falsely the water begins to swell and rises till reaching her neck it overwhelms the tablet but if she is a genuine maid the placid water continues below her knee and the triumphant virgin having remained her appointed time in the fountain is led out of it by the applauding priest achilles tatius lib viii   in the romance which bears the name of the learned bishop eustathius a similar trial occurs that amusing author describes a temple of diana in which was a golden statue of the goddess bending her bow at her feet flowed a murmuring fountain by which the chaste divinity used to prove the innocence of her votaries the suspected virgin was conducted into this mysterious water with a crown of laurel on her head if she was really pure the goddess did not extend her bow the water remained calm and the maiden passed quietly through it retaining her laurel crown on her head but if to copy the expression of eustathius the breath of venus had extinguished her virgin lamp diana directed her bow against the pretended virgin and seemed to aim at her head the affrighted culprit hid herself in the stream to avoid the shaft and her laurel wreath was washed off by the murmuring water eustathius de ismeniae et ismenes amoribus lib viii   incidents of this kind seem to belong to romance yet the learned editor of eustathius in a note to this story has produced a similar anecdote from a grave historian he quotes a passage from an unpublished greek chronicle of constantinople which informs us that a statue of venus in that city had this formidable attribute of discovering the foibles of the fair it ascertained the purity of married women and of virgins both rich and poor but at last says the chronicle the sister of justins wife destroyed the statue for having detected her frailty eustathius gaulmini notarum p      the only remains of these superstitious and fantastic trials of virginity that have descended to our more refined and enlightened age appear in the common jest of trying to rekindle by the breath an extinguished candle pasquier the learned french antiquarian has written a chapter on this sportive custom he does not indeed attempt to discover its origin but gravely takes occasion from the idea to assert the despicable emptiness of all animal pleasure and to affirm on the authority of tertullian that the happiness of woman consists in her virginity pasquier recherches lib viii chap      i shall close this miscellaneous chapter by acquainting the chaste sisterhood with many vain attempts that i have made to elucidate a very mysterious proverb by which their whole order is preposterously condemned to a very strange and unworthy destiny i mean the proverb which says that old maids are doomed to lead apes in hell after consulting the profoundest antiquarians of our own country and some upon the continent i am still unable to ascertain the origin of this remarkable saying one of my ingenious friends is convinced that it was invented by the monks to allure opulent females into the cloister by teaching them that if they did not become the spouses either of man or god they must expect to be united in a future world to the most impertinent and disgusting companion for my own part i am inclined to rank an idea so injurious to my fair friends among the dismal and despicable superstitions of egypt as i find a passage in hermes trismegistus which says that those who die childless are immediately after their death tormented by demons trismegisti lib ix  i must confess however that from the very high respect which the egyptians entertained for the ape the demons intended by trismegistus could hardly be of that figure indeed the affectionate adoration which apes have sometimes received as we learn from the pious poet prudentius venerem precaris comprecare et simiam prudentius  has at times led me to conjecture that the saying in question might have arisen in some country where it bore a very different meaning from what we annex to it at present where this destiny of the ancient virgin was intended not as the punishment but the reward of her continence  i do not recollect to have seen the expression of leading apes in any english author before shirley the dramatic poet in his comedy called the school of compliment printed in      there is a scene in which to humor the madness of infortunio the several characters on the stage pretend to be damned delia among the rest declares that she was damned for being a stale virgin and that her punishment was to lead apes in hell  a living poet of our country seems to have wished to make the sisterhood amends for the insult of this injurious proverb by assigning a place to old maids in his poetical elysium as the friend and advocate of the chaste community i transcribe with singular pleasure the following verses in which their neglected merits are so liberally distinguished  turn to this cheerful band and mark in this spirits who justly claim my realms of bliss most lovely these when judged by generous truth though beauty is not theirs nor blooming youth for these are they who in lifes thorny shade repined not at the name of ancient maid no proud disdain no narrowness of heart held them from hymens tempting rites apart but fair discretion led them to withdraw from the prized honor of his proffered law to quit the object of no hasty choice in mild submission to a parents voice the valued lover with a sigh resign and sacrifice delight at dutys shrine with smiles they bore from angry spleen exempt injurious mockery and coarse contempt twas theirs to clasp each selfish care above a sisters orphans with parental love and all her tender offices supply though bound not by the strong maternal tie twas theirs to bid intestine quarrels cease and form the cement of domestic peace no throbbing joy their spotless bosom fired save what benevolence herself inspired no praise they sought except that praise refined which the heart whispers to the worthy mind hayleys triumphs of temper canto v ver      chap ii containing the discussion of a very delicate and important question as good fortune has thrown into my hands a manuscript oration on a topic highly interesting to the sisterhood i shall insert it in this chapter and to gratify to the utmost of my power the curiosity of my fair readers i shall introduce it by a little history of the incidents which have enabled me to enrich my work with so singular an embellishment  a few years ago i had the happiness of ranking among my friends a gentleman of the most amiable singularity he was a baronet of an ancient family and very ample possessions in the north of england his father who had all the convivial spirit so prevalent in that part of our island paid a very heavy tax for his bacchanalian enjoyments in suffering the frequent visits of an excruciating gout and in dying at last a martyr of the bottle my friend sir hilary highman had all the natural vivacity of his father he loved pleasure as well but warned by so striking an example he resolved to pursue it though with equal ardour yet in paths of less peril  while his father was yet living he discovered in his own frame young as it was some traces of that formidable distemper to which parental intemperance had given him too good a title this tendency he wisely determined to counteract by a steady adherence to the most simple diet yet as he was unwilling to irritate the growing illhumour of a parent whom he tenderly regarded he engaged not in this degenerate regimen till he had taken leave of the jovial testy and crippled old gentleman to embark in a favorite project of visiting the ruins of greece an opposite conduct might have endangered his future fortune as the impetuous old toper detested the character of a milksop and would not perhaps have scrupled to disinherit a son merely for renouncing that festive poison which had destroyed his own temper and was rapidly preying on the dregs of his exhausted life my friend indeed when he set out on his travels relying on the strength of his fathers constitution entertained a very lively hope of amusing the old knight on his return with a history of his adventures but the fates determined otherwise a long scene of election festivity hurried this hearty friend of bacchus to the grave and the temperate sir hilary was recalled from the ruins of athens to take possession of an estate large enough to furnish every kind of luxury to an attic imagination abstemious as he was sir hilary was a genuine disciple of epicurus he considered pleasure as the universal aim of every sensible being but the pleasure he courted was only such as arises from the indulgence of an elegant fancy and a benevolent heart he was particularly fond of female society and his passions were vehement though tender a grecian lady of exquisite beauty and accomplishments inflamed them to the highest degree and he had been privately married to her many months when the intelligence arrived which recalled him to his country the delights arising from his new connection and the general state of his fathers ruined health and temper allowed him not to feel any great poignancy or grief though he frequently spoke of the departed old gentleman with a grateful and tender regret sir hilary was far from showing any eagerness to take possession of the princely opulence which had now devolved to him his affectionate attention to his lovely greek rendered his travels homeward particularly slow this fair partner of his fortune was advanced in pregnancy her husband would have kindly waited the event on the coast of asia minor of which she was a native but it was settled at the request of the lady that they should proceed on their way to england as far as rome where she had the happiness of presenting to sir hilary two lovely boys not inferior to the twin founders of the imperial city the exulting mother soon recovered her strength with increasing loveliness and the whole party arrived with chequered sensations of joy and sorrow at the paternal seat of sir hilary the young baronet paid all decent honors to the memory of his father and handsomely provided for a few old domestics who had shared both the joviality and the infirmities of their late master he soon began to newmodel his house and to regulate his establishment in both it was his chief aim to unite elegance with comfort and gaiety with temperance he built a very spacious library with an adjoining saloon the latter was well furnished with a few admirable pictures and the former completely enriched with books busts and statues sir hilary had imbibed very early an extreme passion for grecian literature which the incidents of his life had tended to increase he particularly admired that cast of conversation which used to form the most delightful part of an ancient attic entertainment and he often wished to substitute something of this nature in the room of those dull or disgusting topics of discourse which produce such a heavy effect in the rural visits of our english gentry he was a hearty friend to every harmless social pleasure but he wished to give a little tincture of literary refinement to his convivial neighborhood this was no easy task yet sir hilary accomplished it and indeed there is hardly any enterprise too hard for a man who possessed as he did engaging manners with warm philanthropy and a very abundant portion of opulence and wit events however happened luckily to facilitate his design on his extensive estate there were two livings of considerable value they had been occupied by two orthodox topers promoted by the old baronet for their uniform adherence to the bottle these honest divines had drank so deeply together to the memory of the good old knight that they soon finished their last bumper on earth and slept in peace with their patron sir hilary seized with great pleasure this opportunity of settling in his neighborhood two gentlemen whose habits of life were congenial with his own he was happy in bestowing ease and independence on two liberal men with whom he had contracted an intimacy at college and who had been the associates of his early studies they were persons of equal integrity but of different characters literature was the passion of each but the first valued learning only as it led him to the serious practice of virtue the second loved it as the most pleasing exercise of an active and playful spirit opposite as they were in their dispositions they had a perfect esteem for each other and for the amiable patron who considered their society as one of the highest gratifications that propitious fortune had bestowed upon him these clerical friends were both in the prime of life and as they were both unmarried they were particularly caressed by the families around them by the aid of these gentlemen with a third clergyman who resided under his roof as a domestic chaplain and his assistant in the education of his children sir hilary commenced an institution which contributed not a little to the amusement of himself and his acquaintance at the full of every moon it was his custom to give a very elegant entertainment to the gentry of his neighborhood on these days in the interval between tea and supper orations were read or spoken in the spacious library on a subject proposed at the preceding assembly it was the banquet of plato an author in whom sir hilary delighted that first inspired him with this idea and in these english dialogues the moral spirit of that sublime grecian was sometimes very happily copied without any mixture of the gross indecency with which the most engaging of his productions is miserably disgraced sir hilary did not confine his entertainment to prosaic discourses but professed himself equally obliged to those guests who produced either a prose dissertation or a poetical jeu desprit on the topic of the day the verses were deposited on a large library table and usually read by sir hilarys secretary who acted as clerk to the assembly before the orations began which were generally delivered by their respective authors and sometimes without any premeditation extempore verses composed upon the spot were also kindly received and if thrown on the table while the assembly was sitting they were read by the clerk when the orations were closed as a kind of epilogue to the amusements of the day  i happened to meet my old acquaintance sir hilary in london at a time when i was greatly reduced by a severe and lingering illness he kindly insisted on my passing a few weeks with him at his country seat in the friendly hope of contributing to the recovery of my health affirming with his usual pleasantry that one of his attic banquets would prove to me a nervous cordial and conduce more than the most fashionable medicines to the revival of a literary invalid my friends institution was now indeed in a very flourishing state sir hilary had by degrees diffused around his neighborhood a spirit of amicable and elegant emulation he had particularly caressed and animated the young people in the genteel families around him and in the course of a few years he had formed in his assembly a little band of orators whom athens herself might have listened to with pleasure the ladies though they never so far forgot the delicacy of their sex as to declaim in these meetings yet contributed not a little to the general amusement by various compositions  as to myself i wished in vain for powers to take an active part in the pleasing ceremony of the place but my health was still so weak that i dared not venture on any kind of mental exertion i had however before this period conceived the first idea of my present work and wishing to derive all the advantages i could from this accomplished society i requested my friend sir hilary to propose the following question as a subject of debate in one of his assemblies  which is the more eligible for a wife a widow or an old maid  my lively friend very cheerfully acquiesced in my proposal and the topic gave birth to much innocent pleasantry and to some serious argument i heartily wish it were in my power to enrich these volumes with many of the pieces both in prose and rhyme that were produced on this occasion but all that i was allowed to treasure up amounts only to three epigrams and a single oration it is however the very oration that i was most solicitous to obtain for alas with grief i confess that although seven orators harangued upon the question one alone had generosity enough to argue on the side of the neglected sisterhood with what powers of rhetoric my reader will very soon have the opportunity of judging i shall first produce the poetical jeux desprit the first of the three following epigrams was found with other pieces of poetry on the library table and were recited according to the ceremonial i have mentioned before the orations began the others were literally produced extempore and of course were not read till the speeches were closed but as they arose from the preceding epigram i shall here insert them united  epigram on this question which is the more eligible for a wife a widow or an old maid ye who to wed the sweetest wife would try observe how men a sweet cremona buy new violins they seek not from the trade but one on which some good musician played strings never tried some harshness will produce the fiddles harmony improves by use impromptu on the preceding epigram one rule will wives and fiddles fit is falsely said i fear by wit to sad experience blind for womans an aeolian harp whose every note or flat or sharp depends upon the wind a reply to the two epigrammatists fiddles and harps no more compare improper symbols to the fair however they attract ye wits for woman let me see if music will not yield to me justly to grace the female race an image more exact woman i say or dame or lass is an harmonica of glass celestial and complete if new or by some trials known it matters not a single jot when rightly touched its every tone is ravishingly sweet there were other verses recited of a more serious cast some juvenile bards wandered a little from the subject and a young oxonian forgot the respect due to both parties concerned in the question for instead of deciding the point in debate he satirized both the widow and the old maid with much sarcastic wit and concluded with a most animated panegyric on a blooming girl of eighteen  more than one poet however pleaded the cause of the widow with energy and pathos but the frail nymphs of parnassus were so unfriendly to the claims of the elderly virgin sisterhood that no bard appeared to sing decidedly in favor of the poor old maid nor will this circumstance be thought surprising when we recollect that among the orators a more reasonable set of men than the sportive sons of apollo the old maiden found only a single advocate of the six speakers who argued with vehemence for the widow the most amusing was a lively and honest foxhunter not remarkable for erudition but possessed of strong mental powers in a robust constitution and happy in a rich vein of original humor this gentleman was actually in chase of a young opulent and lovely widow he gloried in this pursuit and being animated with the fairest prospect of success he spoke with peculiar force and felicity on the topic of the day i must confess that he sometimes threw the audience into a kind of panic by appearing to gallop very fast toward the precipice of indecency but whenever he found himself on the brink of it he rapidly made so delicate and dexterous a turn that he converted the terrors of the company into ease admiration and good humor  the debate on this side of the question was closed by a speaker of an opposite character he was a gentleman of extensive learning and a grave deportment yet easy in his address and forcible in his elocution he gave us a serious yet entertaining history of widowhood and enumerated the happy events and the illustrious characters to which the second marriage of some eminent widows had given birth when his peroration was ended which being tender and pathetic formed a pleasing contrast to the humorous arguments of his predecessor a gentleman arose who possessed with a very graceful person an uncommon archness of countenance and in a voice peculiarly melodious he delivered the following oration  mr president though i was aware that a very formidable majority of speakers would appear against me it is yet with confidence that i engage on the unpopular side of the present question a question upon which the prejudices the passions and the practice of mankind are in direct opposition to the clearest dictates of reason and of justice yes sir i will be so bold as to affirm that if the conduct and the opinions of men were under the steady guidance of equity this question could not remain doubtful for a single minute in the mind of any man it must be decided without a moments hesitation in favor of that injured that derided being the involuntary old maid whose advocate i profess myself nor would such a decision depend on any prior sentiments which the arbiter might form to the discredit or to the glory of wedlock for whether we consider marriage as a burden or as an enjoyment it is equally unjust that any female should twice suffer that burden or be twice indulged in that enjoyment while another at the same period of life is kept an utter stranger to the cares or to the delights of an important office which she is equally ready to assume and equally able to support this position is i trust so evident that if i could convert this assembly into the supreme court of judicature and bring to its bar both the widow and the old maid as rival claimants of the nuptial coronet on the mere principles of right i am persuaded the integrity of this audience would soon terminate the contest and ratify the title of my client by an unanimous decree but alas in this point there is no tribunal on earth to which the disconsolate old maiden can successfully apply for substantial justice the clamor of prejudice is against her and her pretensions are derided while custom and commodity that smoothfaced gentleman tickling commodity are such active and prosperous agents for her antagonist the widow that she this insidious antagonist is admitted perhaps three four or even five times to the recent altar of hymen while my unfortunate client the neglected old maid however wishfully she may look toward the portal is not allowed to find even a temporary shelter within a portico of the temple  can this sir be called equity is it not injustice is it not barbarity  but i may be told that in the common occurrences of life in a transaction such as marriage peculiarly subject to fancy and caprice we must not expect we must not require men to observe the nicer dictates of strict equity and a speculative rule of right  be it so  i will not therefore on this important question appeal solely to the consciences of men i will appeal to their interests i will prove to them that he who marries an old maid has a much greater chance of being invariably beloved by his wife or in other words of being happy in wedlock than he has who rashly throws himself into the open arms of a widow  sir i flatter myself it will require no long chain of arguments to establish and fortify on the most solid ground this momentous position i trust that i shall be able to accomplish it merely by reminding this audience of a propensity in the human mind which cannot be called in question i mean the propensity to exalt in our estimation those possessions of which we are deprived and to sink the value of what is actually in our hands  sir the first part of this propensity is so general and it operates with such amazing force on the character to whom i wish to apply it that i remember the admirable fielding with a most happy coincidence of humor and of truth calls the death of an husband an infallible recipe to recover the lost affections of a wife  let me sir entreat this assembly to retain in their thoughts the propensity i have mentioned and then to contemplate with me the feelings of the late widow toward her second or third husband and the feelings of the quondam old maid now joyfully united to her first and only love  sir the affection of the remarried widow is a pocket telescope she directs the magnifying end of it toward her good man in the grave and it enlarges to a mavelous degree all the mental and all the personal endowments of the dear departed she then turns the inverted glass to his diminishing successor and whatever his proportion of excellence may be the poor luckless living mortal soon dwindles in her sight to a comparative pigmy but sir this is not the case with our quondam old maid no sir  her affection is a portable microscope which magnifies in a stupendous manner all the attractive merits and powers of pleasing however inconsiderable they may be in the favorite creature upon whom she gazes like an inexperienced but a passionate naturalist she continues to survey the new and sole object of her contemplation not only with unremitted assiduity but with increasing amazement and delight he fills her eye he occupies her mind he engrosses her heart  but it may be said in reply if the man who marries an old maid has this superior chance of being uniformly beloved by his wife since it is certainly the wish of every man who marries to be so how happens it that men decide so preposterously against themselves and perpetually prefer the widow to the old maid is not this constant preference a very strong argument in favor of the character so preferred does it not prove that the widow has acquired the art or the power of conferring more happiness on her second husband than the old maid is able to bestow upon her first for can we suppose that men instructed by the experience of ages would continue to act in constant opposition to their own domestic happiness in the most important article of human life  alas sir i fear there are more articles than one in which we inconsiderate mortals may be frequently observed to act against experience against our reason and against our felicity that the widow is constantly preferred to the old maid i most readily admit nay i complain of it as an inveterate grievance but i trust sir that i can account for this unreasonable preference without adding a single grain to the weight or rather to the empty scale of the widow  i believe sir a very simple metaphor will illustrate the whole affair on both sides  the widow is an experienced and a skilful angler who has acquired patience to wait for the favorable minute and rapidity to strike in the very instant when the fish has fairly risen to the hook by this double excellence her success is ensured but alas sir the old maid is an angler whom fruitless expectation has rendered both impatient and unskilful she is thrown into trepidation by the first appearance of a nibble and by making a too hasty movement at that critical juncture she too often renders her bait however sweet it may be an object of terror instead of allurement to what she wishes to catch though my allusion may sound a little coarsely let me entreat you sir not to imagine that i mean to express any degree of disrespect to my honest and worthy client the unprosperous old maid allow me sir to remind you that ingenuous and unhacknied spirits though actively inclined are often reduced to do nothing by their too eager desire to do well and this is frequently the case of the good and delicate old maid in her laudable project of securing a husband so that even when she is herself the cause of her own failure in this worthy purpose she deserves not our censure but our compassion yes sir the partisans of the widow may smile if they please at my assertion but i scruple not to affirm that the solitary neglected old maid is more truly entitled to pity that soft harbinger of love than the weeping widow herself much has been said and i confess with great eloquence on the widows attractive sorrow it is indeed attractive and so attractive that it has frequently recalled to my imagination the moan of the hyaena that artful destructive and insatiable creature who is said by the ancient naturalists to lure into her den by a treacherous cry of distress the unwary traveller whom she intends to devour this insidious behavior of the hyaena is a questionable fact that no one perhaps can fully prove or refute but all persons of any experience in the world have seen instances of men who have been allured into the snare of the widow and have lamented when it was too late to retreat that they fell the victims of their own generous but misplaced compassion  the habit of changing is very apt to produce a passion for novelty and the wife who has buried one or two husbands on a slight disagreement with her second or third will soon wish him to sleep in peace with his departed predecessor from her hope of being more lucky in her next adventure you may remember sir that our old poet chaucer that admirable and exact painter of life and manners has very happily marked this prevalent disposition of the remarried widow in the long prologue which he assigns to his wife of bath that good lady glories in having already buried four husbands and expresses a perfect readiness whenever heaven may give her the opportunity to engage with a sixth let it not be said that this character is a mere phantom created by the lively imagination of a satirical and facetious poet no sir this venerable though sportive old bard copied nature most faithfully and as a proof that he did so in the present case i will mention a more mavelous example of this passion in the remarrying widow for an unlimited succession of novelties sir the example i mean is recorded in an ecclesiastical writer of great authority whose name i cannot in this moment recollect but i remember he mentions it as a fact which happened at rome and to which he was himself an eyewitness this fact sir was the marriage of a widow to her twentysecond husband the man also had buried twenty wives and all the eyes of rome were fixed on this singular pair as on a couple of gladiators anxious to see which would conduct the other to the grave if i remember right the woman after all her funeral triumphs was the victim in this wonderful conflict but the story however it might terminate sufficiently proves the passion for novelty which i have ascribed to the widow now sir if the second or third husband of a widow may have frequent cause to imagine that his ladys transferrable affections are veering toward his probable successor he cannot surely be so happy or secure as the man who has more wisely united himself to a worthy old maid she good soul remembering how long she waited for her first husband instead of hastily looking forward to a second will direct all her attention to cherish and preserve the dear creature whom she at last acquired after tedious expectation her good man has no rival to fear either among the living or the dead and may securely enjoy the delightful prerogative of believing himself the absolute master of his wifes affections i entreat you sir to observe how very different the case is with the inconsiderate man who rashly married a widow he has not only to apprehend that the changeable tenderness of his lady may take a sudden turn toward his probable successor but if her thoughts are too faithful and too virtuous to wander toward the living even then sir after all his endeavors to take full possession of her heart though he may delude himself with the vain idea of being its sole proprietor he will frequently find that he has only entered into partnership with a ghost yes sir though my opponents may treat the expression as ludicrous i will maintain that it is literally just i repeat he has entered into partnership with a ghost and i will add sir the very probable consequence of such a partnership he will soon find that by the subtle illusions of his invisible partner he has lost even his poor moiety in that precarious possession the heart of a remarried widow and will find himself at the same time a real bankrupt in happiness since my antagonists have been pleased to smile at my expression as the language rather of fancy than of truth suffer me mr president to quote a case in which this dead this derided partner made his actual appearance and was bold enough to urge an exclusive claim sir i trust the case i allude to is a case directly in point it is quoted indeed on a different occasion by the admirable addison from the seventeenth book of the jewish historian josephus i mean the case of the widow glaphyra who having been twice a widow took for her third husband archelaus you may remember sir that the thoughts of this lady after her third adventure ran so much on her first lord that she saw the good man in a vision  glaphyra said the phantom thou have made good the old saying that women are not to be trusted was not i the husband of thy virginity have i not children by thee how could thou forget our loves so far as to enter into a second marriage and after that into a third  but for our passed loves i will free thee from thy present reproach and make thee mine for ever  glaphyra related her dream and died soon after this sir is a serious and tragical proof how dangerous it is to marry a widow surely no considerate man would choose to incur the hazard of having his bride thus torn from his embraces by so arrogant a phantom  allow me sir to relate a story of a comic cast which will equally prove the secret perils of such a marriage i received it from a very worthy old gentleman not unknown to this assembly he was acquainted in his youth with a famous mimic of the last century who was the principal actor in this comic or rather farcical scene and related it circumstantially to my friend this mimic sir a man of pleasantry and adventure courted in the early part of his life a very handsome and opulent widow she gave him the highest encouragement but as avarice was her foible she at last jilted him for a wealthy suitor who though of a very timid constitution was rash enough to marry this very tempting widow the discarded mimic was inflamed with a variety of passions and determined to take some very signal revenge an opportunity of vengeance occurred to him which as he knew the extreme timidity of his fortunate rival he seized without the pause of apprehension his valet had intrigued with the favorite abigail of the widow and by her assistance the mimic commanded the nuptial chamber of the bride he had known the person of her first husband and having concealed himself under a toilet till the hour of consummation he then made his appearance assuming the most exact similitude both in figure and voice to the dear departed he had hardly undrawn the curtain when the affrighted bride fell into a fit the bridegroom who had also known his deceased predecessor was seized with a panic still worse and his trembling body soon diffused so powerful an effluvia that although it contributed nothing to his own relief it recovered the lady from her swoon she revived in perfect possession of her senses and finding the dead husband vanished and the living one unfit for a companion she hastily arose as she loved money she had taken the prudent precaution of securing to herself the enjoyment of her own fortune and having some suspicion of the trick which had been played against her she resolved to make a wise use of it and declared that she would never proceed to consummate her marriage with a man who had not resolution enough to protect her from a ghost she persisted in this conduct and the luckless derided bridegroom remained through life a melancholy example to confirm the wisdom of that adage which says that he should indeed be a bold man who enters into the service of a widow  sir i should entreat your pardon for having trespassed on the patience of this assembly by the recital of so long a story did i not flatter myself that it will have a happy tendency to guard the single gentlemen who hear me from the iniquitous temerity of preferring a widow to an old maid  i might allege sir many arguments which i have not hitherto touched upon in favor of my client i might show of what infinite importance it is to matrimonial felicity that the husband should receive into his arms a partner for life whose disposition and habits instead of being fixed already by a former lord are yet to be molded according to the will and abilities of her first and only director sir in this point the widow is a piece of warped wood which the most skilful workman may find himself unable to shape as he wishes but the old maid sir is the pliant virgin wax which follows with the most happy ductility every serious design every ingenious device every sportive whim of the modeller  but i will relinquish the innumerable arguments that i might yet adduce in support of the old maid i will rest her cause on that solid rock which i have endeavored sir to exhibit in different points of view i mean the superior security with which her husband may depend on the stability of her affection i will conclude by conjuring every gentleman who may happen to hesitate between a widow and an old maid to remember that reason and experience that equity and the general interest of mankind all loudly plead for his preferring the latter i will conjure him to recollect that the man who marries a widow has great cause to apprehend unreasonable expectations unpleasant comparisons and variable affection while he who marries an old maid may with confidence prepare to meet unexacting tenderness increasing gratitude and perpetual endearments  i will not presume to comment on the preceding oration but merely add that the ecclesiastical author from whom the ingenious speaker has cited a most remarkable anecdote is st jerome it is contained in one of his epistles addressed to a widow whose name was ageruchia i shall transcribe the words of the saint at the bottom of the page rem dicturus sum incredibilem sed multorum testimoniis approbatam ante annos plurimos quum in chartis ecclesiasticis juvarem damasum romanae urbis episcopum et orientis atque occidentis

friend for the permission to print his speech and by expressing a cordial wish that my readers may bestow on it as much favor and applause as it received from the amicable and polite assembly in which it was delivered  chap iii the concluding chapter of the essay containing a sermon to old maids delivered in a dream the most sanguine projector that ever wasted his fortune and his brains in the smoke of expectation never thought on the golden crown of all his labors with more assiduity and hope than i have thought on the amusement and advantage which i trust will accrue to the community of old maids from this elaborate essay the good spinsters have frequently engrossed me sleeping as well as waking in proof of this affectionate assertion i shall close my work with a circumstantial account of a very singular vision which my extreme solicitude for their interest most certainly produced  i had been reading in a hot summers day a little too soon after dinner one of the greek homilies on virginity when my attention gradually diminished and sleep imperceptibly stole upon me i found myself transported on a sudden from my own narrow study and a little circle of dingy folios to the middle of a large and magnificent apartment it appeared to be the refectory of a very populous convent at the upper end of it were two doors the one which stood open discovered to me a very elegant and extensive chapel the other as i found in the sequel led into a set of apartments appropriated to the lady abbess of this chaste but unfettered society i was soon informed by a group of courteous females who were walking for the purposes of exercise and conversation in this spacious hall that the ample and sumptuous fabric had been raised by the contribution of many elderly virgins all of liberal birth and education though unequal in their fortunes who forming themselves into a very numerous yet friendly community dwell together with quiet industry and social content  we are governed said a kind and communicative sister of the house who with a disposition that appeared to me peculiarly angelical in an ancient virgin expressed more eagerness to satisfy my curiosity than her own we are governed by a president of our own sex who is annually elected by a majority of our sisterhood but though we formally exert the privilege of election we have never had but one and the same governess for the lady who first planned and has since directed our society is constantly rechosen into the delicate and important office which she discharges to the satisfaction of all with whom she is connected how madam i exclaimed how may i obtain the happiness of beholding a personage so extraordinary you will probably behold her very soon replied my kind informer returning into this saloon from our adjoining chapel you may distinguish she continued through that open door a distant party engaged about the altar among them you may just discern our president seraphina with her two favorite assistants melesinda and fuscina they are employed in a melancholy yet pleasing office in decorating the tomb of an amiable old divine who formed a part of our household and was indeed to have appeared in the character of our pastor but as from motives of maidenly discretion we chose the good man in a very advanced and infirm period of life he has never been able to ascend the pulpit prepared for him we were afraid of wounding both him and ourselves by appointing any substitute for him while we could hope for his recovery and have therefore subsisted hitherto without any acting minister except one selected from ourselves for the mere purpose of reading the chapel service of the day for we are very punctual in our daily devotions and now the good old man is departed our president will probably soon choose for us a preacher who may fill more effectually the department of the deceased my pulse quickened as she spoke but the mingled sentiments of surprise joy and ambition rendered me unable to frame an immediate reply never did the hot pericranium of any dean or provost so itch and burn for an expected mitre as mine did at this moment for a certain square cap of white velvet adorned with a silver tassel which now glittered in my view it was suspended to the wall of the saloon at the center of the diningtable and my goodnatured informer who observed with what an inquiring eye i surveyed it very kindly told me it was the work of their fair president prepared as a mark of affectionate distinction for the pastor of this maiden flock while this shining object of my chaste ambition still attracted my eyes and i was still listening to several interesting little anecdotes concerning it the lady abbess and her attendants began to move toward me my heart fluttered as they advanced though a considerable space was yet between us i was struck with a trembling and speechless awe by the air of complacent grandeur which appeared in the form and countenance of seraphina never did a young volunteer presented for the first time to the imperial catherine of russia feel a more ardent unutterable desire to serve his fair sovereign in the field or the cabinet than i felt to recommend myself to the very different favors of this dignified lady but how is it possible thought i to myself as she was approaching to make her suddenly my patroness her character and all her features assure me that she is utterly devoid of ambition and desire those quick and powerful springs by the means of which the fraternity of eloquent and able ministers have so often and so rapidly been exalted by the queens and abbesses of their respective countries but there is a nobler passion my heart inwardly said to itself that by actuating both of us alike may facilitate my success with seraphina and this is our mutual zeal for the felicity of her fellowmaidens could this fair president of autumnal virgins be made acquainted with all that i have thought and all that i have written in behalf of old maids  but here is my difficulty and distress how can i explain to her in a few minutes the long labors of my life  while these ideas were passing with confused rapidity in my mind seraphina advanced very near to me the mild dignity of her aspect extorted from me a bow of affectionate admiration i made an imperfect effort to tell her so but before i could utter a single sentence to recommend myself as i wished to her favor she saluted me by my name to my infinite astonishment and proceeded to inform me with a graceful and engaging familiarity that the departed minister was one of my old friends who had given her a complete idea both of my person and my character expressing a wish on his deathbed in the most flattering terms that i might be chosen to succeed him in the pastoral care of this sisterhood we are no strangers continued the polite seraphina to the benevolent cast of your studies and we look with peculiar gratitude on a person whose pen has been long employed with a very singular humanity to amuse to instruct and i may say to honor a certain class of females whom the unthinking world have incessantly wounded with derision or neglect it is possible sir she added that your book to which i allude however enriched and adorned with learning and with fancy with reason and with wit it is possible i say that this book may not find more kindness from the world than what has hitherto attended the degraded order of beings to whom it is so generously devoted but whatever fate may attend your work whose merits have been fully explained to us we shall at least enjoy the happiness of securing you from many of those humiliating personal evils to which the greatest authors have been exposed if you will allow us to appoint you the preacher of our chapel  seraphina paused for my reply but my head and heart were too full to allow me the use of speech in the first moments of my surprise and exultation i made her the profoundest reverence that a body not perfectly elastic could accomplish it was as low as the bow of a newcreated bishop to his earthly maker yet i fear it was not so much the genuine movement of humility as of pride  seraphina seemed to read all my sentiments and to relieve me from the perplexing difficulty of putting my thanks into proper words she thus pursued her discourse  it is now the usual hour of our morning prayers will you allow me sir the pleasure of introducing you to your new office you will find the books of our chapel in order and i doubt not but as you have long meditated on the good and evil of our single state you can oblige us on the instant with a sermon adapted to our sequestered condition  much as i was elated by the flattering appointment i felt myself embarrassed by this proposal in truth i was utterly unprepared and wished to excuse myself on the score of my dress thinking it improper to appear as the pastor of these elegant though ancient maidens in a rusty black coat which time and snuff had conspired to disfigure but casting such a downward glance on my own person as every man does who means to ground an apology on his habit i was astonished to find myself arrayed in a new cassock my amazement increased on perceiving that my right hand which held a clean cambrick handkerchief was decorated with a magnificent ring not of diamond indeed but formed by a single sapphire of uncommon magnitude and luster without disturbing my brain to account for my acquisition of this surprising ornament i bowed again to the fair president and followed her toward the chapel my ring had acted as a talisman to dispel my embarrassment and i advanced with such an air of confidence as i have formerly observed in a courtly preacher apparently inspired not indeed by the inward light of the soul but by the radiance beaming from his own little finger  we now entered the chapel it was a structure of exquisite proportions in which elegance and simplicity were most happily united the walls were covered with a stucco of very pale dovecolour enriched with decorations of white marble consisting chiefly of emblematic figures expressive of innocence and peace the only painting which this edifice contained was of glass it formed the rich and magnificent window to which the chapel was indebted for all the light it received the effect of this window was truly celestial not only from the happy disposition of that soft and solemn radiance which it diffused over the building but from the transcendent beauty of the figures with which it was enriched chastity was here represented in a meek yet firm position supported by temperance and fortitude and paying a kind of modest homage to charity and faith the two latter were raised on a slight elevation and being united by a posture of sisterly endearment formed the pyramidical point in this enchanting group the distinct character of every personage was so exquisitely conceived and so forcibly expressed the connection of all was rendered so happily visible by their attention to each other that no spectator could behold this little assembly of virtues without feeling a tender reverence for each and without wishing to become the perfect votary of all  while i gazed on this enchanting picture the bell began to toll the numerous sisterhod came flocking to their seats i advanced to the reading desk i adjusted the books i went through the service and now with a heart that began to palpitate afresh i ascended the pulpit a multitude of curious and piercing eyes flashed upon me but my embarrassment was a little relieved by a hymn of the divinest melody most admirably sung by a few sisters of the house in the time which this soothing ceremony allowed me to collect my hurried spirits it struck me that the unknown power to whom i was indebted for my cassock and my ring might have happily supplied me with a supernatural sermon in this hope i now searched my pockets but to my utter disappointment i could find only a small copy of the old testament in confusion and distress i turned hastily to such passages as i thought might befriend me on the present occasion my eye suddenly fastened on a text that pleased me i closed the volume fat in profound thought for a few minutes then rose with inward exultation and delivered the following discourse  in the   th chapter of judges and at the   th verse it is thus written  she went with her companions and bewailed her virginity  alas the tenderhearted might say to themselves on first hearing these few and simple words how frequent how universal is such lamentation  in every age and in all the civilized nations of the globe many inconsiderate daughters of eve have been hastily led into penitence and sorrow by the violence or the artifice of an imperious and a deceitful passion and often have they bewailed the dishonorable loss of that maiden purity regarded as the best and perhaps the only treasure which nature and fortune had bestowed upon them  but it was not so with the fair mourner in my text she was the chaste and honored daughter of jephtha the judge of israel she bewailed not the loss of her virginity but that she was destined to carry it to the grave being condemned to die in compliance with the rash vow of her father she lamented not the immediate stroke of death but the idea of dying without having fulfilled her fair expectations of nuptial happiness and maternal delight  before i proceed to any remarks on this interesting story let me here observe to you my sisters that the learned and pious men who have endeavored to elucidate the obscurer passages of the old testament are by no means agreed on the real fate of this lovely victim some contend that she actually perished by a violent death and others affirm that she was only condemned to perpetual virginity i will not enter upon the merits of this question because in whatever light the history of this fair sufferer may be considered it equally affords me a proper groundwork for the doctrine i wish to inculcate her sorrow whatever its duration might be naturally leads me to point out to you a great and important truth a truth my sisters in which you are principally concerned and it is this  that to pass through human life either by a short or a long journey and finally to quit it in the character of a virgin is by no means a just cause for lamentation  do not mistake me i mean not to reflect with a cruel asperity on jephthas unhappy daughter i mean not to insinuate aught against the temper or the modesty of the damsel that would indeed be barbarous when her strange mischance was so peculiarly severe as to plead for the tenderest sympathy and compassion she came out to meet her victorious father with timbrels and with dances and she was his only child beside her he had neither son nor daughter how bitter must be the condition of this darling child when she found her triumphant festivity turned to anguish by the vow of her precipitate parent every humane heart must bleed at the idea and the more when it remarks with what an affectionate magnanimity she submitted to her fate  and she said unto him my father if thou have opened thy mouth unto the lord do to me according to that which has proceeded out of thy mouth forasmuch as the lord has taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies  generous heroic maiden she enjoyed the past triumph of her father in her own present calamity and despair her first sentiments were those of the affectionate disinterested daughter if these were followed by a more selfish idea it was suggested by a national custom and arose not from any defects in the spirit and character of the devoted victim but let us hear how she proceeded and she said unto her father let this thing be done for me let me alone two months that i may go up and down upon the mountains and bewail my virginity i and my fellows  strange as her request may sound in a modern ear it appeared reasonable to her father and he said go  and well might he say so for her petition was not the dictate of a wanton and dissolute spirit preparing to lament the loss of expected pleasure with coarseness of sentiment and indelicacy of language no it proceeded only from her wish to observe a religious ceremony which prevailed among the unmarried females of her country who considered the destiny of living and of dying in a single state as the severest evil that heaven could inflict this idea was indeed universal among the jews but the jews were a moody and a murmuring people perpetually disposed to quarrel not only with the common incidents of life but with the most merciful dispensations of their god it is the perversity of their general judgment on this head and not the particular conduct of one most amiable and unfortunate maiden that i mean to censure to guard the whole sisterhood against the insidious approaches of discontent i would here demonstrate that to bewail virginity in the jewish sense of bewailing it is equally irrational and irreligious  a custom however reprehensible which has prevailed among any civilized people deserves to be fairly considered and will generally be found to possess some important advantage to plead in its behalf this was undoubtedly the case in the custom i allude to it wanted not the plea of political wisdom the female ceremony of bewailing virginity had assuredly a strong tendency to promote wedlock and in this point of view it merited the countenance of a wise legislator  but observe with what cruelty it must have operated upon one unprotected class of the community how wretched must have been the condition of an elderly maiden among the jews if such a character existed among them when she was taught by the prejudices of the public to despise and to detest herself as the object of human contempt and divine displeasure  it is an image of humiliation and distress too grievous for a gentle heart to dwell upon let us hasten to contemplate the very different condition of the same character among the early christians  here indeed we behold an excess but of a more cheerful and amiable complexion not an excess of absurd barbarity but of tender enthusiasm instead of bewailing virginity as an evil they exalted it into an evidence of supernatural merit they regarded it as a clear title not only to celestial bliss but to the highest degree of beatitude that heaven can bestow  i will not basely attempt to ingratiate myself with this audience by adopting from the fathers of the catholic church a flattering illusive doctrine to which the purity of our reformed religion can afford no countenance for it was not countenanced by that meek and righteous master whose life and language are the great unerring lights that we profess to follow  though an advocate for a single life st paul himself acknowledges that concerning virgins he had no commandment of the lord  and indeed we find nothing in the words or actions of our blessed savior that can be fairly construed into a recommendation of their single state that he was very far from being a morose enemy to the joys and even the festivity of marriage one of his own miracles has sufficiently evinced he seems not however to have shown any prejudice or partiality toward any particular order of human beings but to have respected all the different conditions of that life which for the good of all he condescended to assume he respected the natural liberties of mankind he interfered with no civil or social duties he forbad no innocent pleasures and what is more to our present purpose he recommended not an adherence to any precise state of life because his own divine institutions are adapted to every condition into which a human creature can be thrown by those busy shifters of human scenery time and chance  but it may be said although we readily allow the benign influence of christianity upon all who sincerely profess it we are warranted by reason and experience in affirming that certain modes of life have a tendency to throw a gloom over the mind and to produce such a dejection of spirit as naturally leads to lamentation and is not the celibacy of an ancient virgin an example of this truth  we feel the full force of this question and imagination sets before us what the world exhibits daily to many a spectator a disconsolate maiden the daughter of an opulent father yet accidentally deprived of all her fair prospects all her tenderest connections and destitute of fortune in the decline of life  shall we say to this solitary virgin bewail not your condition for if you are a good christian you should be happy  no we will not address her thus and shame on those illinstructed ministers of christ who insult the wretched with such abrupt and unfeeling admonition it is our duty to penetrate with insinuating tenderness into the painful recesses of a suffering spirit let us gently search into the natural train of thought which depresses the unfortunate virgin and pursue that line of consolation which the present turn of her own mind may effectually suggest  by what is she depressed by the contrast which memory presents to her between the gay festivity of her early days and the neglect and solitude to which she is now reduced by the comparison which imagination suggests to her between her own desolate condition and the different destiny of those female companions of her youth who were so fortunate as to marry let us follow this clue and it may enable us to lead the dejected sufferer from the labyrinth of perplexed and gloomy thoughts into light and peace let us first indulge and humor the melancholy of her spirit let us allow the seeming severity of her lot let us say to her you have indeed been unjustly overlooked by men who have pitched upon companions less attractive and have shared their wealth and splendour with partners far less deserving but before you estimate their supposed felicity examine the real state of those associates of your youth whom marriage has placed in a condition so different from your own  let us try the first  she is a woman of rank of opulence of gaiety but her innocence was undermined by the supposed constituents of her visionary happiness and your heart is too pure to envy pleasures debased by infamy or loaded with remorse  let us proceed to a second  behold a woman whom nature and education had rendered a lovely compound of vivacity and virtue she was wedded to the man of her choice with the sanction of her delighted parents the figure the reputation and the fortune of her husband made her the envy of all her fair single friends but alas could they have read her destiny she would have excited only compassion for she soon found that the pleasing manners the enchanting talents and the bright semblance of integrity in the man whom she fondly thought all perfection covered a mind corrupted by licentious pleasure and a heart that could only counterfeit for a very short period all the generous characteristics of genuine love his passion was extinguished by a few weeks possession and she then experienced in return for real and anxious affection mortifying neglect contemptuous sarcasm and perpetual infidelity his vices soon produced their natural effect the ruin of his fortune his temper and his health haunted by every painful recollection he now vainly tries to drown in deeper intemperance all ideas of his misery while the innocent and still lovely victim of his various crimes surrounded by indigent and deserted children looks up to those her former companions who have remained unmarried as the most enviable of human beings  but let us pass on to a third and a much happier example of married life  here indeed as you truly observe here we find every circumstance of character and condition that is justly entitled to the name of fortunate in this person we may behold the beloved wife of an affectionate and a sensible husband the healthy and opulent mother of a numerous and lovely offspring she has a heart and spirit to relish happiness and she is surrounded by every thing that is likely to give and to increase it her condition is in truth opposite to that of the elderly indigent and solitary maiden  but let us take a nearer view of this fortunate personage let us visit the mansion of felicity  where is the gaiety that should surround it  good heavens what evil has befallen it  all is disorder and distress  mischance has happened to one of the young and favorite branches of this flourishing house  it is the cry of the distracted mother over her darling torn from her by a calamitous death  let us retire for her we cannot comfort  her grief can be alleviated only by that almighty power who has permitted it to be inflicted but we have received our lesson in the piercing sound of her distress a single shriek of the mother on the expiration of her child ought to drown for ever all the petty murmuring of maidenly discontent  let it not be said that such calamities are rare who has ever known a numerous family unvisited by sickness and sorrow o ye considerate virgins let me lead you to form a true estimate of all the good and evil in female life place if you please to the account of the wife and mother all the more intense and more lively pleasures but enter fairly at the same time her anxieties her terrors her agonies both of body and of mind enter also on your own side of the account your exemption from all these forget not the more certain and quiet enjoyments which particularly belong to your own condition examine the two accounts with strict impartiality and perhaps you will find that in a course of years the balance has run considerably in your favor  but it should not be the sole business of a mortal to regard the enjoyments of human life a concern more important demands the attention of us all i mean the preparation for death it is hardly possible that the virgin can be properly prepared for this inevitable hour who has reached the latter end of a long life in the habit of murmuring at her own lot and thereby condemning the dispensations of that god in whose presence she is so soon to appear but on the other hand the ancient maiden who has supported the neglect and injustice of mankind with pious resignation and content has such advantages over the married woman in the aweful and important close of human existence as more than repays her for any supposed or real inferiority in the point of worldly enjoyments let us pursue this idea it leads us to interesting contemplation circumstances that attend the dying of every station are particularly deserving of our notice because however different the degrees and fashions of our lives in the act of death we must all resemble each other it is a trial universally endured though variously sustained let me then conduct you my sisters to two scenes of this kind different from each other yet both affecting and instructive  let us first approach and consider the deathbed of the wife  behold a woman of virtue and of piety behold her after many blessings thankfully received and many duties faithfully discharged behold her devoutly hastening to her heavenly reward  see though her frame is shattered her mind is still sedate  yet see with what tender anguish she takes leave of an afflicted husband who has been her fond and faithful guide in the paths of innocence and religion  observe how her fortitude is shaken by reading in his features a vehemence of distress bursting through the kind mask of resignation which in pity to her sufferings he vainly labors to wear  yet even this is not her severest trial as her life is hastening to its close she yields to a parental and irresistible desire she calls for her children to fold them for the last time to her bosom  good heavens what a scene  o god release her for she has lost the firmness of piety itself  her soul engrossed by the wants and sorrows of these little innocents and by a dreadful idea of what they may suffer should their father also be taken from them  her distracted soul pays no longer its just obedience to the summons of her maker  yet thou art not offended almighty parent for there are weaknesses peculiarly entitled to thy mercy and such are the fond excesses of a maternal heart to which thou have allotted the extremes of delight and agony  let us turn from this heartrending scene to one though equally aweful yet much less afflicting let us approach the deathbed of the ancient maiden  behold a woman not endued with a more cultivated understanding or with more habitual piety than the dying mother whom we have just beheld but o with what a different frame of mind and heart does the present expiring mortal support the most striking if not the most important of human trials observe with what serenity she contemplates the visible approach of that destroying power who has been called the king of terrors  she has led a life of innocence and content but her soul is not rivetted to earth by those earthly fetters which in the preceding instance the twin seraphs hope and faith were hardly able to unlock here religion operates without a check this elderly expiring virgin has indeed her tender attachments to relinquish but she bids adieu to her friends with the placid air of one who is setting forth on a longwishedfor journey she does not hurry from the world with the overheated enthusiasm of romish nuns who call themselves with an unbecoming familiarity and fervor of language the spouses of their god  no she contemplates the gracious promises of her redeemer with the humble confidence of a faithful and affectionate servant she prepares to meet him with the meek obedience of tender humanity and unperverted reason willing to quit a world where she has been frequently wronged and neglected to enter those blessed regions where neglect or injustice can never be admitted  o my sisters what is the lesson that these contrasted scenes may suggest to us is it not this that every good and wise virgin of advanced life instead of sinking into the jewish folly of bewailing her virginity should regard it as a passport from providence which may have conducted her through a vexatious world exempt from many of its severest troubles and which may at last enable her to pass the gates of death not with reluctant anguish but with rational composure and devout exultation  to crown all our disquietudes and conflicts by an end so happy is a destiny that the purest and happiest of human characters might esteem perhaps the most desirable of blessings and to this my beloved sisters may the god of purity conduct us all  amen  in descending from the pulpit i observed with an honest pride the effect of my discourse in the features of the sisterhood several of them pressed around me to utter their compliments on the occasion while others contrived to compliment their preacher in a manner still more engaging by discovering to me without affectation the traces of those subsiding tears which i had drawn from my tender audience not by the real excellence of my sermon but by the cordial fervor and apparent sincerity of my zeal in truth i had preached to them from the bottom of a feeling and benevolent heart and i had raised so forcibly before my own eyes the successive images which i presented to them that in delivering my sermon i was myself affected even to tears and obliged to pause more than once to recover the powers of my suspended voice  the lady seraphina who spoke to me as president in the name of the community had begun to honor me with a very delicate encomium but checked herself on a sudden and observing that i had exhausted myself to such a degree that i was ready to faint she hastily dispatched the good melesinda for a glass of hartshorn and water i was still within the chapel for perceiving myself in some danger of falling i had supported my weak and emaciated body against a pillar the compassionate lady abbess held one of my hands which answered the honest pressure of her generous anxiety her favorite fuscina continued by her direction to chase my temples till the hartshorn arrived i drank it with some difficulty and regaining a little portion of strength i said to my charitable assistants in a feeble and broken voice be not alarmed my good sisters you see before you a frail and feverish mortal whose trembling nerves have but too often refused to second and support the honest ardour of his soul accept however my good intention and allow me to live and die in your service the attentive lady abbess endeavored to raise and comfort me with the most friendly and endearing expressions she now conducted me in the tenderest manner into her own private apartment she seated me on a most comfortable sopha that filled a large recess in an elegant and spacious parlour the room was decorated with many beautiful works both of the needle and the pencil but alas i was unable to contemplate their respective beauties for the shades of death appeared now to be gathering very fast around me the kind solicitude of seraphina redoubled she discovered the most fervent desire to restore my health excellent lady i exclaimed with all the little voice that i could raise disquiet not thy tender bosom with a vain expectation  i perceive that my last moment is near and i ought not to regret it since i have obtained and enjoyed the great object of my ambition the affectionate favor of your sisterhood yet there is one thing that i have still to wish and you alone can indulge me  o name it name it said the tender abbess pressing my cold hand and wetting it with her tears yes madam i replied i will lay before you all the little weaknesses of a heart that has much to hope and little to fear from a being so benevolent and gentle as you are i am a vain creature but your tenderness will call my vanity a virtue indeed i covet not the most envied distinction i sigh not for preeminence in learning genius or wit yet i confess to you i wish with great fervor to attract the notice of posterity i wish that as long as my name endures it may be honored with the affectionate remembrance of my fellow creatures and particularly with the tender esteem of your sisterhood  it must it must said the good abbess sobbing  o replied i enfolding one of her hands within mine secure to me this delightful distinction you have the power of doing so  give me your promise that i shall be buried in your chapel under a simple slab of white marble with this inscription here lies     the friend and pastor of old maids the kind abbess assented and i thus continued  i have yet another request pray forgive the whimsies of a fond and perhaps foolish old man  i conjure you let me not be removed from this chamber till the day of my interment  place me in my coffin just as i am in this my pastoral habit and as i confess i have a secret horror of being buried alive pray let some of your good sisters be so charitable as to watch my body during nine days at least after my decease  the tender seraphina continued to signify her perfect acquiescence in all my desires not by distinct words indeed but a series of the most expressive and endearing gestures  enough enough i exclaimed in a sepulchral tone and bestowing upon her a benediction but half articulated i with difficulty raised her unresisting hand to my clammy lips then gently laid it on my own throbbing heart and having squeezed it against my bosom in a strong convulsive pressure expired  my spirit however remained fluttering and invisible in the chamber and seemed to contemplate with a sort of seraphic pride the chaste weeping abbess and my own lifeless body the excellent seraphina would not quit the corpse for a single moment till she was thoroughly persuaded that the breath of the lamented pastor was departed from him for ever she then gave such orders as were necessary for the literal accomplishment of my request she permitted select parties of the kind and curious sisterhood to enter the apartment by turns and indulge themselves in contemplating the countenance of their departed friend my spirit was highly flattered and entertained by their various comments upon it and by their many quick vicissitudes of maidenly curiosity and regret at length a simple but elegant coffin was brought to the sopha on which i died the body without any change of dress was deposited within it but the coffin remained open the admirable lady abbess herself determined to set the community an example of tender and generous attachment she did me the unusual honor of watching the body the first night attended by her two favorite sisters in the evening of the subsequent day it happened that melesinda and fuscina were left alone in this office they endeavored to amuse each other by entering into a very curious and diverting debate on my character and constitution but my modesty will not allow me to repeat the many flattering things which were uttered on this occasion at last when they had thoroughly discussed all my qualities  i sincerely regret this good man said the friendly fuscina as the world contains but few such advocates for our sisterhood but dont you think my dear melesinda that we may ground some little hope of his revival on his singular request of being attended nine days  suppose he should be only in a trance  good god continued the kindhearted creature i would give the world to restore him  as she uttered these words she cast a piercing eye on my countenance and wetting the tip of her fingers with a little bottle of lavenderwater which she held in her left hand she began to rub my temples with an eager anxiety yet with some degree of that awe and trepidation which the dead are apt to inspire  in a few moments she exclaimed look look my dear melesinda am i mistaken or may we not perceive a little dawn of color on his cheek  her benevolent heart beat high with expectation and seizing my hand she said aloud with the commanding ecstatic air of a beneficent enchantress  o thou gentle pastor revive and live for ever not only for us but for every future old maid  she seemed to speak with a prophetic transport and at the same time squeezed my hand with such forcible pressure that i awaked with mingled sensations of pain and exultation  i looked wistfully around and was surprised to find instead of a kind and honest old maiden on each side of me st basils discourse on virginity at my left hand and toward the right an exhausted bottle of port  in the first moments that i could clearly recollect all the particulars of my vision i threw them upon paper and resolved to make them serve me as the close of my elaborate essay in the hope that good old maidens who are said to delight in visions may believe like the honest folks in homer that they descend from heaven  whether i am really indebted to my good angel or not for this unexpected conclusion of my work i shall now leave the candid critics of either sex to decide  frank and gentle spirits who are willing to be pleased let me request and advise you to consider this chequered production with that uniform goodnature and satisfaction which the author has endeavored to promote and sincerely wishes you to preserve not only through these pages but in turning over every new leaf of your separate lives whatever you may chance to find its contents  let me caution you against one possible error in your judgment of this performance do not i entreat you suppose that these little volumes were written with an idle ambition of trying what supposed wit and learning could produce on a subject not very promising  do not i conjure you rank my essay on old maids with the famous meditation on a broomstick  i flatter myself it is far superior to that celebrated production in the merits of the aim proposed though not in those of execution i am willing to hope that my design will be thought to possess the charm of originality but i cannot presume to think that i am entitled to any such commendation for the conduct of my performance since i must heartily confess that it bears a very striking resemblance to many other philosophical essays by ending in a dream  end of the essay postscript i cannot dispatch this courteous and gallant performance to the press without recommending it by a postscript to the particular patronage of that illustrious fraternity the knights of the garter with the original purpose of whose institution it will be found to have a very singular conformity  i have heard that a certain noble lord was free enough to declare on receiving his blue riband that he should not be much embarrassed by the new duties which it imposed upon him namely those of killing dragons and defending virgins intimating with a sarcastic levity hardly becoming a true knight that a dragon and a virgin were equal rarities in the living world what success this noble person may have met with in his knightly pursuits and encounters i know not but i flatter myself that i have happily performed the very exploits for the attempt of which this ancient and noble order of knighthood was originally created though i fear the whole fraternity of modern knights have like the facetious lord i have alluded to rather derided than fulfilled the high duties of their profession in proof of my own achievements i must overstep my natural modesty to observe that in my chapter on the envy and ill nature of old maids i have subdued or at least manfully attacked not only one but many dragons for i doubt not but that incomparable naturalist the count de buffon will allow me that the envious illnatured old maid is the most genuine dragon that nature has produced that i have defended virgins envy herself cannot deny and by choosing to undertake the defense of old maids i have defended those virgins who are undoubtedly the most likely to preserve their purity and of course are the most entitled to protection  having thus fairly proved my unexampled pretensions to their regard i recommend it as a point of honor to all the princes and peers who are at present enrolled under the banner of our common patron st george to make me a little public acknowledgment for the unprecedented services which i have rendered to virginity in their place i doubt not but every true knight will cheerfully contribute the annual sum of twenty guineas on so just an occasion and think it a very moderate compensation for his own particular share in these more than herculean labors which i have happily performed as a kind of acting lieutenant to the whole brotherhood of knights as this most noble order consists of twentysix members the contribution i have proposed allowing for vacancies in the order will supply me with an annual revenue of four hundred guineas a decent provision for an honest veteran worn out in this glorious warfare a wellearned stipend to which i have assuredly an unrivalled claim and for which i shall be happy to see myself registered in the courtcalendar with the new and truly honorable title of deputy dragonqueller and deputy defender of virgins to all the knights of the most noble order of the garter  i am the more free to give this hint to the illustrious fraternity because as my work i trust may be truly called a national service i certainly ought to receive a public reward and to the discredit of our country i cannot discover in all the pages of the red book abovementioned any place already existing which may be considered as a proper compensation for my important labors to the shame of a country which prides itself on achievements in literature there are no posts of decent profit appropriated to literary heroes to the disgrace and sorrow of the muses our poet laureat himself is registered in the said red book as receiving a stipend inferior to that assigned in the same volume to his majestys barber i hope this may be an error of the press for i own it appears to me a kind of treasonable sarcasm on all the late monarchs who have filled the english throne by intimating that he who decorates the outside of our sovereigns head is entitled to a higher reward than he is whose labors are directed to exalt the mind and enliven the fancy of his king however this may be as the laureats office has been recently conferred on a gentleman to whom literature is infinitely indebted i sincerely hope his majesty will graciously correct the unprincely scantiness of the stipend which custom has assigned to his poet by adding a mitre to his laurel  as to myself i should like other veterans very humbly lay my long services and hard fortunes before the sovereign of the knightly order whose duties i have discharged and implore his protection of this performance were i not restrained by a generous regard to the fine feelings of a literary prince  i am convinced indeed that his munificent spirit would be most willing to patronise an author who has so heroically defended the most unprotected class of his faithful and fair subjects but i recollect with pain that his majesty god bless him found himself so exhausted by other acts of bounty that he was unable to increase at the request of his chancellor the little and hardlyearned stipend of an illustrious literary pensioner who wished to be supported in the expense of trying if a foreign climate would retard or alleviate that stroke of death which was soon to release him from all the miseries of mortal dependence  when i think what a king who professes a regard for literature must have suffered from such inability to supply the transient wants of a dying genius who did honor to his reign i cannot bear the idea of exposing a royal patron of letters even to a much smaller degree of similar concern which he must certainly feel if the champion of old maids applied to him for a gratuity that he could not afford to bestow perhaps i am too delicate in this point perhaps regarding the glory as well as the quiet and convenience of my sovereign i ought to conjure him to counteract in the eyes of posterity by all possible attention to men of letters his refusal to increase the salary of an aged distempered moralist such a refusal as if it were not to be weighed in the balance of candor with many opposite acts of munificence would be sufficient to annihilate all the literary fame of an augustus but as this though it is honest loyal and friendly language might be misinterpreted by some courtly yet rough critics i shall not attempt to introduce it where it might appear perhaps an amusing novelty within the precincts of the court  when i reflect indeed on the refined characters capacities and occupations of our peers when i consider that to many of these noble persons a book is the most useless thing in the world and that some of them who generously condescend to read a modern publication yet prudently avoid the extravagance of buying it when i recollect that a certain noble lord who has affected the character of a mecaenas and is enriched by a sinecure of some thousands per annum was wise enough to declare in a booksellers shop that he could not afford to purchase a new performance which he confessed he had heard commended on being informed that the author had affixed to it the enormous price of seven shillings and six pence when i reflect i say on these points i cheerfully retract my preceding application for the lucrative patronage of the great being convinced that most of them may expend the annual sum of twenty guineas much more to their own convenience and pleasure than by contributing to the support of any author whatever  in truth i should deem it on more mature reflection a degradation of my own dignity to accept any patronage except that of the numerous intelligent and powerful sisterhood to whom my pen has been assiduously and affectionately devoted there is undoubtedly some propriety in considering the order of old maids as the genuine patrons of literature since curiosity the mythological parent of all knowledge is their established characteristic and such indeed is the proficiency which some fair individuals of this order have lately made in polite learning that considering the little attention paid to this article by our men of business and our men of pleasure there is reason to believe that the society of old maids will very soon be found the most learned body in this enlightened kingdom  as i trust i am the first author who has expressly dedicated his life and labors to this worthy society i flatter myself they will be unanimous in the opinion that so voluntary and unprecedented an attachment has entitled me to a signal reward i shall therefore suggest to them an idea that may conduce to our mutual honor i shall modestly advise them to ennoble and support their professed servant as the good people of our nation formerly supported their prince by a contribution according to their respective fortunes entitled a benevolence  i recommend it to all the genuine old maids who receive pleasure from my book and i trust this description will include the whole sisterhood to form themselves into little convocations of their order in their respective counties that each convocation may instantly appoint a president to prevent confusion in their debates and a maiden secretary to collect and vest in the hands of my bookseller this honorable little tax which i doubt not they will cheerfully levy on themselves in proportion to their finances and to the amusement afforded them by this performance as i have a very exalted opinion of the chastity and munificence of my fair countrywomen i am persuaded that however small the quota may be which every ancient maiden may contribute the sum total of this benevolence will reflect the highest glory both on me and my patrons to show that i have a spirit able to keep pace with their liberality i think it proper to make the following declaration  expecting the sum to be very great i am determined not to diminish the capital but vesting it in the bank of england to content myself with the interest till my death which as i have passed my grand climacteric can hardly be very distant i shall then bequeath this noble sum as a patriotic legacy in trust to our active and patient young minister who will find it i hope no trifling assistance to his arduous and important project of reducing our national debt and without doubt he will prove a very warm friend to this performance when he sees me converting my chaste patronesses the old maids into pillars of our state  my readers will now perceive to their great surprise that the success of my essay on old maids is a matter of high moment to the interest of our country  a point that my modesty would not allow me to mention as authors less delicate would undoubtedly have done in the first pages of my first volume  having thus chalked out a glorious line of conduct for my fair patrons and myself i have only to take my leave with a respectful bow to the sisterhood and this i cannot do better than by declaring the infinite value that i set upon their favor princes themselves are but pensioners of the public and as my dignity and revenue will arise from the purest part of that public i may certainly by the most philosophical estimate of human honors rank myself as superior to princes if i acquire and support the hitherto unknown and unsurpassable title of gentleman pensioner to the immaculate community of old maids  finis
