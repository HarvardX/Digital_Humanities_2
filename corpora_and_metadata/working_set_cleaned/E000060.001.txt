the complete works of m de montesquieu vol i none none the complete works of m de montesquieu translated from the french in four volumes volume the first london printed for t evans in the strand and w davis in piccadilly m dcc lxxvii none i an eulogium on president montesquieu by monsieur dalembert the interest which good citizens are pleased to take in the encyclopedia and the great number of men of letters who consecrate their labours to it seem to permit us to regard this work as one of the most proper monuments to preserve the grateful sentiments of our country and that respect which is due to the memory of those celebrated men who have done it honour persuaded however that m de montesquieu had a title to expect other panegyrists and that the public grief deserved to be described by more eloquent pens we would have concealed within our own breasts our just concern and respect for his memory but the acknowledgement of what we owe him we hold too dear to permit us to leave the care of it to others while a benefactor to mankind by his writings he also condescended to be so to this work and our gratitude pretends to no more but only to trace out a few lines at the foot of his statue charles de secondat baron of la brede and of montesquieu late president à mortier of the parliament of bourdeaux member of the french academy ii of sciences and belles lettres of prussia and of the royal society of london was born at the castle of la brede near bourdeaux the   th of january      of a noble family of guyenne his great great grandfather john de secondat steward of the household to henry the second king of navarre and afterwards to jane daughter of that king who married antony of bourbon purchased the estate of montesquieu for the sum of  0000 livres which this princess gave him by an authentic deed as a reward for his probity and services henry the third king of navarre afterwards henry the fourth king of france erected the lands of montesquieu into a barony in favour of jacob de secondat son of john first one of the gentlemen in ordinary of the bedchamber to this prince and ofterwards colonel of the regiment of chatillon john gaston de secondat his second son having married a daughter of the first president of the parliament of bourdeaux purchased the office of president à mortier in this society he had several children one of whom entered into the service distinguished himself in it and quitted it very early in life this was the father of charles de secondat author of the spirit of laws these particulars may perhaps appear misplaced at the beginning of the eloge of a philosopher whose name stands so little in need of ancestors but let us not envy their memory that eclat which this name reflects upon it the early marks of his genius a presage sometimes so deceitful was not so in charles de secondat he discovered very soon what he one day would be and his father employed all his attention to cultivate this rising genius the object of his hope and of his tenderness at the age of twenty young montesquieu already prepared materials for the iii spirit of laws by a welldigested extract from those immense volumes which compose the body of the civil law thus heretofore newton laid in his early youth the foundation of works which have rendered him immortal the study of jurisprudence however though less dry to m de montesquieu than to the most part of those who apply to it because he studied it as a philosopher was not sufficient for the extent and activity of his genius he enquired deeply at the same time into subjects still more important and more delicate and discussed them in silence with that wisdom with that decency and with that equity which he has since discovered in his works a brother of his father president à mortier of the parliament of bourdeaux an able judge and virtuous citizen the oracle of his own society and of his province having lost an only son and wanting to preserve in his own corps that elevated spirit which he had endeavoured to infuse into it left his fortune and his office to m de montesquieu he had been one of the counsellors of the parliament of bourdeaux since the   th of february      and was received president à mortier the   th of july      some years after in      during the kings minority his society employed him to present remonstrances upon occasion of a new impost placed between the throne and the people he filled like a respectful subject and courageous magistrate the employment so noble and so little envied of making the cries of the unfortunate reach the sovereign the public misery represented with as much address as force of argument obtained that justice iv which it demanded this success it is true much more unfortunately for the stare than for him was of as short continuance as if it had been unjust scarce had the voice of the people ceased to be heard but the impost which had been suppressed was replaced by another but the good citizen had done his duty he was received the  d of april      into the academy of bourdeaux which was then only beginning a taste for music and for works of pure entertainment had at first assembled together the members who composed it m de montesquieu believed with reason that the rising ardour and talents of his friends might be employed with still greater advantage in physical subjects he was persuaded that nature so worthy of being beheld every where found also in all places eyes worthy of viewing her that on the contrary works of taste not admitting of mediocrity and the metropolis being the center of men of abilities and opportunities of improvement in this way it was too difficult to gather together at a distance from it a sufficient number of distinguished writers he looked upon the societies for belles lettres so strangely multiplied in our provinces as a kind or rather as a shadow of literary luxury which is of prejudice to real opulence without even presenting us with the appearance of it luckily the duke de la force by a prize which he had just founded at bourdeaux seconded these rational and just designs it was judged that an experiment properly made would be preferable to a weak discourse or a bad poem and bourdeaux got an academy of sciences m de montesquieu not at all eager to shew himself to the public seemed according to the expression of a great genius to wait for an age ripe for v writing it was not till      that is to say at    years of age that he published the persian letters the siamois and the serious and comic amusements might have furnished him with the idea of it but he excelled his model the description of oriental manners real or supposed of the pride and phlegm of asiatic love is but the smallest object of these letters it only serves so to speak as a pretence for a delicate satire upon our manners and for treating of several important subjects which the author went to the bottom of while he only appeared to glance at them in this kind of moving picture usbec chiefly exposes with as much genteel easiness as energy whatever amongst us most struck his penetrating eyes our way of treating the most silly things seriously and of turning the most important into a joke our conversations which are so blustering and so frivolous our impatience even in the midst of pleasure itself our prejudices and our actions perpetually in contradiction with our understandings so much love of glory joined with so much respect for the idol of courtfavour our courtiers so mean and so vain our exterior politeness to and our real contempt of strangers or our affected regard for them the fantasticness of our tastes than which there is nothing lower but the eagerness of all europe to adopt them our barbarous disdain for the two most respectable occupations of a citizen commerce and magistracy our literary disputes so keen and so useless our rage for writing before we think and for judging before we understand to this picture which is lively but without malice he opposes in the apologue of the troglodytes the description of a virtuous people become wise by misfortunes a piece worthy of the portico in another place he represents philosophy which had been a long vi time smothered appearing all of a sudden regaining by a rapid progress the time which he had lost penetrating even amongst the russians at the voice of a genius which invites her while among other people of europe superstition like a thick atmosphere prevents that light which surrounds them on all hands from reaching them in fine by the principles which he has established concerning the nature of ancient and modern government he presents us with the bud of those bright ideas which have been since developed by the author in his great work these different subjects deprived at present of the graces of novelty which they had when the persian letters first appeared will for ever preserve the merit of that original character which the author has had the art to give them a merit by so much the more real that in this case it proceeds alone from the genius of the writer and not from that foreign veil with which he covered himself for usbec acquired during his abode in france not only so perfect a knowledge of our morals but even so strong a tincture of our manners that his style makes us often forget his country this small defect in point of probability was perhaps not without design and address when he was exposing our follies and vices he wanted without doubt also to do justice to our advantages he was fully conscious of the insipidity of a direct panegyric he has more delicately praised us by so often assuming our own air to satirize us more agreeably notwithstanding the success of this work m de montesquieu did not openly declare himself the author of it perhaps he thought that by this means he would more easily escape that literary satire which spares anonymous writings the more willingly vii because it is always the person and not the work which is the aim of its darts perhaps he was afraid of being attacked on account of the pretended contrast of the persian letters with the gravity of his office a sort of reproach said he which critics never fail to make because it requires no effort of genius but his secret was discovered and the public already pointed him out to the french academy the event demonstrated how prudent m de montesquieus silence had been ufbec expresses himself sometimes freely enough not concerning the fundamentals of christianity but about matters which too many people affect to confound with christianity itself about the spirit of persecution with which so many christians have been animated about the temporal usurpation of ecclesiastic power about the excessive multiplication of monasteries which deprive the state of subjects without giving worshippers to god about some opinions which have in vain been attempted to be established as principles about our religious disputes always violent and always fatal if he appears any where to touch upon more delicate questions and which more nearly interest the christian religion his reflections weighed with justice are in fact very favourable to revelation because he only shews how little human reason left to itself knows concerning these subjects in a word among the genuine letters of m de montesquieu the foreign printer had inserted some by another hand and they ought at least before the author was condemned to have distinguished which properly belonged to him without regard to these considerations on the one hand hatred under the name of zeal and on the other zeal without discernment or understanding rose and united themselves against the persian letters viii informers a species of men dangerous and base which even in a wise government are unfortunately sometimes listened to alarmed by an unfaithful extract the piety of the ministry m de montesquieu by the advice of his friends supported by the public voice having offered himself for that place in the french academy vacant by the death of m de sacy the minister wrote a letter to the academy that his majesty would never agree to the election of the author of the persian letters that he had not read the book but that persons in whom he placed confidence had informed him of their poisonous and dangerous tendency m de montesquieu perceived what a stroke such an accusation might be to his person his family and the tranquility of his life he neither put so high a price upon literary honours either keenly to seek them or to affect to disdain them when they came in his way nor in a word to regard the simple want of them as a misfortune but a perpetual exclusion and especially the motives of that exclusion appeared to him to be an injury he saw the minister declared to him that for particular reasons he did not own the persian letters but that he would be still farther from disowning a work for which he believed he had no reason to blush and that he ought to be judged after a reading and not upon an information at last the minister did what he ought to have begun with he read the book loved the author and learned to place his confidence better the french academy was not deprived of one of its greatest ornaments and france had the happiness to preserve a subject which superstition or calumny was ready to deprive her of for m de montesquieu had declared to the government that after that kind of affront which they were about to put upon him he would ix go among foreigners who with open arms offered to receive him in quest of that safety that repose and perhaps those rewards which he might have hoped for in his own country the nation would have deplored this loss and the disgrace of it would notwithstanding have fallen upon it the late marshal destrées at that time director of the french academy conducted himself upon this occasion like a virtuous courtier and a person of a truly elevated mind he was neither afraid of abusing his credit nor of endangering it he supported his friend and justified socrates this act of courage so dear to learning so worthy of being imitated at present and so honourable to the memory of marshal destrées ought not to have been forgot in his panegyric m de montesquieu was received the   th of january      his oration is one of the best which have been pronounced upon a like occasion its merit is by so much the greater that those who were to be received till then confined by those forms and by those éloges which were in use and to which a kind of prescription subjected them had not as yet dared to step over this circle to treat of other subjects or had not at least thought of comprehending them in it even in this state of constraint he had the happiness to succeed among several strokes with which his oration shines we may easily distinguish the deepthinking writer by the single portrait of cardinal richlieu who taught france the secret of its strength and spain that of its weakness who freed germany from her chains and gave her new ones we must admire monsieur de montesquieu for having been able to overcome the difficulty of his x subject and we ought to pardon those who have not had the same success the new academician was by so much the more worthy of this title that he had not long before renounced every other business to give himself entirely up to his genius and taste however important the place which he occupied was with whatever judgement and integrity he might have fulfilled its duties he perceived that there were objects more worthy of employing his talents that a citizen is accountable to his country and to mankind for all the good which he can do and that he could be more useful to one and the other by instructing them with his writings than he could be by determining a few particular disputes in obscurity all these reflections determined him to sell his office he was no longer a magistrate and was now only a man of letters but to render himself useful by his works to different nations it was necessary that he should know them it was with this view that he undertook to travel his aim was to examine every where the natural and moral world to study the laws and constitution of every country to visit the learned the writers the celebrated artists every where to seek for those rare and singular geniuses whose conversation sometimes supplies the place of many years observation and residence m de montesquieu might have said like democritus i have forgot nothing to instruct myself i have quitted my country and travelled over the universe the better to know truth i have seen all the illustrious personages of my time but there was this difference between the french democritus and him of abdera that the first travelled to instruct men and the second to laugh at them xi he first went to vienna where he often saw the celebrated prince eugene this hero so fatal to france to which he might have been so useful after having given a check to the fortune of lewis xiv and humbled the ottoman pride lived during the peace without pomp loving and cultivating letters in a court where they are little honoured and setting an example to his masters how they should protect them m de montesquieu thought that he could discover in his conversation some remains of affection for his ancient country prince eugene especially discovered it as much as an enemy could when he talked of the fatal consequences of that intestine division which has so long troubled the church of france the statesman foresaw its duration and effects and foretold it like a philosopher m de montesquieu left vienna to visit hungary an opulent and fertile country inhabited by a haughty and generous nation the scourge of its tyrants and the support of its sovereigns as few persons know this country well he has written with care this part of his travels from germany he went to italy he saw at venice the famous mr law who had nothing remaining of his grandeur but projects fortunately destined to die away in his own head and a diamond which he pawned to play at games of hazard one day the conversation turned on the famous system which law had invented an epoch of so many calamities and so many great fortunes and especially of a remarkable corruption in our morals as the parliament of paris the immediate depository of the laws during a minority had made some resistance to the scotch minister on this occasion m de montesquieu asked him why he had never tried to overcome xii this resistance by a method almost always infallible in england by the grand mover of human actions in a word by money these are not answered law geniuses so ardent and so generous as my countrymen but they are much more incorruplible we shall add without any prejudice of national vanity that a society which is free for some short limited time ought to resist corruption more than one which is always so the first when it sells its liberty loses it the second so to speak only lends it and exercises it even when it is doing so thus the circumstances and nature of government give rise to the vices and virtues of nations another person no less famous whom m de montesquieu saw still oftener at venice was count de bonneval this man so known by his adventures which were not yet at an end and flattered with conversing with so good a judge and one so worthy of hearing them often related to him the remarkable circumstances of his life recited the military actions in which he had been engaged and drew the characters of those generals and ministers whom he had known m de montesquieu often recalled to mind these conversations and related different strokes of them to his friends he went from venice to rome in this ancient capital of the world which is still so in some respects he applied himself chiefly to examine that which distinguishes it most at present the works of raphael of titian and of michael angelo he had not made a particular study of the fine arts but that expression which shines in the masterpieces of this kind infallibly strikes every man of genius accustomed to study nature he knew her again when well imitated as a like portrait strikes all those who are familiarly acquainted with the original xiii those productions of art must indeed be wretched whose whole beauty is only discernible by artists after having travelled over italy m de montesquieu came to switzerland he carefully examined those vast countries which are watered by the rhine there was nothing more for him to see in germany for frederic did not yet reign he stopped afterwards some time in the united provinces an admirable monument what human industry animated by a love of liberty can do at last he went to england where he staid three years worthy of visiting and entertaining the greatest of men he had nothing to regret but that he had not made this voyage sooner newton and locke were dead but he had often the honour of paying his respects to their protectress the celebrated queen of england who cultivated philosophy upon a throne and who properly esteemed and valued m de montesquieu he was no less well received by the nation which however was not obliged to follow the example of its superiors on this occasion he formed at london intimate friendships with men accustomed to think and to prepare themselves for great actions by profound studies with them he instructed himself in the nature of the government and attained to a thorough knowledge of it we speak here after the public testimonies which have been given him by the english themselves so jealous of our advantages and so little disposed to acknowledge any superiority in us as he had examined nothing either with the prejudice of an enthusiast or the austerity of a cynic he brought back from his travels neither a saucy disdain for foreigners nor a still more misplaced contempt for his own country it was the result of xiv his observations that germany was made to travel in italy to sojourn in england to think in and france to live in after his return to his own country m de montesquieu retired for two years to his estate of la brede he there enjoyed in peace that solitude which our having viewed the tumult and hurry of the world serves to render more agreeable he lived with himself after having so long lived in a different way and what interests us most he put the last hand to his work on the cause of the grandeur and declension of the romans which appeared in      empires like men must encrease decay and be extinguished but this necessary revolution has often hidden causes which the veil of time conceals from us and which mystery or their apparent minuteness has even sometimes hid from the eyes of contemporaries nothing in this respect resembles modern history more than ancient history that of the romans however deserves in this respect to be made an exception of it presents us with a rational policy a connected system of aggrandizement which does not permit us to attribute the fortune of this people to obscure and inferior springs the causes of the roman grandeur may then be found in history and it is the business of the philosopher to discover them besides there are no systems in this study as in that of physic these are almost always overthrown because one new and unforeseen experiment can overturn them in an instant on the contrary when we carefully collect the facts which the ancient history of a country transmits to us if we do not always gather together all the materials which we can desire we can at least hope one day to have more of them a careful study of history a study xv so important and so difficult consists in combining in the most perfect manner these defective materials such would be the merit of an architect who from some curious learned remains should trace in the most probable manner the plan of an ancient edifice supplying by genius and happy conjectures what was wanting in those unformed and mutilated ruins it is in this point of view that we ought to consider the work of m de montesquieu he finds the causes of the grandeur of the romans in that love of liberty of labour and of their country which was instilled into them during their infancy in those intestine divisions which gave an activity to their genius and which ceased immediately upon the appearance of an enemy in that constancy after misfortunes which never despaired of the republic in that principle they adhered to of never making peace but after victories in the honour of a triumph which was a subject of emulation among the generals in that protection which they granted to those people who rebelled against their kings in the excellent policy of permitting the conquered to preserve their religion and customs and that of never having two enemies upon their hands at once and of bearing every thing of the one till they had destroyed the other he finds the causes of their declension in the aggrandizement of the state itself in those distant wars which obliging the citizens to be too long absent made them insensibly lose their republican spirit in the privilege of being citizens of rome granted to so many nations which made the roman people at last become a sort of many headed monster in the corruption introduced by the luxury of asia in the proscriptions of sylla which debased the genius of the nation and prepared it for slavery xvi in that necessity which the romans found themselves in of having a master while their liberty was become burthensome to them in that necessity they were obliged to of changing their maxims when they changed their government in that series of monsters who reigned almost without interruption from tiberius to nerva and from commodus to constantine in a word in the translation and division of the empire which perished first in the west by the power of barbarians and which after having languished several ages in the east under weak or cruel emperors insensibly died away like those rivers which disappear in the sands a very small volume was enough for m de montesquieu to explain and unfold so interesting and vast a picture as the author did not insist upon the detail and only seized on the most fruitful branches of his subject he has been able to include in a very small space a vast number of objects distinctly perceived and rapidly presented without fariguing the reader while he points out a great deal to us he leaves us still more to reflect upon and he might have intitled his book a roman history for the use of statesmen and philosophers whatever reputation m de montesquieu had acquired by this last work and by those which had preceded it he had only cleared the way for a far grander undertaking for that which ought to immortalize his name and render it respectable to future ages he had long ago formed the design and had meditated for twenty years upon the execution of it or to speak more properly his whole life had been a perpetual meditation upon it he had first made himself in some respect a stranger in his own country better to understand it at last he had afterwards travelled over all europe and profoundly xvii studied the different people who inhabit it the famous island which glories so much in her laws and which makes so bad a use of them had been to him in his long tour what the isle of crete had formerly been to lycurgus a school where he had known well how to instruct himself without approving every thing in a word he had if we may so speak examined and judged those celebrated nations and men who only exist at present in the annals of the world it was thus that he attained by degrees to the noblest title which a wise man can deserve that of legislator of nations if he was animated by the importance of his subject he was at the same time terrified by its extensiveness he abandoned it and returned to it again at several intervals he felt more than once as he himself owns his paternal hands fail him at last encouraged by his friends he collected all his strength and published the spirit of laws in this important work m de montesquieu without insisting after the example of those who preceded him upon metaphysical discussions relative to the nature of man supposed in an abstract state without confining himself like others to consider certain people in certain particular relations or circumstances takes a view of the inhabitants of the world in the actual state in which they are and in all the relations which they can stand in to one another the most part of other writers in this way are almost always either simple moralists or simple lawyers or even sometimes simple theologists as for him a citizen of all countries and of all nations he is less employed about what our duty requires of us than about the means by which we can be obliged to fulfil it about the metaphysical perfection of laws than about that which human xviii nature renders man capable of about laws which have been made than about those which ought to have been made about the laws of a particular people than about those of all nations thus when comparing himself to those who have run before him in this noble and grand career he might say with correggio when he had seen the works of his rivals and i also i am a painter filled and penetrated with his subject the author of the spirit of laws comprehends in it so great a number of materials and treats them with such brevity and depth that an affiduous and studious reading of it can make us alone perceive the merit of this book this will especially serve we venture to say to make that pretended want of method with which some readers have accused m de montesquieu disappear an advantage which they ought not slightly to have accused him of having neglected in a philosophical subject and in a work of twenty years real want of order ought to be distinguished from that which is only apparent disorder is when the analogy and connection of ideas are not observed when conclusions are set up as principles or precede them when the reader after innumerable windings finds himself at the point whence he set out apparent disorder is when the author putting in their true place the ideas which he makes use of leaves it to the readers to supply the intermediate ones and it is thus that m de montesquieu believed that he might and ought to make use of them in a book designed for men who thought whose genius ought to supply voluntary and reasonable omissions the order which is perceivable in the grand divisions of the spirit of laws takes place no less in the smaller details we believe that the more profoundly the work is studied the more one will be xix convinced of it faithful to his general divisions the author refers to each those objects which belong to it exclusively and with respect to those which by different branches belong to several subjects at once he has placed under each division that branch which properly belongs to it by this we easily perceive and without confusion the influence which the different parts of the subject have upon each other as in a tree or system of human knowledge well understood we may perceive the mutual relation of sciences and arts this comparison is by so much the more just that it is the same thing with respect to a plan which we may form to ourselves for examining laws philosophically as of that order which may be observed in a tree comprehending all the sciences there will always remain something arbitrary in it and all that can be required of an author is that he follow strictly without deviating from it that system which he has once formed to himself we may say of that obscurity which is allowable in such a work the same thing as of want of order what may be obscure for vulgar readers is not so for those whom the author had in his view besides obscurity which is voluntary is not properly obscurity m de montesquieu being sometimes obliged to present to us truths of great importance the absolute and direct avowal of which might have shocked without doing any good has had the prudence to cover them and by this innocent artifice he has concealed them from those to whom they might have been hurtful without making them lost to men of sagacity among those works which have sometimes furnished him with assistance and sometimes with clearer views for his own we may perceive that he xx has especially profited from two historians who have thought the most tacitus and plutarch but though a philosopher who has read these two authors might have dispensed with a great many others he did not believe that he ought to neglect or disdain any thing in this way that could be of use to his subject that reading which we must suppose necessary for the spirit of laws is immense and the rational use which the author has made of such a prodigious multitude of materials will appear still more surprising when it is known that he was almost entirely deprived of sight and obliged to have recourse to eyes not his own this prodigious reading contributes not only to the utility but to the agreeableness of the work without derogating from the majesty of his subject m de montesquieu has known how to soften its austerity and procure the reader some moments of repose whether by facts which are singular and little known or by delicate allusions or by those strong and brilliant touches of the pencil which paint by one stroke nations and men in a word for we will not here play the part of homers commentators there are without doubt faults in the spirit of laws as there are in every work of genius whose author first dared to clear out for himself a new rout m de montesquieu has been amongst us for the study of laws what descartes was for that of philosophy he often instructs us and is sometimes mistaken and even when he mistakes he instructs those who know how to read him the last edition of his works demonstrates by the corrections and additions which he has made that if he has now and then made a slip he has been able to find it out and to rise again by this he will acquire at least a title to a new examination xxi in those places where he was not of the same opinion with his censurers perhaps indeed what he imagined stood most in need of correction has entirely escaped them so blind commonly is the inclination to do hurt but that which is within the reach of all the world is the spirit of laws that which ought to render the author dear to all nations that which would serve to cover far greater faults than are in it is that spirit of patriotism which dictated it the love of the public good a desire of seeing men happy discovers itself in it every where and had it no other merit but this which is so rare and so valuable it would be worthy on this account alone to be read by nations and kings we already perceive by happy experience that the fruits of this work are not confined to useless sentiments in the minds of its readers though m de montesquieu survived the publication of the spirit of laws but a short while he had the satisfaction in some measure to foresee those effects which it begins to produce amongst us the natural love of frenchmen for their country turned towards its true object that taste for commerce for agriculture and for useful arts which insensibly spreads itself in our nation that general knowledge of the principles of government which renders people more attached to that which they ought to love those who have so indecently attacked this work perhaps owe more to it than they imagine ingratitude besides is the smallest reproach which we have to make to them it is not without regret and without blushing for the age we live in that we proceed to expose them but this history is of too much consequence to the glory of m de montesquieu and advantage to philosophy to be xxii passed over in silence may that reproach which at last covers his enemies be of use to them scarce had the spirit of laws appeared but it was eagerly sought after on account of the reputation of its author but though m de montesquieu had written for the good of the people he ought not to have had the vulgar for his judge the depth of his subject was a necessary consequence of its importance however the strokes which were scattered up and down the work and which would have been displaced if they had not arisen naturally from the subject made too many people believe that it was written for them people sought for an agreeable book and they only found an useful one the whole scheme and particular details of which they could not comprehend without some attention the spirit of laws was treated with a deal of light wit even the title of it was made a subject of pleasantry in a word one of the finest literary monuments which our nation ever produced was at first regarded by it with much indifference it was requisite that the true judges should have time to read it they very soon correct the errors of the multitude always ready to change its opinion that part of the public which teaches dictated to that which listens to hear how it ought to think and speak and the suffrages of men of abilities joined to the echoes which repeated them formed only one voice over all europe it was then that the open and secret enemies of letters and philosophy for there are of both kinds united their darts against this work hence that multitude of pamphlets which were aimed against him from all parts and which we shall not draw out from that oblivion in which they have sunk if those authors had not taken proper measures to be xxiii unknown to posterity it might be believed that the spirit of laws was written amidst a nation of barbarians m de montesquieu easily despised the dark criticisms of those weak authors who whether out of a jealousy which they had no title to have or to satisfy the public illnature which loves satire and contempt outrageously attack what they cannot attain to and more odious on account of the ill which they want to do than formidable for that which they actually do do not succeed even in this kind of writing the facility of which as well as its object renders equally mean he placed works of this kind on the same level with those weekly newspapers of europe the encomiums of which have no authority and their darts no effect which indolent readers run over without giving credit to and in which sovereigns are insulted without knowing it or without deigning to revenge it but he was not equally indifferent about those principles of irreligion which they accused him of having propagated in the spirit of laws by despising such reproaches he would have believed that he deserved them and the importance of the object made him shut his eyes at the real meanness of his adversaries those men who really want zeal as much as they are eager to make it appear that they have it afraid of that light which letters diffuse not to the prejudice of religion but to their own disadvantage took different ways of attacking him some by a stratagem which was as puerile as pusillanimous had written to himself others after having attacked him under the mask of anonymous writers had afterwards fallen by the ears among themselves m de montesquieu though he was very jealous of confounding them with each other did not think it proper to lose xxiv time which was precious in combating them one after another he contented himself with making an example of him who had most signalized himself by his extravagance it was the author of an anonymous and periodical paper who imagined that he had a title to succeed pascal because he has succeeded to his opinions a panegyrist of works which nobody reads and an apologist of miracles which the secular power put an end to whenever it wanted to do it who calls the little interest which people of letters take in his quarrels impious and scandalous and hath by an address worthy of him alienated from himself that part of the nation whose affections he ought chiefly to have endeavoured to keep the strokes of this formidable champion were worthy of those views which inspired him he accused m de montesquieu of spinosism and deism two imputations which are incompatible of having followed the system of pope of which there is not a word in his works of having quoted plutarch who is not a christian author of not having spoken of original sin and of grace in a word he pretended that the spirit of laws was a production of the constitution unigenitus an idea which we may perhaps be suspected of fathering on the critic out of derision those who have known m de montesquieu and who understand his work and that of clement xi may judge by this accusation of the rest the unsuccessfulness of this writer ought greatly to discourage him he wanted to attack a wise man in that place which is most sensible to every good citizen but he only procured him an addition of glory as a man of letters the defence of the spirit of laws appeared this work on account of that moderation that truth that delicacy of ridicule which abound in it ought to be regarded as a modelin xxv this way m de montesquieu charged by his adversary with atrocious imputations might easily have rendered him odious he did better he made him ridiculous if we are beholden to an aggressor for that good which he has done us without wanting to do it we owe him eternal thanks for having procured us this masterpiece but what adds still more to the merit of this precious little piece is this that the author without thinking of it has there drawn a picture of himself those who knew him think they hear him and posterity will be convinced when reading his defence that his conversation was not inferior to his writings an encomium which few great men have deserved another circumstance gave him plainly the advantage in this dispute the critic who as a proof of his attachment to religion attacks its ministers loudly accused the clergy of france and especially the faculty of theology of indifference for the cause of god because they did not authentically proscribe so pernicious a work the faculty had a title to despise the reproach of a nameless writer but religion was in the question a commendable delicacy made it resolve to examine the spirit of laws though it has been employed about it several years it has not yet pronounced any thing and if some slight inadvertencies which are almost inevitable in so vast a career should have escaped m de montesquieu the long and scrupulous attention which they would have required from the most enlightened body of the church might prove at least how excusable they are but this body full of prudence will do nothing rashly in so important an affair it knows the grounds of reason and of faith it knows that the work of a man of letters ought no to be examined like that of a theologist xxvi that the bad consequences which odious interpretations may draw from a proposition do not render the proposition blameable in itself that besides we live in an unlucky age in which the interests of religion have need of being delicately managed and that it may do hurt to weak people to throw an illtimed suspicion of incredulity upon geniuses of the first rank that in a word in spite of this unjust accusation m de montesquieu was always esteemed visited and well received by the greatest and most respectable characters in the church would he have preserved among men of worth that esteem which he enjoyed if they had regarded him as a dangerous writer while insects plagued him in his own country england erected a monument to his glory in      m dassier celebrated for the medals which he has struck in honour of several illustrious men came from london to paris to strike one of him m de la tour an artist of such superior talents and so respectable for his disinterestedness and greatness of mind had ardently desired to give a new lustre to his pencil by transmitting to posterity the portrait of the author of the spirit of laws he only wanted the satisfaction of painting him and he deserved like apelles that this honour should be reserved for him but m de montesquieu as sparing of m de la tours time as he himself was free of it constantly and politely refused his pressing solicitations m dassier at first bore with such difficulties do you believe said he at last to m de montesquieu that there is not as much pride in refusing my offer as in accepting of it overcome by his pleasantry he permitted m dassier to do whatever he would xxvii the author of the spirit of laws in fine was peaceably enjoying his glory when he fell sick at the beginning of february his health naturally delicate began to decay for some time past by the slow and almost infallible effect of deep study by the uneasiness which they had endeavoured to give him on account of his work in a word by that kind of life which he was obliged to lead at paris which he felt to be fatal to him but the eagerness with which his company was sought after was too keen not to be sometimes indiscreet they would without perceiving it enjoy him at the expence of himself scarce had the news of the danger which he was in spread abroad but it became the object of the conversation and anxiety of the public his house was never empty of persons of all ranks who came to enquire about his health some out of real affection others to have the appearance of it or to follow the crowd his majesty penetrated with the loss which his kingdom was about to sustain enquired about him several times a testimony of goodness and justice which does equal honour to the monarch and the subject m de montesquieus end was not unworthy of his life oppressed with cruel pains far from a family that was dear to him and which had not the comfort of closing his eyes surrounded by some friends and a great crowd of spectators he preserved to his last moments a calmness and tranquility of soul in a word after having performed with decency every duty full of confidence in the eternal being whom he was about to be reunited with he died with the tranquility of a man of worth who had never consecrated his talents but to the improvement of virtue and humanity france and europe lost him the  0th of february      aged sixtysix xxviii all the public newspapers published this event as a misfortune we may apply to m de montesquieu what was formerly said of an illustrious roman that nobody when told of his death shewed any joy at it that nobody even forgot him when he was no more foreigners were eager to demonstrate their regrets my lord chesterfield whom it is enough to name caused to be published in one of the public london papers an article to his honour an article worthy of the one and of the other it is the portrait of anaxagoras drawn by pericles the royal academy of sciences and belles lettres of prussia though it is not its custom to pronounce the éloge of foreign members thought itself bound to do him an honour which it had not before done to any one but the illustrious john bernouilli m de maupertuis notwithstanding he was at that time indisposed performed himself this last duty to his friend and would not permit an office so dear and so melancholy to fall to the share of any other person to so many honourable suffrages in favour of m de montesquieu we believe we may add without indiscretion those praises which were given him in presence of one of us by that very monarch to whom this celebrated academy owes its lustre xxix a prince made to feel those losses which philosophy sustains and at the same time to comfort her the seventeenth of february the french academy according to custom performed a solemn service for him at which notwithstanding the rigour of the season almost all the learned men of this body who were not absent from paris thought it their duty to assist they ought at this melancholy ceremony to have placed the spirit of laws upon his coffin as heretofore they exposed opposite to that of raphael his last picture of the transfiguration this simple and affecting ornament would have been a fine funeral oration hitherto we have only considered m de montesquieu as a writer and philosopher it would be to rob him of the half of his glory to pass over in silence his agreeable personal qualities he had in company a sweetness and gaiety of temper always the same his conversation was spirited agreeable and instructive by the great number of men and of nations whom he had known it was like his stile concise full of wit and sallies without gall and without satire nobody told a story in a more lively manner more readily or with more grace and less affectation he knew that the conclusion of an agreeable story is always the point in view he therefore made dispatch to come at it and produced the effect without having long promised it his frequent absence of mind only rendered him more amiable he always awoke from it by some unexpected stroke which reanimated the languishing conversation besides these were never either frolicsome shocking or troublesome the fire of his genius the great number of ideas with which it was furnished gave rise to them but this never xxx happened in the midde of an interesting or serious conversation the desire of pleasing those in whose company he was made him attentive to them without affectation and without constraint the agreeableness of his conversation not only resembled his character and his genius but even that kind of method which he observed in his study though capable of deep and longcontinued meditation he never exhausted his strength he always left off application before he felt the least symptom of fatigue he was sensible to glory but he did not wish to attain it but by deserving it he never endeavoured to augment his own by those underhand practices by those dark and shameful methods which dishonour the character of the man without adding to that of the author worthy of every distinction and of every reward he asked nothing and he was not surprised that he was forgot but he has adventured even in delicate circumstances to protect at court men of letters who were persecuted celebrated and unfortunate and has obtained favours for them though he lived with the great whether out of necessity or propriety or taste their company was not necessary to his happiness he retired whenever he could to his estate in the country he there again with joy met his philosophy his books and his xxxi repose surrounded at his leisure hours with country people after having studied man in the commerce of the world and in the history of nations he studied him also in those simple people whom nature alone has instructed and he could from them learn something he conversed chearfully with them he endeavoured like socrates to find out their genius he appeared as happy when conversing with them as in the most brilliant assemblies especially when he made up their differences and comforted them under their distress by his beneficence nothing does greater honour to his memory than the method in which he lived which some people have pretended to blame as extravagant in a proud and avaricious age extremely unfit to find out and still less to feel the real benevolent motives of it m de montesquieu would neither make encroachments upon the fortune of his family by those supplies which he gave the unfortunate nor by those considerable expences which his long tour of travelling the weakness of his sight and the printing of his works had exposed him to he transmitted to his children without diminution or augmentation the estate which he received from his ancestors he added nothing to it but the glory of his name and the example of his life he had married in      dame jane de lartigue daughter of peter de lartigue lieutenantcolonel of the regiment of molevrier he had two daughters and one son by her who by his character his morals and his works has shewn himself worthy of such a father those who love truth and their country will not be displeased to find some of his maxims here he thought xxxii that every part of the state ought to be equally subject to the laws but that the privileges of every part of the state ought to be respected when their effects have nothing contrary to that natural right which obliges every citizen equally to concur to the public good that ancient possession was in this kind the first of titles and the most inviolable of rights which it was always unjust and sometimes dangerous to want to shake that magistrates in all circumstances and notwithstanding whatever advantage it might be to their own body ought never to be any thing but magistrates without partiality and without passion like the laws which absolve and punish without love and hatred in a word he said upon occasion of those ecclesiastical disputes which have so much employed the greek emperors and christians that theological disputes when they are not confined to the schools infallibly dishonour a nation in the eyes of its neighbours in fact the contempt in which wise men hold those quarrels does not vindicate the character of their country because sages making every where the least noise and being the smallest number it is never from them that the nation is judged of the importance of those works which we have had occasion to mention in this panegyric has made us pass over in silence less considerable ones which served as a relaxation to our author and which in any other person would have merited an encomium the most remarkable of them is the temple of gnidus which was very soon published after the persian letters m de montesquieu after having been horace theophrastus and lucian xxxiii in those was an ovid and anacreon in this new essay it is no more the despotic love of the east which he proposes to paint it is the delicacy and simplicity of pastoral love such as it is in an unexperienced heart which the commerce of the world has not yet corrupted the author fearing perhaps that a picture so opposite to our manners should appear too languid and uniform has endeavoured to animate it by the most agreeable images he transports the reader into inchanted scenes the view of which to say the truth little interests the lover in his happiest moments but the description of which still flatters the imagination when the passions are gratified inspired by his subject he hath adorned his prose with that animated figurative and poetic stile which the romance of telemachus gave the first example of amongst us we do not know why some censurers of the temple of gnidus have said upon this occasion that it ought to have been written in verse the poetic stile if we understand as we ought by this word a stile full of warmth and images does not stand in need of the uniform march and cadency of versification to be agreeable but if we only make this stile to consist in a diction loaded with needless epithets in the cold and trivial descriptions of the wings and quiver of love and of such objects versification will add nothing to the merit of these beaten ornaments in vain will we look for the life and spirit of it however this be the temple of gnidus being a sort of poem in prose it belongs to our celebrated writers to determine the rank which it ought to hold it is worthy of such judges we believe at least the descriptions in this work may with success stand one of the principal xxxiv tests of poetic descriptions that of being represented on canvass but what we ought chiefly to observe in the temple of gnidus is that anacreon himself is always the observer and the philosopher there in the fourth canto the author appears to describe the manners of the cyberites and it may easily be perceived that these are our own manners the preface especially bears the mark of the author of the persian letters when he represents the temple of gnidus as a translation from a greek manuscript a piece of wit which has been so much disfigured since by bad imitators he takes occasion to paint by one stroke of his pen the folly of critics and the pedantry of translators he concludes with these words which deserve to be repeated if serious people require some other work of me of a less frivolous nature i can easily satisfy them i have been labouring thirty years at a work of twelve pages which will contain all that we know of metaphysics politics and morality and all that the greatest authors have forgot in the volumes which they have published on these sciences we look upon that particular interest which m de montesquieu took in the encyclopædia as one of the most honourable rewards of our labour this work till the present time has only been supported by the courage and emulation of its authors all men of letters ought as he thought eagerly to concur in the execution of this most useful undertaking he gave an example of it with m de voltaire and several other celebrated writers perhaps the opposition which this work has met with and which reminded him of what had happened to himself interested him the more in our favour xxxv perhaps he was sensible without perceiving it of that justice which we dared to do him in the first volume of the encyclopædia when nobody as yet ventured to say a word in his defence he prepared for us an article upon taste which has been found imperfect among his papers we shall give it to the public in that condition and treat it with the same respect that antiquity formerly shewed to the last words of seneca death prevented him from giving us any farther marks of his beneficence and joining our own griefs with those of all europe we might write on his tomb finis vitæ ejus nobis luctuosus patriæ tristis extraneis etiam ignotisque non sine cura fuit tacit in agric xxxvi xxxvii preface if amidst the infinite number of subjects contained in this book there is any thing which contrary to my expectation may possibly offend i can at least assure the public that it was not inserted with an ill intention for i am not naturally of a captious temper plato thanked heaven that he was born in the same age with socrates and for my part i give thanks to god that i was born a subject of that government under which i live and that it is his pleasure i should obey those whom he has made me love i beg one favour of my readers which i fear will not be granted me this is that they will not judge by a few hours reading of the labour of twenty years that they will approve or condemn the book entire and not a few particular phrases if they would search into the design of the author they can do it no other way so completely as by searching into the design of the work i have first of all considered mankind and the result of my thoughts has been that amidst such an infinite diversity of laws and manners they were not solely conducted by the caprice of fancy i have laid down the first principles and have found that the particular cases apply naturally to them that the histories of all nations are only consequences of them and that every particular law is connected with another law or depends on some other of a more general extent xxxviii when i have been obliged to look back into antiquity i have endeavoured to assume the spirit of the ancients lest i should consider those things as alike which are really different and lest i should miss the difference of those which appear to be like i have not drawn my principles from my prejudices but from the nature of things here a great many truths will not appear till we have seen the chain which connects them with others the more we enter into particulars the more we shall perceive the certainty of the principles on which they are founded i have not even given all these particulars for who could mention them all without a most insupportable fatigue the reader will not here meet with any of those bold flights which seem to characterise the works of the present age when things are examined with ever so small a degree of extent the sallies of imagination must vanish these generally arise from the minds collecting all its powers to view only one side of the subject while it leaves the other unobserved i write not to censure any thing established in any country whatsoever every nation will here find the reasons on which its maxims are founded and this will be the natural inference that to propose alterations belongs only to those who are so happy as to be born with a genius capable of penetrating into the entire constitution of a state it is not a matter of indifference that the minds of people be enlightened the prejudices of the magistrate have arisen from national prejudice in a time of ignorance they have committed even the greatest evils without the least scruple but in an enlightened age they even tremble while conferring the greatest blessings they perceive the ancient abuses they see how they must be reformed but xxxix they are sensible also of the abuses of the reformation they let the evil continue if they fear a worse they are content with a lesser good if they doubt of a greater they examine into the parts to judge of them in connection and they examine all the causes to discover their different effects could i but succeed so as to afford new reasons to every man to love his duty his prince his country his laws new reasons to render him more sensible in every nation and government of the blessings he enjoys i should think myself the most happy of mortals could i but succeed so as to persuade those who command to increase their knowlege in what they ought to prescribe and those who obey to find a new pleasure resulting from their obedience i should think myself the most happy of mortals the most happy of mortals should i think myself could i contribute to make mankind recover from their prejudices by prejudice i here mean not that which renders men ignorant of some particular things but whatever renders them ignorant of themselves it is in endeavouring to instruct mankind that we are best able to practise that general virtue which comprehends the love of all man that flexible being conforming in society to the thoughts and impressions of others is equally capable of knowing his own nature whenever it is laid open to his view and of losing the very sense of it when this idea is banished from his mind often have i begun and as often have i laid aside this undertaking i have a thousand times given the leaves i have written to the winds i every day felt my paternal hands fall† i have followed my xl object without any fixed plan i have known neither rules nor exceptions i have found the truth only to lose it again but when i had once discovered my first principles every thing i sought for appeared and in the course of twenty years i have seen my work begun growing up advancing to maturity and finished if this work meets with success i shall owe it chiefly to the grandeur and majesty of the subject however i do not think that i have been totally deficient in point of genius when i have seen what so many great men both in france and germany have written before me i have been lost in admiration but i have not lost my courage i have said with corregio and i also am a painter xli   the spirit of laws book i of laws in general chap i of the relation of laws to different beings laws in their most general signification are the necessary relations arising from the nature of things in this sense all beings have their laws the deity his laws the material world its laws the intelligence superior to man their laws the beasts their laws man his laws they who assert that a blind fatality produced the various effects we behold in this world talk very absurdly for can any thing be more unreasonable than to pretend that a blind fatality could be productive of intelligent beings   there is then a primitive reason and laws are the relations subsisting between it and different beings and the relations of these to one another god is related to the universe as creator and preserver the laws by which he created all things are those by which he preserves them he acts according to these rules because he knows them he knows them because he made them and he made them because they are relative to his wisdom and power since we observe that the world though formed by the motion of matter and void of understanding subsists through so long a succession of ages its motions must certainly be directed by invariable laws and could we imagine another world it must also have constant rules or it would inevitably perish thus the creation which seems an arbitrary act supposeth laws as invariable as those of the fatality of the atheists it would be absurd to say that the creator might govern the world without those rules since without them it could not subsist these rules are a fixed and invariable relation in bodies moved the motion is received increased diminished lost according to the relations of the quantity of matter and velocity each diversity is uniformity each change is constancy particular intelligent beings may have laws of their own making but they have some likewise which they never made before there were intelligent beings they were possible they had therefore possible relations and consequently possible laws before laws were made there were relations of possible justice to say that there is nothing just or unjust but what is commanded or forbidden by positive laws is the same as saying that before the describing of a circle all the radii were not equal   we must therefore acknowledge relations of justice antecedent to the positive law by which they are established as for instance that if human societies existed it would be right to conform to their laws if there were intelligent beings that had received a benefit of another being they ought to shew their gratitude if one intelligent being had created another intelligent being the latter ought to continue in its original state of dependence if one intelligent being injures another it deserves a retaliation and so on but the intelligent world is far from being so well governed as the physical for though the former has also its laws which of their own nature are invariable it does not conform to them so exactly as the physical world this is because on the one hand particular intelligent beings are of a finite nature and consequently liable to error and on the other their nature requires them to be free agents hence they do not steadily conform to their primitive laws and even those of their own instituting they frequently infringe whether brutes be governed by the general laws of motion or by a particular movement we cannot determine be that as it may they have not a more intimate relation to god than the rest of the material world and sensation is of no other use to them than in the relation they have either to other particular beings or to themselves by the allurement of pleasure they preserve the individual and by the same allurement they preserve their species they have natural laws because they are united by sensation positive laws they have none because they are not connected by knowledge and yet they do not invariably conform to their natural laws these are better observed by   vegetables that have neither understanding nor sense brutes are deprived of the high advantages which we have but they have some which we have not they have not our hopes but they are without our fears they are subject like us to death but without knowing it even most of them are more attentive than we to selfpreservation and do not make so bad a use of their passions man as a physical being is like other bodies governed by invariable laws as an intelligent being he incessantly transgresses the laws established by god and changes those of his own instituting he is left to his private direction though a limited being and subject like all finite intelligences to ignorance and error even his imperfect knowledge he loseth and as a sensible creature he is hurried away by a thousand impetuous passions such a being might every instant forget his creator god has therefore reminded him of his duty by the laws of religion such a being is liable every moment to forget himself philosophy has provided against this by the laws of morality formed to live in society he might forget his fellowcreatures legislators have therefore by political and civil laws confined him to his duty chap ii of the laws of nature antecedent to the abovementioned laws are those of nature so called because they derive their force entirely from our frame and existence in order to have a perfect knowledge of these laws we must consider man before the establishment of society the laws received in such a state would be those of nature the law which impressing on our minds the idea of a creator inclines us toward him is the first in importance   though not in order of natural laws man in a state of nature would have the faculty of knowing before he had acquired any knowledge plain it is that his first ideas would not be of a speculative nature he would think of the preservation of his being before he would investigate its original such a man would feel nothing in himself at first but impotency and weakness his fears and apprehensions would be excessive as appears from instances were there any necessity of proving it of savages found in forests trembling at the motion of a leaf and flying from every shadow in this state every man instead of being sensible of his equality would fancy himself inferior there would therefore be no danger of their attacking one another peace would be the first law of nature the natural impulse or desire which hobbes attributes to mankind of subduing one another is far from being well founded the idea of empire and dominion is so complex and depends on so many other notions that it could never be the first which occurred to the human understanding hobbes enquires for what reason men go armed and have locks and keys to fasten their doors if they be not naturally in a state of war but is it not obvious that he attributes to mankind before the establishment of society what can happen but in consequence of this establishment which furnishes them with motives for hostile attacks and selfdefence next to a sense of his weakness man would soon find that of his wants hence another law of nature would prompt him to seek for nourishment fear i have observed would induce men to shun one another but the marks of this fear being reciprocal   would soon engage them to associate besides this association would quickly follow from the very pleasure one animal feels at the approach of another of the same species again the attraction arising from the difference of sexes would enhance this pleasure and the natural inclination they have for each other would form a third law beside the sense or instinct which man possesses in common with brutes he has the advantage of acquired knowledge and thence arises a second tie which brutes have not mankind have therefore a new motive of uniting and a fourth law of nature results from the desire of living in society chap iii of positive laws as soon as mankind enter into a state of society they lose the sense of their weakness equality ceases and then commences the state of war each particular society begins to feel its strength whence arises a state of war betwixt different nations the individuals likewise of each society become sensible of their force hence the principal advantages of this society they endeavour to convert to their own emolument which constitutes a state of war betwixt individuals these two different kinds of states give rise to human laws considered as inhabitants of so great a planet which necessarily contains a variety of nations they have laws relative to their mutual intercourse which is what we call the law of nations as members of a society that must be properly supported they have laws relative to the governors and the governed and this we distinguish by the name of politic law they have also another sort of laws as they stand in relation to each other by which is understood the civil law   the law of nations is naturally founded on this principle that different nations ought in time of peace to do one another all the good they can and in time of war as little injury as possible without prejudicing their real interests the object of war is victory that of victory is conquest and that of conquest preservation from this and the preceding principle all those rules are derived which constitute the law of nations all countries have a law of nations not excepting the iroquois themselves though they devour their prisoners for they send and receive ambassadors and understand the rights of war and peace the mischief is that their law of nations is not founded on true principles besides the law of nations relating to all societies there is a polity or civil constitution for each particularly considered no society can subsist without a form of government the united strength of individuals as gravina well observes constitutes what we call the body politic the general strength may be in the hands of a single person or of many some think that nature having established paternal authority the most natural government was that of a single person but the example of paternal authority proves nothing for if the power of a father be relative to a single government that of brothers after the death of a father and that of cousingermans after the decease of brothers refer to a government of many the political power necessarily comprehends the union of several families better is it to say that the government most conformable to nature is that which best agrees with the humour and disposition of the people in whose favour it is established   the strength of individuals cannot be united without a conjunction of all their wills the conjunction of those wills as gravina again very justly observes is what we call the civil state law in general is human reason inasmuch as it governs all the inhabitants of the earth the political and civil laws of each nation ought to be only the particular cases in which human reason is applied they should be adapted in such a manner to the people for whom they are framed that it is a great chance if those of one nation suit another they should be relative to the nature and principle of each government whether they form it as may be said of political laws or whether they support it as in the case of civil institutions they should be relative to the climate of each country to the quality of its soil to its situation and extent to the principal occupation of the natives whether husbandmen huntsmen or shepherds they should have a relation to the degree of liberty which the constitution will bear to the religion of the inhabitants to their inclinations riches numbers commerce manners and customs in fine they have relations to each other as also to their origin to the intent of the legislator and to the order of things on which they are established in all which different lights they ought to be considered this is what i have undertaken to perform in the following work these relations i shall examine since all these together constitute what i call the spirit of laws i have not separated the political from the civil institutions for as i do not pretend to treat of laws but of their spirit and as this spirit consists in the various relations which the laws may have to different objects it is not so much my business to follow   the natural order of laws as that of these relations and objects i shall first examine the relations which laws have to the nature and principle of each government and as this principle has a strong influence on laws i shall make it my study to understand it thoroughly and if i can but once establish it the laws will soon appear to flow from thence as from their source i shall proceed afterwards to other more particular relations book ii of laws directly derived from the nature of government chap i of the nature of three different governments there are three species of government republican monarchical and despotic in order to discover their nature it is sufficient to recollect the common notion which supposes three definitions or rather three facts that a republican government is that in which the body or only a part of the people is possessed of the supreme power monarchy that in which a single person governs by fixed and established laws a despotic government that in which a single person directs every thing by his own will and caprice this is what i call the nature of each government we must now inquire into those laws which directly conform to this nature and consequently are the fundamental institutions  0 chap ii of the republican government and the laws relative to democracy when the body of the people is possessed of the supreme power this is called a democracy when the supreme power is lodged in the hands of a part of the people it is then an aristocracy in a democracy the people are in some respects the sovereign and in others the subject there can be no exercise of sovereignty but by their suffrages which are their own will now the sovereigns will is the sovereign himself the laws therefore which establish the right of suffrage are fundamental to this government and indeed it is as important to regulate in a republic in what manner by whom to whom and concerning what suffrages are to be given as it is in a monarchy to know who is the prince and after what manner he ought to govern libanius says that at athens a stranger who intermeddled in the assemblies of the people was punished with death this is because such a man usurped the rights of sovereignty it is an essential point to fix the number of citizens who are to form the public assemblies otherwise it would be uncertain whether the whole or only a part of the people had given their votes at sparta the number was fixed to ten thousand but rome designed by providence to rise from the weakest beginnings to the highest pitch of grandeur rome doomed to experience all the vicissitudes of fortune rome who had sometimes all her inhabitants without her walls and sometimes all italy and a considerable part of the world within them    rome i say never fixed the number and this was one of the principal causes of her ruin the people in whom the supreme power resides ought to have the management of every thing within their reach what exceeds their abilities must be conducted by their ministers but they cannot properly be said to have their ministers without the power of nominating them it is therefore a fundamental maxim in this government that the people should choose their ministers that is their magistrates they have occasion as well as monarchs and even more so to be directed by a council or senate but to have a proper confidence in these they should have the choosing of the members whether the election be made by themselves as at athens or by some magistrate deputed for that purpose as on certain occasions was customary at rome the people are extremely well qualified for choosing those whom they are to intrust with part of their authority they have only to be determined by things to which they cannot be strangers and by facts that are obvious to sense they can tell when a person has fought many battles and been crowned with success they are therefore very capable of electing a general they can tell when a judge is assiduous in his office gives general satisfaction and has never been charged with bribery this is sufficient for choosing a prætor they are struck with the magnificence or riches of a fellowcitizen no more is requisite for electing an ædile these are facts of which they can have better information in a public forum than a monarch in his palace but are they capable of conducting an intricate affair of seizing and improving    the opportunity and critical moment of action no this surpasses their abilities should we doubt of the peoples natural capacity in respect to the discernment of merit we need only cast an eye on the series of surprising elections made by the athenians and romans which no one surely will attribute to hazard we know that though the people of rome assumed to themselves the right of raising plebeians to public offices yet they never would exert this power and though at athens the magistrates were allowed by the law of aristides to be elected from all the different classes of inhabitants there never was a case says xenophon that the common people petitioned for employments which could endanger either their security or their glory as most citizens have sufficient abilities to choose though unqualified to be chosen so the people though capable of calling others to an account for their administration are incapable of conducting the administration themselves the public business must be carried on with a certain motion neither too quick nor too slow but the motion of the people is always either too remiss or too violent sometimes with a hundred thousand arms they overturn all before them and sometimes with a hundred thousand feet they creep like insects in a popular state the inhabitants are divided into certain classes it is in the manner of making this division that great legislators have signalized themselves and it is on this the duration and prosperity of democracy have ever depended servius tullus followed the spirit of aristocracy in the distribution of his classes we find in livy†    and in dionysius halicarnasseus‡ in what manner he lodged the right of suffrage in the hands of the principal citizens he had divided the people of rome into a hundred and ninetythree centuries which formed six classes and ranking the rich who were in smaller numbers in the first centuries and those in middling circumstances who were more numerous in the next he flung the indigent multitude into the last and as each century had but one vote it was property rather than numbers that decided the elections solon divided the people of athens into four classes in this he was directed by the spirit of democracy his intention not being to fix those who were to choose but such as were eligible therefore leaving to every citizen the right of election he made† the judges eligible from each of those four classes but the magistrates he ordered to be chosen only out of the first three consisting of persons of easy fortunes as the division of those who have a right of suffrage is a fundamental law in republics the manner also of giving this suffrage is another fundamental the suffrage by lot is natural to democracy as that by choice is to aristocracy the suffrage by lot is a method of electing that offends no one but animates each citizen with the pleasing hope of serving his country yet as this method is in itself defective it has been the endeavour of the most eminent legislators to regulate and amend it    solon made a law at athens that military employments should be conferred by choice but that senators and judges should be elected by lot the same legislator ordained that civil magistracies attended with great expence should be given by choice and the others by lot in order however to amend the suffrage by lot he made a rule that none but those who presented themselves should be elected that the person elected should be examined by judges and that every one should have a right to accuse him if he were unworthy of the office† this participated at the same time of the suffrage by lot and of that by choice when the time of their magistracy was expired they were obliged to submit to another judgement in regard to their conduct persons utterly unqualified must have been extremely backward in giving in their names to be drawn by lot the law which determines the manner of giving suffrage is likewise fundamental in a democracy it is a question of some importance whether the suffrages ought to be public or secret cicero observes‡ that the laws∥ which rendered them secret towards the close of the republic were the cause of its decline but as this is differently practised in different republics i shall offer here my thoughts concerning this subject the peoples suffrages ought doubtless to be public§ and this should be considered as a fundamental    law of democracy the lower class ought to be directed by those of higher rank and restrained within bounds by the gravity of eminent personages hence by rendering the suffrages secret in the roman republic all was lost it was no longer possible to direct a populace that sought its own destruction but when the body of the nobles are to vote in an aristocracy or in a democracy the senate† as the business is then only to prevent intrigues the suffrages cannot be too secret intriguing in a senate is dangerous dangerous it is also in a body of nobles but not so in the people whose nature is to act through passion in countries where they have no share in the government we often see them as much inflamed on the account of an actor as ever they could be for the welfare of the state the misfortune of a republic is when intrigues are at an end which happens when the people are gained by bribery and corruption in this case they grow indifferent to public affairs and avarice becomes their predominant passion unconcerned about the government and every thing belonging to it they quietly wait for their hire it is likewise a fundamental law in democracies that the people should have the sole power to enact laws and yet there are a thousand occasions on which it is necessary the senate should have a power of decreeing nay it is frequently proper to make some trial of a law before it is established the constitutions of rome and athens were excellent the decrees of the senate‡ had the force of laws for the    space of a year but did not become perpetual till they were ratified by the consent of the people chap iii of the laws relative to the nature of aristocracy in an aristocracy the supreme power is lodged in the hands of a certain number of persons these are invested both with the legislative and executive authority and the rest of the people are in respect to them the same as the subjects of a monarchy in regard to the sovereign they do not vote here by lot for this would be productive of inconveniencies only and indeed in a government where the most mortifying distinctions are already established though they were to be chosen by lot still they would not cease to be odious it is the nobleman they envy and not the magistrate when the nobility are numerous there must be a senate to regulate the affairs which the body of nobles are incapable of deciding and to prepare others for their decision in this case it may be said that the aristocracy is in some measure in the senate the democracy in the body of the nobles and the people are a cypher it would be a very happy thing in an aristocracy if the people in some measure could be raised from their state of annihilation thus at genoa the bank of st george being administered by the people gives them a certain influence in the government from whence their whole prosperity is derived the senators ought by no means to have a right of naming their own members for this would be    the only way to perpetuate abuses at rome which in its early years was a kind of aristocracy the senate did not fill up the vacant places in their own body the new members were nominated by the censors in a republic the sudden rise of a private citizen to exorbitant power produces monarchy or something more than monarchy in the latter the laws have provided for or in some measure adapted themselves to the constitution and the principle of government checks the monarch but in a republic where a private citizen has obtained an exorbitant power† the abuse of this power is much greater because the laws foresaw it not and consequently made no provision against it there is an exception to this rule when the constitution is such as to have immediate need of a magistrate invested with an exorbitant power such was rome with her dictators such is venice with her stateinquisitors these are formidable magistrates who restore as it were by violence the state to its liberty but how comes it that these magistracies are so very different in these two republics it is because rome supported the remains of her aristocracy against the people whereas venice employs her stateinquisitors to maintain her aristocracy against the nobles the consequence was that at rome the dictatorship could be only of a short duration as the people act through passion and not with design it was necessary that a magistracy of this kind should be exercised with lustre and pomp the business being to intimidate and not to punish the multitude it was also proper that the dictator should be created only for some particular affair    and for this only should have an unlimited authority as he was always created upon some sudden emergency on the contrary at venice they have occasion for a permanent magistracy for here it is that schemes may be set on foot continued suspended and resumed that the ambition of a single person becomes that of a family and the ambition of one family that of many they have occasion for a secret magistracy the crimes they punish being hatched in secrecy and silence this magistracy must have a general inquisition for their business is not to remedy known disorders but to prevent the unknown in a word the latter is designed to punish suspected crimes whereas the former used rather menaces than punishment even for crimes that were openly avowed in all magistracies the greatness of the power must be compensated by the brevity of the duration this most legislators have fixed to a year a longer space would be dangerous and a shorter would be contrary to the nature of government for who is it that in the management even of his domestic affairs would be thus confined at ragusa the chief magistrate of the republic is changed every month the other officers every week and the governor of the castle every day but this can take place only in a small republic environed† by formidable powers who might easily corrupt such petty and insignificant magistrates the best aristocracy is that in which those who have no share in the legislature are so few and inconsiderable that the governing party have no interest in oppressing them thus when‡ antipater made a law at athens that whosoever was not worth    two thousand drachms should have no power to vote he formed by this method the best aristocracy possible because this was so small a sum as excluded very few and not one of any rank or consideration in the city aristocratical families ought therefore as much as possible to level themselves in appearance with the people the more an aristocracy borders on democracy the nearer it approaches to perfection and in proportion as it draws towards monarchy the more it is imperfect but the most imperfect of all is that in which the part of the people that obeys is in a state of civil servitude to those who command as the aristocracy of poland where the peasants are slaves to the nobility chap iv of the relation of laws to the nature of monarchical government the intermediate subordinate and dependent powers constitute the nature of monarchical government i mean of that in which a single person governs by fundamental laws i said the intermediate subordinate and dependent powers and indeed in monarchies the prince is the source of all power political and civil these fundamental laws necessarily suppose the intermediate channels through which the power flows for if there be only the momentary and capricious will of a single person to govern the state nothing can be fixed and of course there is no fundamental law the most natural intermediate and subordinate power is that of the nobility this in some measure seems to be essential to a monarchy whose  0 fundamental maxim is no monarch no nobility no nobility no monarch but there may be a despotic prince there are men who have endeavoured in some countries in europe to suppress the jurisdiction of the nobility not perceiving that they were driving at the very thing that was done by the parliament of england abolish the privileges of the lords the clergy and cities in a monarchy and you will soon have a popular state or else a despotic government the courts of a considerable kingdom in europe have for many ages been striking at the patrimonial jurisdiction of the lords and clergy we do not pretend to censure these sage magistrates but we leave it to the public to judge how far this may alter the constitution far am i from being prejudiced in favour of the privileges of the clergy however i should be glad their jurisdiction were once fixed the question is not whether their jurisdiction was justly established but whether it be really established whether it constitutes a part of the laws of the country and is in every respect relative to those laws whether between two powers acknowledged independent the conditions ought not to be reciprocal and whether it be not equally the duty of a good subject to defend the prerogative of the prince and to maintain the limits which from time immemorial he has prescribed to his authority though the ecclesiastic power be so dangerous in a republic yet it is extremely proper in a monarchy especially of the absolute kind what would become of spain and portugal since the subversion of their laws were it not for this only barrier against the incursions of arbitrary power a barrier ever    useful when there is no other for since a despotic government is productive of the most dreadful calamities to human nature the very evil that restrains it is beneficial to the subject in the same manner as the ocean threatening to overflow the whole earth is stopped by weeds and pebbles that lie scattered along the shore so monarchs whose power seems unbounded are restrained by the smallest obstacles and suffer their natural pride to be subdued by supplication and prayer the english to favour their liberty have abolished all the intermediate powers of which their monarchy was composed they have a great deal of reason to be jealous of this liberty were they ever to be so unhappy as to lose it they would be one of the most servile nations upon earth mr law through ignorance both of a republican and monarchical constitution was one of the greatest promoters of absolute power ever known in europe besides the violent and extraordinary changes owing to his direction he would fain suppress all the intermediate ranks and abolish the political communities he was dissolving the monarchy by his chimerical reimbursements and seemed as if he even wanted to redeem the constitution it is not enough to have intermediate powers in a monarchy there must be also a depositary of the laws this depositary can only be the judges of the supreme courts of justice who promulge the new laws and revive the obsolete the natural ignorance of the nobility their indolence and contempt of civil government require there should be    a body invested with a power of reviving and executing the laws which would be otherwise buried in oblivion the princes council are not a proper depositary they are naturally the depositary of the momentary will of the prince and not of the fundamental laws besides the princes council is continually changing it is neither permanent nor numerous neither has it a sufficient share of the confidence of the people consequently it is incapable to set them right in difficult conjunctures or to reduce them to proper obedience despotic governments where there are no fundamental laws have no such kind of depositary hence it is that religion has generally so much influence in those countries because it forms a kind of permanent depositary and if this cannot be said of religion it may of the customs that are respected instead of laws chap v of the laws relative to the nature of a despotic government from the nature of despotic power it follows that the single person invested with this power commits the execution of it also to a single person a man whom his senses continually inform that he himself is every thing and his subjects nothing is naturally lazy voluptuous and ignorant in consequence of this he neglects the management of public affairs but were he to commit the administration to many there would be continual disputes among them each would form intrigues to be his first slave and he would be obliged to take the reins into his own hands it is therefore more    natural for him to resign it to a vizir and to invest him with the same power as himself the creation of a vizir is a fundamental law of this government it is related of a pope that he had started an infinite number of difficulties against his election from a thorough conviction of his incapacity at length he was prevailed on to accept of the pontificate and resigned the administration entirely to his nephew he was soon struck with surprize and said i should never have thought that these things were so easy the same may be said of the princes of the east who being educated in a prison where eunuchs corrupt their hearts and debase their understandings and where they are frequently kept ignorant of their high rank when drawn forth in order to be placed on the throne they are at first confounded but as soon as they have chosen a vizir and abandoned themselves in their seraglio to the most brutal passions pursuing in the midst of a prostituted court every capricious extravagance they could never have dreamt to find matters so easy the more extensive the empire the larger the seraglio and consequently the more voluptuous the prince hence the more nations such a sovereign has to rule the less he attends to the cares of government the more important his affairs the less he makes them the subject of his deliberations    book iii of the principles of the three kinds of government chap i difference between the nature and principle of government after having examined the laws relative to the nature of each government we must investigate those which relate to its principle there is this difference between the nature and principle of government that the former is that by which it is constituted and the latter that by which it is made to act one is its particular structure and the other the human passions which set it in motion now laws ought to be no less relative to the principle than to the nature of each government we must therefore enquire into this principle which shall be the subject of this third book chap ii of the principle of different governments i have already observed that it is the nature of a republican government that either the collective body of the people or particular families should be possessed of the supreme power of a monarchy that the prince should have this power but in the execution of it should be directed by established laws of a despotic government that a single person should rule according to his own will and caprice this enables me to discover their three principles which    are naturally derived from thence i shall begin with a republican government and in particular with that of democracy chap iii of the principle of democracy there is no great share of probity necessary to support a monarchical or despotic government the force of laws in one and the princes arm in the other are sufficient to direct and maintain the whole but in a popular state one spring more is necessary namely virtue what i have here advanced is confirmed by the unanimous testimony of historians and is extremely agreeable to the nature of things for it is clear that in a monarchy where he who commands the execution of the laws generally thinks himself above them there is less need of virtue than in a popular government where the person entrusted with the execution of the laws is sensible of his being subject to their direction clear it is also that a monarch who through bad advice or indolence ceases to enforce the execution of the laws may easily repair the evil he has only to follow other advice or to shake off this indolence but when in a popular government there is a suspension of the laws as this can proceed only from the corruption of the republic the state is certainly undone a very droll spectacle it was in the last century to behold the impotent efforts of the english towards the establishment of democracy as they who had a share in the direction of public affairs were void of virtue as their ambition was enflamed by    the success of the most daring of their members† as the prevailing parties were successively animated by the spirit of faction the government was continually changing the people amazed at so many revolutions in vain attempted to erect a commonwealth at length when the country had undergone the most violent shocks they were obliged to have recourse to the very government which they had so wantonly proscribed when sylla thought of restoring rome to her liberty this unhappy city was incapable of that blessing she had only the feeble remains of virtue which were continually diminishing instead of being roused out of her lethargy by cæsar tiberius caius claudius nero domitian she riveted every day her chains if she struck some blows her aim was at the tyrant but not at the usurpation the politic greeks who lived under a popular government knew no other support than virtue the modern inhabitants of that country are entirely taken up with manufacture commerce finances opulence and luxury when virtue is banished ambition invades the minds of those who are disposed to receive it and avarice possesses the whole community the objects of their desires are changed what they were fond of before is become indifferent they were free while under the restraint of laws but they would fain now be free to act against law and as each citizen is like a slave who has run away from his master what was a maxim of equity he calls rigour what was a rule of action he stiles constraint and to precaution he gives the name of fear frugality and not the thirst of gain now passes for avarice formerly the wealth of individuals constituted the public treasure    but now this is become the patrimony of private persons the members of the commonwealth riot on the public spoils and its strength is only the power of a few and the licentiousness of many athens was possessed of the same number of forces when she triumphed so gloriously and when with so much infamy she was inslaved she had twenty thousand citizens§ when she defended the greeks against the persians when she contended for empire with sparta and invaded sicily she had twenty thousand when demetrius phalereus numbered them as slaves are told by the head in a marketplace when philip attempted to lord it over greece and appeared at the gates of athens† she had even then lost nothing but time we may see in demosthenes how difficult it was to awake her she dreaded philip not as the enemy of her liberty but of her pleasures∥ this famous city which had withstood so many defeats and after having been so often destroyed had as often risen out of her ashes was overthrown at chæronea and at one blow deprived of all hopes of resource what does it avail her that philip sends back her prisoners if he does not return her men it was ever after as easy to triumph over the athenian forces as it had been difficult to subdue her virtue how was it possible for carthage to maintain her ground when hannibal upon his being made prætor endeavoured to hinder the magistrates from plundering the republic did not they complain of him to the romans wretches who would fain be citizens without a city and beholden for their    riches to their very destroyers rome soon insisted upon having three hundred of their principal citizens as hostages she obliged them next to surrender their arms and ships and then she declared war† from the desperate efforts of this defenceless city one may judge of what she might have performed in her full vigour and assisted by virtue chap iv of the principle of aristocracy as virtue is necessary in a popular government it is requisite also under an aristocracy true it is that in the latter it is not so absolutely requisite the people who in respect to the nobility are the same as the subjects with regard to a monarch are restrained by their laws they have therefore less occasion for virtue than the people in a democracy but how are the nobility to be restrained they who are to execute the laws against their colleagues will immediately perceive they are acting against themselves virtue is therefore necessary in this body from the very nature of the constitution an aristocratical government has an inherent vigour unknown to democracy the nobles form a body who by their prerogative and for their own particular interest restrain the people it is sufficient that there are laws in being to see them executed but easy as it may be for the body of the nobles to restrain the people it is difficult to restrain themselves such is the nature of this constitution that it seems to subject the very same persons to the power    of the laws and at the same time to exempt them now such a body as this can restrain itself only two ways either by a very eminent virtue which puts the nobility in some measure on a level with the people and may be the means of forming a great republic or by an inferior virtue which puts them at least upon a level with one another and on this their preservation depends moderation is therefore the very soul of this government a moderation i mean founded on virtue not that which proceeds from indolence and pusillanimity chap v that virtue is not the principle of a monarchical government in monarchies policy effects great things with as little virtue as possible thus in the nicest machines art has reduced the number of movements springs and wheels the state subsists independently of the love of our country of the thirst of true glory of selfdenial of the sacrifice of our dearest interests and of all those heroic virtues which we admire in the ancients and to us are known only by story the laws supply here the place of those virtues they are by no means wanted and the state dispenses with them an action performed here in secret is in some measure of no consequence though all crimes be in their own nature public yet there is a distinction between crimes really public and those that are private which are so called because they are more injurious to individuals than to the community  0 now in republics private crimes are more public that is they attack the constitution more than they do individuals and in monarchies public crimes are more private that is they are more prejudicial to private people than to the constitution i beg that no one will be offended with what i have been saying my observations are founded on the unanimous testimony of historians i am not ignorant that virtuous princes are no such very rare instances but i venture to affirm that in a monarchy it is extremely difficult for the people to be virtuous let us compare what the historians of all ages have asserted concerning the courts of monarchs let us recollect the conversations and sentiments of people of all countries in respect to the wretched character of courtiers and we shall find that these are not airy speculations but truths confirmed by a sad and melancholy experience ambition in idleness meanness mixed with pride a desire of riches without industry aversion to truth flattery perfidy violation of engagements contempt of civil duties fear of the princes virtue hope from his weakness but above all a perpetual ridicule cast upon virtue are i think the characteristics by which most courtiers in all ages and countries have been constantly distinguished now it is exceeding difficult for the leading men of the nation to be knaves and the inferior sort to be honest for the former to be cheats and the latter to rest satisfied with being only dupes but if there should chance to be some unlucky honest man† among the people cardinal richelieu in his political testament seems to hint that a prince    should take care not to employ him‡ so true is it that virtue is not the spring of this government it is not indeed excluded but it is not the spring of government chap vi in what manner virtue is supplied in a monarchical government but it is high time for me to have done with this subject lest i should be suspected of writing a satire against monarchical government far be it from me if monarchy wants one spring it is provided with another honour that is the prejudice of every person and rank supplieth the place of the political virtue of which i have been speaking and is every where her representative here it is capable of inspiring the most glorious actions and joined with the force of laws may lead us to the end of government as well as virtue itself hence in wellregulated monarchies they are almost all good subjects and very few good men for to be a good man† a good intention is necessary and we should love our country not so much on our own account as out of regard to the community chap vii of the principle of monarchy a monarchical government supposeth as we have already observed preeminences and ranks as likewise a noble descent now since it is the nature of    honour to aspire to preferments and titles it is properly placed in this government ambition is pernicious in a republic but in a monarchy it has some good effects it gives life to the government and is attended with this advantage that it is no way dangerous because it may be continually checked it is with this kind of government as with the system of the universe in which there is a power that constantly repels all bodies from the center and a power of gravitation that attracts them to it honour sets all the parts of the body politic in motion and by its very action connects them thus each individual advances the public good while he only thinks of promoting his own interest true it is that philosophically speaking it is a false honour which moves all the parts of the government but even this false honour is as useful to the public as true honour could possibly be to private people is it not a very great point to oblige men to perform the most difficult actions such as require an extraordinary exertion of fortitude and resolution without any other recompence than that of glory and applause chap viii that honour is not the principle of despotic government honour is far from being the principle of despotic government mankind being here all upon a level no one person can prefer himself to another and as on the other hand they are all slaves they can give themselves no sort of preference besides as honour has its laws and rules as it knows not how to submit as it depends in a great    measure on a mans own caprice and not on that of another person it can be found only in countries in which the constitution is fixed and where they are governed by settled laws how can despotism bear with honour this glories in the contempt of life and that is founded in the power of taking it away how can honour on the other hand bear with despotism the former has its fixed rules and peculiar caprices but the latter is directed by no rule and its own caprices are subversive of all others honour therefore a thing unknown in arbitrary governments some of which have not even a proper word to express it is the prevailing principle in monarchies here it gives life to the whole body politic to the laws and even to the virtues themselves chap ix of the principle of despotic government as virtue is necessary in a republic and in a monarchy honour so fear is necessary in a despotic government with regard to virtue there is no occasion for it and honour would be extremely dangerous here the immense power of the prince is devolved intirely upon those whom he is pleased to intrust with the administration persons capable of setting a value upon themselves would be likely to create disturbances fear must therefore depress their spirits and extinguish even the least sense of ambition a moderate government may whenever it pleases and without the least danger relax its springs it supports itself by the laws and by its own internal strength but when a despotic prince ceases one single moment to lift up his arm when he cannot    instantly demolish those whom he has intrusted with the first employments† all is over for as fear the spring of this government no longer subsists the people are left without a protector it is probably in this sense the cadis maintained that the grand seignior was not obliged to keep his word or oath when he limited thereby his authority‡ it is necessary that the people should be judged by laws and the great men by the caprice of the prince that the lives of the lowest subjects should be safe and the bashaws head ever in danger we cannot mention these monstrous governments without horror the sophi of persia dethroned in our days by mahomet the son of miriveis saw the constitution subverted before this revolution because he had been too sparing of blood history informs us that the horrid cruelties of domitian struck such a terror into the governors that the people recovered themselves a little under his reign§ thus a torrent overflows one side of a country and on the other leaves fields untouched where the eye is refreshed by the prospect of fine meadows chap x difference of obedience in moderate and despotic governments in despotic states the nature of government requires the most passive obedience and when once the princes will is made known it ought infallibly to produce its effect    here they have no limitations or restrictions no mediums terms equivalents or remonstrances no change to propose man is a creature that blindly submits to the absolute will of the sovereign in a country like this they are no more allowed to represent their apprehensions of a future danger than to impute their miscarriage to the capriciousness of fortune mans portion here like that of beasts is instinct compliance and punishment little does it then avail to plead the sentiments of nature filial respect conjugal or parental tenderness the laws of honour or want of health the order is given and that is sufficient in persia when the king has condemned a person it is no longer lawful to mention his name or to intercede in his favour even if the prince were intoxicated or non compos the decree must be executed otherwise he would contradict himself and the law admits of no contradiction this has been the way of thinking in that country in all ages as the order which ahasuerus gave to exterminate the jews could not be revoked they were allowed the liberty of defending themselves one thing however may be sometimes opposed to the princes will§ namely religion they will abandon nay they will slay a parent if the prince so commands but he cannot oblige them to drink wine the laws of religion are of a superior nature because they bind the sovereign as well as the subject but with respect to the law of nature it is otherwise the prince is no longer supposed to be a man in monarchical and moderate states the power is limited by its very spring i mean by honour which like a monarch reigns over the prince and his people    they will not alledge to their sovereign the laws of religion a courtier would be apprehensive of rendering himself ridiculous but the laws of honour will be appealed to on all occasions hence arise the restrictions necessary to obedience honour is naturally subject to whims by which the subjects submission will be ever directed though the manner of obeying be different in these two kinds of government the power is the same on which side soever the monarch turns he inclines the scale and is obeyed the whole difference is that in a monarchy the prince receives instruction at the same time that his ministers have greater abilities and are more versed in public affairs than the ministers of a despotic government chap xi reflections on the preceding chapters such are the principles of the three sorts of government which does not imply that in a particular republic they actually are but that they ought to be virtuous nor does it prove that in a particular monarchy they are actuated by honour or in a particular despotic government by fear but that they ought to be directed by these principles otherwise the government is imperfect    book iv that the laws of education ought to be relative to the principles of government chap i of the laws of education the laws of education are the first impressions we receive and as they prepare us for civil life every private family ought to be governed by the plan of that great household which comprehends them all if the people in general have a principle their constituent parts that is the several families will have one also the laws of education will be therefore different in each species of government in monarchies they will have honour for their object in republics virtue in despotic governments fear chap ii of education in monarchies in monarchies the principal branch of education is not taught in colleges or academies it commences in some measure at our setting out in the world for this is the school of what we call honour that universal preceptor which ought every where to be our guide here it is that we constantly hear three rules or maxims viz that we should have a certain nobleness in our virtues a kind of frankness in our morals and a particular politeness in our behaviour the virtues we are here taught are less what we owe to others than to ourselves they are not so    much what draws us towards society as what distinguishes us from our fellowcitizens here the actions of men are judged not as virtuous but as shining not as just but as great not as reasonable but as extraordinary when honour here meets with any thing noble in our actions it is either a judge that approves them or a sophister by whom they are excused it allows of gallantry when united with the idea of sensible affection or with that of conquest this is the reason why we never meet with so strict a purity of morals in monarchies as in republican governments it allows of cunning and craft when joined with the notion of greatness of soul or importance of affairs as for instance in politics with whose finesses it is far from being offended it does not forbid adulation but when separate from the idea of a large fortune and connected only with the sense of our mean condition with regard to morals i have observed that the education of monarchies ought to admit of a certain frankness and open carriage truth therefore in conversation is here a necessary point but is it for the sake of truth by no means truth is requisite only because a person habituated to veracity has an air of boldness and freedom and indeed a man of this stamp seems to lay a stress only on the things themselves not on the manner in which they are received hence it is that in proportion as this kind of frankness is commended that of the common people is despised which has nothing but truth and simplicity for its object in fine the education of monarchies requires a certain politeness of behaviour man a social    animal is formed to please in society and a person that would break through the rules of decency so as to shock those he conversed with would lose the public esteem and become incapable of doing any good but politeness generally speaking does not derive its original from so pure a source it rises from a desire of distinguishing ourselves it is pride that renders us polite we are flattered with being taken notice of for a behaviour that shews we are not of a mean condition and that we have not been bred up with those who in all ages are considered as the scum of the people politeness in monarchies is naturalised at court one man excessively great renders every body else little hence that regard which is paid to our fellowsubjects hence that politeness equally pleasing to those by whom as to those towards whom it is practised because it gives people to understand that a person actually belongs or at least deserves to belong to the court a court air consists in quitting a real for a borrowed greatness the latter pleases the courtier more than the former it inspires him with a certain disdainful modesty which shews itself externally but whose pride insensibly diminishes in proportion to its distance from the source of this greatness at court we find a delicacy of taste in every thing a delicacy arising from the constant use of the superfluities of life from the variety and especially the satiety of pleasures from the multiplicity and even confusion of fancies which if they are but agreeable are sure of being well received these are the things which properly fall within the province of education in order to form what  0 we call a man of honour a man possessed of all the qualities and virtues requisite in this kind of government here it is that honour interferes with every thing mixing even with peoples manner of thinking and directing their very principles to this whimsical honour it is owing that the virtues are only just what it pleases it adds rules of its own invention to every thing prescribed to us it extends or limits our duties according to its own fancy whether they proceed from religion politics or morality there is nothing so strongly inculcated in monarchies by the laws by religion and honour as submission to the princes will but this very honour tells us that the prince never ought to command a dishonourable action because this would render us incapable of serving him crillon refused to assassinate the duke of guise but offered to fight him after the massacre of st bartholomew charles ix having sent orders to the governors in the several provinces for the hugonots to be murdered viscount dorte who commanded at bayonne wrote thus to the king sire among the inhabitants of this town and your majestys troops i could not find so much as one executioner they are honest citizens and brave soldiers we jointly therefore beseech your majesty to command our arms and lives in things that are practicable this great and generous soul looked upon a base action as a thing impossible there is nothing that honour more strongly recommends to the nobility than to serve their prince in a military capacity and indeed this is their favourite    profession because its dangers its success and even its miscarriages are the road to grandeur yet this very law of its own making honour chooses to explain and in case of any affront it requires or permits us to retire it insists also that we should be at liberty either to seek or to reject employments a liberty which it prefers even to an ample fortune honour therefore has its supreme laws to which education is obliged to conform† the chief of these are that we are permitted to set a value upon our fortune but are absolutely forbidden to set any upon our lives the second is that when we are raised to a post or preferment we should never do or permit any thing which may seem to imply that we look upon ourselves as inferior to the rank we hold the third is that those things which honour forbids are more rigorously forbidden when the laws do not concur in the prohibition and those it commands are more strongly insisted upon when they happen not to be commanded by law chap iii of education in a despotic government as education in monarchies tends to raise and ennoble the mind in despotic governments its only aim is to debase it here it must necessarily be servile even in power such an education will be an advantage because every tyrant is at the same time a slave excessive obedience supposes ignorance in the person that obeys the same it supposes in him that    commands for he has no occasion to deliberate to doubt to reason he has only to will in despotic states each house is a separate government as education therefore consists chiefly in social converse it must be here very much limited all it does is to strike the heart with fear and to imprint on the understanding a very simple notion of a few principles of religion learning here proves dangerous emulation fatal and as to virtue aristotle cannot think there is any one virtue belonging to slaves if so education in despotic countries is confined within a very narrow compass here therefore education is in some measure needless to give something one must take away every thing and begin with making a bad subject in order to make a good slave for why should education take pains in forming a good citizen only to make him share in the public misery if he loves his country he will strive to relax the springs of government if he miscarries he will be undone if he succeeds he must expose himself the prince and his country to ruin chap iv difference between the effects of ancient and modern education most of the ancients lived under governments that had virtue for their principle and when this was in full vigour they performed actions unusual in our times and at which our narrow minds are astonished another advantage their education had over ours it never was effaced by contrary impressions epaminondas the last year of his life said heard beheld    and performed the very same things as at the age in which he received the first principles of his education in our days we receive three different or contrary educations namely of our parents of our masters and of the world what we learn in the latter effaces all the ideas of the former this in some measure arises from the contrast we experience between our religious and worldly engagements a thing unknown to the ancients chap v of education in a republican government it is in a republican government that the whole power of education is required the fear of despotic governments naturally rises of itself amidst threats and punishments the honour of monarchies is favoured by the passions and favours them in its turn but virtue is a selfrenunciation which is ever arduous and painful this virtue may be defined the love of the laws and of our country as such love requires a constant preference of public to private interest it is the source of all private virtues for they are nothing more than this very preference itself this love is peculiar to democracies in these alone the government is intrusted to private citizens now government is like every thing else to preserve it we must love it has it ever been heard that kings were not fond of monarchy or that despotic princes hated arbitrary power every thing therefore depends on establishing this love in a republic and to inspire it ought to be the principal business of education but the surest    way of instilling it into children is for parents to set them an example people have it generally in their power to communicate their ideas to their children but they are still better able to transfuse their passions if it happens otherwise it is because the impressions made at home are effaced by those they have received abroad it is not the young people that degenerate they are not spoilt till those of maturer age are already sunk into corruption chap vi of some institutions among the greeks the ancient greeks convinced of the necessity that people who live under a popular government should be trained up to virtue made very singular institutions in order to inspire it upon seeing in the life of lycurgus the laws that legislator gave to the lacedæmonians i imagine i am reading the history of the sevarambes the laws of crete were the model of those of sparta and those of plato reformed them let us reflect here a little on the extensive genius with which those legislators must have been endowed to perceive that by striking at received customs and by confounding all manner of virtues they should display their wisdom to the universe lycurgus by blending theft with the spirit of justice the hardest servitude with excess of liberty the most rigid sentiments with the greatest moderation gave stability to his city he seemed to deprive her of all resources such as arts commerce money walls ambition prevailed among the citizens without hopes or improving their fortune they had natural sentiments    without the tie of a son husband or father and chastity was stript even of modesty and shame this was the road that led sparta to grandeur and glory and so infallible were these institutions that it signified nothing to gain a victory over that republic without subverting her polity by these laws crete and laconia were governed sparta was the last that fell a prey to the macedonians and crete to the romans† the samnites had the same institutions which furnished those very romans with the subject of four and twenty triumphs∥ a character so extraordinary in the institutions of greece has shewn itself lately in the dregs and corruption of modern times‡ a very honest legislator has formed a people to whom probity seems as natural as bravery to the spartans mr penn is a real lycurgus and though the former made peace his principal aim as the latter did war yet they resemble one another in the singular way of living to which they reduced their people in the ascendant they had over free men in the prejudices they overcame and in the passions which they subdued another example we have from paraguay this has been the subject of an invidious charge against a society that considers the pleasure of commanding as the only happiness in life but it will be ever a    glorious undertaking to render government subservient to human happiness§ it is glorious indeed for this society to have been the first in pointing out to those countries the idea of religion joined with that of humanity by repairing the devastations of the spaniards she has begun to heal one of the most dangerous wounds that the human species ever received an exquisite sensibility to whatever she distinguishes by the name of honour joined to her zeal for a religion which is far more humbling in respect to those who receive than to those who preach its doctrines has set her upon vast undertakings which she has accomplished with success she has drawn wild people from their woods secured them a maintenance and clothed their nakedness and had she only by this step improved the industry of mankind it would have been sufficient to eternize her fame they who shall attempt hereafter to introduce the like institutions must establish the community of goods as prescribed in platos republic that high respect he required for the gods that separation from strangers for the preservation of morals and an extensive commerce carried on by the community and not by private citizens they must give our arts without our luxury and our wants without our desires they must prescribe money the effect of which is to swell peoples fortunes beyond the bounds prescribed by nature to learn to preserve for no purpose what has been idly hoarded up to multiply without end our desires and to supply the sterility    of nature of whom we have received very scanty means of inflaming our passions and of corrupting each other the epidamnians† perceiving their morals depraved by conversing with barbarians chose a magistrate for making all contracts and sales in the name and behalf of the city commerce then does not corrupt the constitution and the constitution does not deprive the society of the advantages of commerce chap vii in what case these singular institutions may be of service institutions of this kind may be proper in republics because they have virtue for their principle but to excite men to honour in monarchies or to imprint fear in despotic governments less pains are necessary besides they cannot take place but in a small state in which there is a possibility of a general education and of training up the body of the people like a single family the laws of minos of lycurgus and of plato suppose a particular attention and care which the citizens ought to have over one anothers conduct but an attention of this kind cannot be expected in the confusion and multitude of affairs in which a large nation is intangled in institutions of this kind money as we have above observed must be banished but in great societies the multiplicity variety embarrassment and importance of affairs as well as the facility of purchasing and the slowness of exchange require a    common measure in order to extend or support our power we must be possessed of the means to which by the unanimous consent of mankind this power is annexed chap viii explication of a paradox of the ancients in respect to manners that judicious writer polybius informs us that music was necessary to soften the manners of the arcadians who lived in a cold gloomy country that the inhabitants of cynete who slighted music were the cruellest of all the greeks and that no other town was so immersed in luxury and debauch plato is not afraid to affirm that there is no possibility of making a change in music without altering the frame of government aristotle who seems to have written his politics only in order to contradict plato agrees with him notwithstanding in regard to the power and influence of music over the manners of the people this was also the opinion of theophrastus of plutarch§ and of all the ancients an opinion grounded on mature reflection being one of the principles of their polity thus it was they enacted laws and thus they required that cities should be governed this i fancy must be explained in the following manner it is observable that in the cities of greece especially those whose principal object was war all lucrative arts and professions were considered as unworthy of a freeman most arts says xenophon‡    corrupt and enervate the bodies of those that exercise them they oblige them to sit under a shade or near the fire they can find no leisure either for their friends or for the republic it was only by the corruption of some democracies that artisans became freemen this we learn from aristotle∥ who maintains that a wellregulated republic will never give them the right and freedom of the city† agriculture was likewise a servile profession and generally practised by the inhabitants of conquered countries such as the helotes among the lacedæmonians the periecians among the cretans the penestes among the thessalians and other conquered¶ people in other republics in fine every kind of low commerce was infamous among the greeks as it obliged a citizen to serve and wait on a slave on a lodger or a stranger this was a notion that clashed with the spirit of greek liberty hence plato§ in his laws orders a citizen to be punished if he attempted to concern himself with trade thus in the greek republics the magistrates were extremely embarrassed they would not have the citizens apply themselves to trade to agriculture or to the arts and yet they would not have them idle∥∥ they found therefore employment for them  0 in gymnic and military exercises and none else were allowed by their institution‡ hence the greeks must be considered as a society of wrestlers and boxers now these exercises having a natural tendency to render people hardy and fierce there was a necessity for tempering them with others that might soften their manners for this purpose music which influences the mind by means of the corporeal organs was extremely proper it is a kind of medium between manly exercises which harden the body and speculative sciences which are apt to render us unsociable and sour it cannot be said that music inspired virtue for this would be inconceivable but it prevented the effects of a savage institution and enabled the soul to have such a share in the education as it could never have had without the assistance of harmony let us suppose among ourselves a society of men so passionately fond of hunting as to make it their sole employment they would doubtless contract thereby a kind of rusticity and fierceness but if they happen to imbibe a taste for music we should quickly perceive a sensible difference in their customs and manners in short the exercises used by the greeks could raise only one kind of passions viz fierceness indignation and cruelty but music excites all these and is likewise able to inspire the soul with a sense of pity lenity tenderness and love our moral writers who declaim so vehemently against the stage sufficiently demonstrate the power of music over the mind if the society abovementioned were to have no other music than that of drums and the sound of the    trumpet would it not be more difficult to accomplish this end than by the more melting tones of softer harmony the ancients were therefore in the right when under particular circumstances they preferred one mode to another in regard to manners but some will ask why should music be pitched upon preferable to any other entertainment it is because of all sensible pleasures there is none that less corrupts the soul we blush to read in plutarch¶ that the thebans in order to soften the manners of their youth authorised by law a passion which ought to be proscribed by all nations book v that the laws given by the legislator ought to be relative to the principle of government chap i idea of this book that the laws of education ought to be relative to the principle of each government has been shewn in the preceding book now the same may be said of those which the legislator gives to the whole society the relation of laws to this principle strengthens the several springs of government and this principle derives from thence in its turn a new degree of vigour and thus it is in mechanics that action is always followed by reaction our design is to examine this relation in each government beginning with the republican state whose principle is virtue    chap ii what is meant by virtue in a political state virtue in a republic is a most simple thing it is a love of the republic it is a sensation and not a consequence of acquired knowledge a sensation that may be felt by the meanest as well as by the highest person in the state when the common people adopt good maxims they adhere to them steadier than those we call gentlemen it is very rare that corruption commences with the former nay they frequently derive from their imperfect light a stronger attachment to the established laws and customs the love of our country is conducive to a purity of morals and the latter is again conducive to the former the less we are able to satisfy our private passions the more we abandon ourselves to those of a general nature how comes it that monks are so fond of their order it is owing to the very cause that renders the order insupportable their rule debars them of all those things by which the ordinary passions are fed there remains therefore only this passion for the very rule that torments them the more austere it is that is the more it curbs their inclinations the more force it gives to the only passion left them chap iii what is meant by a love of the republic in a democracy a love of the republic in a democracy is a love of the democracy as the latter is that of equality a love of the democracy is likewise that of frugality since every individual ought here to enjoy the same happiness and the same advantages they    should consequently taste the same pleasures and form the same hopes which cannot be expected but from a general frugality the love of equality in a democracy limits ambition to the sole desire to the sole happiness of doing greater services to our country than the rest of our fellowcitizens they cannot all render her equal services but they all ought to serve her with equal alacrity at our coming into the world we contract an immense debt to our country which we can never discharge hence distinctions here arise from the principle of equality even when it seems to be removed by signal services or superior abilities the love of frugality limits the desire of having to the study of procuring necessaries to our family and superfluities to our country riches give a power which a citizen cannot use for himself for then he would be no longer equal they likewise procure pleasures which he ought not to enjoy because these would be also repugnant to the equality thus wellregulated democracies by establishing domestic frugality made way at the same time for public expences as was the case at rome and athens when magnificence and profusion arose from the very fund of frugality and as religion commands us to have pure and unspotted hands when we make our offerings to the gods the laws required a frugality of life to enable them to be liberal to our country the good sense and happiness of individuals depend greatly on the mediocrity of their abilities and fortunes therefore as a republic where the laws have placed many in a middling station is composed of wise men it will be wisely governed as it is composed of happy men it will be extremely happy    chap iv in what manner the love of equality and frugality is inspired the love of equality and of a frugal œconomy is greatly excited by equality and frugality themselves in societies where both these virtues are established by law in monarchies and despotic governments no body aims at equality this does not so much as enter their thoughts they all aspire to superiority people of the very lowest condition desire to emerge from their obscurity only to lord it over their fellowsubjects it is the same with respect to frugality to love it we must practise and enjoy it it is not those who are enervated with pleasure that are fond of a frugal life were this natural and common alcibiades would never have been the admiration of the universe neither is it those who envy or admire the luxury of the great people that have present to their view none but rich men or men miserable like themselves detest their wretched condition without loving or knowing the real term or point of misery a true maxim it is therefore that in order to love equality and frugality in a republic these virtues must have been previously established by law chap v in what manner the laws establish equality in a democracy some ancient legislators as lycurgus and romulus made an equal division of lands a settlement of this kind can never take place but upon the foundation of a new republic or when the old one is so corrupt and the minds of the people are so disposed    that the poor think themselves obliged to demand and the rich obliged to consent to a remedy of this nature if the legislator in making a division of this kind does not enact laws at the same time to support it he forms only a temporary constitution inequality will break in where the laws have not precluded it and the republic will be utterly undone hence for the preservation of this equality it is absolutely necessary there should be some regulation in respect to womens dowries donations successions testamentary settlements and all other forms of contracting for were it once allowed to dispose of our property to whom and how we pleased the will of each individual would disturb the order of the fundamental law solon by permitting the athenians upon failure of issue to leave their estates to whom they pleased acted contrary to the ancient laws by which the estates were ordered to continue in the family of the testator† and even contrary to his own laws for by abolishing debts he had aimed at equality the law which prohibited peoples having two inheritances§ was extremely well adapted for a democracy it derived its origin from the equal distribution of lands and portions made to each citizen the law would not permit a single man to possess more than a single portion from the same source arose those laws by which the next relation was ordered to marry the heiress this law was given to the jews after the like distribution plato¶ who grounds his laws on this division    made the same regulation which had been received as a law by the athenians at athens there was a law whose spirit in my opinion has not been hitherto rightly understood it was lawful to marry a sister only by the fathers side but it was not permitted to espouse a sister by the same venter this custom was originally owing to republics whose spirit would not permit that two portions of land and consequently two inheritances should devolve on the same person a man who married his sister only by the fathers side could inherit but one estate namely that of his father but by espousing his sister by the same venter it might happen that his sisters father having no male issue might leave her his estate and consequently the brother who married her might be possessed of two little will it avail to object what philo says‡ that although the athenians were allowed to marry a sister by the fathers side and not by the mothers yet the contrary practice prevailed among the lacedæmonians who were permitted to espouse a sister by the mothers side and not by the fathers for i find in strabo† that at sparta whenever a woman was married to her brother she had half his portion for her dowry plain it is that this second law was made in order to prevent the bad consequences of the former that the estate belonging to the sisters family might not devolve on the brothers they gave half the brothers estate to the sister for her dowry    seneca∥ speaking of silanus who had married his sister says that the permission was limited at athens but general at alexandria in a monarchical government there was very little concern about any such thing as a division of estates excellent was that law which in order to maintain this division of lands in a democracy ordained that a father who had several children should pitch upon one of them to inherit his portion§ and leave the others to be adopted to the end that the number of citizens might always be kept upon an equality with that of the divisions phaleas of chalcedon‡ contrived a very extraordinary method of rendering all fortunes equal in a republic where there was the greatest inequality this was that the rich should give fortunes with their daughters to the poor but receive none themselves and that the poor should receive money for their daughters instead of giving them fortunes but i do not remember that a regulation of this kind ever took place in any republic it lays the citizens under such hard and oppressive conditions as would make them detest the very equality which they designed to establish it is proper sometimes that the laws should not seem to tend so directly to the end they propose though real equality be the very soul of a democracy it is so difficult to establish that an extreme exactness in this respect would not be always convenient sufficient it is to establish a census which should reduce or fix the differences to a certain point it is afterwards the business of particular    laws to level as it were the inequalities by the duties laid upon the rich and by the ease afforded to the poor it is moderate riches alone that can give or suffer this sort of compensations for as to men of overgrown estates every thing which does not contribute to advance their power and honour is considered by them as an injury all inequality in democracies ought to be derived from the nature of the government and even from the principle of equality for example it may be apprehended that people who are obliged to live by their labour would be too much impoverished by a public employment or neglect the duties attending it that artisans would grow insolent and that too great a number of freemen would overpower the ancient citizens in this case the equality† in a democracy may be suppressed for the good of the state but this is only an apparent equality for a man ruined by a public employment would be in a worse condition than his fellowcitizens and this same man being obliged to neglect his duty would reduce the rest to a worse condition than himself and so on chap vi in what manner the laws ought to maintain frugality in a democracy it is not sufficient in a wellregulated democracy that the divisions of land be equal they ought also to be small as was customary among the romans god forbid said curius to his soldiers‡ that a citizen should look upon that as a small piece of land which is sufficient to maintain him    as equality of fortunes supports frugality so the latter maintains the former these things though in themselves different are of such a nature as to be unable to subsist separately they reciprocally act upon each other if one withdraws itself from a democracy the other surely follows it true it is that when a democracy is founded in commerce private people may acquire vast riches without a corruption of morals this is because the spirit of commerce is naturally attended with that of frugality œconomy moderation labour prudence tranquility order and rule so long as this spirit subsists the riches it produces have no bad effect the mischief is when excessive wealth destroys the spirit of commerce then it is that the inconveniences of inequality begin to be felt in order to support this spirit commerce should be carried on by the principal citizens this should be their sole aim and study this the chief object of the laws and these very laws by dividing the estates of individuals in proportion to the increase of commerce should set every poor citizen so far at his ease as to be able to work like the rest and every wealthy citizen in such a mediocrity as to be obliged to take some pains either in preserving or acquiring a fortune it is an excellent law in a trading republic to make an equal division of the paternal estate among the children the consequence of this is that how great soever a fortune the father has made his children being not so rich as he are induced to avoid luxury and to work as he had done i speak here only of trading republics for as to those that have no commerce the legislator must pursue quite different measures  0 in greece there were two sorts of republics the one military like sparta the other commercial as athens in the former the citizens were obliged to be idle in the latter endeavours were used to inspire them with the love of industry and labour solon made idleness a crime and insisted that each citizen should give an account of his manner of getting a livelihood and indeed in a wellregulated democracy where peoples expences should extend only to what is necessary every one ought to have it for how should their wants be otherwise supplied chap vii other methods of favouring the principle of democracy an equal division of lands cannot be established in all democracies there are some circumstances in which a regulation of this nature would be impracticable dangerous and even subversive of the constitution we are not always obliged to proceed to extremes if it appears that this division of lands which was designed to preserve the peoples morals does not suit with the democracy recourse must be had to other methods if a permanent body be established to serve as a rule and pattern of manners a senate to which years virtue gravity and eminent services procure admittance the senators by being exposed to public view like the statues of the gods must naturally inspire every family with sentiments of virtue above all this senate must steadily adhere to the ancient institutions and mind that the people and the magistrates never swerve from them the preservation of the ancient customs is a very considerable point in respect to manners since a corrupt people seldom perform any memorable actions    seldom establish societies build cities or enact laws on the contrary since most institutions are derived from people whose manners are plain and simple to keep up the ancient custom is the way to preserve the original purity of morals besides if by some revolution the state has happened to assume a new form this seldom can be effected without infinite pains and labour and hardly ever by idle and debauched persons even those who had been the instruments of the revolution were desirous it should be relished which is difficult to compass without good laws hence it is that ancient institutions generally tend to reform the peoples manners and those of modern date to corrupt them in the course of a long administration the descent to vice is insensible but there is no reascending to virtue without making the most generous efforts it has been questioned whether the members of the senate we are speaking of ought to be for life or only chosen for a time doubtless they ought to be for life as was the custom at rome at sparta† and even at athens for we must not confound the senate at athens which was a body that changed every three months with the areopagus whose members as standing patterns were established for life let this be therefore a general maxim that in a senate designed to be a rule and the depositary as it were of manners the members ought to be chosen for life in a senate intended for the administration of affairs the members may be changed    the spirit says aristotle waxes old as well as the body this reflection holds good only in regard to a single magistrate but cannot be applied to a senatorian assembly at athens beside the areopagus there were guardians of the public morals as well as of the laws‡ at sparta all the old men were censors at rome the censorship was committed to two particular magistrates as the senate watched over the people the censors were to have an eye over the people and the senate their office was to reform the corruptions of the republic to stigmatize indolence to censure neglects and to correct mistakes as to flagrant crimes these were left to the punishment of the laws that roman law which required the accusations in cases of adultery to be public was admirably well calculated for preserving the purity of morals it intimidated married women as well as those who were to watch over their conduct nothing contributes more to the preservation of morals than an extreme subordination of the young to the old thus they are both restrained the former by their respect for those of advanced age and the latter by their regard for themselves nothing gives a greater force to the laws than a perfect subordination between the citizens and the magistrate the great difference which lycurgus established between sparta and the other cities says xenophon consists chiefly in the obedience the citizens shew to the laws they run when the magistrate calls them but at athens a rich man would be highly displeased to be thought dependent on the magistrate    paternal authority is likewise of great use towards the preservation of morals we have already observed that in a republic there is not so coercive a force as in other governments the laws must therefore endeavour to supply this defect by some means or other and this is done by paternal authority fathers at rome had the power of life and death over their children† at sparta every father had a right to correct another mans child paternal authority ended at rome together with the republic in monarchies where such a purity of morals is not required they are controuled by no other authority than that of the magistrates the roman laws which accustomed young people to dependence established a long minority perhaps we are mistaken in conforming to this custom there is no necessity for so much constraint in monarchies this very subordination in a republic might make it necessary for the father to continue in the possession of his childrens fortune during life as was the custom at rome but this is not agreeable to the spirit of monarchy chap viii in what manner the laws ought to be relative to the principle of government in an aristocracy if the people are virtuous in an aristocracy they enjoy very near the same happiness as in a popular government and the state grows powerful but as a great share of virtue is very rare where mens    fortunes are so unequal the laws must tend as much as possible to infuse a spirit of moderation and endeavour to reestablish that equality which was necessarily removed by the constitution the spirit of moderation is what we call virtue in an aristocracy it supplies the place of the spirit of equality in a popular state as the pomp and splendor with which kings are surrounded form a part of their power so modesty and simplicity of manners constitute the strength of an aristocratic nobility when they affect no distinction when they mix with the people dress like them and with them share all their pleasures the people are apt to forget their subjection and weakness every government has its nature and principle an aristocracy must not therefore assume the nature and principle of monarchy which would be the case were the nobles to be invested with personal privileges distinct from those of their body privileges ought to be for the senate and simple respect for the senators in aristocratical governments there are two principal sources of disorder excessive inequality between the governors and the governed and the same inequality between the different members of the body that governs from these two inequalities hatreds and jealousies arise which the laws ought ever to prevent or repress the first inequality is chiefly when the privileges of the nobility are honourable only as they are ignominious to the people such was the law at rome by which the patricians were forbidden to marry plebeians    a law that had no other effect than to render the patricians on the one side more haughty and on the other more odious the reader may see what advantages the tribunes derived from thence in their harangues this inequality occurs likewise when the condition of the citizens differs with regard to taxes which may happen four different ways when the nobles assume the privilege of paying none when they commit frauds to exempt themselves† when they engross the public money under pretence of rewards or appointments for their respective employments in fine when they render the common people tributary and divide among their own body the profits arising from the several subsidies this last case is very rare an aristocracy so instituted would be the most intolerable of all governments while rome inclined towards an aristocracy she avoided all these inconveniences the magistrates never received any emoluments from their office the chief men of the republic were taxed like the rest nay heavier and sometimes the taxes fell upon them alone in fine far from sharing among themselves the revenues of the state all they could draw from the public treasure and all the wealth that fortune flung into their laps they bestowed freely on the people to be excused from accepting public honours∥ it is a fundamental maxim that largesses are pernicious to the people in a democracy but salutary in an aristocratical government the former make them forget they are citizens the latter bring them to a sense of it    if the revenues of the state are not distributed amongst the people they must be convinced at least of their being well administered to feast their eyes with the public treasure is with them the same thing almost as enjoying it the golden chain displayed at venice the riches exhibited at rome in public triumphs the treasures preserved in the temple of saturn were in reality the wealth of the people it is a very essential point in an aristocracy that the nobles themselves should not levy the taxes the first order of the state in rome never concerned themselves with it the levying of taxes was committed to the second and even this in process of time was attended with great inconveniences in an aristocracy of this kind where the nobles levied the taxes the private people would be all at the discretion of persons in public employments and there would be no such thing as a superior tribunal to check their power the members appointed to remove the abuses would rather enjoy them the nobles would be like the princes of despotic governments who confiscate whatever estates they please soon would the profits hence arising be considered as a patrimony which avarice would enlarge at pleasure the farms would be lowered and the public revenues reduced to nothing this is the reason that some governments without having ever received any remarkable shock have dwindled away to such a degree as not only their neighbours but even their own subjects have been surprized at it the laws should likewise forbid the nobles all kind of commerce merchants of such unbounded credit would monopolize all to themselves commerce is a profession of people who are upon an equality hence among despotic states the most miserable are those in which the prince applies himself to trade    the laws of venice debar‡ the nobles from commerce by which they might even innocently acquire exorbitant wealth the laws ought to employ the most effectual means for making the nobles do justice to the people if they have not established a tribune they ought to be a tribune themselves every sort of asylum in opposition to the execution of the laws destroys aristocracy and is soon succeeded by tyranny they ought always to mortify the lust of dominion there should be either a temporary or perpetual magistrate to keep the nobles in awe as the ephori at sparta and the stateinquistors at venice magistrates subject to no formalities this sort of government stands in need of the strongest springs thus a mouth of stone§ is open to every informer at venice a mouth to which one would be apt to give the appellation of tyranny these arbitrary magistrates in an aristocracy bear some analogy to the censorship in democracies which of its own nature is equally independent and indeed the censors ought to be subject to no enquiry in relation to their conduct during their office they should meet with a thorough confidence and never be discouraged in this respect the practice of the romans deserved admiration magistrates of all denominations were accountable for their administration¶ except the censors    there are two very pernicious things in an aristocracy excess either of poverty or of wealth in the nobility to prevent their poverty it is necessary above all things to oblige them to pay their debts in time to moderate the excess of wealth prudent and gradual regulations should be made but no confiscations no agrarian laws no expunging of debts these are productive of infinite mischief the laws ought to abolish the right of primogeniture among the nobles† to the end that by a continual division of the inheritances their fortunes may be always upon a level there should be no substitutions no powers of redemption no rights of majorasgo or adoption the contrivances for perpetuating the grandeur of families in monarchical governments ought never to be employed in aristocracies‡ when the laws have compassed the equality of families the next thing is to preserve a proper harmony and union amongst them the quarrels of the nobility ought to be quickly decided otherwise the contests of individuals become those of families arbiters may terminate or even prevent the rise of disputes in fine the laws must not favour the distinctions raised by vanity among families under pretence that they are more noble or ancient than others pretences of this nature ought to be ranked among the weaknesses of private persons we have only to cast an eye on sparta there we may see how the ephori contrived to check the foibles of the kings as well as those of the nobility and common people    chap ix in what manner the laws are relative to their principle in monarchies as honour is the principle of a monarchical government the laws ought to be relative to this principle they should endeavour to support the nobility in respect to whom honour may be in some measure deemed both child and parent they should render the nobility hereditary not as a boundary between the power of the prince and the weakness of the people but as the link which connects them both in this government substitutions which preserve the estates of families undivided are extremely useful though in others not so proper here the power of redemption is of service as it restores to noble families the lands that had been alienated by the prodigality of a parent the lands of the nobility ought to have privileges as well as their persons the monarchs dignity is inseparable from that of his kingdom and the dignity of the nobleman from that of his fief all these privileges must be particular to the nobility and incommunicable to the people unless we intend to act contrary to the principle of government and to diminish the power of the nobles together with that of the people substitutions are a restraint to commerce the power of redemption produces an infinite number of processes every estate in land that is sold throughout the kingdom is in some measure without an owner for the space of a year privileges annexed to fiefs give a power very burthensome to those governments which tolerate them these are the inconveniences  0 of nobility inconveniences however that vanish when confronted with its general utility but when these privileges are communicated to the people every principle of government is wantonly violated in monarchies a person may leave the bulk of his estate to one of his children a permission improper in any other government the laws ought to favour all kind of commerce∥ consistent with the constitution to the end that the subjects may without ruining themselves be able to satisfy the continual cravings of the prince and his court they should establish some regulation that the manner of collecting the taxes may not be more burthensome than the taxes themselves the weight of duties produces labour labour weariness and weariness the spirit of indolence chap x of the expedition peculiar to the executive power in monarchies great is the advantage which a monarchical government has over a republic as the state is conducted by a single person the executive power is thereby enabled to act with greater expedition but as this expedition may degenerate into rapidity the laws should use some contrivance to slacken it they ought not only to favour the nature of each constitution but likewise to remedy the abuses that might result from this very nature cardinal richelieu§ advises monarchs to permit no such things as societies or communities that raise    difficulties upon every trifle if this mans heart had not been bewitched with the love of despotic power still these arbitrary notions would have filled his head the bodies intrusted with the depositum of the laws are never more obedient than when they proceed slowly and use that reflection in the princes affairs which can scarcely be expected from the ignorance of a court or from the precipitation of its councils¶ what would have become of the finest monarchy in the world if the magistrates by their delays their complaints and entreaties had not checked the rapidity even of their princes virtues when these monarchs consulting only the generous impulse of their minds would fain have given a boundless reward to services performed with an unlimited courage and fidelity chap xi of the excellence of a monarchical government monarchy has a great advantage over a despotic government as it naturally requires there should be several orders or ranks of subjects the state is more permanent the constitution more steady and the person of him who governs more secure cicero is of opinion that the establishing of the tribunes preserved the republic and indeed says he the violence of a headless people is more terrible a chief or head is sensible that the affair depends upon himself and therefore he thinks but the people in their impetuosity are ignorant of the danger into which they hurry    themselves this reflection may be applied to a despotic government which is a people without tribunes and to a monarchy where the people have some sort of tribunes accordingly it is observable that in the commotions of a despotic government the people hurried away by their passions are apt to push things as far as they can go the disorders they commit are all extreme whereas in monarchies matters are seldom carried to excess the chiefs are apprehensive on their own account they are afraid of being abandoned and the intermediate dependent powers† do not choose that the populace should have too much the upper hand it rarely happens that the states of the kingdom are entirely corrupted the prince adheres to these and the seditious who have neither will nor hopes to subvert the government have neither power nor will to dethrone the prince in these circumstances men of prudence and authority interfere moderate measures are first proposed then complied with and things at length are redressed the laws resume their vigour and command submission thus all our histories are full of civil wars without revolutions while the histories of despotic governments abound with revolutions without civil wars the writers of the history of the civil wars of some countries even those who fomented them sufficiently demonstrate the little foundation princes have to suspect the authority with which they invest particular bodies of men since even under the unhappy circumstance of their errors they sighed only after the laws and their duty and restrained more than they were capable of inflaming the impetuosity of the revolted∥    cardinal richelieu reflecting perhaps that he had too much reduced the states of the kingdom has recourse to the virtues of the prince and of his ministers for the support‡ of government but he requires so many things that indeed there is none but an angel capable of such attention such resolution and knowledge and scarce can we flatter ourselves ever to see such a prince and ministers no not while monarchy subsists as people who live under a good government are happier than those who without rule or leaders wander about the forests so monarchs who live under the fundamental laws of their country are far happier than despotic princes who have nothing to regulate either their own passions or those of their subjects chap xii the same subject continued let us not look for magnanimity in despotic governments the prince cannot impart a greatness which he has not himself with him there is no such thing as glory it is in monarchies we behold the subjects encircling the throne and cheered by the irradiancy of the sovereign there it is that each person filling as it were a larger space is capable of exercising those virtues which adorn the soul not with independence but with true dignity and greatness chap xiii an idea of despotic power when the savages of louisiana are desirous of fruit they cut the tree to the root and gather the    fruit this is an emblem of despotic government chap xiv in what manner the laws are relative to the principles of despotic government the principle of despotic government is fear but a timid ignorant and faintspirited people have no occasion for a great number of laws every thing ought to depend here on two or three ideas hence there is no necessity that any new notions should be added when we want to break a horse we take care not to let him change his master his lesson or his pace thus an impression is made on his brain by two or three motions and no more if a prince is shut up in a seraglio he cannot leave his voluptuous abode without alarming those who keep him confined they will not bear that his person and power should pass into other hands he seldom therefore wages war in person and hardly ventures to intrust the command to his generals a prince of this stamp unaccustomed to resistance in his palace is enraged to see his will opposed by armed force hence he is generally governed by wrath or vengeance besides he can have no notion of true glory war therefore is carried on under such a government in its full natural fury and less extent is given to the law of nations than in other states such a prince has so many imperfections that they are afraid to expose his natural stupidity to public view he is concealed in his palace and the    people are ignorant of his situation it is lucky for him that the inhabitants of those countries need only the name of a prince to govern them when charles xii was at bender he met with some opposition from the senate of sweden upon which he wrote word home that he would send one of his boots to command them this boot would have governed like a despotic prince if the prince is a prisoner he is supposed to be dead and another mounts the throne the treaties made by the prisoner are void his successor will not ratify them and indeed as he is the law the state and the prince when he is no longer a prince he is nothing were he not therefore deemed to be deceased the state would be subverted one thing which chiefly determined the turks to conclude a separate peace with peter i was the muscovites telling the vizir that in sweden another prince had been set upon the throne† the preservation of the state is only the preservation of the prince or rather of the palace where he is confined whatever does not directly menace this palace or the capital makes no impression on ignorant proud and prejudiced minds and as for the concatenation of events they are unable to trace to foresee or even to conceive it politics with its several springs and laws must here be very much limited the political government is as simple as the civil the whole is reduced to reconciling the political and civil administration to the domestic government the officers of state to those of the seraglio such a state is happiest when it can look upon itself as the only one in the world when it is environed    with deserts and separated from those people whom they call barbarians since it cannot depend on the militia it is proper it should destroy a part of itself as fear is the principle of despotic government its end is tranquillity but this tranquillity cannot be called a peace no it is only the silence of those towns which the enemy is ready to invade since the strength does not lie in the state but in the army that founded it in order to defend the state the army must be preserved how formidable soever to the prince how then can we reconcile the security of the government to that of the princes person observe how industriously the russian government endeavours to temper its arbitrary power which it finds more burthensome than the people themselves they have broke their numerous guards mitigated criminal punishments erected tribunals entered into a knowledge of the laws and instructed the people but there are particular causes that will probably once more involve them in the very misery which they now endeavour to avoid in those states religion has more influence than any where else it is fear added to fear in mahometan countries it is partly from their religion that the people derive the surprizing veneration they have for their prince it is religion that amends in some measure the turkish constitution the subjects who have no attachment of honour to the glory and grandeur of the state are connected with it by the force and principle of religion of all despotic governments there is none that labours more under its own weight than that wherein the prince declares himself proprietor of all the    lands and heir to all his subjects hence the neglect of agriculture arises and if the prince intermeddles likewise in trade all manner of industry is ruined under this sort of government nothing is repaired or improved† houses are built only for the necessity of habitation there is no digging of ditches or planting of trees every thing is drawn from but nothing restored to the earth the ground lies untilled and the whole country becomes a desert is it to be imagined that the laws which abolish the property of land and the succession of estates will diminish the avarice and cupidity of the great by no means they will rather stimulate this cupidity and avarice the great men will be prompted to use a thousand oppressive methods imagining they have no other property than the gold and silver which they are able to seize upon by violence or to conceal to prevent therefore the utter ruin of the state the avidity of the prince ought to be moderated by some established custom thus in turkey the sovereign is satisfied with the right of three per cent on the value of inheritances‡ but as he gives the greatest part of the lands to his soldiery and disposes of them as he pleases as he seizes on all the inheritances of the officers of the empire at their decease as he has the property of the possessions of those who die without issue and the daughters have only the usufruct it thence follows that the greatest part of the estates of the country are held in a precarious manner    by the laws of bantam the king seizes on the whole inheritance even wife children and habitation in order to elude the cruellest part of this law they are obliged to marry their children at eight nine or ten years of age and sometimes younger to the end that they may not be a wretched part of the fathers succession in countries where there are no fundamental laws the succession to the empire cannot be fixed the crown is then elective and the right of electing is in the prince who names a successor either of his own or of some other family in vain would it be to establish here the succession of the eldest son the prince might always choose another the successor is declared by the prince himself or by a civil war hence a despotic state is upon another account more liable than a monarchical government to dissolution as every prince of the royal family is held equally capable of being chosen hence it follows that the prince who ascends the throne immediately strangles his brothers as in turkey or puts out their eyes as in persia or bereaves them of their understanding as in the moguls country or if these precautions are not used as in morocco the vacancy of the throne is always attended with the horrors of a civil war by the constitutions of russia† the czar may choose whom he has a mind for his successor whether of his own or of a strange family such a settlement produces a thousand revolutions and renders the throne as tottering as the succession is arbitrary the right of succession being one of those    things which are of most importance to the people to know the best is that which most sensibly strikes them such as a certain order of birth a settlement of this kind puts a stop to intrigues and stifles ambition the mind of a weak prince is no longer enslaved nor is he made to speak his will as he is just expiring when the succession is established by a fundamental law only one prince is the successor and his brothers have neither a real nor apparent right to dispute the crown with him they can neither pretend to nor take any advantage of the will of a father there is then no more occasion to confine or kill the kings brother than any other subject but in despotic governments where the princes brothers are equally his slaves and his rivals prudence requires that their persons be secured especially in mahometan countries where religion considers victory or success as a divine decision in their favour so that they have no such thing as a monarch de jure but only de facto there is a far greater incentive to ambition in countries where the princes of the blood are sensible that if they do not ascend the throne they must be either imprisoned or put to death than amongst us where they are placed in such a station as may satisfy if not their ambition at least their moderate desires the princes of despotic governments have ever perverted the use of marriage they generally take a great many wives especially in that part of the world where absolute power is in some measure naturalized namely asia hence they come to have such a multitude of children that they can hardly have any great affection for them nor the children for one another  0 the reigning family resembles the state it is too weak itself and its head too powerful it seems very numerous and extensive and yet is suddenly extinct artaxerxes‡ put all his children to death for conspiring against him it is not at all probable that fifty children should conspire against their father and much less that this conspiracy should be owing to his having refused to resign his concubine to his eldest son it is more natural to believe that the whole was an intrigue of those oriental seraglios where fraud treachery and deceit reign in silence and darkness and where an old prince grown every day more infirm is the first prisoner of the palace after what has been said one would imagine that human nature should perpetually rise up against despotism but notwithstanding the love of liberty so natural to mankind notwithstanding their innate detestation of force and violence most nations are subject to this very government this is easily accounted for to form a moderate government it is necessary to combine the several powers to regulate temper and set them in motion to give as it were ballast to one in order to enable it to counterpoise the other this is a masterpiece of legislation rarely produced by hazard and seldom attained by prudence on the contrary a despotic government offers itself as it were at first sight it is uniform throughout and as passions only are requisite to establish it this is what every capacity may reach    chap xv the same subject continued in warm climates where despotic power generally prevails the passions disclose themselves earlier and are sooner extinguished∥ the understanding is sooner ripened they are in less danger of squandering away their fortunes there is less facility of distinguishing themselves in the world less communication between young people who are confined at home they marry much earlier and consequently may be sooner of age than in our european climates in turkey they are of age at fifteen§ they have no such thing as a cession of goods in a government where there is no fixed property people depend rather on the person than on his estate the cession of goods is naturally admitted in moderate governments but especially in republics because of the greater confidence usually placed in the probity of the citizens and the lenity and moderation arising from a form of government which every subject seems to have preferred to all others had the legislators of the roman republic established the cession of goods† they never would have been exposed to so many seditions and civil discords neither would they have experienced the danger of the evils nor the inconveniency of the remedies poverty and the precariousness of property in a despotic state render usury natural each person raising the value of his money in proportion to the danger he sees in lending it misery therefore pours in    from all parts into those unhappy countries they are bereft of every thing even of the resource of borrowing hence it is that a merchant under this government is unable to carry on an extensive commerce he lives from hand to mouth and were he to encumber himself with a large quantity of merchandises he would lose more by the exorbitant interest he must give for money than he could possibly get by the goods hence they have no laws here relating to commerce they are all reduced to what is called the bare police a government cannot be unjust without having hands to exercise its injustice now it is impossible but these hands will be grasping for themselves the embezzling of the public money is therefore natural in despotic states as this is a common crime under such a government confiscations are very useful by these the people are eased the money drawn by this method being a considerable tribute which could hardly be raised on the exhausted subject neither is there in those countries any one family which the prince would be glad to preserve in moderate governments it is quite a different thing confiscations would render property uncertain would strip innocent children would destroy a whole family instead of punishing a single criminal in republics they would be attended with the mischief of subverting equality which is the very soul of this government by depriving a citizen of his necessary subsistence there is a roman law‡ against confiscations except in the case of crimen majestatis or high treason of the most heinous nature it would be a prudent    thing to follow the spirit of this law and to limit confiscations to particular crimes in countries where a local custom has rendered real estates alienable bodin very justly observes that confiscations should extend only to such as are purchased or acquired∥ chap xvi of the communication of power in a despotic government the power is communicated entire to the person intrusted with it the vizir himself is the despotic prince and each particular officer is the vizir in monarchies the power is less immediately applied being tempered by the monarch as he gives it‡ he makes such a distribution of his authority as never to communicate a part of it without reserving a greater share to himself hence in monarchies the governors of towns are not so dependent on the governor of the province as not to be still more so on the prince and the private officers of military bodies are not so far subject to their general as not to owe still a greater subjection to their sovereign in most monarchies it has been wisely regulated that those who have an extensive command should not belong to any military corps so that as they have no authority but through the princes pleasure and as they may be employed or not they are in some measure in the service and in some measure out of it this is incompatible with a despotic government for if those who are not actually employed were still invested with privileges and titles the consequence    must be that there would be a kind of men in the state who might be said to be great of themselves a thing directly opposite to the nature of this government were the governor of a town independent of the bashaw expedients would be daily necessary to make them agree which is highly absurd in a despotic state besides if a particular governor might refuse to obey how could the other answer for his province with his head in this kind of government authority must ever be wavering nor is that of the lowest magistrate more steady than that of the despotic prince under moderate governments the law is prudent in all its parts and perfectly well known so that even the pettiest magistrates are capable of following it but in a despotic state where the princes will is the law though the prince were wise yet how could the magistrate follow a will he does not know he must certainly follow his own again as the law is only the princes will and as the prince can only will what he knows the consequence is that there are an infinite number of people who must will for him and make their wills keep pace with his in fine as the law is the momentary will of the prince it is necessary that those who will for him should follow his subitaneous manner of willing chap xvii of presents it is a received custom in despotic countries never to address any superior whomsoever not excepting their kings without making them a present    the mogul† never receives the petitions of his subjects if they come with empty hands these princes spoil even their own favours but thus it must ever be in a government where no man is a citizen where they have all a notion that a superior is under no obligation to an inferior where men imagine themselves bound by no other tie than the chastisements inflicted by one party over another where in fine there is very little to do and where the people have seldom an occasion of presenting themselves before the great of offering their petitions and much less their complaints in a republic presents are odious because virtue stands in no need of them in monarchies honour is a much stronger incentive than presents but in a despotic government where there is neither honour nor virtue people cannot be determined to act but through hope of the conveniences of life it is in conformity to republican ideas that plato‡ ordered those who received presents for doing their duty to be punished with death they must not take presents says he neither for good nor for evil actions a very bad law that was among the romans∥ which gave the magistrates leave to accept of small presents§ provided they did not exceed one hundred crowns the whole year they who receive nothing expect nothing they who receive a little soon covet more till at length their desires swell to an exorbitant height besides it is much easier to convict a man who knows himself obliged to accept of no present at all and yet will accept of something    than a person who takes more when he ought to take less and who always finds pretexts excuses and plausible reasons in justification of his conduct chap xviii of rewards conferred by the sovereign in despotic governments where as we have already observed the principal motive of action is the hope of the conveniences of life the prince who confers rewards has nothing to bestow but money in monarchies where honour alone predominates the princes rewards would consist only of marks of distinction if the distinctions established by honour were not attended with luxury which necessarily brings on its wants the prince therefore is obliged to confer such honours as lead to wealth but in a republic where virtue reigns a motive selfsufficient and which excludes all others the recompences of the state consist only of public attestations of this virtue it is a general rule that great rewards in monarchies and republics are a sign of their decline because they are a proof of their principles being corrupted and that the idea of honour has no longer the same force in monarchy nor the title of citizen the same weight in a republic the very worst roman emperors were those who were most profuse in their largesses for example caligula claudius nero otho vitellius commodus heliogabalus and caracalla the best as augustus vespasian antoninus pius marcus aurelius and pertinax were œconomists under good emperors the state resumed its principles all other treasures were supplied by that of honour    chap xix new consequences of the principles of the three governments i cannot conclude this book without making some applications of my three principles quest   it is a question whether the laws ought to oblige a subject to accept of a public employment my opinion is that they ought in a republic but not in a monarchical government in the former public employments are attestations of virtue depositums with which a citizen is entrusted by his country for whose sake alone he ought to live to act and to think consequently he cannot refuse them¶ in the latter public offices are testimonies of honour now such is the capriciousness of honour that it chooses to accept of none of these testimonies but when and in what manner it pleases the late king of sardinia inflicted punishments on his subjects who refused the dignities and public offices of the state in this he unknowingly followed republican ideas but his manner of governing in other respects sufficiently proves that this was not his intention quest   secondly it is questioned whether a subject should be obliged to accept of a post in the army inferior to that which he held before among the romans it was usual to see a captain serve the next year under his lieutenant† this is because virtue in republics requires a continual sacrifice of    our persons and of our repugnances for the good of the state but in monarchies honour true or false will never bear with what it calls degrading itself in despotic governments where honour posts and ranks are equally abused they indiscriminately make of a prince a scullion and of a scullion a prince quest   thirdly it may be enquired whether civil and military employments should be conferred on the same person in republics i think they should be joined but in monarchies separated in the former it would be extremely dangerous to make the profession of arms a particular state distinct from that of civil functions and in the latter no less dangerous would it be to confer these two employments on the same person in republics a person takes up arms only with a view to defend his country and its laws it is because he is a citizen he makes himself for a while a soldier were these two distinct states the person who under arms thinks himself a citizen would soon be made sensible he is only a soldier in monarchies they whose condition engages them in the profession of arms have nothing but glory or at least honour or fortune in view to men therefore like these the prince should never give any civil employments on the contrary they ought to be checked by the civil magistrate that the same persons may not have at the same time the confidence of the people and the power to abuse it‡ we have only to cast an eye on a nation that may be justly called a republic disguised under the form of monarchy and we shall see how jealous they are of making a separate order of the profession of arms    and how the military state is constantly allied with that of the citizen and even sometimes of the magistrate to the end that these qualities may be a pledge for their country which should never be forgotten the division of civil and military employments made by the romans after the extinction of the republic was not an arbitrary thing it was a consequence of the change which happened in the constitution of rome it was natural to a monarchical government and what was only commenced under augustus∥ succeeding emperors§ were obliged to finish in order to temper the military government procopius therefore the competitor of valens the emperor was very much to blame when conferring the proconsular dignity¶ upon hormisdas a prince of the bloodroyal of persia he restored to this magistracy the military command of which it had been formerly possessed unless indeed he had very particular reasons for so doing a person that aspires to the sovereignty concerns himself less about what is serviceable to the state than what is likely to promote his own interest quest   fourthly it is a question whether public employments should be sold they ought not i think in despotic governments where the subjects must be instantaneously placed or displaced by the prince but in monarchies this custom is not at all improper by reason it is an inducement to engage in that as a family employment which would not be undertaken through a motive of virtue it fixes likewise every one to his duty and renders the several  0 orders of the kingdom more permanent suidas very justly observes that anastasius had changed the empire into a kind of aristocracy by selling all public employments plato† cannot bear with this prostitution this is exactly says he as if a person were to be made a mariner or pilot of a ship for his money is it possible that this rule should be bad in every other employment of life and hold good only in the administration of a republic but plato speaks of a republic founded on virtue and we of a monarchy now in monarchies where though there were no such thing as a regular sale of public offices still the indigence and avidity of the courtier would equally prompt him to expose them to sale chance will furnish better subjects than the princes choice in short the method of attaining to honours through riches inspires and cherishes industry‡ a thing extremely wanting in this kind of government quest   the fifth question is in what kind of government censors are necessary my answer is that they are necessary in a republic where the principle of government is virtue we must not imagine that criminal actions only are destructive of virtue it is destroyed also by omissions by neglects by a certain coolness in the love of our country by bad examples and by the seeds of corruption whatever does not openly violate but elude the laws does not subvert but weaken them ought to fall under the enquiry and correction of the censors we are surprised at the punishment of the areopagite for killing a sparrow which to escape the pursuit of a hawk had taken shelter in his bosom surprised we are also that an areopagite should put    his son to death for pulling out the eyes of a little bird but let us reflect that the question here does not relate to a criminal sentence but to a judgement concerning manners in a republic founded on manners in monarchies there should be no censors the former are founded on honour and the nature of honour is to have the whole world for its censor every man who fails in this article is subject to the reproaches even of those who are void of honour here the censors would be spoilt by the very people whom they ought to correct they could not prevail against the corruption of a monarchy the corruption rather would be too strong against them hence it is obvious that there ought to be no censors in despotic governments the example of china seems to derogate from this rule but we shall see in the course of this work the particular reasons of that institution book vi consequences of the principles of different governments with respect to the simplicity of civil and criminal laws the form of judgements and the inflicting of punishments chap i of the simplicity of civil laws in different governments monarchies do not permit of so great a simplicity of laws as despotic governments for in monarchies there must be courts of judicature these must give their decisions the decisions must be preserved and learnt that we may judge in the    same manner today as yesterday and that the lives and property of the citizens may be as certain and fixt as the very constitution of the state in monarchies the administration of justice which decides not only in whatever belongs to life and property but likewise to honour demands very scrupulous enquiries the delicacy of the judge increases in proportion to the increase of his trust and of the importance of the interests on which he determines we must not therefore be surprised to find so many rules restrictions and extensions in the laws of those countries rules that multiply the particular cases and seem to make of reason itself an art the difference of rank birth and condition established in monarchical governments is frequently attended with distinctions in the nature of property and the laws relative to the constitution of this government may augment the number of these distinctions hence among us goods are divided into real estates purchases dowries paraphernalia paternal and maternal inheritances moveables of different kinds estates held in feesimple or in tail acquired by descent or conveyance allodial or held by soccage groundrents or annuities each sort of goods is subject to particular rules which must be complied with in the disposal of them these things must needs diminish the simplicity of the laws in our governments the fiefs are become hereditary it was necessary that the nobility should have a fixt property that is the fief should have a certain consistency to the end that the proprietor might be always in a capacity of serving the prince this must have been productive of great varieties for instance there are countries where fiefs could not be divided among the brothers in others the    younger brothers may be allowed a more generous subsistence the monarch who knows each of his provinces may establish different laws or tolerate different customs but as the despotic prince knows nothing and can attend to nothing he must take general measures and govern by a rigid and inflexible will which throughout his whole dominions produces the same effect in short every thing bends under his feet in proportion as the decisions of the courts of judicature are multiplied in monarchies the law is loaded with decrees that sometimes contradict one another either because succeeding judges are of a different way of thinking or because the same causes are sometimes well and at other times ill defended or in fine by reason of an infinite number of abuses to which all human regulations are liable this is a necessary evil which the legislator redresses from time to time as contrary even to the spirit of moderate governments for when people are obliged to have recourse to courts of judicature this should come from the nature of the constitution and not from the contradiction or uncertainty of the law in governments where there are necessary distinctions of persons there must likewise be privileges this also diminishes the simplicity and creates a thousand exceptions one of the privileges least burthensome to society and especially to him who confers it is that of pleading in one court preferably to another here new difficulties arise when it becomes a question before which court we shall plead far different is the case of the people under despotic governments in those countries i can see nothing that the legislator is able to decree or the    magistrate to judge as the lands belong to the prince it follows that there are scarce any civil laws in regard to landed property from the right the sovereign has to successions it follows likewise that there are none relating to inheritances the monopolies established by the prince for himself in some countries render all sorts of commercial laws quite useless the marriages which they usually contract with female slaves are the cause that there are scarce any civil laws relating to dowries or to the particular advantage of married women from the prodigious multitude of slaves it follows likewise that there are very few who have any such thing as a will of their own and of course are answerable for their conduct before a judge most moral actions that are only in consequence of a fathers a husbands or a masters will are regulated by them and not by the magistrates i forgot to observe that as what we call honour is a thing hardly known in those countries the several difficulties relating to this article though of such importance with us are with them quite out of the question despotic power is selfsufficient round it there is an absolute vacuum hence it is that when travellers favour us with the description of countries where arbitrary sway prevails they seldom make mention of civil laws all occasions therefore of wrangling and lawsuits are here removed and to this in part it is owing that litigious people in those countries are so roughly handled as the injustice of their demand is neither screened palliated nor protected    by an infinite number of laws of course it is immediately discovered chap ii of the simplicity of criminal laws in different governments we hear it generally said that justice ought to be administered with us as in turkey is it possible then that the most ignorant of all nations should be the most clearsighted in a point which it most behoves mankind to know if we examine the set forms of justice with respect to the trouble the subject undergoes in recovering his property or in obtaining satisfaction for an injury or affront we shall find them doubtless too numerous but if we consider them in the relation they bear to the liberty and security of every individual we shall often find them too few and be convinced that the trouble expence delays and even the very dangers of our judiciary proceedings are the price that each subject pays for his liberty in turkey where little regard is shewn to the honour life or estate of the subject all causes are speedily decided the method of determining them is a matter of indifference provided they be determined the bashaw after a quick hearing orders which party he pleases to be bastinadoed and then sends them about their business here it would be dangerous to be of a litigious disposition this supposes a strong desire of obtaining justice a settled aversion an active mind and a steadiness in pursuing ones point all this should be avoided in a government where fear ought to be the only prevailing sentiment and in which popular    disturbances are frequently attended with sudden and unforeseen revolutions here every man ought to know that the magistrate must not hear his name mentioned and that his security depends entirely on his being reduced to a kind of annihilation but in moderate governments where the life of the meanest subject is deemed precious no man is stript of his honour or property but after a long enquiry and no man is bereft of life till his very country has attacked him an attack that is never made without leaving him all possible means of making his defence hence it is that when a person renders himself absolute he immediately thinks of reducing the number of laws in a government thus constituted they are more affected with particular inconveniences than with the liberty of the subject which is very little minded in republics it is plain that as many formalities at least are necessary as in monarchies in both governments they increase in proportion to the value which is set on the honour fortune liberty and life of the subject in republican governments men are all equal equal they are also in despotic governments in the former because they are every thing in the latter because they are nothing chap iii in what governments and in what cases the judges ought to determine according to the express letter of the law the nearer the government approaches towards a republic the more the manner of judging becomes    settled and fixt hence it was a fault in the republic of sparta for the ephori to pass such arbitrary judgements without having any laws to direct them the first consuls at rome pronounced sentence in the same manner as the ephori but the inconveniency of this proceeding was soon felt and they were obliged to have recourse to express and determinate laws in despotic governments there are no laws the judge himself is his own rule there are laws in monarchies and where these are explicit the judge conforms to them where they are otherwise he endeavours to investigate their spirit in republics the very nature of the constitution requires the judges to follow the letter of the law otherwise the law might be explained to the prejudice of every citizen in cases where their honour property or life are concerned at rome the judges had no more to do than to declare that the person accused was guilty of a particular crime and then the punishment was found in the laws as may be seen in divers laws still extant in england the jury give their verdict whether the fact brought under their cognizance be proved or not if it be proved the judge pronounces the punishment inflicted by the law and for this he needs only to open his eyes chap iv of the manner of passing judgement hence arises the different manner of passing judgement in monarchies the judges choose the method of arbitration they deliberate together they communicate their sentiments for the sake of unanimity they moderate their opinions in order to render them conformable to those of others and    the lesser number is obliged to give way to the majority but this is not agreeable to the nature of a republic at rome and in the cities of greece the judges never entered into a consultation each gave his opinion one of these three ways i absolve i condemn it does not appear clear to me this was because the people judged or were supposed to judge but the people are far from being civilians all these restrictions and methods of arbitration are above their reach they must have only one object and one single fact set before them and then they have only to see whether they ought to condemn to acquit or to suspend their judgement the romans introduced fet forms of actions† after the example of the greeks and established a rule that each cause should be directed by its proper action this was necessary in their manner of judging it was necessary to fix the state of the question that the people might have it always before their eyes otherwise in a long process this state of the question would continually change and be no longer distinguished hence it followed that the roman judges granted only the simple demand without making any addition deduction or limitation but the prætors devised other forms of actions which were called ex bona fide where the method of pronouncing sentence was left to the disposition of the judge this was more agreeable to the spirit of monarchy hence it is a saying among the french lawyers that in france‡ all actions are ex bona fide    chap v in what governments the sovereign may be judge machiavel§ attributes the loss of the liberty of florence to the peoples not judging in a body in cases of hightreason against themselves as was customary at rome for this purpose they had eight judges but the few says machiavel are corrupted by a few i should willingly adopt the maxim of this great man but as in those cases the political interest prevails in some measure over the civil for it is always an inconveniency that the people should be judges in their own cause in order to remedy this evil the laws must provide as much as possible for the security of individuals with this view the roman legislators did two things they gave the persons accused permission to banish themselves∥ before sentence was pronounced¶ and they ordained that the goods of those who were condemned should be sacred to prevent their being confiscated to the people we shall see in the xith book the other limitations that were set to the judicatory power residing in the people solon knew how to prevent the abuse which the people might make of their power in criminal judgements he ordained that the court of areopagus should reexamine the affair that if they believed the party accused was unjustly acquitted they should impeach him again before the people that if they believed him unjustly condemned† they should prevent the execution of the sentence and make them  00 rejudge the proceeding an admirable law that subjected the people to the censure of the magistracy which they most revered and even to their own in affairs of this kind it is always proper to throw in some delays especially when the party accused is under confinement to the end that the people may grow calm and give their judgement coolly in despotic governments the prince himself may be judge but in monarchies this cannot be the constitution by such means would be subverted and the dependent intermediate powers annihilated all set forms of judgement would cease fear would take possession of the peoples minds and paleness spread itself over every countenance the more confidence honour affection and security in the subject the more extended is the power of the monarch we shall give here a few more reflections on this point in monarchies the prince is the party that prosecutes the person accused and causes him to be punished or acquitted now were he himself to sit upon the trial he would be both judge and party in this government the prince has frequently the benefit of confiscation so that here again by determining criminal causes he would be both judge and party farther by this method he would deprive himself of the most glorious attribute of sovereignty namely that of granting pardon for it would be quite ridiculous of him to make and unmake his decisions surely he would not choose to contradict himself besides this would be confounding all ideas it would be impossible to tell whether a man was acquitted or received his pardon lewis xiii being desirous to sit in judgement upon the trial of the duke ae la valette† sent for some  0  members of the parliament and of the privycouncil to debate the matter upon their being ordered by the king to give their opinion concerning the warrant for his arrest the president de believre said that he found it very strange a prince should pass sentence upon a subject that kings had reserved to themselves the power of pardoning and left that of condemning to their officers that his majesty wanted to see before him at the bar a person who by his decision was to be hurried away into the other world that the princes countenance should inspire with hopes and not confound with fears that his presence alone removed ecclesiastic censures and that subjects ought not to go away dissatisfied from the sovereign when sentence was passed the same magistrate declared this is an unprecedented judgement to see contrary to the example of past ages a king of france in the quality of a judge condemning a gentleman to death‡ again sentences passed by the prince would be an inexhaustible source of injustice and abuse the courtiers by their importunity would always be able to extort his decisions some roman emperors were so mad as to sit as judges themselves the consequence was that no reigns ever so surprized the world with oppression and injustice claudius says tacitus∥ having appropriated to himself the determination of law suits and the function of magistrates gave occasion to all manner of rapine but nero upon coming to the empire after claudius endeavoured to conciliate the minds of the people by declaring that he would take care not to be judge himself in private causes  0  that the parties might not be exposed within the walls of a palace to the iniquitous influence of a few freedmen§ under the reign of arcadius says zozimus¶ a swarm of calumniators spread themselves on every side and infected the court upon a persons decease it was immediately supposed he had left no children and in consequence of this his property was given away by a recript for as the prince was surprizingly stupid and the empress excessively enterprizing she was a slave to the insatiable avarice of her domestics and confidents insomuch that to an honest man nothing could be more desirable than death formerly says procopius† there used to be very few people at court but in justinians reign as the judges had no longer the liberty of administering justice their tribunals were deserted while the princes palace resounded with the litigious clamours of the several parties every body knows what a prostitution there was of public judgements and even of the very laws themselves at the emperors court the laws are the eye of the prince by them he sees what would otherwise escape his observation should he attempt the function of a judge he would not then labour for himself but for impostors whose aim is to deceive him chap vi that in monarchies ministers ought not to sit as judges it is likewise a very great inconveniency in monarchies for the ministers of the prince to sit as  0  judges we have still instances of states where there is a great number of judges to decide exchequer causes and where the ministers nevertheless a thing most incredible would fain determine them many are the reflections that here arise but this single one will suffice for my purpose there is in the very nature of things a kind of contrast between a princes council and his courts of judicature the kings council ought to be composed of a few persons and the courts of judicature of a great many the reason is in the former things should be undertaken and conducted with a kind of warmth and passion which can hardly be expected but from four or five men who make it their sole business on the contrary in courts of judicature a certain coolness is requisite and an indifference in some measure to all manner of affairs chap vii of a single magistrate a magistracy of this kind cannot take place but in a despotic government we have an instance in the roman history how far a single magistrate may abuse his power might it not be very well expected that appius on his tribunal should contemn all laws after having violated that of his own‡ enacting livy has given us the iniquitous distinction of the decemvir he had suborned a man to reclaim virginia in his presence as his slave virginias relations insisted that by virtue of his own law she should be consigned to them till the definitive judgement was passed upon which he declared that his law had been enacted only in favour of the father  0  and that as virginius was absent no application could be made of it to the present case∥ chap viii of accusation in different governments at rome§ it was lawful for one citizen to accuse another this was agreeable to the spirit of a republic where each citizen ought to have an unlimited zeal for the public good and is supposed to hold all the rights of his country in his own hands under the emperors the republican maxims were still pursued and instantly appeared a pernicious tribe a swarm of informers crafty wicked men who could stoop to any indignity to serve the purposes of their ambition were sure to busy themselves in the search of criminals whose condemnation might be agreeable to the prince this was the road to honour and preferment¶ but luckily we are strangers to it in our country we have at present an admirable law namely that by which the prince who is established for the execution of the laws appoints an officer in each court of judicature to prosecute all sorts of crimes in his name hence the profession of informers is a thing unknown to us for if this public avenger were suspected to abuse his office he would soon be obliged to mention his author by platos laws those who neglect to inform or assist the magistrates are liable to punishment this would not be so proper in our days the public prosecutor warches for the safety of the citizens he proceeds in his office while they enjoy their quiet and ease  0  chap ix of the severity of punishments in different governments the severity of punishments is fitter for despotic governments whose principle is terror than for a monarchy or a republic whose spring is honour and virtue in moderate governments the love of ones country shame and the fear of blame are restraining motives capable of preventing a multitude of crimes here the greatest punishment of a bad action is conviction the civil laws have therefore a softer way of correcting and do not require so much force and severity in those states a good legislator is less bent upon punishing than preventing crimes he is more attentive to inspire good morals than to inflict penalties it is a constant remark of the chinese authors† that the more the penal laws were increased in their empire the nearer they drew towards a revolution this is because punishments were augmented in proportion as the public morals were corrupted it would be an easy matter to prove that in all or almost all the governments of europe penalties have increased or diminished in proportion as those governments favoured or discouraged liberty in despotic governments people are so unhappy as to have a greater dread of death than regret for the loss of life consequently their punishments ought to be more severe in moderate states they are more afraid of losing their lives than apprehensive of the pain of dying those punishments therefore which deprive them simply of life are sufficient  0  men in excess of happiness or misery are equally inclinable to severity witness conquerors and monks it is mediocrity alone and a mixture of prosperous and adverse fortune that inspire us with lenity and pity what we see practised by individuals is equally observable in regard to nations in countries inhabited by savages who lead a very hard life and in despotic governments where there is only one person on whom fortune lavishes her favours while the miserable subjects lie exposed to her insults people are equally cruel lenity reigns in moderate governments when in reading history we observe the cruelty of the sultans in the administration of justice we shudder at the very thought of the miseries of human nature in moderate governments a good legislator may make use of every thing by way of punishment is it not very extraordinary that one of the chief penalties at sparta was to deprive a person of the power of lending out his wife or of receiving the wife of another man and to oblige him to have no company at home but virgins in short whatever the law calls a punishment is such effectively chap x of the ancient french laws in the ancient french laws we find the true spirit of monarchy in cases relating to pecuniary mulcts the common people are less severely punished than the nobility‡ but in criminal∥ cases it is quite the  0  reverse the nobleman loses his honour and his voice in court while the peasant who has no honour to lose undergoes a corporal punishment chap xi that when people are virtuous few punishments are necessary the people of rome had some share of probity such was the force of this probity that the legislator had frequently no farther occasion than to point out the right road and they were sure to follow it one would imagine that instead of precepts it was sufficient to give them counsels the punishments of the regal laws and those of the twelve tables were almost all abolished in the time of the republic in consequence either of the valerian§ or of the porcian law¶ it was never observed that this step did any manner of prejudice to the civil administration this valerian law which restrained the magistrates from using violent methods against a citizen that had appealed to the people inflicted no other punishment on the person who infringed it than that of being reputed a dishonest man chap xii of the power of punishments experience shews that in countries remarkable for the lenity of their laws the spirit of  0  the inhabitants is as much affected by slight penalties as in other countries by severer punishments if an inconveniency or abuse arises in the state a violent government endeavours suddenly to redress it and instead of putting the old laws in execution it establishes some cruel punishment which instantly puts a stop to the evil but the spring of government hereby loses its elasticity the imagination grows accustomed to the severe as well as the milder punishment and as the fear of the latter diminishes they are soon obliged in every case to have recourse to the former robberies on the highway were grown common in some countries in order to remedy this evil they invented the punishment of breaking upon the wheel the terror of which put a stop for a while to this mischievous practice but soon after robberies on the highways became as common as ever desertion in our days was grown to a very great height in consequence of which it was judged proper to punish those delinquents with death and yet their number did not diminish the reason is very natural a soldier accustomed to venture his life despises or affects to despise the danger of losing it he is habituated to the fear of shame it would have been therefore much better to have continued a punishment† which branded him with infamy for life the penalty was pretended to be increased while it really diminished mankind must not be governed with too much severity we ought to make a prudent use of the means which nature has given us to conduct them if we enquire into the cause of all human corruptions we shall find that they proceed from the impunity  0  of criminals and not from the moderation of punishments let us follow nature who has given shame to man for his scourge and let the heaviest part of the punishment be the infamy attending it but if there be some countries where shame is not a consequence of punishment this must be owing to tyranny which has inflicted the same penalties on villains and honest men and if there are others where men are deterred only by cruel punishments we may be sure that this must in a great measure arise from the violence of the government which has used such penalties for slight transgressions it often happens that a legislator desirous of remedying an abuse thinks of nothing else his eyes are open only to this object and shut to its inconveniences when the abuse is redressed you see only the severity of the legislator yet there remains an evil in the state that has sprung from this severity the minds of the people are corrupted and become habituated to despotism lysander‡ having obtained a victory over the athenians the prisoners were ordered to be tried in consequence of an accusation brought against that nation of having thrown all the captives of two galleys down a precipice and of having resolved in full assembly to cut off the hands of those whom they should chance to make prisoners the athenians were therefore all massacred except adymantes who had opposed this decree lysander reproached philocles before he was put to death with having depraved the peoples minds and given lessons of cruelty to all greece   0 the argives says plutarch∥ having put fifteen hundred of their citizens to death the athenians ordered sacrifices of expiation that it might please the gods to turn the hearts of the athenians from so cruel a thought there are two sorts of corruption one when the people do not observe the laws the other when they are corrupted by the laws an incurable evil because it is in the very remedy itself chap xiii insufficiency of the laws of japan excessive punishments may even corrupt a despotic government of this we have an instance in japan here almost all crimes are punished with death§ because disobedience to so great an emperor as that of japan is reckoned an enormous crime the question is not so much to correct the delinquent as to vindicate the authority of the prince these notions are derived from servitude and are owing especially to this that as the emperor is universal proprietor almost all crimes are directly against his interests they punish with death lies spoken before the magistrate¶ a proceeding contrary to natural defence even things which have not the appearance of a crime are severely punished for instance a man that ventures his money at play is put to death true it is that the character of this people so amazingly obstinate capricious and resolute as to     defy all dangers and calamities seems to absolve their legislators from the imputation of cruelty notwithstanding the severity of their laws but are men who have a natural contempt of death and who rip open their bellies for the least fancy are such men i say mended or deterred or rather are they not hardened by the continual prospect of punishments the relations of travellers inform us with respect to the education of the japanese that children must be treated there with mildness because they become hardened to punishment that their slaves must not be too roughly used because they immediately stand upon their defence would not one imagine that they might easily have judged of the spirit which ought to reign in their political and civil government from that which should prevail in their domestic concerns a wise legislator would have endeavoured to reclaim people by a just temperature of punishments and rewards by maxims of philosophy morality and religion adapted to those characters by a proper application of the rules of honour and by the enjoyment of ease and tranquillity of life and should he have entertained any apprehension that their minds being inured to the cruelty of punishments would no longer be restrained by those of a milder nature he would have conducted himself in another manner and gained his point by degrees in particular cases that admitted of any indulgence he would have mitigated the punishment till he should have been able to extend this mitigation to all cases     but these are springs to which despotic power is a stranger it may abuse itself and that is all it can do in japan it has made its utmost effort and has surpassed even itself in cruelty as the minds of the people grew wild and intractable they were obliged to have recourse to the most horrid severity this is the origin this the spirit of the laws of japan they had more fury however than force they succeeded in the extirpation of christianity but such unaccountable efforts are a proof of their insufficiency they wanted to establish a good polity and they have shewn greater marks of their weakness we have only to read the relation of the interview between the emperor and the deyro at meaco† the number of those who were suffocated or murdered in that city by ruffians is incredible young maids and boys were carried off by force and found afterwards exposed in public places at unseasonable hours quite naked and sewed in linen bags to prevent their knowing which way they had passed robberies were committed in all parts the bellies of horses were ripped open to bring their riders to the ground and coaches were overturned in order to strip the ladies the dutch who were told they could not pass the night on the scaffolds without exposing themselves to the danger of being assassinated came down c i shall here give one instance more from the same nation the emperor having abandoned himself to infamous pleasures lived unmarried and was consequently in danger of dying without issue the deyro sent him two beautiful damsels one he married     out of respect but would not meddle with her his nurse caused the finest women of the empire to be sent for but all to no purpose at length an armourers daughter having pleased his fancy‡ he determined to espouse her and had a son the ladies belonging to court enraged to see a person of such mean extraction preferred to themselves stifled the child the crime was concealed from the emperor for he would have deluged the land with blood the excessive severity of the laws hinders therefore their execution when the punishment surpasses all measure they are frequently obliged to prefer impunity to it chap xiv of the spirit of the roman senate under the consulate of acilius glabrio and piso the acilian law∥ was made to prevent the intriguing for places dio says§ that the senate engaged the consuls to propose it by reason that c cornelius the tribune had resolved to cause more severe punishments to be established against this crime to which the people seemed greatly inclined the senate rightly judged that immoderate punishments would strike indeed a terror into peoples minds but must have also this effect that there would be nobody afterwards to accuse or condemn whereas by proposing moderate penalties there would be always judges and accusers     chap xv of the roman laws in respect to punishments i am strongly confirmed in my sentiments upon finding the romans on my side and i think that punishments are connected with the nature of government when i behold this great people changing in this respect their civil laws in proportion as they altered their form of government the regal laws made for fugitives slaves and vagabonds were very severe the spirit of a republic would have required that the decemvirs should not have inserted those laws in their twelve tables but men who aimed at tyranny were far from conforming to a republican spirit livy says¶ in relation to the punishment of metius suffetius dictator of alba who was condemned by tullius hostilius to be fastened to two chariots drawn by horses and to be torn asunder that this was the first and last punishment in which the remembrance of humanity seemed to have been lost he is mistaken the twelve tables are full of very cruel laws the design of the decemvirs appears more conspicuous in the capital punishment pronounced against libellers and poets this is not agreeable to the genius of a republic where the people like to see the great men humbled but persons who aimed at the subversion of liberty were afraid of writings that might revive its spirit†     after the expulsion of the decemvirs almost all the penal laws were abolished it is true they were not expressly repealed but as the porcian law had ordained that no citizen of rome should be put to death they were of no farther use this is exactly the time to which we may refer what livy says¶ of the romans that no people were ever fonder of moderation in punishments but if to the lenity of the penal laws we add the right which the party accused had of withdrawing before judgement was pronounced we shall find that the romans followed the spirit which i have observed to be natural to a republic sylla who confounded tyranny anarchy and liberty made the cornelian laws he seemed to have contrived regulations merely with a view to create new crimes thus distinguishing an infinite number of actions by the name of murder he found murderers in all parts and by a practice but too much followed he laid snares sowed thorns and opened precipices wheresoever the citizens set their feet almost all syllas laws contained only the interdiction of fire and water to this cæsar added the confiscation of goods because the rich by preserving their estates in exile became bolder in the perpetration of crimes the emperors having established a military government soon found that it was as terrible to the prince as to the subject they endeavoured therefore to temper it and with this view had recourse to dignities and to the respect with which those dignities were attended     the government thus drew nearer a little to monarchy and punishments were divided into three classes† those which related to the principal persons in the state‡ which were very mild those which were inflicted on persons of an inferior rank∥ and which were more severe and in fine such as concerned only persons of the lowest condition§ which were the most rigorous maximinus that fierce that stupid prince increased the rigour of the military government which he ought to have softened the senate was informed says capitolinus¶ that some had been crucified others exposed to wild beasts or sewed up in the skins of beasts lately killed without any manner of regard to their dignity it seemed as if he wanted to exercise the military discipline on the model of which he pretended to regulate the civil administration in the considerations on the rise and declension of the roman grandeur we find in what manner constantine changed the military despotism into a military and civil government and drew nearer to monarchy there we may trace the different revolutions of this state and see how they fell from rigour to indolence and from indolence to impunity chap xvi of the just proportion betwixt punishments and crimes it is an essential point that there should be a certain proportion in punishments because it is essential that a great crime should be avoided rather than a smaller and that which is more pernicious to society rather than that which is less     an impostor who called himself constantine ducas raised a great insurrection at constantinople he was taken and condemned to be whipt but upon informing against several persons of distinction he was sentenced to be burnt as a calumniator it is very extraordinary that they should thus proportion the punishments betwixt the crime of hightreason and that of calumny this puts me in mind of a saying of charles ii king of greatbritain he saw a man one day standing in the pillory upon which he asked what crime the man had committed he was answered please your majesty he has written a libel against your ministers the fool said the king why did not he write against me they would have done nothing to him seventy persons having conspired against the emperor basil† he ordered them to be whipt and the hair of their heads and beards to be burnt a stag one day having taken hold of him by the girdle with his horn one of his retinue drew his sword cut the girdle and saved him upon which he ordered that persons head to be cut off for having said he drawn his sword against his sovereign who could imagine that the same prince could ever have passed two such different judgements it is a great abuse amongst us to condemn to the same punishment a person that only robs on the highway and another who robs and murders surely for the public security some difference should be made in the punishment in china those who add murder to robbery are cut in pieces‡ but not so the others to this difference it is owing that though they rob in that country they never murder     in russia where the punishment of robbery and murder is the same they always murder∥ the dead say they tell no tales where there is no difference in the penalty there should be some in the expectation of pardon in england they never murder on the highway because robbers have some hopes of transportation which is not the case in respect to those that commit murder letters of grace are of excellent use in moderate governments this power which the prince has of pardoning exercised with prudence is capable of producing admirable effects the principle of despotic government which neither grants nor receives any pardon deprives it of these advantages chap xvii of the rack the wickedness of mankind makes it necessary for the laws to suppose them better than they really are hence the deposition of two witnesses is sufficient in the punishment of all crimes the law believes them as if they spoke by the mouth of truth thus we judge that every child conceived in wedlock is legitimate the law having a confidence in the mother as if she were chastity itself but the use of the rack against criminals cannot be defended on a like plea of necessity we have before us the example of a nation blessed with an excellent civil government§ where without any inconveniency the practice of racking criminals is rejected it is not therefore in its own nature necessary¶     so many men of learning and genius have written against the custom of torturing criminals that after them i durst not presume to meddle with the subject i was going to say that it might suit despotic states where whatever inspires fear is the properest spring of government i was going to say that the slaves among the greeks and romans — but nature cries out aloud and asserts her rights chap xviii of pecuniary and corporal punishments our ancestors the germans admitted of none but pecuniary punishments those free and warlike people were of opinion that their blood ought not to be spilt but with sword in hand on the contrary these punishments are rejected by the japanese under pretence that the rich might elude them but are not the rich afraid of being stripped of their property and might not pecuniary penalties be proportioned to peoples fortunes and in fine might not infamy be added to those punishments a good legislator takes a just medium he ordains neither always pecuniary nor always corporal punishments chap xix of the law of retaliation the use of the law of retaliation† is very frequent in despotic countries where they are fond of   0 simple laws moderate governments admit of it sometimes but with this difference that the former exercise it in full rigour whereas among the latter it ever receives some kind of limitation the law of the twelve tables admitted two first it never condemned to retaliation but when the plaintiff could not be satisfied in any other manner‡ secondly after condemnation they might pay damages and interest∥ and then the corporal was changed into a pecuniary punishment§ chap xx of the punishment of fathers for the crimes of their children in china fathers are punished for the crimes of their children this was likewise the custom of peru¶ a custom derived from the notion of despotic power little does it signify to say that in china the father is punished for not having exerted that paternal authority which nature has established and the laws themselves have improved this still supposes that there is no honour among the chinese amongst us parents whose children are condemned by the laws of their country and children whose parents have undergone the like fate are as severely punished by shame as they would be in china by the loss of their lives     chap xxi of the clemency of the prince clemency is the characteristic of monarchs in republics whose principle is virtue it is not so necessary in despotic governments where fear predominates it is less customary because the great men are to be restrained by examples of severity it is more necessary in monarchies where they are governed by honour which frequently requires what the very law forbids disgrace is here equivalent to chastisement and even the forms of justice are punishments this is because particular kinds of penalty are formed by shame which on every side invades the delinquent the great men in monarchies are so heavily punished by disgrace by the loss though often imaginary of their fortune credit acquaintances and pleasures that rigour in respect to them is needless it can tend only to divest the subject of the affection he has for the person of his prince and of the respect he ought to have for public posts and employments as the instability of the great is natural to a despotic government so their security is interwoven with the nature of monarchy so many are the advantages which monarchs gain by clemency so greatly does it raise their fame and endear them to their subjects that it is generally happy for them to have an opportunity of displaying it which in this part of the world is seldom wanting some branch perhaps of their authority but never hardly the whole will be disputed and if they sometimes fight for their crown they do not fight for their life     but some may ask when is it proper to punish and when to pardon — this is a point easier felt than prescribed when there is danger in the exercise of clemency it is visible nothing so easy as to distinguish it from that imbecillity which exposes princes to contempt and to the very incapacity of punishing the emperor maurice† made a resolution never to spill the blood of his subjects anastasius‡ punished no crimes at all isaac angelus took an oath that no one should be put to death during his reign those greek emperors had forgot that it was not for nothing they were intrusted with the sword book vii consequences of the different principles of the three governments with respect to sumptuary laws luxury and the condition of women chap i of luxury luxury is ever in proportion to the inequality of fortunes if the riches of a state are equally divided there will be no luxury for it is founded merely on the inconveniences acquired by the labour of others in order to have this equal distribution of riches the law ought to give to each man only what is necessary for nature if they exceed these bounds     some will spend and others will acquire by which means an inequality will be established supposing what is necessary for the support of nature to be equal to a given sum the luxury of those who have only what is barely necessary will be equal to a cypher if a person happens to have double that sum his luxury will be equal to one he that has double the latters substance will have a luxury equal to three if this be still doubled there will be a luxury equal to seven so that the property of the subsequent individual being always supposed double to that of the preceding the luxury will increase double and an unit will be always added in this progression 0                    in platos republic∥ luxury might have been exactly calculated there were four sorts of censuses or rates of estates the first was exactly the term beyond poverty the second was double the third triple the fourth quadruple to the first in the first census luxury was equal to a cypher in the second to one in the third to two in the fourth to three and thus it followed in an arithmetical proportion considering the luxury of different nations with respect to one another it is in each state in a compound proportion to the inequality of fortunes among the subjects and to the inequality of wealth in different states in poland for example there is an extreme inequality of fortunes but the poverty of the whole hinders them from having so much luxury as in a more opulent government luxury is also in proportion to the populousness of the towns and especially of the capital so that     it is in a compound proportion to the riches of the state to the inequality of private fortunes and to the number of people settled in particular places in proportion to the populousness of towns the inhabitants are filled with notions of vanity and actuated by an ambition of distinguishing themselves by trifles§ if they are very numerous and most of them strangers to one another their vanity redoubles because there are greater hopes of success as luxury inspires these hopes each man assumes the marks of a superior condition but by endeavouring thus at distinction every one becomes equal and distinction ceases as all are desirous of respect nobody is regarded hence arises a general inconvenience those who excel in a profession set what value they please on their labour this example is followed by people of inferior abilities and then there is an end of all proportion between our wants and the means of satisfying them when i am forced to go to law i must be able to fee council when i am sick i must have it in my power to fee a physician it is the opinion of several that the assembling so great a multitude of people in capital cities is an obstruction to commerce because the inhabitants are no longer at a proper distance from each other but i cannot think so for men have more desires more wants more fancies when they live together     chap ii of sumptuary laws in a democracy we have observed that in a republic where riches are equally divided there can be no such thing as luxury and as we have shewn in the  th book¶ that this equal distribution constitutes the excellency of a republican government hence it follows that the less luxury there is in a republic the more it is perfect there was none among the old romans none among the lacedæmonians and in republics where this equality is not quite lost the spirit of commerce industry and virtue renders every man able and willing to live on his own property and consequently prevents the growth of luxury the laws concerning the new division of lands insisted upon so eagerly in some republics were of the most salutary nature they are dangerous only as they are subitaneous by reducing instantly the wealth of some and increasing that of others they form a revolution in each family and must produce a general one in the state in proportion as luxury gains ground in a republic the minds of the people are turned towards their particular interests those who are allowed only what is necessary have nothing but their own reputation and their countrys glory in view but a soul depraved by luxury has many other desires and soon becomes an enemy to the laws that confine it the luxury in which the garrison of rhegio began to live was the cause of their massacring the inhabitants no sooner were the romans corrupted than their desires became boundless and immense of this we     may judge by the price they set on things a pitcher of falernian wine was sold for a hundred roman denarii a barrel of salt meat from the kingdom of pontus cost four hundred a good cook four talents and for boys no price was reckoned too great when the whole world impelled by the force of corruption is immersed in voluptuousness† what must then become of virtue chap iii of sumptuary laws in an aristocracy there is this inconvenience in an illconstituted aristocracy that the wealth centers in the nobility and yet they are not allowed to spend for as luxury is contrary to the spirit of moderation it must be banished from thence this government comprehends therefore only people who are extremely poor and cannot acquire and people who are vastly rich and cannot spend in venice they are compelled by the laws to moderation they are so habituated to parsimony that none but courtezans can make them part with their money such is the method made use of for the support of industry the most contemptible of women may be profuse without danger whilst those who contribute to their extravagance consume their days in the greatest obscurity admirable in this respect were the institutions of the principal republics of greece the rich employed their money in festivals musical choruses chariots horseraces and chargeable offices wealth was therefore as burthensome there as poverty     chap iv of sumptuary laws in a monarchy tacitus says‡ that the suiones a german nation have a particular respect for riches for which reason they live under the government of one person this shews that luxury is extremely proper for monarchies and that under this government there must be no sumptuary laws as riches by the very constitution of monarchies are unequally divided there is an absolute necessity for luxury were the rich not to be lavish the poor would starve it is even necessary here that the expences of the opulent should be in proportion to the inequality of fortunes and that luxury as we have already observed should increase in this proportion the augmentation of private wealth is owing to its having deprived one part of the citizens of their necessary support this must therefore be restored to them hence it is that for the preservation of a monarchical state luxury ought continually to increase and to grow more extensive as it rises from the labourer to the artificer to the merchant to the magistrate to the nobility to the great officers of state up to the very prince otherwise the nation will be undone in the reign of augustus a proposal was made in the roman senate which was composed of grave magistrates learned civilians and of men whose heads were filled with the notion of the primitive times to reform the manners and luxury of women it is curious to see in dio∥ with what art this prince eluded the importunate sollicitations of those     senators this was because he was founding a monarchy and dissolving a republic under tiberius the ædiles proposed in the senate the reestablishment of the ancient sumptuary laws§ this prince who did not want sense opposed it the state said he could not possibly subsist in the present situation of things how could rome how could the provinces live we were frugal while we were only masters of one city now we consume the riches of the whole globe and employ both the masters and their slaves in our service he plainly saw that sumptuary laws would not suit the present form of government when a proposal was made under the same emperor to the senate to prohibit the governors from carrying their wives with them into the provinces because of the dissoluteness and irregularity which followed those ladies the proposal was rejected it was said that the examples of ancient austerity had been changed into a more agreeable method of living¶ they found there was a necessity for different manners luxury is therefore absolutely necessary in monarchies as it is also in despotic states in the former it is the use of liberty in the latter it is the abuse of servitude a slave appointed by his master to tyrannize over other wretches of the same condition uncertain of enjoying tomorrow the blessings of today has no other felicity than that of glutting the pride the passions and voluptuousness of the present moment hence arises a very natural reflexion republics end with luxury monarchies with poverty     chap v in what cases sumptuary laws are useful in a monarchy whether it was from a republican spirit or from some other particular circumstance sumptuary laws were made in arragon in the middle of the thirteenth century james the first ordained that neither the king nor any of his subjects should have above two sorts of dishes at a meal and that each dish should be dressed only one way except it were game of their own killing† in our days sumptuary laws have been also enacted in sweden but with a different view from those of arragon a government may make sumptuary laws with a view to absolute frugality this is the spirit of sumptuary laws in republics and the very nature of the thing shews that such was the design of those of arragon sumptuary laws may likewise be established with a design to promote a relative frugality when a government perceiving that foreign merchandizes being at too high a price will require such an exportation of home manufactures as to deprive them of more advantages by the loss of the latter than they can receive from the possession of the former they will forbid their being introduced and this is the spirit of the laws which in our days have been passed in sweden‡ such are the sumptuary laws proper for monarchies   0 in general the poorer a state the more it is ruined by its relative luxury and consequently the more occasion it has for relative sumptuary laws the richer a state the more it thrives by its relative luxury for which reason it must take particular care not to make any relative sumptuary laws this we shall better explain in the book on commerce here we treat only of absolute luxury chap vi of the luxury of china sumptuary laws may in some governments be necessary for particular reasons the people by the influence of the climate may grow so numerous and the means of subsisting may be so uncertain as to render an universal application to agriculture extremely necessary as luxury in those countries is dangerous their sumptuary laws should be very severe in order therefore to be able to judge whether luxury ought to be encouraged or proscribed we should examine first what relation there is between the number of people and the facility they have of procuring subsistence in england the soil produces more grain than is necessary for the maintenance of such as cultivate the land and of those who are employed in the woollen manufactures this country may be therefore allowed to have some trifling arts and consequently luxury in france likewise there is corn enough for the support of the husbandman and of the manufacturer besides a foreign trade may bring in so many necessaries in return for toys that there is no danger to be apprehended from luxury     on the contrary in china the women are so prolific and the human species multiplies so fast that the lands though never so much cultivated are scarcely sufficient to support the inhabitants here therefore luxury is pernicious and the spirit of industry and œconomy is as requisite as in any republic they are obliged to pursue the necessary arts and to shun those of luxury and pleasure this is the spirit of the excellent decrees of the chinese emperors our ancestors says an emperor of the family of the tangs† held it as a maxim that if there was a man who did not work or a woman that was idle somebody must suffer cold or hunger in the empire and on this principle he ordered a vast number of the monasteries of bonzes to be destroyed the third emperor of the oneandtwentieth dynasty‡ to whom some precious stones were brought that had been found in a mine ordered it to be shut up not choosing to fatigue his people with working for a thing that could neither feed nor clothe them so great is our luxury says kiayventi∥ that people adorn with embroidery the shoes of boys and girls whom they are obliged to sell is employing so many people in making cloaths for one person the way to prevent a great many from wanting cloaths there are ten men who eat the fruits of the earth to one employed in agriculture and is this the means to preserve numbers from wanting nourishment     chap vii fatal consequences of luxury in china in the history of china we find it has had twentytwo successive dynasties that is it has experienced twentytwo general without mentioning a prodigious number of particular revolutions the three first dynasties lasted a long time because they were wisely administered and the empire had not so great an extent as it afterwards obtained but we may observe in general that all those dynasties began very well virtue attention and vigilance are necessary in china these prevailed in the commencement of the dynasties and failed in the end it was natural that emperors trained up in military toil who had compassed the dethroning of a family immersed in pleasure should adhere to virtue which they had found so advantageous and be afraid of voluptuousness which they knew had proved so fatal to the family dethroned but after the three or four first princes corruption luxury indolence and pleasure possessed their successors they shut themselves up in a palace their understanding was impaired their life was shortened the family declined the grandees rose up the eunuchs gained credit none but children were set on the throne the palace was at variance with the empire a lazy set of people that dwelled there ruined the industrious part of the nation the emperor was killed or destroyed by an usurper who founded a family the third or fourth successor of which went and shut himself up in the very same palace     chap viii of public continency so many are the imperfections that attend the loss of virtue in women and so greatly are their minds depraved when this principal guard is removed that in a popular state public incontinency may be considered as the last of miseries and as a certain forerunner of a change in the constitution hence it is that the sage legislators of republican states have ever required of women a particular gravity of manners they have proscribed not only vice but the very appearance of it they have banished even all commerce of gallantry a commerce that produces idleness that renders the women corrupters even before they are corrupted that gives a value to trifles and debases things of importance a commerce in fine that makes people act entirely by the maxims of ridicule in which the women are so perfectly skilled chap ix of the condition or state of women in different governments in monarchies women are subject to very little restraint because as the distinction of ranks calls them to court there they assume a spirit of liberty which is almost the only one tolerated in that place each courtier avails himself of their charms and passions in order to advance his fortune and as their weakness admits not of pride but of vanity luxury constantly attends them in despotic governments women do not introduce but are themselves an object of luxury they must be in a state of the most rigorous servitude every     one follows the spirit of the government and adopts in his own family the customs he sees elsewhere established as the laws are very severe and executed on the spot they are afraid lest the liberty of women should expose them to danger their quarrels indiscretions repugnances jealousies piques and that art in fine which little souls have of interesting great ones would be attended there with fatal consequences besides as princes in those countries make a sport of human nature they allow themselves a multitude of women and a thousand considerations oblige them to keep those women in close confinement in republics women are free by the laws and restrained by manners luxury is banished from thence and with it corruption and vice in the cities of greece where they were not under the restraint of a religion which declares that even amongst men regularity of manners is a part of virtue where a blind passion triumphed with a boundless insolence and love appeared only in a shape which we dare not mention while marriage was considered as nothing more than simple friendship such was the virtue simplicity and chastity of women in those cities that in this respect hardly any people were ever known to have had a better and wiser polity† chap x of the domestic tribunal among the romans the romans had no particular magistrates like the greeks to inspect the conduct of women the     censors had not an eye over them but as over the rest of the republic the institution of the domestic tribunal§ supplied the magistracy established among the greeks∥ the husband summoned the wifes relations and tried her in their presence‡ this tribunal preserved the manners of the republic and at the same time those very manners maintained this tribunal for it decided not only in respect to the violation of the laws but also of manners now in order to judge of the violation of the latter manners are requisite the penalties inflicted by this tribunal ought to be and actually were arbitrary for all that relates to manners and to the rules of modesty can hardly be comprised under one code of laws it is easy indeed to regulate by laws what we owe to others but it is very difficult to comprise all we owe to ourselves the domestic tribunal inspected the general conduct of women but there was one crime which beside the animadversion of this tribunal was likewise subject to a public accusation this was adultery whether that in a republic so great a depravation of manners interested the government or whether the wifes immorality might render the husbands suspected or whether in fine they were afraid lest     even honest people might choose that this crime should rather be concealed than punished chap xi in what manner the institutions changed at rome together with the government as manners were supposed by the domestic tribunal they were also supposed by the public accusation and hence it is that these two things fell together with the public manners and ended with the republic the establishing of perpetual questions that is the division of jurisdiction among the prætors and the custom gradually introduced of the prætors determining all causes themselves† weakened the use of the domestic tribunal this appears by the surprize of historians who look upon the decisions which tiberius caused to be given by this tribunal as singular facts and as a renewal of the ancient course of pleading the establishment of monarchy and the change of manners put likewise an end to public accusations it might be apprehended lest a dishonest man affronted at the slight shewn him by a woman vexed at her refusal and irritated even by her virtue should form a design to destroy her the julian law ordained that a woman should not be accused of adultery till after her husband had been charged with favouring her irregularities which limited greatly and annihilated as it were this sort of accusation‡     sixtus quintus seemed to have been desirous of reviving the public accusation∥ but there needs very little reflection to see that this law would be more improper in such a monarchy as his than in any other chap xii of the guardianship of women among the romans the roman laws subjected women to a perpetual guardianship except they were under cover and subject to the authority of a husband this guardianship was given to the nearest of the male relations and by a vulgar expression† it appears they were very much confined this was proper for a republic but not at all necessary in a monarchy‡ that the women among the ancient germans were likewise under a perpetual tutelage appears from the different codes of the laws of the barbarians§ this custom was communicated to the monarchies founded by those people but was not of a long duration chap xiii of the punishments decreed by emperors against the incontinency of women the julian law ordained a punishment against adultery but so far was this law any more than those afterwards made on the same account from being a mark of regularity of manners that on the contrary it was a proof of their depravation     the whole political system in regard to women received a change in the monarchical state the question was no longer to oblige them to a regularity of manners but to punish their crimes that new laws were made to punish their crimes was owing to their leaving those transgressions unpunished which were not of so criminal a nature the frightful dissolution of manners obliged indeed the emperors to enact laws in order to put some stop to lewdness but it was not their intention to establish a general reformation of this the positive facts related by historians are a much stronger proof than all these laws can be of the contrary we may see in dio the conduct of augustus on this occasion and in what manner he eluded both in his prætorian and censorian office the repeated instances that were made him §for that purpose it is true that we find in historians very rigid sentences passed in the reigns of augustus and tiberius against the lewdness of some roman ladies but by shewing us the spirit of those reigns at the same time they demonstrate the spirit of those decisions the principal design of augustus and tiberius was to punish the dissoluteness of their relations it was not their immorality they punished but a     particular crime of impiety or hightreason of their own invention which served to promote a respect for majesty and answered their private revenge hence it is that the roman historians inveigh so bitterly against this tyranny the penalty of the julian law was small† the emperors insisted that in passing sentence the judges should increase the penalty of the law this was the subject of the invectives of historians they did not examine whether the women were deserving of punishment but whether they had violated the law in order to punish them one of the most tyrannical proceedings of tiberius‡ was the abuse he made of the ancient laws when he wanted to extend the punishment of a roman lady beyond that inflicted by the julian law he revived the domestic tribunal∥ these regulations in respect to women concerned only senatorial families but not the common people pretences were wanted to accuse the great which were constantly furnished by the dissolute behaviour of the ladies in fine what i have above observed namely that regularity of manners is not the principle of monarchy was never better verified than under those first emperors and whoever doubts of it needs only read tacitus suetonius juvenal or martial   0 chap xiv sumptuary laws among the romans we have spoken of public incontinence because it is the inseparable companion of luxury if we leave the motions of the heart at liberty how shall we be able to restrain the weaknesses of the mind at rome besides the general institutions the censors prevailed on the magistrates to enact several particular laws for maintaining the frugality of women this was the design of the fannian licinian and oppian laws we may see in livy§ the great ferment the senate was in when the women insisted upon the revocation of the oppian law the abrogation of this law is fixed upon by valerius maximus as the period from whence we may date the luxury of the romans chap xv of dowries and nuptial advantages in different constitutions dowries ought to be considerable in monarchies in order to enable husbands to support their rank and the established luxury in republics where luxury should never reign they ought to be moderate but there should be hardly any at all in despotic governments where women are in some measure slaves the community of goods introduced by the french laws between man and wife is extremely well adapted to a monarchical government because     the women are thereby interested in domestic affairs and compelled as it were to take care of their family it is less so in a republic where women are possessed of more virtue but it would be quite absurd in despotic governments where the women themselves generally constitute a part of the masters property as women are in a state that furnishes sufficient inducements to marriage the advantages which the law gives them over the husbands property are of no service to society but in a republic they would be extremely prejudicial because riches are productive of luxury in despotic governments the profits accruing from marriage ought to be mere subsistence and no more chap xvi an excellent custom of the samnites the samnites had a custom which in so small a republic and especially in their situation must have been productive of admirable effects the young people were all convened in one place and their conduct was examined he that was declared the best of the whole assembly had leave given him to take which girl he pleased for his wife the second best chose after him and so on† admirable institution the only recommendation that young men could have on this occasion was their virtue and the services done their country he who had the greatest share of these endowments chose which girl he liked out of the whole nation love beauty chastity virtue birth and even wealth itself were all in some measure the dowry     of virtue a nobler and grander recompence less chargeable to a petty state and more capable of influencing both sexes could scarce be imagined the samnites were descended from the lacedæmonians and plato whose institutes are only an improvement of those of lycurgus enacted nearly the same law chap xvii of femaleadministration it is contrary to reason and nature that women should reign in families as was customary among the ægyptians but not that they should govern an empire in the former case the state of their natural weakness does not permit them to have the preeminence in the latter their very weakness generally gives them more lenity and moderation qualifications fitter for a good administration than roughness and severity in the indies they are very easy under a female government and it is settled that if the male issue be not of a mother of the same blood the females born of a mother of the bloodroyal must succeed† and then they have a certain number of persons who assist them to bear the weight of the government according to mr smith‡ they are very easy in africa under a female administration if to this we add the example of england and russia we shall find that they succeed alike both in moderate and despotic governments     book viii of the corruption of the principles of the three governments chap i general idea of this book the corruption of each government generally begins with that of the principles chap ii of the corruption of the principles of democracy the principle of democracy is corrupted not only when the spirit of equality is extinct but likewise when they fall into a spirit of extreme equality and when each citizen would fain be upon a level with those whom he has chosen to command him then the people incapable of bearing the very power they have delegated want to manage every thing themselves to debate for the senate to execute for the magistrate and to decide for the judges when this is the case virtue can no longer subsist in the republic the people are desirous of exercising the functions of the magistrates who cease to be revered the deliberations of the senate are slighted all respect is then laid aside for the senators and consequently for old age if there is no more respect for old age there will be none presently for parents deference to husbands will be likewise thrown off and submission to masters this licentiousness will soon become general and the trouble of command be as fatiguing as that of obedience wives children slaves will shake off all     subjection no longer will there be any such things as manners order or virtue we find in xenophons banquet a very lively description of a republic in which the people abused their equality each guest gives in his turn the reason why he is satisfied content i am says chamides because of my poverty when i was rich i was obliged to pay my court to informers knowing i was more liable to be hurt by them than capable of doing them harm the republic constantly demanded some new tax of me and i could not decline paying since i am grown poor i have acquired authority nobody threatens me i rather threaten others i can go or stay where i please the rich already rise from their seats and give me the way i am a king i was before a slave i paid taxes to the republic now it maintains me i am no longer afraid of losing but i hope to acquire the people fall into this misfortune when those in whom they confide desirous of concealing their own corruption endeavour to corrupt them to disguise their own ambition they speak to them only of the grandeur of the state to conceal their own avarice they incessantly slatter theirs the corruption will increase among the corrupters and likewise among those who are already corrupted the people will divide the public money among themselves and having added the administration of affairs to their indolence will be for blending their poverty with the amusements of luxury but with their indolence and luxury nothing but the public treasure will be able to satisfy their demands we must not be surprized to see their suffrages given for money it is impossible to make great largesses to the people without great extortion and     to compass this the state must be subverted the greater the advantages they seem to derive from their liberty the nearer they approach towards the critical moment of losing it petty tyrants arise who have all the vices of a single tyrant the small remains of liberty soon become insupportable a single tyrant starts up and the people are stripped of every thing even of the profits of their corruption democracy hath therefore two excesses to avoid the spirit of inequality which leads to aristocracy or monarchy and the spirit of extreme equality which leads to despotic power as the latter is completed by conquest true it is that those who corrupted the greek republics did not always become tyrants this was because they had a greater passion for eloquence than for the military art besides there reigned an implacable hatred in the breasts of the greeks against those who subverted a republican government and for this reason anarchy degenerated into annihilation instead of being changed into tyranny but syracuse being situated in the midst of a great number of petty states whose government had been changed from oligarchy to tyranny¶ and being governed by a senate scarcely ever mentioned in history underwent such miseries as are the consequence of a more than ordinary corruption this city ever a prey to licentiousness† or oppression equally labouring under the sudden and alternate succession of liberty and servitude and notwithstanding     her external strength constantly determined to a revolution by the least foreign power this city i say had in her bosom an immense multitude of people whose fate it was to have always this cruel alternative either of choosing a tyrant to govern them or of acting the tyrant themselves chap iii of the spirit of extreme equality as distant as heaven is from earth so is the true spirit of equality from that of extreme equality the former does not imply that every body should command or that no one should be commanded but that we obey or command our equals it endeavours not to shake off the authority of a master but that its masters should be none but its equals in the state of nature indeed all men are born equal but they cannot continue in this equality society makes them lose it and they recover it only by the protection of the laws such is the difference between a well regulated democracy and one that is not so that in the former men are equal only as citizens but in the latter they are equal also as magistrates as senators as judges as fathers as husbands or as masters the natural place of virtue is near to liberty but it is not nearer to excessive liberty than to servitude chap iv particular cause of the corruption of the people great success especially when chiefly owing to the people intoxicates them to such a degree that it is impossible to contain them within bounds jealous of their magistrates they soon become jealous     likewise of the magistracy enemies to those who govern they soon prove enemies also to the constitution thus it was that the victory over the persians in the straits of salamis corrupted the republic of athens‡ and thus the defeat of the athenians ruined the republic of syracuse∥ marseilles never experienced those great transitions from lowness to grandeur this was owing to the prudent conduct of that republic who always preserved her principles chap v of the corruption of the principle of aristocracy aristocracy is corrupted if the power of the nobles becomes arbitrary when this is the case there can no longer be any virtue either in the governors or the governed if the reigning families observe the laws it is a monarchy with several monarchs and in its own nature one of the most excellent for almost all these monarchs are tied down by the laws but when they do not observe them it is a despotic state swayed by a great many despotic princes in the latter case the republic consists only in the nobles the body governing is the republic and the body governed is the despotic state which form two of the most heterogeneous bodies in the world the extremity of corruption is when the power of the nobles becomes hereditary§ for then they can hardly have any moderation if they are only a few their power is greater but their security less if they are a larger number their power is less and their security greater insomuch that power goes on increasing     and security diminishing up to the very despotic prince who is encircled with excess of power and danger the great number therefore of nobles in an hereditary aristocracy renders the government less violent but as there is less virtue they fall into a spirit of supineness and negligence by which the state loses all its strength and activity¶ an aristocracy may maintain the full vigour of its constitution if the laws be such as are apt to render the nobles more sensible of the perils and fatigues than of the pleasure of command and if the government be in such a situation as to have something to dread while security shelters under its protection and uncertainty threatens from abroad as a certain kind of confidence forms the glory and stability of monarchies republics on the contrary must have something to apprehend a fear of the persians supported the laws of greece carthage and rome were alarmed and strengthened by each other strange that the greater security those states enjoyed the more like stagnated waters they were subject to corruption chap vi of the corruption of the principle of monarchy as democracies are subverted when the people despoil the senate the magistrates and judges of their functions so monarchies are corrupted when the prince insensibly deprives societies or cities of     their privileges in the former case the multitude usurps the power in the latter it is usurped by a single person the destruction of the dynasties of tsin and soüi says a chinese author was owing to this the princes instead of confining themselves like their ancestors to a general inspection the only one worthy of a sovereign wanted to govern every thing immediately by themselves† the chinese author gives us in this instance the cause of the corruption of almost all monarchies monarchy is destroyed when a prince thinks he shews a greater exertion of power in changing than in conforming to the order of things when he deprives some of his subjects of their hereditary employments to bestow them arbitrarily upon others and when he is fonder of being guided by fancy than judgement again it is destroyed when the prince directing every thing entirely to himself calls the state to his capital the capital to his court and the court to his own person it is destroyed in fine when the prince mistakes his authority his situation and the love of his people and when he is not fully persuaded that a monarch ought to think himself secure as a despotic prince ought to think himself in danger chap vii the same subject continued the principle of monarchy is corrupted when the first dignities are marks of the first servitude when the great men are deprived of public respect and rendered the low tools of arbitrary power   0 it is still more corrupted when honour is set up in contradiction to honours and when men are capable of being loaded at the very same time with infamy‡ and with dignities it is corrupted when the prince changes his justice into severity when he puts like the roman emperors a medusas head on his breast∥ and when he assumes that menacing and terrible air which commodus ordered to be given to his statues§ again it is corrupted when mean and abject souls grow vain of the pomp attending their servitude and imagine that the motive which induces them to be entirely devoted to their prince exempts them from all duty to their country but if it be true and indeed the experience of all ages has shewn it that in proportion as the power of the monarch becomes boundless and immense his security diminishes is the corrupting of this power and the altering of its very nature a less crime than that of hightreason against the prince chap viii danger of the corruption of the principle of monarchical government the danger is not when the state passes from one moderate to another moderate government as from     a republic to a monarchy or from a monarchy to a republic but when it precipitates from a moderate to a despotic government most of the european nations are still governed by the principles of morality but if from a long abuse of power or the fury of conquest despotic sway should prevail to a certain degree neither morals nor climate would be able to withstand its baleful influence and then human nature would be exposed for some time at least even in this beautiful part of the world to the insults with which she has been abused in the other three chap ix how ready the nobility are to defend the throne the english nobility buried themselves with charles the first under the ruins of the throne and before that time when philip the second endeavoured to tempt the french with the allurement of liberty the crown was constantly supported by a nobility who think it an honour to obey a king but consider it as the lowest disgrace to share the power with the people the house of austria has ever used her endeavours to oppress the hungarian nobility little thinking how serviceable that very nobility would be one day to her she would fain have drained their country of money of which they had no plenty but took no notice of the men with whom it abounded when princes combined to dismember her dominions the several parts of that monarchy fell motionless as it were one upon another no life was then to be seen but in those very nobles who resenting the affronts offered to the sovereign and forgetting the injuries done to themselves took up arms to avenge     her cause and considered it as the highest glory bravely to die and to forgive chap x of the corruption of the principle of despotic government the principle of despotic government is subject to a continual corruption because it is even in its nature corrupt other governments are destroyed by particular accidents which do violence to the principles of each constitution this is ruined by its own intrinsic imperfections when some accidental causes do not prevent the corrupting of its principles it maintains itself therefore only when circumstances drawn from the climate religion situation or genius of the people oblige it to conform to order and to admit of some rule by these things its nature is forced without being changed its ferocity remains and it is made tame and tractable only for a time chap xi natural effects of the goodness and corruption of the principles of government when once the principles of government are corrupted the very best laws become bad and turn against the state but when the principles are sound even bad laws have the same effect as good the force of the principle draws every thing to it the inhabitants of crete used a very singular method to keep the principal magistrates dependent on the laws which was that of insurrection part of the citizens rose up in arms¶ put the magistrates     to flight and obliged them to return to a private life this was supposed to be done in consequence of the law one would have imagined that an institution of this nature which established sedition to hinder the abuse of power would have subverted any republic whatsoever and yet it did not subvert that of crete the reason is this when the ancients would express a people that had the strongest affection for their country they were sure to mention the inhabitants of crete our country said plato† a name so dear to the cretans they called it by a name which signifies the love of a mother for her children‡ now the love of our country sets every thing to right the laws of poland have likewise their insurrection but the inconveniences thence arising plainly shew that the people of crete alone were capable of using such a remedy with success the gymnic exercises established among the greeks had the same dependence on the goodness of the principle of government it was the lacedæmonians and cretans said plato∥ that opened those celebrated academies which gave them so eminent a rank in the world modesty at first was alarmed but it yielded to the public utility in platos time these institutions were admirable§ as they had a relation to a very important     object which was the military art but when virtue fled from greece the military art was destroyed by these institutions people appeared then on the arena not for improvement but for debauch¶ plutarch informs us that the romans in his time were of opinion that those games had been the principal cause of the slavery into which the greeks were fallen on the contrary it was the slavery of the greeks that corrupted those exercises in plutarchs time† their fighting naked in the parks and their wrestling infected the young people with a spirit of cowardice inclined them to infamous passions and made them mere dancers but under epaminondas the exercise of wrestling made the thebans win the famous battle of leuctra‡ there are very few laws which are not good while the state retains its principles here i may apply what epicurus said of riches it is not the liquor but the vessel that is corrupted chap xii the same subject continued in rome the judges were chosen at first from the order of senators this privilege the gracchi transferred to the knights drusus gave it to the senators and knights sylla to the senators only cotta to the senators knights and public treasurers cæsar excluded the latter antony made decuries of senators knights and centurions     when once a republic is corrupted there is no possibility of remedying any of the growing evils but by removing the corruption and restoring its lost principles every other correction is either useless or a new evil while rome preserved her principles entire the judicial power might without any abuse be lodged in the hands of senators but as soon as this city became corrupt to whatever body that power was transferred whether to the senate to the knights to the treasurers to two of those bodies to all three together or to any other matters still went wrong the knights had no more virtue than the senate the treasurers no more than the knights and these as little as the centurions after the people of rome had obtained the privilege of sharing the magistracy with the patricians it was natural to think that their flatterers would immediately become arbiters of the government but no such thing ever happened it was observable that the very people who had rendered the plebeians capable of public offices ever fixed their choice upon the patricians because they were virtuous they were magnanimous and because they were free they had a contempt of power but when their morals were corrupted the more power they were possessed of the less prudent was their conduct till at length upon becoming their own tyrants and slaves they lost the strength of liberty to fall into the weakness and impotency of licentiousness chap xiii the effect of an oath among virtuous people there is no nation says livy∥ that has been longer uncorrupted than the romans no nation     where moderation and poverty have been longer respected such was the influence of an oath among those people that nothing bound them stronger to the laws they often did more for the observance of an oath than they would ever have performed for the thirst of glory or for the love of their country when quintus cincinnatus the consul wanted to raise an army in the city against the æqui and the volsci the tribunes opposed him well said he let all those who have taken an oath to the consul of the preceding year march under my banner§ in vain did the tribunes cry out that this oath was no longer binding and that when they took it quintus was but a private person the people were more religious than those who pretended to direct them they would not listen to the distinctions or equivocations of the tribunes when the same people thought of retiring to the sacred mount they felt some remorse from the oath they had taken to the consuls that they would follow them into the field¶ they entered then into a design of killing the consuls but dropped it when they were given to understand that their oath would still be binding now it is easy to judge of the notion they entertained of the violation of an oath from the crime they intended to commit after the battle of cannæ the people were seized with such a panic that they would fain have retired to sicily but scipio having prevailed upon them to swear they would not stir from rome the fear of violating this oath surpassed all other apprehensions rome was a ship held by two anchors religion and morality in the midst of a furious tempest     chap xiv how the smallest change of the constitution is attended with the ruin of its principles aristotle mentions the city of carthage as a well regulated republic polybius tells us that there was this inconvenience at carthage in the second punic war that the senate had lost almost all their authority we are informed by livy that when hannibal returned to carthage he found that the magistrates and the principal citizens had abused their power and converted the public revenues to their private emolument the virtue therefore of the magistrates and the authority of the senate both fell at the same time and all was owing to the same cause every one knows the wonderful effects of the censorship among the romans there was a time when it grew burthensome but still it was supported because there was more luxury than corruption claudius† weakened its authority by which means the corruption became greater than the luxury and the censorship dwindled away of itself‡ after various interruptions and resumptions it was entirely laid aside till it became altogether useless that is till the reigns of augustus and claudius chap xv sure methods of preserving the three principles i shall not be able to make myself rightly understood till the reader has perused the four following chapters     chap xvi distinctive properties of a republic it is natural for a republic to have only a small territory otherwise it cannot long subsist in an extensive republic there are men of large fortunes and consequently of less moderation there are trusts too considerable to be placed in any single subject he has interests of his own he soon begins to think that he may be happy and glorious by oppressing his fellowcitizens and that he may raise himself to grandeur on the ruins of his country in an extensive republic the public good is sacrificed to a thousand private views it is subordinate to exceptions and depends on accidents in a small one the interest of the public is more obvious better understood and more within the reach of every citizen abuses have less extent and of course are less protected the long duration of the republic of sparta was owing to her having continued in the same extent of territory after all her wars the sole aim of sparta was liberty and the sole advantage of her liberty glory it was the spirit of the greek republics to be as contented with their territories as with their laws athens was first fired with ambition and gave it to lacedæmon but it was an ambition rather of commanding a free people than of governing slaves rather of directing than of breaking the union all was lost upon the starting up of monarchy a government whose spirit is more turned to increase of dominion     excepting particular circumstances it is difficult for any other than a republican government to subsist longer in a single town a prince of so petty a state would naturally endeavour to oppress his subjects because his power would be great while the means of enjoying it or of causing it to be respected would be inconsiderable the consequence is he would trample upon his people on the other hand such a prince might be easily crushed by a foreign or even a domestic force the people might every instant unite and rise up against him now as soon as the sovereign of a single town is expelled the quarrel is over but if he has many towns it only begins chap xvii distinctive properties of a monarchy a monarchical state ought to be of a moderate extent were it small it would form itself into a republic were it very large the nobility possessed of great estates far from the eye of the prince with a private court of their own and secure moreover from sudden executions by the laws and manners of the country such a nobility i say might throw off their allegiance having nothing to fear from too slow and too distant a punishment thus charlemagne had scarce founded his empire when he was obliged to divide it whether the governors of the provinces refused to obey or whether in order to keep them more under subjection there was a necessity of parcelling the empire into several kingdoms after the decease of alexander his empire was divided how was it possible for those greek and   0 macedonian chiefs who were each of them free and independent or commanders at least of the victorious bands dispersed throughout that vast extent of conquered land how was it possible i say for them to obey attilas empire was dissolved soon after his death such a number of kings who were no longer under restraint could not resume their fetters the sudden establishment of unlimited power is a remedy which in those cases may prevent a dissolution but how dreadful the remedy which after the enlargement of dominion opens a new scene of misery the rivers hasten to mingle their waters with the sea and monarchies lose themselves in despotic power chap xviii particular case of the spanish monarchy let not the example of spain be produced against me it rather proves what i affirm to preserve america she did what even despotic power itself does not attempt she destroyed the inhabitants to preserve her colony she was obliged to keep it dependent even for its subsistence in the netherlands she essayed to render herself arbitrary and as soon as she abandoned the attempt her perplexity increased on the one hand the walloons would not be governed by spaniards and on the other the spanish soldiers refused to submit to walloon officers† in italy she maintained her ground merely by exhausting herself and by enriching that country for those who would have been pleased to have got rid     of the king of spain were not in a humour to refuse his gold chap xix distinctive properties of a despotic government a large empire supposes a despotic authority in the person who governs it is necessary that the quickness of the princes resolutions should supply the distance of the places they are sent to that fear should prevent the remissness of the distant governor or magistrate that the law should be derived from a single person and should shift continually according to the accidents which incessantly multiply in a state in proportion to its extent chap xx consequence of the preceding chapters if it be therefore the natural property of small states to be governed as a republic of middling ones to be subject to a monarch and of large empires to be swayed by a despotic prince the consequence is that in order to preserve the principles of the established government the state must be supported in the extent it has acquired and that the spirit of this state will alter in proportion as it contracts or extends its limits chap xxi of the empire of china before i conclude this book i shall answer an objection that may be made to the foregoing doctrine our missionaries inform us that the government of the vast empire of china is admirable and that it has a proper mixture of fear honour and virtue     consequently i must have given an idle distinction in establishing the principles of the three governments but i cannot conceive what this honour can be among a people who act only through fear of being bastinaded‡ again our merchants are far from giving us any such accounts of the virtue so much talked of by the missionaries we need only consult them in relation to the robberies and extortions of the mandarines∥ i likewise appeal to another unexceptionable witness the great lord anson besides father perennins letters concerning the emperors proceedings against some of the princes of the blood§ who had incurred his displeasure by their conversion plainly shew us a settled plan of tyranny and barbarities committed by rule that is in cold blood we have likewise monsieur de mairans and the same father perennins letters on the government of china i find therefore that after a few proper questions and answers the whole mystery is unfolded might not our missionaries have been deceived by an appearance of order might not they have been struck with that constant exercise of a single persons will an exercise by which they themselves are governed and which they are so pleased to find in the courts of the indian princes because as they go thither only in order to introduce great changes it is much easier to persuade those princes that there are no bounds to their power than to convince the people that there are none to their submission¶     in fine there is frequently some kind of truth even in errors themselves it may be owing to particular and perhaps very extraordinary circumstances that the chinese government is not so corrupt as one might naturally expect the climate and some other physical causes may in that country have had so strong an influence on their morals as in some measure to produce wonders the climate of china is surprizingly favourable to the propagation of the human species the women are the most prolific in the whole world the most barbarous tyranny can put no stop to the progress of propagation the prince cannot say there like pharaoh let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply he would rather be reduced to neros wish that mankind had all but one head in spite of tyranny china by the force of its climate will be ever populous and triumph over the tyrannical oppressor china like all other countries that live chiefly upon rice is subject to frequent famines when the people are ready to starve they disperse in order to seek for nourishment in consequence of which gangs of robbers are formed on every side most of them are extirpated in their very infancy others swell and are likewise suppressed and yet in so great a number of such distant provinces some band or other may happen to meet with success in that case they maintain their ground strengthen their party form themselves into a military body march up to the capital and place their leader on the throne from the very nature of things a bad administration is here immediately punished the want of subsistence in so populous a country produces sudden disorders the reason why the redress of abuses     in other countries is attended with such difficulty is because their effects are not immediately felt the prince is not informed in so sudden and sensible a manner as in china the emperor of china is not taught like our princes that if he governs ill he will be less happy in the other life less powerful and less opulent in this he knows that if his government be not just he will be stript both of empire and life as china grows every day more populous notwithstanding the exposing of children the inhabitants are incessantly employed in tilling the lands for their subsistence this requires a very extraordinary attention in the government it is their perpetual concern that every man should have it in his power to work without the apprehension of being deprived of the fruits of his labour consequently this is not so much a civil as a domestic government such has been the origin of those regulations which have been so greatly extolled they wanted to make the laws reign in conjunction with despotic power but whatever is joined to the latter loses all its force in vain did this arbitrary sway labouring under its own inconveniences desire to be fettered it armed itself with its chains and is become still more terrible china is therefore a despotic state whose principle is fear perhaps in the earliest dynasties when the empire had not so large an extent the government might have deviated a little from this spirit but the case is otherwise at present     book ix of laws in the relation they bear to a defensive force chap i in what manner republics provide for their safety if a republic be small it is destroyed by a foreign force if it be large it is ruined by an internal imperfection to this twofold inconveniency democracies and aristocracies are equally liable whether they be good or bad the evil is in the very thing itself and no form can redress it it is therefore very probable that mankind would have been at length obliged to live constantly under the government of a single person had they not contrived a kind of constitution that has all the internal advantages of a republican together with the external force of a monarchical government i mean a confederate republic this form of government is a convention by which several petty states agree to become members of a larger one which they intend to establish it is a kind of assemblage of societies that constitute a new one capable of increasing by means of farther associations till they arrive to such a degree of power as to be able to provide for the security of the whole body it was these associations that so long contributed to the prosperity of greece by these the romans attacked the whole globe and by these alone the whole globe withstood them for when rome was arrived to her highest pitch of grandeur it was the associations beyond the danube and the rhine associations     formed by the terror of her arms that enabled the barbarians to resist her from hence it proceeds that holland† germany and the swiss cantons are considered in europe as perpetual republics the associations of cities were formerly more necessary than in our times a weak defenceless town was exposed to greater danger by conquest it was deprived not only of the executive and legislative power as at present but moreover of all human property‡ a republic of this kind able to withstand an external force may support itself without any internal corruption the form of this society prevents all manner of inconveniences if a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme power he could not be supposed to have an equal authority and credit in all the confederate states were he to have too great an influence over one this would alarm the rest were he to subdue a part that which would still remain free might oppose him with forces independent of those which he had usurped and overpower him before he could be settled in his usurpation should a popular insurrection happen in one of the confederate states the others are able to quell it should abuses creep into one part they are reformed by those that remain sound the state may be destroyed on one side and not on the other the confederacy may be dissolved and the confederates preserve their sovereignty as this government is composed of petty republics it enjoys the internal happiness of each and     with regard to its external situation by means of the association it possesseth all the advantages of large monarchies chap ii that a confederate government ought to be composed of states of the same nature especially of the republican kind the canaanites were destroyed by reason they were petty monarchies that had no union nor confederacy for their common defence and indeed a confederacy is not agreeable to the nature of petty monarchies as the confederate republic of germany consists of free cities and of petty states subject to different princes experience shews us that it is much more imperfect than that of holland and swisserland the spirit of monarchy is war and enlargement of dominion peace and moderation is the spirit of a republic these two kinds of government cannot naturally subsist in a confederate republic thus we observe in the roman history that when the veientes had chosen a king they were immediately abandoned by all the other petty republics of tuscany greece was undone as soon as the kings of macedon obtained a seat among the amphictyons the confederate republic of germany composed of princes and free towns subsists by means of a chief who is in some respects the magistrate of the union in others the monarch     chap iii other requisites in a confederate republic in the republic of holland one province cannot conclude an alliance without the consent of the others this law which is an excellent one and even necessary in a confederate republic is wanting in the germanic constitution where it would prevent the misfortunes that may happen to the whole confederacy through the imprudence ambition or avarice of a single member a republic united by a political confederacy has given itself entirely up and has nothing more to resign it is difficult for the united states to be all of equal power and extent the lycian republic was an association of twentythree towns the large ones had three votes in the common council the middling ones two and the small towns one the dutch republic consists of seven princes of different extent of territory which have each one voice the cities of lycia† contributed to the expences of the state according to the proportion of suffrages the provinces of the united netherlands cannot follow this proportion they must be directed by that of their power in lycia∥ the judges and town magistrates were elected by the common council and according to the proportion already mentioned in the republic of holland they are not chosen by the common council but each town names its magistrates were i to give a model of an excellent confederate republic i should pitch upon that of lycia     chap iv in what manner despotic governments provide for their security as republics provide for their security by uniting despotic governments do it by separating and by keeping themselves as it were single they sacrifice a part of the country and by ravaging and desolating the frontiers they render the heart of the empire inaccessible it is a received axiom in geometry that the greater the extent of bodies the more their circumference is relatively small this practice therefore of laying the frontiers waste is more tolerable in large than in middling states a despotic government does all the mischief to itself that could be committed by a cruel enemy whose arms it were unable to resist it preserves itself likewise by another kind of separation which is by putting the most distant provinces into the hands of a great vassal the mogul the king of persia and the emperors of china have their feudatories and the turks have found their account in putting the tartars the moldavians the walachians and formerly the transylvanians between themselves and their enemies chap v in what manner a monarchical government provides for its security a monarchy never destroys itself like a despotic government but a kingdom of a moderate extent is liable to sudden invasions it must therefore have fortresses to defend its frontiers and troops to garrison   0 those fortresses the least spot of ground is disputed with military skill and resolution despotic states make incursions against one another it is monarchies only that wage war fortresses are proper for monarchies despotic governments are afraid of them they dare not intrust their officers with such a command as none of them have any affection for the prince or his government chap vi of the defensive force of states in general to preserve a state in its due force it must have such an extent as to admit of a proportion between the celerity with which it may be invaded and that with which it may defeat the invasion as an invader may appear on every side it is requisite that the states should be able to make on every side its defence consequently it should be of a moderate extent proportioned to the degree of velocity that nature has given to man to enable him to move from one place to another france and spain are exactly of a proper extent they have so easy a communication for their forces as to be able to convey them immediately to what part they have a mind the armies unite and pass with rapidity from one frontier to another without any apprehension of such difficulties as require time to remove it is extremely happy for france that the capital stands near to the different frontiers in proportion to their weakness and the prince has a better view of each part of his country according as it is more exposed but when a vast empire like persia is attacked it is several months before the troops are assembled     in a body and then they are not able to make such forced marches for that space of time as they could for fifteen days should the army on the frontiers be defeated it is soon dispersed because there is no neighbouring place of retreat the victor meeting with no resistance advances with all expedition sits down before the capital and lays siege to it when there is scarce time sufficient to summon the governors of the provinces to its relief those who foresee an approaching revolution hasten it by their disobedience for men whose fidelity is entirely owing to the danger of punishment are easily corrupted as soon as it becomes distant their aim is their own private interest the empire is subverted the capital taken and the conqueror disputes the several provinces with the governors the real power of a prince does not consist so much in the facility he meets with in making conquests as in the difficulty an enemy finds in attacking him and if i may so speak in the immutability of his condition but the increase of territory obliges a government to lay itself more open to an enemy as monarchs therefore ought to be endued with wisdom in order to increase their power they ought likewise to have an equal share of prudence to confine it within bounds upon removing the inconveniences of too small a territory they should have their eye constantly on the inconveniences which attend its extent chap vii a reflexion the enemies of a great prince whose reign was protracted to an unusual length have very often accused     him rather i believe from their own fears than upon any solid foundation of having formed and carried on a project of universal monarchy had he attained his aim nothing would have been more fatal to his subjects to himself to his family and to all europe heaven that knows our true interests favoured him more by preventing the success of his arms than it could have done by crowning him with victories instead of raising him to be the only sovereign in europe it made him happier by rendering him the most powerful the subjects of this prince who in travelling abroad are never affected but with what they have left at home who on quitting their own habitations look upon glory as their chief object and in distant countries as an obstacle to their return who disgust you even by their good qualities because they are tainted with so much vanity who are capable of supporting wounds perils and fatigues but not of foregoing their pleasures who are supremely fond of gaiety and comfort themselves for the loss of a battle by a song upon the general those subjects i say would never have the solidity requisite for an enterprize of this kind which if defeated in one country would be unsuccessful every where else and if once unsuccessful would be so for ever chap viii a particular case in which the defensive force of a state is inferior to the offensive it was a saying of the lord of coucy to king charles v that the english are never weaker nor easier overcome than in their own country the same was observed of the romans the same of     the carthaginians and the same will happen to every power that sends armies to distant countries in order to reunite by discipline and military force those who are divided among themselves by political or civil interests the state finds itself weakened by the disorder that still continues and more so by the remedy the lord of coucys maxim is an exception to the general rule which disapproves of wars against distant countries and this exception confirms likewise the rule because it takes place only with regard to those by whom such wars are undertaken chap ix of the relative force of states all grandeur force and power are relative care therefore must be taken that in endeavouring to increase the real grandeur the relative be not diminished under the reign of lewis xiv france was at its highest pitch of relative grandeur germany had not yet produced such powerful princes as have since appeared in that country italy was in the same case england and scotland were not yet formed into one united kingdom arragon was not joined to castile the distant branches of the spanish monarchy were weakened by it and weakened it in their turn and muscovy was as little known in europe as crimtartary chap x of the weakness of neighbouring states whensoever a state lies contiguous to another that happens to be in its decline the former     ought to take particular care not to precipitate the ruin of the latter because this is the happiest situation imaginable nothing being so convenient as for one prince to be near another who receives for him all the rebuff and insults of fortune and it seldom happens that by subduing such a state the real power of the conqueror is as much increased as the relative is diminished book x of laws in the relation they bear to offensive force chap i of offensive force offensive force is regulated by the law of nations which is the political law of each country considered in its relation to every other chap ii of war the life of governments is like that of man the latter has a right to kill in case of natural defence the former have a right to wage war for their own preservation in the case of natural defence i have a right to kill because my life is in respect to me what the life of my antagonist is to him in the same manner a state wages war because its preservation is like that of any other being     with individuals the right of natural defence does not imply a necessity of attacking instead of attacking they need only have recourse to proper tribunals they cannot therefore exercise this right of defence but in sudden cases when immediate death would be the consequence of waiting for the assistance of the law but with states the right of natural defence carries along with it sometimes the necessity of attacking as for instance when one nation sees that a continuance of peace will enable another to destroy her and that to attack that nation instantly is the only way to prevent her own destruction from thence it follows that petty states have oftener a right to declare war than great ones because they are oftener in the case of being afraid of destruction the right therefore of war is derived from necessity and strict justice if those who direct the conscience or councils of princes do not abide by this maxim the consequence is dreadful when they proceed on arbitrary principles of glory convenience and utility torrents of blood must overspread the earth but above all let them not plead such an idle pretext as the glory of the prince his glory is nothing but pride it is a passion and not a legitimate right it is true the fame of his power might increase the strength of his government but it might be equally increased by the reputation of his justice     chap iii of the right of conquest from the right of war comes that of conquest which is the consequence of that right and ought therefore to follow its spirit the right the conqueror has over a conquered people is directed by four sorts of laws the law of nature which makes every thing tend to the preservation of the species the law of natural reason which teaches us to do to others what we would have done to ourselves the law that forms political societies whose duration nature has not limited and in fine the law derived from the nature of the thing itself conquest is an acquisition and carries with it the spirit of preservation and use not of destruction the inhabitants of a conquered country are treated by the conqueror one of the four following ways either he continues to rule them according to their own laws and assumes to himself only the exercise of the political and civil government or he gives them new political and civil government or he destroys and disperses the society or in fine he exterminates the people the first way is conformable to the law of nations nowfollowed the fourth is more agreeable to the law of nations followed by the romans in respect to which i leave the reader to judge how far we have improved upon the ancients we must give due commendations to our modern refinements in reason religion philosophy and manners the authors of our public law guided by ancient histories without confining themselves to cases of strict necessity have fallen into very great errors they have adopted tyrannical and arbitrary principles by supposing the conquerors to be invested with i know not what right to kill from thence they     have drawn consequences as terrible as the very principle and established maxims which the conquerors themselves when possessed of the least grain of sense never presumed to follow it is a plain case that when the conquest is completed the conqueror has no longer a right to kill because he has no longer the plea of natural defence and selfpreservation what has led them into this mistake is that they imagined the conqueror had a right to destroy the state from whence they inferred that he had a right to destroy the men that compose it a wrong consequence from a false principle for from the destruction of the state it does not at all follow that the people who compose it ought to be also destroyed the state is the association of men and not the men themselves the citizen may perish and the man remain from the right of killing in the case of conquest politicians have drawn that of reducing to slavery a consequence as ill grounded as the principle there is no such thing as a right of reducing people to slavery but when it becomes necessary for the preservation of the conquest preservation and not servitude is the end of conquest though servitude may happen sometimes to be a necessary means of preservation even in that case it is contrary to the nature of things that the slavery should be perpetual the people enslaved ought to be rendered capable of becoming subjects slavery in conquests is an accidental thing when after the expiration of a certain space of time all the parts of the conquering state are connected with the conquered nation by custom marriages laws associations and by a certain conformity of disposition there ought to be an end of the slavery for the rights of the conqueror are     founded entirely on the opposition between the two nations in those very articles whence prejudices arise and the want of mutual confidence a conqueror therefore who reduces the conquered people to slavery ought always to reserve to himself the means for means there are without number of restoring them to their liberty these are far from being vague and uncertain notions thus our ancestors acted those ancestors who conquered the roman empire the laws they made in the heat and transport of passion and in the insolence of victory were gradually softened those laws were at first severe but were afterwards rendered impartial the burgundians goths and lombards would have the romans continue a conquered people but the laws of euric gundebald and rotharis made the romans and barbarians fellowcitizens charlemagne to tame the saxons deprived them of their liberty and property lewis the debonnaire made them a free people† and this was one of the most prudent regulations during his whole reign time and servitude had softened their manners and they ever after adhered to him with the greatest fidelity chap iv some advantages of a conquered people instead of inferring such destructive consequences from the right of conquest much better would it have been for politicians to mention the advantages which this very right may sometimes give to a conquered people advantages which would be     more sensibly and more universally experienced were our law of nations exactly followed and established in every part of the globe conquered countries are generally speaking degenerated from their original institution corruption has crept in the execution of the laws has been neglected and the government is grown oppressive who can question but such a state would be a gainer and derive some advantages from the very conquest itself if it did not prove destructive when a government is arrived to that degree of corruption as to be incapable of reforming itself it would not lose much by being new moulded a conqueror who enters triumphant into a country where the moneyed men have by a variety of artifices insensibly arrived at innumerable ways of encroaching on the public where the miserable people who see abuses grown into laws are ready to sink under the weight of oppression yet think they have no right to apply for redress a conqueror i say may make a total change and then the tyranny of those wretches will be the first thing exposed to his resentment we have beheld for instance countries oppressed by the farmers of the revenues and eased afterwards by the conqueror who had neither the engagements nor wants of the legitimate prince even the abuses have been often redressed without any interposition of the conqueror sometimes the frugality of a conquering nation has enabled them to allow the conquered those necessaries of which they had been deprived under a lawful prince a conquest may destroy pernicious prejudices and lay if i may presume to use the expression the nation under a better genius   0 what good might not the spaniards have done to the mexicans they had a mild religion to impart to them but they filled their heads with a frantic superstition they might have set slaves at liberty they made free men slaves they might have undeceived them with regard to the abuse of human sacrifices instead of that they destroyed them never should i have finished were i to recount all the good they might have done and all the mischief they committed it is a conquerors business to repair a part of the mischief he has occasioned the right therefore of conquest i define thus a necessary lawful but unhappy power which leaves the conqueror under a heavy obligation of repairing the injuries done to humanity chap v gelon king of syracuse the noblest treaty of peace ever mentioned in history is in my opinion that which gelon made with the carthaginians he insisted upon their abolishing the custom of sacrificing their children‡ glorious indeed after having defeated three hundred thousand carthaginians he required a condition that was advantageous only to themselves or rather he stipulated in favour of human nature the bactrians exposed their aged fathers to be devoured by large mastiffs a custom suppressed by alexander∥ whereby he obtained a signal triumph over superstition     chap vi of conquests made by a republic it is contrary to the nature of things that in a confederate government one state should make any conquest over another as in our days we have seen in swisserland§ in mixt confederate republics where the association is between petty republics and monarchies of a small extent this is not so absurd contrary it is also to the nature of things that a democratical republic should conquer towns which cannot enter into the sphere of its democracy it is necessary that the conquered people should be capable of enjoying the privileges of sovereignty as was settled in the very beginning among the romans the conquest ought to be limited to the number of citizens fixt for the democracy if a democratical republic subdues a nation in order to govern them as subjects it exposes its own liberty because it intrusts too great a power to those who are appointed to the command of the conquered provinces how dangerous would have been the situation of the republic of carthage had hannibal made himself master of rome what would not he have done in his own country had he been victorious — he who caused so many revolutions in it after his defeat hanno could never have dissuaded the senate from sending succours to hannibal had he used no other argument than his own jealousy the carthaginian senate whose wisdom is so highly extolled by aristotle and which has been evidently proved     by the prosperity of that republic could never have been determined by other than solid reasons they must have been stupid not to see that an army at the distance of three hundred leagues would necessarily be exposed to losses which required reparation hannos party insisted that hannibal should be delivered up to the romans† they could not at that time be afraid of the romans they were therefore apprehensive of hannibal it was impossible some will say for them to imagine that hannibal had been so successful but how was it possible for them to doubt of it could the carthaginians a people spread over all the earth be ignorant of what was transacting in italy no they were sufficiently acquainted with it and for that reason they did not care to send supplies to hannibal hanno became more resolute after the battle of trebia after the battle of thrasimenus after that of cannæ it was not his incredulity that increased but his fear chap vii the same subject continued there is still another inconvenience in conquests made by democracies their government is ever odious to the conquered states it is apparently monarchical but in reality it is much more oppressive than monarchy as the experience of all ages and countries evinces the conquered people are in a melancholy situation they neither enjoy the advantages of a republic nor those of a monarchy     what has been here said of a popular state is applicable to aristocracy chap viii the same subject continued when a republic therefore keeps another nation in subjection it should endeavour to repair the inconveniences arising from the nature of its situation by giving it good laws both for the political and civil government of the people we have an instance of an island in the mediterranean subject to an italian republic whose political and civil laws with regard to the inhabitants of that island were extremely defective the act of indemnity by which it ordained that no one should be condemned to bodily punishment in consequence of the private knowledge of the governor ex informata conscientia is still recent in every bodys memory there have been frequent instances of the peoples petitioning for privileges here the sovereign grants only the common right of all nations chap ix of conquests made by a monarchy if a monarchy can long subsist before it is weakened by its increase it will become formidable and its strength will remain entire while pent up by the neighbouring monarchies it ought not therefore to aim at conquests beyond the natural limits of its government so soon as it has passed these limits it is prudence to stop     in this kind of conquest things must be left as they were found the same courts of judicature the same laws the same customs the same privileges there ought to be no other alteration than that of the army and of the name of the sovereign when a monarchy has extended its limits by the conquest of neighbouring provinces it should treat those provinces with great lenity if a monarchy has been long endeavouring at conquests the provinces of its ancient demesne are generally illused they are obliged to submit both to the new and to the ancient abuses and to be depopulated by a vast metropolis that swallows up the whole now if after having made conquests round this demesne the conquered people were treated like the ancient subjects the state would be undone the taxes sent by the conquered provinces to the capital would never return the inhabitants of the frontiers would be ruined and consequently the frontiers would be weaker the people would be disaffected and the subsistence of the armies designed to act and remain there would become more precarious such is the necessary state of a conquering monarchy a shocking luxury in the capital misery in the provinces somewhat distant and plenty in the most remote it is the same with such a monarchy as with our planet fire at the center verdure on the surface and between both a dry cold and barren earth chap x of one monarchy that subdues another sometimes one monarchy subdues another the smaller the latter the better it is overawed by     fortresses and the larger it is the better will it be preserved by colonies chap xi of the manners of a conquered people it is not sufficient in those conquests to let the conquered nation enjoy their own laws it is perhaps more necessary to leave them also their manners because people in general have a stronger attachment to these than to their laws the french have been driven nine times out of italy because as historians say† of their insolent familiarities with the fair sex it is too much for a nation to be obliged to bear not only with the pride of conquerors but with their incontinence and indiscretion these are without doubt most grievous and intolerable as they are the source of infinite outrages chap xii of a law of cyrus far am i from thinking that a good law which cyrus made to oblige the lydians to practise none but mean or infamous professions it is true he directed his attention to an object of the greatest importance he thought of guarding against revolts and not invasions but invasions will soon come when the persians and lydians unite and corrupt each other i would therefore much rather support by laws the simplicity and rudeness of the conquering nation than the effeminacy of the conquered     aristodemus tyrant of cumæ‡ used all his endeavours to banish courage and to enervate the minds of youth he ordered that boys should let their hair grow in the same manner as girls that they should deck it with flowers and wear long robes of different colours down to their heels that when they went to their masters of music and dancing they should have women with them to carry their umbrelloes perfumes and fans and to present them with combs and lookingglasses whenever they bathed this education lasted till the age of twenty an education that could be agreeable to none but to a petty tyrant who exposes his sovereignty to defend his life chap xiii charles xii this prince who depended entirely on his own strength hastened his ruin by forming designs that could never be executed but by a long war a thing which his kingdom was unable to support it was not a declining state he undertook to subvert but a rising empire the russians made use of the war he waged against them as of a military school every defeat brought them nearer to victory and losing abroad they learnt to defend themselves at home charles in the deserts of poland imagined himself sovereign of the whole world here he wandered and with him in some measure wandered sweden whilst his capital enemy acquired new strength against him locked him up made settlements along the baltic destroyed or subdued livonia     sweden was like a river whose waters are cut off at the fountainhead in order to change its course it was not the affair of pultova that ruined charles had he not been destroyed at that place he would in another the casualties of fortune are easily repaired but who can be guarded against events that incessantly arise from the nature of things but neither nature nor fortune was ever so much against him as he himself he was not directed by the present situation of things but by a kind of plan of his forming and even this he followed very ill he was not an alexander but he would have made an excellent soldier under that monarch alexanders project succeeded because it was prudently concerted the bad success of the persians in their several invasions of greece the conquests of agesilaus and the retreat of the ten thousand had shewn to demonstration the superiority of the greeks in their manner of fighting and in their arms and it was well known that the persians were too proud to be corrected it was no longer possible for them to weaken greece by divisions greece was then united under one head who could not pitch upon a better method of rendering her insensible of her servitude than by flattering her vanity with the destruction of her hereditary enemy and with the hopes of the conquest of asia an empire cultivated by the most industrious nation in the world that followed agriculture from a principle of religion an empire abounding with every conveniency of life furnished the enemy with all necessary means of subsisting it was easy to judge by the pride of those kings who in vain were mortified by their numerous defeats     that they would precipitate their ruin by their forwardness in venturing battles and that the flattery of their courtiers would never permit them to doubt of their grandeur the project was not only wise but wisely executed alexander in the rapidity of his conquests even in the imperuosity of his passion had if i may so express myself a flash of reason by which he was directed and which those who would fain have made a romance of his history and whose minds were more corrupt than his could not conceal from our view let us descend more minutely into his history chap xiv alexander he did not set out upon his expedition till he had secured macedonia against the neighbouring barbarians and completed the reduction of greece he availed himself of this conquest for no other end than for the execution of his grand enterprize he rendered the jealousy of the lacedæmonians of no effect he attacked the maritime provinces he caused his land forces to keep close to the sea coast that they might not be separated from his fleet he made an admirable use of discipline against numbers he never wanted provisions and if it be true that victory gave him every thing he in his turn did every thing to obtain it in the beginning of his enterprize a time when the least check might have proved his destruction he trusted very little to fortune but when his reputation was established by a series of prosperous events he sometimes had recourse to temerity when before his departure for asia he marched against the triballians and illyrians you find he     waged war against those people in the very same manner as cæsar afterwards conducted that against the gauls upon his return to greece† it was in some measure against his will that he took and destroyed thebes when he invested the city he wanted the inhabitants to come into terms of peace but they hastened their own ruin when it was debated whether he should attack the persian fleet‡ it is parmenio that shews his presumption alexander his wisdom his aim was to draw the persians from the seacoast and to lay them under a necessity of abandoning their marine in which they had a manifest superiority tyre being from principle attached to the persians who could not subsist without the commerce and navigation of that city alexander destroyed it he subdued egypt which darius had left bare of troops while he was assembling immense armies in another world to the passage of the granicus alexander owed the conquest of the greek colonies to the battle of issus the reduction of tyre and egypt to the battle of arbela the empire of the world after the battle of issus he suffered darius to escape and employed his time in securing and regulating his conquests after the battle of arbela he pursued him so close∥ as to leave him no place of shelter in his empire darius enters his towns his provinces to quit them the next moment and alexander marches with such rapidity that the empire of the world seems to be rather the prize of an olympian race than the fruit of a great victory in this manner he carried on his conquests let us now see how he preserved them   0 he opposed those who would have had him treat the greeks as masters§ and the persians as slaves he thought only of uniting the two nations and of abolishing the distinctions of a conquering and a conquered people after he had completed his victories he relinquished all those prejudices that had helped him to obtain them he assumed the manners of the persians that he might not chagrine them too much by obliging them to conform to those of the greeks it was this humanity which made him shew so great a respect for the wife and mother of darius and this that made him so continent what a conqueror he is lamented by all the nations he has subdued what an usurper at his death the very family he has cast from the throne is all in tears these were the most glorious passages in his life and such as history cannot produce an instance of in any other conqueror nothing consolidates a conquest more than the union formed between the two nations by marriages alexander chose his wives from the nation he had subdued he insisted on his courtiers doing the same and the rest of the macedonians followed the example the franks and burgundians permitted those marriages¶ the visigoths forbad them in spain and afterwards allowed them by the lombards they were not only allowed but encouraged† when the romans wanted to weaken macedonia they ordered that there should be no intermarriages between the people of different provinces     alexander whose aim was to unite the two nations thought fit to establish in persia a great number of greek colonies he built therefore a multitude of towns and so strongly were all the parts of this new empire cemented that after his decease amidst the disturbances and confusion of the most frightful civil wars when the greeks had reduced themselves as it were to a state of annihilation not a single province of persia revolted to prevent greece and macedon from being too much exhausted he sent a colony of jews‡ to alexandria the manners of those people signified nothing to him provided he could be sure of their fidelity he not only suffered the conquered nations to retain their own customs and manners but likewise their civil laws and frequently the very kings and governors to whom they had been subject the macedonians∥ he placed at the head of the troops and the natives of the country at the head of the government rather choosing to run the hazard of a particular disloyalty which sometimes happened than of a general revolt he paid a great respect to the ancient traditions and to all the public monuments of the glory or vanity of nations the persian monarchs having destroyed the temples of the greeks babylonians and egyptians alexander rebuilt them§ few nations submitted to his yoke to whose religion he did not conform and his conquests seem to have been intended only to make him the particular monarch of each nation and the first inhabitant of each city the aim of the romans in conquest was to destroy     his to preserve and wherever he directed his victorious arms his chief view was to atchieve something from whence that country might derive an increase of prosperity and power to attain this end he was enabled first of all by the greatness of his genius secondly by his frugality and private œconomy¶ thirdly by his profusion in matters of importance he was close and reserved in his private expences but generous to the highest degree in those of a public nature in regulating his household he was the private macedonian but in paying the troops in sharing his conquests with the greeks and in his largesses to every soldier in his army he was alexander he committed two very bad actions in setting persepolis on fire and slaying clitus but he rendered them famous by his repentance hence it is that his crimes are forgot while his regard for virtue was recorded they were considered rather as unlucky accidents than as his own deliberate acts posterity struck with the beauty of his mind even in the midst of his irregular passion can view him only with pity but never with an eye of hatred let us draw a comparison between him and cæsar the roman general by attempting to imitate the asiatic monarch flung his fellowcitizens into a state of despair for a matter of mere ostentation the macedonian prince by the same imitation did a thing which was quite agreeable to his original scheme of conquest chap xv new methods of preserving a conquest when a monarch has subdued a large country he may make use of an admirable method equally     proper for moderating despotic power and for preserving the conquest it is a method practised by the conquerors of china in order to prevent the vanquished nation from falling into despair the victors from growing insolent and proud the government from becoming military and to contain the two nations within their duty the tartar family now on the throne of china has ordained that every military corps in the provinces should be composed half of chinese and half tartars to the end that the jealousy between the two nations may keep them within bounds the courts of judicature are likewise half chinese and half tartars this is productive of several good effects   the two nations are a check to one another   they both preserve the civil and military power and one is not destroyed by the other   the conquering nation may spread itself without being weakened and lost it is likewise enabled to withstand civil and foreign wars the want of so wise an institution as this has been the ruin of almost all the conquerors that ever existed chap xvi of conquests made by a despotic prince when a conquest happens to be vastly large it supposes a despotic power and then the army dispersed in the provinces is not sufficient there should be always a body of faithful troops near the prince ready to fall instantly upon any part of the empire that may chance to waver this military corps ought to awe the rest and to strike terror into those who through necessity have been intrusted with any authority in the empire the emperor of china has always a large body of tartars near his     person ready upon all occasions in india in turkey in japan the prince has always a bodyguard independent of the other regular forces this particular corps keeps the dispersed troops in awe chap xvii the same subject continued we have observed that the countries subdued by a despotic monarch ought to be held by a vassal historians are very lavish of their praises on the generosity of those conquerors who restored the princes to the throne whom they had vanquished extremely generous then were the romans who made such a number of kings in order to have instruments of slavery a proceeding of that kind is absolutely necessary if the conqueror intends to preserve the country which he has subdued neither the governors he sends will be able to contain the subjects within duty nor he himself the governors he will be obliged to strip his ancient patrimony of troops in order to secure his new dominions the miseries of each nation will be common to both civil broils will spread themselves from one to the other on the contrary if the conqueror restores the legitimate prince to the throne he will of course have an ally by the junction of whose forces his own power will be augmented we have a recent instance of this in shah nadir who conquered the mogul seized his treasures and left him in possession of indostan     book xi of the laws which establish political liberty with regard to the constitution chap i a general idea i make a distinction between the laws that establish political liberty as it relates to the constitution and those by which it is established as it relates to the citizen the former shall be the subject of this book the latter i shall examine in the next chap ii different significations of the word liberty there is no word that admits of more various significations and has made more different impressions on the human mind than that of liberty some have taken it for a facility of deposing a person on whom they had conferred a tyrannical authority others for the power of choosing a superior whom they are obliged to obey others for the right of bearing arms and of being thereby enabled to use violence others in fine for the privilege of being governed by a native of their own country or by their own laws a certain nation for a long time thought liberty consisted in the privilege of wearing a long beard∥ some have annexed this name to one form of government exclusive     of others those who had a republican taste applied it to this species of polity those who liked a monarchical state gave it to monarchy† thus they have all applied the name of liberty to the government most suitable to their own customs and inclinations and as in republics the people have not so constant and so present a view of the causes of their misery and as the magistrates seem to act only in conformity to the laws hence liberty is generally said to reside in republics and to be banished from monarchies in fine as in democracies the people seem to act almost as they please this sort of government has been deemed the most free and the power of the people has been confounded with their liberty chap iii in what liberty consists it is true that in democracies the people seem to act as they please but political liberty does not consist in an unlimited freedom in governments that is in societies directed by laws liberty can consist only in the power of doing what we ought to will and in not being constrained to do what we ought not to will we must have continually present to our minds the difference between independence and liberty liberty is a right of doing whatever the laws permit and if a citizen could do what they forbid he would be no longer possessed of liberty because all his fellowcitizens would have the same power     chap iv the same subject continued democratic and aristocratic states are not in their own nature free political liberty is to be found only in moderate governments and even in these it is not always found it is there only when there is no abuse of power but constant experience shews us that every man invested with power is apt to abuse it and to carry his authority as far as it will go is it not strange though true to say that virtue itself has need of limits to prevent this abuse it is necessary from the very nature of things power should be a check to power a government may be so constituted as no man shall be compelled to do things to which the law does not oblige him nor forced to abstain from things which the law permits chap v of the end or view of different governments though all governments have the same general end which is that of preservation yet each has another particular object increase of dominion was the object of rome war that of sparta religion that of the jewish laws commerce that of marseilles public tranquillity that of the laws of china navigation that of the laws of rhodes natural liberty that of the policy of the savages in general the pleasures of the prince that of despotic states that of monarchies the princes and the kingdoms glory the independence of individuals     is the end aimed at by the laws of poland from thence results the oppression of the whole† one nation there is also in the world that has for the direct end of its constitution political liberty we shall presently examine the principles on which this liberty is founded if they are sound liberty will appear in its highest perfection to discover political liberty in a constitution no great labour is requisite if we are capable of seeing it where it exists it is soon found and we need not go far in search of it chap vi of the constitution of england in every government there are three sorts of power the legislative the executive in respect to things dependent on the law of nations and the executive in regard to matters that depend on the civil law by virtue of the first the prince or magistrate enacts temporary or perpetual laws and amends or abrogates those that have been already enacted by the second he makes peace or war sends or receives embassies establishes the public security and provides against invasions by the third he punishes criminals or determines the disputes that arise between individuals the latter we shall call the judiciary power and the other simply the executive power of the state the political liberty of the subject is a tranquillity of mind arising from the opinion each person has of his safety in order to have this liberty it is requisite the government be so constituted as one man need not be afraid of another     when the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or in the same body of magistrates there can be no liberty because apprehensions may arise lest the same monarch or senate should enact tyrannical laws to execute them in a tyrannical manner again there is no liberty if the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and executive were it joined with the legislative the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary controul for the judge would be then the legislator were it joined to the executive power the judge might behave with violence and oppression there would be an end of every thing were the same man or the same body whether of the nobles or of the people to exercise those three powers that of enacting laws that of executing the public resolutions and of trying the causes of individuals most kingdoms in europe enjoy a moderate government because the prince who is invested with the two first powers leaves the third to his subjects in turkey where these three powers are united in the sultans person the subjects groan under the most dreadful oppression in the republics of italy where these three powers are united there is less liberty than in our monarchies hence their government is obliged to have recourse to as violent methods for its support as even that of the turks witness the stateinquisitors and the lions mouth into which every informer may at all hours throw his written accusations in what a situation must the poor subject be under those republics the same body of magistrates are possessed as executors of the laws of the whole  00 power they have given themselves in quality of legislators they may plunder the state by their general determinations and as they have likewise the judiciary power in their hands every private citizen may be ruined by their particular decisions the whole power is here united in one body and though there is no external pomp that indicates a despotic sway yet the people feel the effects of it every moment hence it is that many of the princes of europe whose aim has been levelled at arbitrary power have constantly set out with uniting in their own persons all the branches of magistracy and all the great offices of state i allow indeed that the mere hereditary aristocracy of the italian republics does not exactly answer to the despotic power of the eastern princes the number of magistrates sometimes moderates the power of the magistracy the whole body of the nobles do not always concur in the same design and different tribunals are erected that temper each other thus at venice the legislative power is in the council the executive in the pregadi and the judiciary in the quarantia but the mischief is that these different tribunals are composed of magistrates all belonging to the same body which constitutes almost one and the same power the judiciary power ought not to be given to a standing senate it should be exercised by persons taken from the body of the people at certain times of the year and consistently with a form and manner prescribed by law in order to erect a tribunal that should last only so long as necessity requires by this method the judicial power so terrible to mankind not being annexed to any particular state  0  or profession becomes as it were invisible people have not then the judges continually present to their view they fear the office but not the magistrate in accusations of a deep and criminal nature it is proper the person accused should have the privilege of choosing in some measure his judges in concurrence with the law or at least he should have a right to except against so great a number that the remaining part may be deemed his own choice the other two powers may be given rather to magistrates or permanent bodies because they are not exercised on any private subject one being no more than the general will of the state and the other the execution of that general will but though the tribunals ought not to be fixt the judgements ought and to such a degree as to be ever conformable to the letter of the law were they to be the private opinion of the judge people would then live in society without exactly knowing the nature of their obligations the judges ought likewise to be of the same rank as the accused or in other words his peers to the end that he may not imagine he is fallen into the hands of persons inclined to treat him with rigour if the legislature leaves the executive power in possession of a right to imprison those subjects who can give security for their good behaviour there is an end of liberty unless they are taken up in order to answer without delay to a capital crime in which case they are really free being subject only to the power of the law but should the legislature think itself in danger by some secret conspiracy against the state or by a correspondence with a foreign enemy it might authorize the executive power for a short and limited time to imprison suspected persons who in that  0  case would lose their liberty only for a while to preserve it for ever and this is the only reasonable method that can be substituted to the tyrannical magistracy of the ephori and to the state inquisitors of venice who are also despotical as in a country of liberty every man who is supposed a free agent ought to be his own governor the legislative power should reside in the whole body of the people but since this is impossible in large states and in small ones is subject to many inconveniences it is fit the people should transact by their representatives what they cannot transact by themselves the inhabitants of a particular town are much better acquainted with its wants and interests than with those of other places and are better judges of the capacity of their neighbours than of that of the rest of their countrymen the members therefore of the legislature should not be chosen from the general body of the nation but it is proper that in every considerable place a representative should be elected by the inhabitants the great advantage of representatives is their capacity of discussing public affairs for this the people collectively are extremely unfit which is one of the chief inconveniences of a democracy it is not at all necessary that the representatives who have received a general instruction from their constituents should wait to be directed on each particular affair as is practised in the diets of germany true it is that by this way of proceeding the speeches of the deputies might with greater propriety be called the voice of the nation but on the other hand this would occasion infinite delays would give each deputy a power of controlling the assembly  0  and on the most urgent and pressing occasions the wheels of government might be stopped by the caprice of a single person when the deputies as mr sidney well observes represent a body of people as in holland they ought to be accountable to their constituents but it is a different thing in england where they are deputed by boroughs all the inhabitants of the several districts ought to have a right of voting at the election of a representative except such as are in so mean a situation as to be deemed to have no will of their own one great fault there was in most of the ancient republics that the people had a right to active resolutions such as require some execution a thing of which they are absolutely incapable they ought to have no share in the government but for the choosing of representatives which is within their reach for though few can tell the exact degree of mens capacities yet there are none but are capable of knowing in general whether the person they choose is better qualified than most of his neighbours neither ought the representative body to be chosen for the executive part of government for which it is not so fit but for the enacting of laws or to see whether the laws in being are duly executed a thing suited to their abilities and which none indeed but themselves can properly perform in such a state there are always persons distinguished by their birth riches or honours but were they to be confounded with the common people and to have only the weight of a single vote like the rest the common liberty would be their slavery and they would have no interest in supporting it as most of the popular resolutions would be against them the share they have therefore in the legislature ought to  0  be proportioned to their other advantages in the state which happens only when they form a body that has a right to check the licentiousness of the people as the people have a right to oppose any encroachment of theirs the legislative power is therefore committed to the body of the nobles and to that which represents the people each having their assemblies and deliberations apart each their separate views and interests of the three powers abovementioned the judiciary is in some measure next to nothing there remain therefore only two and as these have need of a regulating power to moderate them the part of the legislative body composed of the nobility is extremely proper for this purpose the body of the nobility ought to be hereditary in the first place it is so in its own nature and in the next there must be a considerable interest to preserve its privileges privileges that in themselves are obnoxious to popular envy and of course in a free state are always in danger but as an hereditary power might be tempted to pursue its own particular interests and forget those of the people it is proper that where a singular advantage may be gained by corrupting the nobility as in the laws relating to the supplies they should have no other share in the legislation than the power of rejecting and not that of resolving by the power of resolving i mean the right of ordaining by their own authority or of amending what has been ordained by others by the power of rejecting i would be understood to mean the right of annulling a resolution taken by another which was the power of the tribunes at rome and though the person possessed of the privilege of rejecting may likewise have the right of approving yet this approbation  0  passes for no more than a declaration that he intends to make no use of his privilege of rejecting and is derived from that very privilege the executive power ought to be in the hands of a monarch because this branch of government having need of dispatch is better administered by one than by many on the other hand whatever depends on the legislative power is oftentimes better regulated by many than by a single person but if there were no monarch and the executive power should be committed to a certain number of persons selected from the legislative body there would be an end of liberty by reason the two powers would be united as the same persons would sometimes possess and would be always able to possess a share in both were the legislative body to be a considerable time without meeting this would likewise put an end to liberty for of two things one would naturally follow either that there would be no longer any legislative resolutions and then the state would fall into anarchy or that these resolutions would be taken by the executive power which would render it absolute it would be needless for the legislative body to continue always assembled this would be troublesome to the representative and moreover would cut out too much work for the executive power so as to take off its attention to its office and oblige it to think only of defending its own prerogatives and the right it has to execute again were the legislative body to be always assembled it might happen to be kept up only by filling the places of the deceased members with new representatives and in that case if the legislative body were once corrupted the evil would be past all  0  remedy when different legislative bodies succeed one another the people who have a bad opinion of that which is actually sitting may reasonably entertain some hopes of the next but were it to be always the same body the people upon seeing it once corrupted would no longer expect any good from its laws and of course they would either become desperate or fall into a state of indolence the legislative body should not meet of itself for a body is supposed to have no will but when it is met and besides were it not to meet unanimously it would be impossible to determine which was really the legislative body the part assembled or the other and if it had a right to prorogue itself it might happen never to be prorogued which would be extremely dangerous in case it should ever attempt to encroach on the executive power besides there are seasons some more proper than others for assembling the legislative body it is fit therefore that the executive power should regulate the time of meeting as well as the duration of those assemblies according to the circumstances and exigences of a state known to itself were the executive power not to have a right of restraining the encroachments of the legislative body the latter would become despotic for as it might arrogate to itself what authority it pleased it would soon destroy all the other powers but it is not proper on the other hand that the legislative power should have a right to stay the executive for as the execution has its natural limits it is useless to confine it besides the executive power is generally employed in momentary operations the power therefore of the roman tribunes was faulty as it put a stop not only to the legislation  0  but likewise to the executive part of government which was attended with infinite mischiefs but if the legislative power in a free state has no right to stay the executive it has a right and ought to have the means of examining in what manner its laws have been executed an advantage which this government has over that of crete and sparta where the cosmi and the ephori gave no account of their administration but whatever may be the issue of that examination the legislative body ought not to have a power of arraigning the person nor of course the conduct of him who is entrusted with the executive power his person should be sacred because as it is necessary for the good of the state to prevent the legislative body from rendering themselves arbitrary the moment he is accused or tried there is an end of liberty in this case the state would be no longer a monarchy but a kind of republic though not a free government but as the person intrusted with the executive power cannot abuse it without bad counsellors and such as hate the laws as ministers though the laws protect them as subjects these men may be examined and punished an advantage which this government has over that of gnidus where the law allowed of no such thing as calling the amymones to an account even after their administration† and therefore the people could never obtain any satisfaction for the injuries done them though in general the judiciary power ought not to be united with any part of the legislative yet  0  this is liable to three exceptions founded on the particular interest of the party accused the great are always obnoxious to popular envy and were they to be judged by the people they might be in danger from their judges and would moreover be deprived of the privilege which the meanest subject is possessed of in a free state of being tried by his peers the nobility for this reason ought not to be cited before the ordinary courts of judicature but before that part of the legislature which is composed of their own body it is possible that the law which is clearsighted in one sense and blind in another might in some cases be too severe but as we have already observed the national judges are no more than the mouth that pronounces the words of the law mere passive beings incapable of moderating either its force or rigour that part therefore of the legislative body which we have just now observed to be a necessary tribunal on another occasion is also a necessary tribunal in this it belongs to its supreme authority to moderate the law in favour of the law itself by mitigating the sentence it might also happen that a subject intrusted with the administration of public affairs may infringe the rights of the people and be guilty of crimes which the ordinary magistrates either could not or would not punish but in general the legislative power cannot try causes and much less can it try this particular case where it represents the party aggrieved which is the people it can only therefore impeach but before what court shall it bring its impeachment must it go and demean itself before the ordinary tribunals which are its inferiors and being composed moreover of men who are chosen from the people as well as itself will naturally  0  be swayed by the authority of so powerful an accuser no in order to preserve the dignity of the people and the security of the subject the legislative part which represents the people must bring in its charge before the legislative part which represents the nobility who have neither the same interests nor the same passions here is an advantage which this government has over most of the ancient republics where this abuse prevailed that the people were at the same time both judge and accuser the executive power pursuant to what has been already said ought to have a share in the legislature by the power of rejecting otherwise it would soon be stripped of its prerogative but should the legislative power usurp a share of the executive the latter would be equally undone if the prince were to have a part in the legislature by the power of resolving liberty would be lost but as it is necessary he should have a share in the legislature for the support of his own prerogative this share must consist in the power of rejecting the change of government at rome was owing to this that neither the senate who had one part of the executive power nor the magistrates who were entrusted with the other had the right of rejecting which was entirely lodged in the people here then is the fundamental constitution of the government we are treating of the legislative body being composed of two parts they check one another by the mutual privilege of rejecting they are both restrained by the executive power as the executive is by the legislative these three powers should naturally form a state of repose or inaction but as there is a necessity for   0 movement in the course of human affairs they are forced to move but still in concert as the executive power has no other part in the legislative than the privilege of rejecting it can have no share in the public debates it is not even necessary that it should propose because as it may always disapprove of the resolutions that shall be taken it may likewise reject the decisions on those proposals which were made against its will in some ancient commonwealths where public debates were carried on by the people in a body it was natural for the executive power to propose and debate in conjunction with the people otherwise their resolutions must have been attended with a strange confusion were the executive power to determine the raising of public money otherwise than by giving its confent liberty would be at an end because it would become legislative in the most important point of legislation if the legislative power were to settle the subsidies not from year to year but for ever it would run the risk of losing its liberty because the executive power would be no longer dependent and when once it was possessed of such a perpetual right it would be a matter of indifference whether it held it of itself or of another the same may be said if it should come to a resolution of intrusting not an annual but a perpetual command of the fleets and armies to the executive power to prevent the executive power from being able to oppress it is requisite that the armies with which it is intrusted should consist of the people and have the same spirit as the people as was the case at rome till the time of marius to obtain this end there are only two ways either that the persons     employed in the army should have sufficient property to answer for their conduct to their fellowsubjects and be enlisted only for a year as was customary at rome or if there should be a standingarmy composed chiefly of the most despicable part of the nation the legislative power should have a right to disband them as soon as it pleased the soldiers should live in common with the rest of the people and no separate camp barracks or fortress should be suffered when once an army is established it ought not to depend immediately on the legislative but on the executive power and this from the very nature of the thing its business consisting more in action than deliberation it is natural for mankind to set a higher value upon courage than timidity on activity than prudence on strength than counsel hence the army will ever despise a senate and respect their own officers they will naturally slight the orders sent them by a body of men whom they look upon as cowards and therefore unworthy to command them so that as soon as the troops depend entirely on the legislative body it becomes a military government and if the contrary has ever happened it has been owing to some extraordinary circumstances it is because the army was always kept divided it is because it was composed of several bodies that depended each on a particular province it is because the capital towns were strong places defended by their natural situation and not garrisoned with regular troops holland for instance is still safer than venice she might drown or starve the revolted troops for as they are not quartered in towns capable of furnishing them with necessary subsistence this subsistence is of course precarious     in perusing the admirable treatise of tacitus on the manners of the germans we find it is from that nation the english have borrowed the idea of their political government this beautiful system was invented first in the woods as all human things have an end the state we are speaking of will lose its liberty will perish have not rome sparta and carthage perished it will perish when the legislative power shall be more corrupt than the executive it is not my business to examine whether the english actually enjoy this liberty or not sufficient it is for my purpose to observe that it is established by their laws and i inquire no farther neither do i pretend by this to undervalue other governments nor to say that this extreme political liberty ought to give uneasiness to those who have only a moderate share of it how should i have any such design i who think that even the highest refinement of reason is not always desirable and that mankind generally find their account better in mediums than in extremes harrington in his oceana has also enquired into the utmost degree of liberty to which the constitution of a state may be carried but of him indeed it may be said that for want of knowing the nature of real liberty he busied himself in pursuit of an imaginary one and that he built a chalcedon though he had a byzantium before his eyes chap vii of the monarchies we are acquainted with the monarchies we are acquainted with have not like that we have been speaking of liberty for     their direct view the only aim is the glory of the subject of the state and of the sovereign but from hence there results a spirit of liberty which in those states is capable of archieving as great things and of contributing as much perhaps to happiness as liberty itself here the three powers are not distributed and founded on the model of the constitution abovementioned they have each a particular distribution according to which they border more or less on political liberty and if they did not border upon it monarchy would degenerate into despotic government chap viii why the ancients had not a clear idea of monarchy the ancients had no notion of a government founded on a body of nobles and much less on a legislative body composed of the representatives of the people the republics of greece and italy were cities that had each their own form of government and convened their subjects within their walls before rome had swallowed up all the other republics there was scarce any where a king to be found no not in italy gaul spain or germany they were all petty states or republics even africa itself was subject to a great commonwealth and asia minor was occupied by greek colonies there was therefore no instance of deputies of towns or assemblies of the states one must have gone as far as persia to find a monarchy i am not ignorant that there were confederate republics in which several towns sent deputies to an assembly but i affirm there was no monarchy on that model     the first plan therefore of the monarchies we are acquainted with was thus formed the german nations that conquered the roman empire were certainly a free people of this we may be convinced by only reading tacitus on the manners of the germans the conquerors spread themselves over all the country living mostly in the fields and very little in towns when they were in germany the whole nation was able to assemble this they could no longer do when dispersed through the conquered provinces and yet as it was necessary that the nation should deliberate on public affairs pursuant to their usual method before the conquest they had recourse to representative such is the origin of the gothic government amongst us at first it was mixt with aristocracy and monarchy a mixture attended with this inconveniency that the common people were bondmen the custom afterwards succeeded of granting letters of infranchisement and was soon followed by so perfect a harmony between the civil liberty of the people the privileges of the nobility and clergy and the princes prerogative that i really think there never was in the world a government so well tempered as that of each part of europe so long as it lasted surprizing that the corruption of the government of a conquering nation should have given birth to the best species of constitution that could possibly be imagined by man chap ix aristotles manner of thinking aristotle is greatly puzzled in treating of monarchy he makes five species and he does     not distinguish them by the form of constitution but by things merely accidental as the virtues and vices of the prince or by things extrinsecal such as tyranny usurped or inherited among the number of monarchies he ranks the persian empire and the kingdom of sparta but is it not evident that the one was a despotic state and the other a republic the ancients who were strangers to the distribution of the three powers in the government of a single person could never form a just idea of monarchy chap x what other politicians thought to temper monarchy arybas king† of epirus found no other remedy than a republic the molossi not knowing how to limit the same power made two kings‡ by which means the state was weakened more than the prerogative they wanted rivals and they created enemies two kings were tolerable no where but at sparta here they did not form but were only a part of the constitution chap xi of the kings of the heroic times of greece in the heroic times of greece a kind of monarchy arose that was not of long duration∥ those who had been inventors of arts who had fought in their countrys cause who had established societies or distributed lands among the people obtained the     regal power and transmitted it to their children they were kings priests and judges this was one of the five species of monarchy mentioned by aristotle¶ and the only one that can give us any idea of the monarchical constitution but the plan of this constitution is opposite to that of our modern monarchies the three powers were there distributed in such a manner that the people were the legislature and the king had the executive together with the judiciary power whereas in modern monarchies the prince is invested with the executive and legislative powers or at least with part of the legislative but does not act in a judiciary capacity in the government of the kings of the heroic times the three powers were illdistributed hence those monarchies could not long subsist for as soon as the people got the legislative power into their hands they might as they every where did upon the very least caprice subvert the regal authority among a free people possessed of the legislative power and enclosed within walls where every thing tending towards oppression appears still more odious it is the masterpiece of legislation to know where to place properly the judiciary power but it could not be in worse hands than in those of the person to whom the executive power had been already committed from that very instant the monarch became terrible but at the same time as he had no share in the legislature he could make no defence against it thus his power was in one sense too great in another too little     they had not as yet discovered that the true function of a prince was to appoint judges and not to sit as judge himself the opposite policy rendered the government of a single person insupportable hence all these kings were banished the greeks had no notion of the proper distribution of the three powers in the government of one person they could see it only in that of many and this kind of constitution they distinguished by the name of polity† chap xii of the government of the kings of rome and in what manner the three powers were there distributed the government of the kings of rome had some relation to that of the kings of the heroic times of greece its subversion like the latters was owing to its general defect though in its own particular nature it was exceeding good in order to give an adequate idea of this government i shall distinguish that of the first five kings that of servius tullus and that of tarquin the crown was elective and under the five first kings the senate had the greatest share in the election upon the kings decease the senate examined whether they should continue the established form of government if they thought proper to continue it they named a magistrate‡ taken from their own body who chose a king the senate were to approve of the election the people to confirm it and the augurs to declare the approbation of the gods if any of these three conditions were wanting they were obliged to proceed to another election     the constitution was a mixture of monarchy aristocracy and democracy and such was the harmony of power that there was no instance of jealousy or dispute in the first reigns the king commanded the armies and had the direction of the sacrifices he had the power of determining∥ civil and criminal§ causes he called the senate together convened the people laid some affairs before the latter and regulated the rest with the senate the authority of the senate was very great the kings oftentimes pitched upon senators with whom they sat in judgement and they never laid any affair before the people till it had been previously debated† in that august assembly the people had the right of choosing‡ magistrates of consenting to the new laws and with the kings permission of making war and peace but they had not the judicial power when tullus hostilius referred the trial of horatius to the people he had his particular reasons which may be seen in dionysius halicarnasseus§§ the constitution altered under∥∥ servius tullus the senate had no share in his election he caused himself to be proclaimed by the people he resigned the power of hearing civil causes¶ reserving none to himself but those of a criminal nature he laid all     affairs directly before the people eased them of the taxes and imposed the whole burthen on the patricians hence in proportion as he weakened the regal together with the senatorian power he augmented that of the plebeians tarquin would neither be chosen by the senate nor by the people he considered servius tullus as an usurper and seized the crown as his hereditary right he destroyed most of the senators those who remained he never consulted nor did he even so much as summon them to assist at his decisions† thus his power increased but the odium of that power received a new addition by usurping also the authority of the people against whose consent he enacted several laws the three powers were by these means reunited in his person but the people at a critical minute recollected that they were legislators and there was an end of tarquin chap xiii general reflections on the state of rome after the expulsion of its kings it is impossible to be tired of so agreeable a subject as ancient rome thus strangers at present leave the modern palaces of that celebrated capital to visit the ruins and thus the eye after recreating itself with the view of flowery meads is pleased with the wild prospect of rocks and mountains the patrician families were at all times possessed of great privileges these distinctions which were considerable under the kings became much more important after their expulsion hence arose the   0 jealousy of the plebeians who wanted to reduce them the contest struck at the constitution without weakening the government for it was very indifferent of what family were the magistrates provided the magistracy preserved its authority an elective monarchy like that of rome necessarily supposeth a powerful aristocratic body to support it without which it changes immediately into tyranny or into a popular state but a popular state has no need of this distinction of families to maintain itself to this it was owing that the patricians who were a necessary part of the constitution under the regal government became a superfluous branch under the consuls the people could suppress them without hurting themselves and change the constitution without corrupting it after servius tullus had reduced the patricians it was natural that rome should fall from the regal hands into those of the people but the people had no occasion to be afraid of relapsing under a regal power by reducing the patricians a state may alter two different ways either by the amendment or by the corruption of the constitution if it has preserved its principles and the constitution changes this is owing to its amendment if upon changing the constitution its principles are lost this is because it has been corrupted the government of rome after the expulsion of the kings should naturally have been a democracy the people had already the legislative power in their hands it was their unanimous consent that had expelled the tarquins and if they had not continued steady to those principles the tarquins might easily have been restored to pretend that their design in expelling them was to render themselves slaves to a few families is quite absurd the situation therefore     of things required that rome should have formed a democracy and yet this did not happen there was a necessity that the power of the principal families should be tempered and that the laws should have a bias to democracy the prosperity of states is frequently greater in the insensible transition from one constitution to another than in either of those constitutions then it is that all the springs of government are upon the stretch that the citizens assert their claims that friendships or enmities are formed amongst the jarring parties and that there is a noble emulation between those who defend the ancient and those who are strenuous in promoting the new constitution chap xiv in what manner the distribution of the three powers began to change after the expulsion of the kings there were four things that greatly prejudiced the liberty of rome the patricians had engrossed to themselves all public employments whatever an exorbitant power was annexed to the consulate the people were often insulted and in fine they had scarce any influence at all left in the public suffrages these four abuses were redressed by the people  st it was regulated that the plebeians might aspire to some magistracies and by degrees they were rendered capable of them all except that of interrex  d the consulate was dissolved into several other magistracies‡ prætors were created on whom the power was conferred of trying private causes quæstors were nominated for determining those of a criminal     nature ædiles were established for the civil administration treasurers∥ were made for the management of the public money and in fine by the creation of censors the consuls were divested of that part of the legislative power which regulates the morals of the citizens and the transient polity of the different bodies of the state the chief privileges left them were to preside in the great meetings† of the people to assemble the senate and to command the armies  d the sacred laws appointed tribunes who had a power of checking the encroachments of the patricians and prevented not only private but likewise public injuries in fine the plebeians increased their influence in the general assemblies the people of rome were divided in three different manners by centuries by curiæ and by tribes and whenever they gave their votes they were convened one of those three ways in the first the patricians the leading men the rich and the senate which was very near the same thing had almost the whole authority in the second they had less and less still in the third the division into centuries was a division rather of estates and fortunes than of persons the whole people were distributed into a hundred and ninetythree centuries‡ which had each a single vote the patricians and leading men composed the first ninetyeight centuries and the other ninetyfive consisted of the remainder of the citizens in this division therefore the patricians were masters of the suffrages     in the division into curiæ§ the patricians had not the same advantages some however they had for it was necessary to consult the augurs who were under the direction of the patricians and no proposal could be made there to the people unless it had been previously laid before the senate and approved of by a senatus consultum but in the division into tribes they had nothing to do either with the augurs or with the decrees of the senate and the patricians were excluded now the people endeavoured constantly to have those meetings by curiæ which had been customary by centuries and by tribes those they used to have before by curiæ by which means the direction of public affairs soon devolved from the patricians to the plebeians thus when the plebeians obtained the power of trying the patricians a power which commenced in the affair of coriolanus¶ they insisted upon assembling by tribes and not by centuries and when the new magistracies† of tribunes and ædiles were established in favour of the people the latter obtained that they should meet by curiæ in order to nominate them and after their power was quite settled they gained‡ so far their point as to assemble by tribes to proceed to this nomination     chap xv in what manner rome in the flourishing state of that republic suddenly lost its liberty in the heat of the contests between the patricians and plebeians the latter insisted upon having fixt laws to the end that the public judgements should no longer be the effects of capricious will or arbitrary power the senate after a great deal of resistance acquiesced and decemvirs were nominated to compose those laws it was thought proper to grant them an extraordinary power because they were to give laws to parties whose views and interests it was almost impossible to unite the nomination of all magistrates was suspended and the decemvirs were chosen in the comitia sole administrators of the republic thus they found themselves invested with the consular and with the tribunitian power by one they had the privilege of assembling the senate by the other that of convening the people but they assembled neither senate nor people ten men only of the republic had the whole legislative the whole executive and the whole judiciary power rome saw herself enslaved by as cruel a tyranny as that of tarquin when tarquin trampled on the liberty of that city she was seized with indignation at the power he had usurped when the decemvirs exercised every act of oppression she was astonished at the extraordinary power she had granted what a strange system of tyranny a tyranny carried on by men who had obtained the political and military power merely from their knowledge in civil affairs and who at that very juncture stood in need of the courage of those citizens to protect them abroad who so tamely submitted to domestic oppression     the spectacle of virginias death whom her father immolated to chastity and liberty put an end to the power of the decemvirs every man became free because every man had been injured each shewed himself a citizen because each had the tie of a parent the senate and the people resumed a liberty which had been committed to ridiculous tyrants no people were so easily moved with public spectacles as the romans that of the impurpled body of lucretia put an end to the regal government the debtor who appeared in the forum covered with wounds caused an alteration in the republic the decemvirs owed their expulsion to the tragedy of virginia to condemn manlius it was necessary to keep the people from seeing the capitol cæsars bloody garment flung rome again into slavery chap xvi of the legislative power in the roman republic there were no rights to contest under the decemvirs but upon the restoration of liberty jealousies revived and so long as the patricians had any privileges left they were sure to be stripped of them by the plebeians the mischief would not have been so great had the plebeians been satisfied with this success but they also injured the patricians as citizens when the people assembled by curiæ or centuries they were composed of senators patricians and plebeians in their disputes the plebeians gained this point∥ that they alone without patricians or senate should enact the laws called plebiscita and     the assemblies in which they were made had the name of comitia by tribes thus there were cases in which the patricians had no share in the legislative power but† were subject to the legislation of another body of the state this was the extravagance of liberty the people to establish a democracy acted against the very principles of that government one would have imagined that so exorbitant a power must have destroyed the authority of the senate but rome had admirable institutions two of these were especially remarkable one by which the legislative power of the people was established and the other by which it was limited the censors and before them the consuls‡ modelled and created as it were every five years the body of the people they exercised the legislation on the very part that was possessed of the legislative power tiberius gracchus says cicero caused the freemen to be admitted into the tribes not by the force of his eloquence but by a word by a gesture which had he not effected the republic whose drooping head we are at present scarce able to uphold would not even exist on the other hand the senate had the power of rescuing as it were the republic out of the hands of the people by creating a dictator before whom the sovereign bowed his head and the most popular laws were silent§     chap xvii of the executive power in the same republic jealous as the people were of their legislative power yet they had no great uneasiness about the executive this they left almost intirely to the senate and to the consuls reserving scarce any thing more to themselves than the right of choosing the magistrates and of confirming the acts of the senate and of the generals rome whose passion was to command whose ambition was to conquer whose commencement and progress were one continued usurpation had constantly affairs of the greatest weight upon her hands her enemies were ever conspiring against her or she against her enemies as she was obliged to behave on the one hand with heroic courage and on the other with consummate prudence it was requisite of course that the management of affairs should be committed to the senate thus the people disputed every branch of the legislative power with the senate because they were jealous of their liberty but they had no disputes about the executive because they were animated with the love of glory so great was the share the senate took in the executive power that as polybius† informs us foreign nations imagined that rome was an aristocracy the senate disposed of the public money and farmed out the revenue they were arbiters of the affairs of their allies they determined war or peace and directed in this respect the consuls they fixed the number of the roman and of the allied troops disposed of the provinces and armies to     the consuls or prætors and upon the expiration of the year of command had the power of appointing successors they decreed triumphs received and sent embassies they nominated rewarded punished and were judges of kings declared them allies of the roman people or stripped them of that title the consuls levied the troops which they were to carry into the field had the command of the forces by sea and land disposed of the forces of the allies were invested with the whole power of the republic in the provinces gave peace to the vanquished nations imposed conditions on them or referred them to the senate in the earliest times when the people had some share in the affairs relating to war or peace they exercised rather their legislative than their executive power they scarce did any thing else but confirm the acts of the kings and after their expulsion those of the consuls or senate so far were they from being the arbiters of war that we have instances of its having been often declared notwithstanding the opposition of the tribunes but growing wanton in their prosperity they increased their executive power thus they created the military tribunes the nomination of whom till then had belonged to the generals and some time before the first punic war they decreed that only their own body should have the right† of declaring war     chap xviii of the judiciary power in the roman government the judiciary power was given to the people to the senate to the magistrates and to particular judges we must see in what manner it was distributed beginning with their civil affairs the consuls had‡ the judiciary power after the expulsion of the kings as the prætors were judges after the consuls servius tullus had divested himself of the power of determining of civil causes which was not resumed by the consuls except in some very rare∥ cases for that reason called extraordinary§ they were satisfied with naming the judges and establishing the several tribunals by a discourse of appius claudius in dionysius¶ halicarnasseus it appears that so early as the    th year of rome this was looked upon as a settled custom among the romans and it is not tracing it very high to refer it to servius tullus every year the prætor made a list† of such as he chose for the office of judges during his magistracy a sufficient number was pitched upon for each cause a custom very near the same as that now practised in england and what was extremely favourable to liberty was the prætors fixing the judges with the∥   0 consent of the parties the great number of exceptions that can be made in england amounts pretty near to this very custom the judges decided only the questions relating to matter of fact for example whether a sum of money had been paid or not whether an act had been committed or not but as to questions of† law as these required a certain capacity they were always carried before the tribunal of the centumvirs§ the kings reserved to themselves the judgement of criminal affairs and in this were succeeded by the consuls it was in consequence of this authority that brutus put his children and all those who were concerned in the tarquinian conspiracy to death this was an exorbitant power the consuls already invested with the military command extended the exercise of it even to civil affairs and their procedures being stripped of all forms of justice were rather exertions of violence than legal judgements this gave rise to the valerian law by which it was made lawful to appeal to the people from every decision of the consuls that endangered the life of a citizen the consuls had no longer a power of pronouncing sentence in capital cases against a roman citizen without the consent of the people¶ we see in the first conspiracy for the restoration of the tarquins that the criminals were tried by brutus the consul in the second the senate and comitia were assembled to try them‡ the laws distinguished by the name of sacred allowed the plebeians the privilege of choosing tribunes     from whence was formed a body whose pretensions at first were immense it is hard to determine which was greater the insolence of the plebeians in demanding or the condescension of the senate in granting the valerian law allowed of appeals to the people that is to the people composed of senators patricians and plebeians the plebeians made a law that appeals should be brought before their own body a question was soon after started whether the plebeians had a right to try a patrician this was the subject of a dispute to which the impeachment of coriolanus gave rise and which ended with that affair when coriolanus was accused by the tribunes before the people he insisted contrary to the spirit of the valerian law that as he was a patrician none but the consuls had a power to try him on the other hand the plebeians also contrary to the spirit of that same law pretended that none but their body were empowered to be his judges and accordingly they pronounced sentence upon him this was moderated by the law of the twelve tables whereby it was ordained that none but the great assemblies of the people† should try a citizen in capital cases hence the body of the plebeians or which amounts to the very same the comitia by tribes had no longer any power of hearing criminal causes except such as were punished with fines to inflict a capital punishment a law was requisite but to condemn to a pecuniary mulct there was occasion only for a plebiscitum this regulation of the law of the twelve tables was extremely prudent it produced an admirable balance between the body of the plebeians and the     senate for as the full judiciary power of both depended on the greatness of the punishment and the nature of the crime it was necessary they should both agree the valerian law abolished all the remains of the roman government any way relative to that of the kings of the heroic times of greece the consuls were divested of the power to punish crimes though all crimes are public yet we must distinguish between those which more nearly concern the mutual intercourse of citizens and those which more immediately interest the state in the relation it bears to its subjects the first are called private the second public the latter were tried by the people and in regard to the former they named by particular commission a quæstor for the prosecution of each crime the person chosen by the people was frequently one of the magistrates sometimes a private man he was called the quæstor of parricide and is mentioned in the law of the twelve tables‡ the quæstor nominated the judge of the question who drew lots for the judges and regulated the tribunal in which he presided∥ here it is proper to observe what share the senate had in the nomination of the quæstor that we may see how far the two powers were balanced sometimes the senate caused a dictator to be chosen in order to exercise the office of quæstor§ at other times they ordained that the people should be convened by a tribune with a view of proceeding to     the nomination of a quæstor¶ and in fine the people frequently appointed a magistrate to make his report to the senate concerning a particular crime and to desire them to name a quæstor as may be seen in the judgement upon lucius scipio in livy† in the year of rome  0  some of these commissions were rendered permanent‡ all criminal causes were gradually divided into different parts to which they gave the name of perpetual questions different prætors were created to each of whom some of those questions were assigned they had a power conferred upon them for the term of a year of trying such criminal causes as were any way relative to those questions and then they were sent to govern their province at carthage the senate of the hundred was composed of judges who enjoyed that dignity for life∥ but at rome the prætors were annual and the judges were not even for so long a term but were nominated for each cause we have already shewn in the sixth chapter of this book how favourable this regulation was to liberty in particular governments the judges were chosen from the order of senators till the time of the gracchi tiberius gracchus caused a law to pass that they should be taken from the equestrian order a change so very considerable that the tribune boasted of having cut by one rogation only the sinews of the senatorian dignity     it is necessary to observe that the three powers may be very well distributed in regard to the liberty of the constitution though not so well in respect to the liberty of the subject at rome the people had the greatest share of the legislative a part of the executive and part of the judiciary power by which means they had so great a weight in the government as required some other power to balance it the senate indeed had part of the executive power and some share of the legislative§ but this was not sufficient to counterbalance the weight of the people it was necessary that they should partake of the judiciary power and accordingly they had a share when the judges were chosen from among the senators but when the gracchi deprived the senators of the judicial power¶ the senate were no longer able to withstand the people to favour therefore the liberty of the subject they struck at that of the constitution but the former perished with the latter infinite were the mischiefs that from thence arose the constitution was changed at a time when the fire of civil discord had scarce left any such thing as a constitution the knights ceased to be that middle order which united the people to the senate and the chain of the constitution was broke there were even particular reasons against transferring the judiciary power to the equestrian order the constitution of rome was founded on this principle that none should be inlisted as soldiers but such as were men of sufficient property to answer for their conduct to the republic the knights as persons of the greatest property formed the cavalry     of the legions but when their dignity increased they refused to serve any longer in that capacity and another kind of cavalry was obliged to be raised thus marius inlisted all sorts of people into his army and soon after the republic was lost besides the knights were the farmers of the revenue men whose great rapaciousness increased the public calamities instead of giving to such as those the judicial power they ought to have been constantly under the eye of the judges this we must say in commendation of the ancient french laws that they have acted towards the officers of the revenue with as great a diffidence as would be observed between enemies when the judiciary power at rome was transferred to the publicans there was then an end of all virtue polity laws and government of this we find a very ingenuous description in some fragments of diodorus siculus and dio mutius scevola says diodorus† wanted to revive the ancient manners and the laudable custom of sober and frugal living for his predecessors having entered into a contract with the farmers of the revenue who at that time were possessed of the judiciary power at rome had infected the province with all manner of corruption but scevola made an example of the publicans and imprisoned those by whom others had been confined dio informs us‡ that publius rutilius his lieutenant was equally obnoxious to the equestrian order and that upon his return they accused him of having received some presents and condemned him     to a fine upon which he instantly made a cession of his goods his innocence appeared in this that he was found to be worth a great deal less than what he was charged with having extorted and he shewed a just title to what he possessed but he would not live any longer in the same city with such profligate wretches ∥the italians says diodorus again bought up whole droves of slaves in sicily to till their lands and to take care of their cattle but refused them a necessary subsistence these wretches were then forced to go and rob on the highways armed with lances and clubs covered with beasts skins and followed by large mastiffs thus the whole province was laid waste and the inhabitants could not call any thing their own but what was secured by fortresses there was neither proconsul nor prætor that could or would oppose this disorder or that presumed to punish these slaves because they belonged to the knights who at rome were possessed of the judiciary power§ and yet this was one of the causes of the war of the slaves but i shall add only one word more a profession deaf and inexorable that can have no other view than lucre that was always asking and never granting that impoverished the rich and increased even the misery of the poor such a profession i say should never have been intrusted with the judiciary power at rome     chap xix of the government of the roman provinces such was the distribution of the three powers in rome but they were far from being thus distributed in the provinces liberty prevailed in the center and tyranny in the extreme parts while rome extended her dominions no farther than italy the people were governed as confederates and the laws of each republic were preserved but when she enlarged her conquests and the senate had no longer an immediate inspection over the provinces nor the magistrates residing at rome were any longer capable of governing the empire they were obliged to send prætors and proconsuls then it was that the harmony of the three powers was lost the persons appointed to that office were intrusted with a power which comprehended that of all the roman magistracies nay even that of the people¶ they were despotic magistrates extremely well adapted to the distance of the places to which they were destined they exercised the three powers and were if i may presume to use the expression the bashaws of the republic we have elsewhere observed that in a commonwealth the same magistrate ought to be possessed of the executive power as well civil as military hence a conquering republic can hardly communicate her government and rule the conquered state according to her own constitution and indeed as the magistrate she sends to govern is invested with the executive power both civil and military he must also have the legislative for who is it that could make laws without him it is necessary therefore that     the governor she sends be intrusted with the three powers as was practised in the roman provinces it is more easy for a monarchy to communicate its government because the officers it sends have some the civil and others the military executive power which does not necessarily imply a despotic authority it was a privilege of the utmost consequence to a roman citizen to have none but the people for his judges were it not for this he would have been subject in the provinces to the arbitrary power of a proconsul or of a proprætor the city never felt the tyranny which was exercised only on conquered nations thus in the roman world as at sparta the freemen enjoyed the highest degree of liberty while those who were slaves laboured under the extremity of servitude while the citizens paid taxes they were raised with great justice and equality the regulation of servius tullus was observed who had distributed the people into six classes according to their difference of property and fixed the several shares of the public imposts in proportion to that which each person had in the government hence they bore with the greatness of the tax because of their proportionable greatness of credit and consoled themselves for the smallness of their credit because of the smallness of the tax there was also another thing worthy of admiration which is that as servius tulluss division into classes was in some measure the fundamental principle of the constitution it thence followed that an equal levying of the taxes was so connected with this fundamental principle that the one could not be abolished without the other     but while the city paid the taxes as she pleased or paid none at all the provinces were plundered by the knights who were the farmers of the public revenue we have already made mention of their oppressive extortions with which all history abounds all asia says mithridates† expects me as her deliverer so great is the hatred which the rapaciousness of the proconsuls‡ the consiscations made by the officers of the revenue and the quirks and cavils of judicial proceedings∥ have excited against the romans hence it was that the strength of the provinces did not increase but rather weakened the strength of the republic hence it was that the provinces looked upon the loss of the liberty of rome as the epocha of their own freedom chap xx the end of this book i should be glad to inquire into the distribution of the three powers in all the moderate governments we are acquainted with in order to calculate the degrees of liberty which each may enjoy but we must not always exhaust a subject so as to leave no work at all for the reader my business is not to make people read but to make them think   0 book xii of the laws that form political liberty as relative to the subject chap i idea of this book it is not sufficient to have treated of political liberty as relative to the constitution we must examine it likewise in the relation it bears to the subject we have observed that in the former case it arises from a certain distribution of the three powers but in the latter we must consider it in another light it consists in security or in the opinion people have of their security the constitution may happen to be free and the subject not the subject may be free and not the constitution in those cases the constitution will be free by right and not in fact the subject will be free in fact and not by right it is the disposition only of the laws and even of the fundamental laws that constitutes liberty in relation to the constitution but as it regards the subject manners customs or received examples may give rise to it and particular civil laws may encourage it as we shall presently observe farther as in most states liberty is more checked or depressed than their constitution requires it is proper to treat of the particular laws that in each constitution are apt to assist or check the principle of liberty which each state is capable of receiving     chap ii of the liberty of the subject philosophical liberty consists in the free exercise of the will or at least if we must speak agreeably to all systems in an opinion that we have the free exercise of our will political liberty consists in security or at least in the opinion that we enjoy security this security is never more dangerously attacked than in public or private accusations it is therefore on the goodness of criminal laws that the liberty of the subject principally depends criminal laws did not receive their full perfection all at once even in places where liberty has been most sought after it has not been always found aristotle informs us that at cumæ the parents of the accuser might be witnesses so imperfect was the law under the kings of rome that servius tullus pronounced sentence against the children of ancus martius who were charged with having assassinated the king his fatherinlaw† under the first kings of france clotarius made a law‡ that nobody should be condemned without being heard which shews that a contrary custom had prevailed in some particular case or among some barbarous people it was charondas that first established penalties against false witnesses∥ when the subject has no fence to secure his innocence he has none for his liberty the knowledge already acquired in some countries or that may be hereafter attained in others     concerning the surest rules to be observed in criminal judgements is more interesting to mankind than any other thing in the world liberty can be founded on the practice of this knowledge only and supposing a state to have the best laws imaginable in this respect a person tried under that state and condemned to be hanged the next day would have much more liberty than a bashaw enjoys in turkey chap iii the same subject continued those laws which condemn a man to death on the deposition of a single witness are fatal to liberty in right reason there should be two because a witness who affirms and the accused who denies make an equal balance and a third must incline the scale the greeks§ and romans¶ required one voice more to condemn but our french laws insist upon two the greeks pretend that their custom was established by the gods but this more justly may be said of ours chap iv that liberty is favoured by the nature and proportion of punishments liberty is in its highest perfection when criminal laws derive each punishment from the particular nature of the crime there are then no arbitrary decisions the punishment does not flow from the capriciousness of the legislator but from the     very nature of the thing and man uses no violence to man there are four sorts of crimes those of the first species are prejudicial to religion the second to morals the third to the public tranquility and the fourth to the security of the subject the punishments inflicted for these crimes ought to proceed from the nature of each of these species in the class of crimes that concern religion i rank only those which attack it directly such as all simple sacrileges for as to crimes that disturb the exercise of it they are of the nature of those which prejudice the tranquility or security of the subject and ought to be referred to those classes in order to derive the punishment of simple sacrileges from the nature of the thing† it should consist in depriving people of the advantages conferred by religion in expelling them out of the temples in a temporary or perpetual exclusion from the society of the faithful in shunning their presence in execrations comminations and conjurations in things that prejudice the tranquility or security of the state secret actions are subject to human jurisdiction but in those which offend the deity where there is no public act there can be no criminal matter the whole passes betwixt man and god who knows the measure and time of his vengeance now if magistrates confounding things should inquire also into hidden sacrileges this inquisition would be directed to a kind of action that does not at all require it the liberty of the subject would be subverted by arming the zeal of timorous as well as of presumptuous consciences against him     the mischief arises from a notion which some people have entertained of revenging the cause of the deity but we must honour the deity and leave him to avenge his own cause and indeed were we to be directed by such a notion where would be the end of punishments if human laws are to avenge the cause of an infinite being they will be directed by his infinity and not by the weakness ignorance and caprice of man an historian‡ of provence relates a fact which furnishes us with an excellent description of the consequences that may arise in weak capacities from the notion of avenging the deitys cause a jew was accused of having blasphemed against the virgin mary and upon conviction was condemned to be flead alive a strange spectacle was then exhibited gentlemen masked with knives in their hands mounted the scaffold and drove away the executioner in order to be the avengers themselves of the honour of the blessed virgin — i do not here choose to anticipate the reflections of the reader the second class consists of those crimes which are prejudicial to morals such is the violation of public or private continence that is of the police directing the manner in which the pleasure annexed to the conjunction of the sexes is to be enjoyed the punishment of those crimes ought to be also derived from the nature of the thing the privation of such advantages as society has attached to the purity of morals fines shame necessity of concealment public infamy expulsion from home and society and in fine all such punishments as belong to a corrective jurisdiction are sufficient to repress the temerity of the two sexes in effect these things are     less founded on malice than on carelessness and selfneglect we speak here of none but crimes which relate merely to morals for as to those that are also prejudicial to the public security such as rapes they belong to the fourth species the crimes of the third class are those which disturb the public tranquility the punishments ought therefore to be derived from the nature of the thing and to be relative to this tranquility such as imprisonment exile and other like chastisements proper for reclaiming turbulent spirits and obliging them to conform to the established order i confine those crimes that injure the public tranquility to things which imply a bare offence against the police for as to those which by disturbing the public peace attack at the same time the security of the subject they ought to be ranked in the fourth class the punishments inflicted upon the latter crimes are such as are properly distinguished by that name they are a kind of retaliation by which the society refules security to a member who has actually or intentionally deprived another of his security these punishments are derived from the nature of the thing founded on reason and drawn from the very source of good and evil a man deserves death when he has violated the security of the subject so far as to deprive or attempt to deprive another man of his life this punishment of death is the remedy as it were of a sick society when there is a breach of security with regard to property there may be some reasons for inflicting a capital punishment but it would be much better and perhaps more natural that crimes committed against the security of property should be punished with the loss     of property and this ought indeed to be the case if mens fortunes were common or equal but as those who have no property of their own are generally the readiest to attack that of others it has been found necessary instead of a pecuniary to substitute a corporal punishment all that i have here advanced is founded in nature and extremely favourable to the liberty of the subject chap v of certain accusations that require particular moderation and prudence it is an important maxim that we ought to be very circumspect in the prosecution of witchcraft and heresy the accusation of these two crimes may be vastly injurious to liberty and productive of infinite oppression if the legislator knows not how to set bounds to it for as it does not directly point at a persons actions but at his character it grows dangerous in proportion to the ignorance of the people and then a man is sure to be always in danger because the most unexceptionable conduct the purest morals and the constant practice of every duty in life are not a sufficient security against the suspicion of his being guilty of the like crimes under manuel comnenus the protestator was accused of having conspired against the emperor and of having employed for that purpose some secrets that render men invisible it is mentioned in the life of this emperor† that aaron was detected as he was poring over a book of solomons the     reading of which was sufficient to conjure up whole legions of devils now by supposing a power in witchcraft to rouse the infernal spirits to arms people look upon a man whom they call a sorcerer as the person in the world most likely to disturb and subvert society and of course they are disposed to punish him with the utmost severity but their indignation increases when witchcraft is supposed to have a power of subverting religion the history of constantinople informs us that in consequence of a revelation made to a bishop of a miracles having ceased because of the magic practices of a certain person both that person and his son were put to death on how many surprizing things did not this single crime depend — that revelations should not be uncommon that the bishop should be favoured with one that it was real that there had been a miracle in the case that this miracle had ceased that there was an art magic that magic could subvert religion that this particular person was a magician and in fine that he had committed that magic act the emperor theodorus lascaris attributed his illness to witchcraft those who were accused of this crime had no other resource left than to handle a red hot iron without being hurt thus among the greeks a person ought to have been a sorcerer to be able to clear himself of the imputation of witchcraft such was the excess of their stupidity that to the most dubious crime in the world they joined the most dubious proofs of innocence under the reign of philip the long the jews were expelled from france being accused of having poisoned the springs with their lepers so absurd an     accusation ought to make us doubt of all those that are founded on public hatred i have not here asserted that heresy ought not to be punished i said only that we ought to be extremely circumspect in punishing it chap vi of the crime against nature god forbid that i should have the least inclination to diminish the public horror against a crime which religion morality and civil government equally condemn it ought to be proscribed were it only for its communicating to one sex the weaknesses of the other and for leading people by a scandalous prostitution of their youth to an ignominious old age what i shall say concerning it will no ways diminish its infamy being levelled only against the tyranny that may abuse the very horror we ought to have against the vice as a natural circumstance of this crime is secrecy there are frequent instances of its having been punished by legislators upon the deposition of a child this was opening a very wide door to calumny justinian says procopius published a law against this crime he ordered an inquiry to be made not only against those who were guilty of it after the enacting of that law but even before the deposition of a single witness sometimes of a child sometimes of a slave was sufficient especially against such as were rich and against those of the green faction it is very odd that these three crimes witchcraft heresy and that against nature of which the first might easily be proved not to exist the second to     be susceptible of an infinite number of distinctions interpretations and limitations the third to be often obscure and uncertain it is very odd i say that these three crimes should amongst us be punished with fire i may venture to affirm that the crime against nature will never make any great progress in society unless people are prompted to it by some particular custom as among the greeks where the youths of that country performed all their exercises naked as amongst us where domestic education is disused as among the asiatics where particular persons have a great number of women whom they despise while others can have none at all let there be no customs preparatory to this crime let it like every other violation of morals be severely proscribed by the civil magistrate and nature will soon defend or resume her rights nature that fond that indulgent parent has strewed her pleasures with a bounteous hand and while she fills us with delights she prepares us by means of our issue in whom we see ourselves as it were reproduced she prepares us i say for future satisfactions of a more exquisite kind than those very delights chap vii of the crime of hightreason it is determined by the laws of china that whosoever shews any disrespect to the emperor is to be punished with death as they do not mention in what this disrespect consists every thing may furnish a pretext to take away a mans life and to exterminate any family whatsoever two persons of that country who were employed to write the courtgazette having inserted some circumstances   0 relating to a certain fact that were not true it was pretended that to tell a lie in the courtgazette was a disrespect shewn to the court in consequence of which they were put to death a prince of the blood having inadvertently made some mark on a memorial signed with the red pencil by the emperor it was determined that he had behaved disrespectfully to the sovereign which occasioned one of the most terrible persecutions against that family that ever was recorded in history† if the crime of hightreason be indeterminate this alone is sufficient to make the government degenerate into arbitrary power i shall descant more largely on this subject when i come to treat‡ of the composition of laws chap viii of the bad application of the name of sacrilege and hightreason it is likewise a shocking abuse to give the appellation of hightreason to an action that does not deserve it by an imperial law§ it was decreed that those who called in question the princes judgement or doubted of the merit of such as he had chosen for a public office should be prosecuted as guilty of sacrilege∥ surely it was the cabinetcouncil and the princes favourites who invented that crime by another law it was determined that whosoever made any attempt to injure the ministers and officers belonging to the sovereign should be deemed     guilty of hightreason as if he had attempted to injure the sovereign himself¶ this law is owing to two princes remarkable for their weakness princes who were led by their ministers as flocks by shepherds princes who were slaves in the palace children in the council strangers to the army princes in fine who preserved their authority only by giving it away every day some of those favourites conspired against their sovereigns nay they did more they conspired against the empire they called in barbarous nations and when the emperors wanted to stop their progress the state was so enfeebled as to be under a necessity of infringing the law and of exposing itself to the crime of hightreason in order to punish those favourites and yet this is the very law which the judge of monsieur de cinqmars built upon† when endeavouring to prove that the latter was guilty of the crime of hightreason for attempting to remove cardinal richelieu from the ministry he says crimes that aim at the persons of ministers are deemed by the imperial constitutions of equal consequence with those which are levelled against the emperors own person a minister discharges his duty to his prince and to his country to attempt therefore to remove him is endeavouring to deprive the former one of his arms‡ and the latter of part of its power it is impossible for the meanest tools of power to express themselves in more servile language by another law of valentinian theodosius and arcadius§ false coiners are declared guilty of hightreason     but is not this confounding the ideas of things is not the very horror of hightreason diminished by giving that name to another crime chap ix the same subject continued paulinus having written to the emperor alexander that he was preparing to prosecute for hightreason a judge who had decided contrary to his edict the emperor answered that under his reign there was no such thing as indirect hightreason faustinian wrote to the same emperor that as he had sworn by the princes life never to pardon his slave he found himself thereby obliged to perpetuate his wrath lest he should incur the guilt of læsa majestas upon which the emperor made answer your fears are groundless† and you are a stranger to my principles it was determined by a senatusconsultum‡ that whosoever melted down any of the emperors statues which happened to be rejected should not be deemed guilty of hightreason the emperors severus and antoninus wrote to pontius§ that those who sold unconsecrated statues of the emperor should not be charged with hightreason the same princes wrote to julius cassianus that if a person in flinging a stone should by chance strike one of the emperors statues he should not be liable to a prosecution for hightreason∥ the julian law requires this sort of limitations for in virtue     of this law the crime of hightreason was charged not only upon those who melted down the emperors statues but likewise on those who committed any such like action which made it an arbitrary crime when a number of crimes of læsa majestas had been established they were obliged to distinguish the several sorts hence ulpian the civilian after saying that the accusation of læsa majestas did not die with the criminal adds that this does not relate to† all the treasonable acts established by the julian law but only to that which implies an attempt against the empire or against the emperors life chap x the same subject continued there was a law passed in england under henry viii by which whoever predicted the kings death was declared guilty of hightreason this law was extremely vague the terror of despotic power is so great that it recoils upon those who exercise it in this kings last illness the physicians would not venture to say he was in danger and surely they acted very right‡ chap xi of thoughts marsyas dreamt that he had cut dionysiuss throat§ dionysius put him to death pretending that he would never have dreamt of such a thing by night if he had not thought of it by day this was     a most tyrannical action for though it had been the subject of his thoughts yet he had made no attempt∥ towards it the laws do not take upon them to punish any other than overt acts chap xii of indiscreet speeches nothing renders the crime of hightreason more arbitrary than declaring people guilty of it for indiscreet speeches speech is so subject to interpretation there is so great a difference between indiscretion and malice and frequently so little is there of the latter in the freedom of expression that the law can hardly subject people to a capital punishment for words unless it expressly declares what words they are words do not constitute an overt act they remain only in idea when considered by themselves they have generally no determinate signification for this depends on the tone in which they are uttered it often happens that in repeating the same words they have not the same meaning this depends on their connection with other things and sometimes more is signified by silence than by any expression whatever since there can be nothing so equivocal and ambiguous as all this how is it possible to convert it into a crime of hightreason wherever this law is established there is an end not only of liberty but even of its very shadow in the manifesto of the late czarina against the family of the dolgoruckys† one of these princes is condemned to death for having uttered some indecent     words concerning her person another for having maliciously interpreted her imperial laws and for having offended her sacred person by disrespectful expressions not that i pretend to diminish the just indignation of the public against those who presume to stain the glory of their sovereign what i mean is that if despotic princes are willing to moderate their power a milder chastisement would be more proper on those occasions than the charge of hightreason a thing always terrible even to innocence itself‡ overt acts do not happen every day they are exposed to the eye of the public and a false charge with regard to matters of fact may be easily detected words carried into action assume the nature of that action thus a man who goes into a public marketplace to incite the subject to revolt incurs the guilt of hightreason because the words are joined to the action and partake of its nature it is not the words that are punished but an action in which words are employed they do not become criminal but when they are annexed to a criminal action every thing is confounded if words are construed into a capital crime instead of considering them only as a mark of that crime the emperors theodosius arcadius and honorius wrote thus to rufinus who was præfectus prætorio though a man should happen to speak amiss of our person or government we do not intend to punish him§ if he has spoken through levity we must despise him if through folly we must pity him and if he wrongs us we must forgive him therefore leaving things as     they are you are to inform us accordingly that we may be able to judge of words by persons and that we may duly consider whether we ought to punish or overlook them chap xiii of writings in writings there is something more permanent than in words but when they are no way preparative to hightreason they cannot amount to that charge and yet augustus and tiberius subjected satyrical writers to the same punishment as for having violated the law of majesty augustus∥ because of some libels that had been written against persons of the first quality tiberius because of those which he suspected to have been written against himself nothing was more fatal to roman liberty cremutius cordus was accused of having called cassius in his annals the last of the romans¶ satyrical writings are hardly known in despotic governments where dejection of mind on the one hand and ignorance on the other afford neither abilities nor will to write in democracies they are not hindered for the very same reason which causes them to be prohibited in monarchies being generally levelled against men of power and authority they flatter the malignancy of the people who are the governing party in monarchies they are forbidden but rather as a subject of civil animadversion than as a capital crime they may amuse the general malevolence please the malcontents diminish the envy against public employments give the     people patience to suffer and make them laugh at their sufferings but no government is so averse to satyrical writings as the aristocratical there the magistrates are petty sovereigns but not great enough to despise affronts if in a monarchy a satyrical stroke is designed against the prince he is placed on such an eminence that it does not reach him but an aristocratical lord is pierced to the very heart hence the decemvirs who formed an aristocracy punished satyrical writings with death chap xiv breach of modesty in punishing crimes there are rules of modesty observed by almost every nation in the world now it would be very absurd to infringe these rules in the punishment of crimes the principal view of which ought always to be the establishment of order was it the intent of those oriental nations who exposed women to elephants trained up for an abominable kind of punishment was it i say their intent to establish one law by the breach of another by an ancient custom of the romans it was not permitted to put girls to death till they were ripe for marriage tiberius found out an expedient of having them debauched by the executioner before they were brought to the place of punishment† that bloody and subtle tyrant destroyed the morals of the people to preserve their customs when the magistrates of japan caused women to be exposed naked in the marketplaces and obliged     them to go upon all four like beasts modesty was shocked‡ but when they wanted to compel a mother  when they wanted to force a son  i cannot proceed even nature herself is struck with horror chap xv of the infranchisement of slaves in order to accuse their master augustus made a law that the slaves of those who conspired against his person should be sold to the public that they might depose against their master§ nothing ought to be neglected which may contribute to the discovery of a heinous crime it is natural therefore that in a government where there are slaves they should be allowed to inform but they ought not to be admitted as witnesses vindex discovered the conspiracy that had been formed in favour of tarquin but he was not admitted a witness against the children of brutus it was right to give liberty to a person who had rendered so great a service to his country but it was not given him with a view of enabling him to render this service hence the emperor tacitus ordained that slaves should not be admitted as witnesses against their masters even in the case of hightreason∥ a law which was not inserted in justinians compilement chap xvi of calumny with regard to the crime of hightreason to do justice to the cæsars they were not the first devisers of the horrid laws which they enacted     it is sylla that taught them that calumniators ought not to be punished but the abuse was soon carried to such excess as to reward them† chap xvii of the revealing of conspiracies if thy brother the son of thy mother or thy son or thy daughter or the wife of thy bosom or thy friend which is as thine own soul entice thee secretly saying let us go and serve other gods thou shalt surely kill him thou shalt stone him‡ this law of deuteronomy cannot be a civil law among most of the nations known to us because it would pave the way for all manner of wickedness no less severe is the law of several countries which commands the subjects on pain of death to disclose conspiracies in which they are not even so much as concerned when such a law is established in a monarchical government it is very proper it should be under some restrictions it ought not to be applied in its full severity but to the strongest cases of hightreason in those countries it is of the utmost importance not to confound the different degrees of this crime in japan where the laws subvert every idea of human reason the crime of concealment is applied even to the most ordinary cases a certain relation§ makes mention of two young ladies who were shut up for life in a box thick set   0 with pointed nails one for having had a love intrigue and the other for not disclosing it chap xviii how dangerous it is in republics to be too severe in punishing the crime of hightreason as soon as a republic has compassed the destruction of those who wanted to subvert it there should be an end of terrors punishments and even of rewards great punishments and consequently great changes cannot take place without investing some citizens with an exorbitant power it is therefore more adviseable in this case to exceed in lenity than in severity to banish but few rather than many and to leave them their estates instead of making a vast number of confiscations under pretence of avenging the republics cause the avengers would establish tyranny the business is not to destroy the rebel but the rebellion they ought to return as quick as possible into the usual track of government in which every one is protected by the laws and no one injured the greeks set no bounds to the vengeance they took of tyrants or of those they suspected of tyranny they put their children to death∥ nay sometimes five of their nearest relations and they proscribed an infinite number of families by such means their republics suffered the most violent shocks exiles or the return of the exiled were always epochas that indicated a change of the constitution     the romans had more sense when cassius was put to death for having aimed at tyranny the question was proposed whether his children should undergo the same fate but they were preserved they says dionysius halicarnasseus¶ who wanted to change this law at the end of the marsian and civil laws and to exclude from public offices the children of those who had been proscribed by sylla are very much to blame we find in the wars of marius and sylla to what excess the romans had gradually carried their barbarity such scenes of cruelty it was hoped would never be revived but under the triumvirs they committed greater acts of oppression though with some appearance of lenity and it is provoking to see what sophisms they make use of to cover their inhumanity appian has given us§ the formula of the proscriptions one would imagine they had no other aim than the good of the republic with such calmness do they express themselves such advantages do they point out to the state such expediency do they shew in the means they adopt such security do they promise to the opulent such tranquility to the poor so apprehensive do they seem of endangering the lives of the citizens so desirous of appeasing the soldiers such felicity in fine do they presage to the commonwealth rome was drenched in blood when lepidus triumphed over spain yet by an unparallelled absurdity he ordered public rejoicings in that city upon pain of proscription†     chap xix in what manner the use of liberty is suspended in a republic in countries where liberty is most esteemed there are laws by which a single person is deprived of it in order to preserve it for the whole community such are in england what they call bills of attainder§ these are relative to those athenian laws by which a private person was condemned provided they were made by the unanimous suffrage of six thousand citizens they are relative also to those laws which were made at rome against private citizens and were called privileges† these were never passed but in the great meetings of the people but in what manner soever they were enacted cicero was for having them abolished because the force of a law consists in its being made for the whole community‡ i must own notwithstanding that the practice of the freest nation that ever existed induces me to think that there are cases in which a veil should be drawn for a while over liberty as it was customary to cover the statues of the gods     chap xx of laws favourable to the liberty of the subject in a republic in popular governments it often happens that accusations are carried on in public and every man is allowed to accuse whomsoever he pleases this rendered it necessary to establish proper laws in order to protect the innocence of the subject at athens if an accuser had not the fifth part of the votes on his side he was obliged to pay a fine of a thousand drachms æschines who accused ctesiphon was condemned to pay this fine§ at rome a false accuser was branded with infamy by marking the letter k on his forehead guards were also appointed to watch the accuser in order to prevent his corrupting either the judges or the witnesses† i have already taken notice of that athenian and roman law by which the party accused was allowed to withdraw before judgement was pronounced chap xxi of the cruelty of laws in respect to debtors in a republic great is the superiority which one fellowsubject has already over another by lending him money which the latter borrows in order to spend and of course has no longer in his possession what must be the consequence if the laws of a republic     make a farther addition to this servitude and subjection at athens and rome it was first permitted to sell such debtors as were insolvent solon redressed this abuse at athens† by ordaining that no mans body should answer for his civil debts but the decemvirs‡ did not reform the same custom at rome and though they had solons regulation before their eyes yet they did not choose to follow it this is not the only passage of the law of the twelve tables in which the decemvirs shew their design of checking the spirit of democracy often did those cruel laws against debtors throw the roman republic into danger a man all covered with wounds made his escape from his creditors house and appeared in the forum§ the people were moved with this spectacle and other citizens whom their creditors durst no longer confine broke loose from their dungeons they had promises made them which were all broke the people upon this having withdrawn to the sacred mount obtained not an abrogation of those laws but a magistrate to defend them thus they quitted a state of anarchy but were scon in danger of falling under tyranny manlius to render himself popular was going to set those citizens at liberty who by their inhuman creditors∥ had been reduced to slavery manliuss designs were prevented but without remedying the evil particular laws facilitated to debtors the means of paying¶ and in     the year of rome     the consuls proposed a law which deprived creditors of the power of confining their debtors in their own houses† an usurer by name papirius attempted to corrupt the chastity of a young man named publius whom he kept in irons sextuss crime gave to rome its political liberty that of papirius gave it also the civil such was the fate of this city that new crimes confirmed the liberty which those of a more ancient date had procured it appiuss attempt upon virginia flung the people again into that horror against tyrants with which the misfortune of lucretia had first inspired them thirtyseven years after∥ the crime of the infamous papirius an action of the like criminal nature‡ was the cause of the peoples retiring to the janiculum§ and of giving new vigour to the law made for the safety of debtors since that time creditors were oftener prosecuted by debtors for having violated the laws against usury than the latter were sued for refusing to pay them chap xxii of things that strike at liberty in monarchies liberty often has been weakened in monarchies by a thing of the least use in the world to     the prince this is the naming of commissioners to try a private person the prince himself derives so very little advantage from those commissioners that it is not worth while to change for their sake the common course of things he is morally sure that he has more of the spirit of probity and justice than his commissioners who think themselves sufficiently justified by his nomination and orders by a vague interest of state and even by their very apprehensions upon the arraigning of a peer under henry viii it was customary to try him by a committee of the house of lords by which means he put to death as many peers as he pleased chap xxiii of spies in monarchies should i be asked whether there is any necessity for spies in monarchies my answer would be that the usual practice of good princes is not to employ them when a man obeys the laws he has discharged his duty to his prince he ought at least to have his own house for an asylum and the rest of his conduct should be exempt from inquiry the trade of a spy might perhaps be tolerable were it practised by honest men but the necessary infamy of the person is sufficient to make us judge of the infamy of the thing a prince ought to act towards his subjects with candour frankness and confidence he that has so much disquiet suspicion and fear is an actor embarrassed in playing his part when he finds that the laws are generally observed and respected he may judge himself safe the behaviour of the public answers for that of every individual let him not be afraid he     cannot imagine how natural it is for his people to love him and how should they do otherwise than love him since he is the source of almost all bounties and favours punishments being generally charged to the account of the laws he never shews himself to his people but with a serene countenance they have even a share of his glory and they are protected by his power a proof of his being beloved is that his subjects have a confidence in him what the minister refuses they imagine the prince would have granted even under public calamities they do not accuse his person they are apt to complain of his being misinformed or beset by corrupt men did the prince but know say the people these words are a kind of invocation and a proof of the confidence they have in his person chap xxiv of anonymous letters the tartars are obliged to put their names to their arrows that the arm may be known which shoots them when philip of macedon was wounded at the siege of a certain town these words were found on the javelin after has given this mortal wound to philip if they who accuse a person did it merely to serve the public they would not carry their complaint to the prince who may be easily prejudiced but to the magistrates who have rules that are formidable only to calumniators but if they are unwilling to leave the laws open between them and the accused it is a presumption they have reason to be afraid of them and the least punishment they ought to suffer is not to be credited     no notice therefore should ever be taken of those letters except in cases that admit not of the delays of the ordinary course of justice and in which the princes welfare is concerned then it may be imagined that the accuser has made an effort which has untied his tongue but in other cases one ought to say with the emperor constantius we cannot suspect a person who has wanted an accuser whilst he did not want an enemy† chap xxv of the manner of governing in monarchies the royal authority is a spring that ought to move with the greatest freedom and ease the chinese boast of one of their emperors who governed they say like the heavens that is by his example there are some cases in which a sovereign ought to exert the full extent of his power and others in which he should reduce it within narrower limits the sublimity of administration consists in knowing the proper degree of power which should be exerted on different occasions the whole felicity of monarchies consists in the opinion which the subjects entertain of the lenity of the government a weak minister is ever ready to remind us of our slavery but granting even that we are slaves he should endeavour to conceal our misery from us all he can say or write is that the prince is uneasy that he is surprised and that he will redress all grievances there is a certain ease in commanding the prince ought only to encourage and let the laws menace     chap xxvi that in a monarchy the prince ought to be of easy access the utility of this maxim will appear from the inconveniency attending the contrary practice the czar peter i says the sieur perry‡ has published a new edict by which he forbids any of his subjects to offer him a petition till after having presented it to two of his officers in case of refusal of justice they may present him a third but upon pain of death if they are in the wrong after this no one ever presumed to offer a petition to the czar chap xxvii of the manners of a monarch the manners of a prince contribute as much as the laws themselves to liberty like these he may transfer men into brutes and brutes into men if he prefers free and generous spirits he will have subjects if he likes base dastardly souls he will have slaves would he know the great art of ruling let him call honour and virtue to attend his person and let him encourage personal merit he may even sometimes cast an eye on talents and abilities let him not be afraid of those rivals who are called men of merit he is their equal when once he loves them let him gain the hearts of his people without subduing their spirits let him render himself popular he ought to be pleased with the affections of the lowest of his subjects for they too are men the common people require so very   0 little condescension that it is fit they should be humoured the infinite distance between the sovereign and them will surely prevent them from giving him any uneasiness let him be exorable to supplication and resolute against demands let him be sensible in fine that his people have his refusals while his courtiers enjoy his favours chap xxviii of the regard which monarchs owe to their subjects princes ought to be extremely circumspect with regard to raillery it pleases with moderation because it is an introduction to familiarity but a satirical raillery is less excusable in them than in the meanest of their subjects for it is they alone that give a mortal wound much less should they offer a public affront to any of their subjects kings were instituted to pardon and to punish but never to insult when they affront their subjects their treatment is more cruel than that of the turk or the muscovite the insults of these are a humiliation not a disgrace but both must follow from the insolent behaviour of monarchs such is the prejudice of the eastern nations that they look upon an affront from the prince as the effect of paternal goodness and such on the contrary is our way of thinking that besides the cruel vexation of being affronted we despair of ever being able to wipe off the disgrace princes ought to be overjoyed to have subjects to whom honour is dearer than life an incitement to fidelity as well as to courage they should remember the misfortunes that have happened to sovereigns for insulting their subjects     the revenge of chærea of the eunuch narses of count julian and in fine of the duchess of montpensier who being enraged against henry iii for having published some of her private failings tormented him during her whole life chap xxix of the civil laws proper for mixing some portion of liberty in a despotic government though despotic governments are of their own nature every where the same yet from circumstances from a religious opinion from prejudice from received examples from a particular turn of mind from manners or morals it is possible they may admit of a considerable difference it is useful that some particular notions should be established in those governments thus in china the prince is considered as the father of his people and at the commencement of the empire of the arabs the prince was their preacher it is proper there should be some sacred book to serve for a rule as the koran among the arabs the books of zoroaster among the persians the vedam among the indians and the classic books among the chinese the religious code supplies the civil and fixes the extent of arbitrary sway it is not at all amiss that in dubious cases the judges should consult the ministers of religion† thus in turkey the cadis consult the mollachs but if it is a capital crime it may be proper for the particular judge if such there be to take the governors advice to the end that the civil and ecclesiastic power may be tempered also by the political authority     chap xxx the same subject continued nothing but the very excess and rage of despotic power ordained that the fathers disgrace should drag after it that of his wife and children they are wretched enough already without being criminals besides the prince ought to leave suppliants or mediators between himself and the accused to assuage his wrath or to inform his justice it is an excellent custom of the maldavians‡ that when a lord is disgraced he goes every day to pay his court to the king till he is taken again into favour his presence disarms the princes indignation in some despotic governments¶ they have a notion that it is trespassing against the respect due to their prince to speak to him in favour of a person in disgrace these princes seem to use all their endeavours to deprive themselves of the virtue of clemency arcadius and honorius by a law§ on which we have already descanted∥ positively declare that they will shew no favour to those who shall presume to petition them in behalf of the guilty this was a very bad law indeed since it is bad even under a despotic government the custom of persia which permits every man that pleases to leave the kingdom is excellent and though the contrary practice derives its origin from     despotic power which has ever considered the subjects as slaves† and those who quit the country as fugitives yet the persian practice is useful even to a despotic government because the apprehension of peoples withdrawing for debt restrains or moderates the oppressions of bashaws and extortioners book xiii of the relation which the levying of taxes and the greatness of the public revenues have to liberty chap i of the public revenues the public revenues are a portion that each subject gives of his property in order to secure or enjoy the remainder to fix these revenues in a proper manner regard should be had both to the necessities of the state and to those of the subject the real wants of the people ought never to give way to the imaginary wants of the state imaginary wants are those which flow from the passions and the weakness of the governors from the vain conceit of some extraordinary project from the inordinate desire of glory and from a certain impotence of mind incapable of withstanding the impulse of fancy often have ministers of a restless     disposition imagined that the wants of their own mean and ignoble souls were those of the state nothing requires more wisdom and prudence than the regulation of that portion of which the subject is deprived and that which he is suffered to retain the public revenues should not be measured by the peoples abilities to give but by what they ought to give and if they are measured by their abilities to give it should be considered what they are able to give for a constancy chap ii that it is bad reasoning to say that the greatness of taxes is good in its own nature there have been instances in particular monarchies of petty states exempt from taxes that have been as miserable as the circumjacent places which groaned under the weight of exactions the chief reason of this is that the petty state can hardly have any such thing as industry arts or manufactures because of its being subject to a thousand restraints from the great state by which it is environed the great state is blessed with industry manufactures and arts and establishes laws by which those several advantages are procured the petty state becomes therefore necessarily poor let it pay never so few taxes and yet some have concluded from the poverty of those petty states that in order to render the people industrious they should be loaded with taxes but it would be a juster inference that they ought to pay no taxes at all none live here but wretches who retire from the neighbouring parts to avoid working wretches who disheartened by labour make their whole felicity consist in idleness     the effect of wealth in a country is to inspire every heart with ambition that of poverty is to give birth to despair the former is excited by labour the latter is soothed by indolence nature is just to all mankind and repays them for their industry she renders them industrious by annexing rewards in proportion to their labour but if an arbitrary prince should attempt to deprive people of natures bounty they would fall into a disrelish of industry and then indolence and inaction must be their only happiness chap iii of taxes in countries where part of the people are villains or bondmen the state of villainage is sometimes established after a conquest in that case the bondman or villain that tills the land ought to have a kind of partnership with his master nothing but a communication of loss or profit can reconcile those who are doomed to labour to such as are blessed with a state of affluence chap iv of a republic in the like case when a republic has reduced a nation to the drudgery of cultivating her lands she ought never to suffer the free subject to have a power of increasing the tribute of the bondman this was not permitted at sparta those brave people thought the helotes would be more industrious in cultivating their lands upon knowing that their servitude was not to increase they imagined likewise that the     masters would be better citizens when they desired no more than what they were accustomed to enjoy chap v of a monarchy in the like case when the nobles of a monarchical state cause the lands to be cultivated for their own use by a conquered people they ought never to have a power of increasing the service or tribute besides it is right the prince should be satisfied with his own demesne and the military service but if he wants to raise taxes on the vassals of his nobility the lords of the several districts ought to be answerable for the tax† and be obliged to pay it for the vassals by whom they may be afterwards reimbursed if this rule be not followed the lord and the collectors of the public taxes will harrass the poor vassal by turns till he perishes with misery or flies into the woods chap vi of a despotic government in the like case the foregoing rule is still more indispensably necessary in a despotic government the lord who is every moment liable to be stripped of his lands and his vassals is not so eager to preserve them when peter i thought proper to follow the custom of germany and to demand his taxes in money he made a very prudent regulation which is still followed in russia the gentleman levies the tax on the peasant and pays it to the czar if the     number of peasants diminishes he pays all the same if it increases he pays no more so that it is his interest not to worry or oppress his vassals chap vii of taxes in countries where villainage is not established when the inhabitants of a state are all free subjects and each man enjoys his property with as much right as the prince his sovereignty taxes may then be laid either on persons on lands on merchandizes on two of these or on all three together in the taxing of persons it would be an unjust proportion to conform exactly to that of property at athens‡ the people were divided into four classes those who drew five hundred measures of liquid or dry fruit from their estates paid a talent to the public those who drew three hundred measures paid half a talent those who had two hundred measures paid ten minæ those of the fourth class paid nothing at all the tax was fair though it was not proportionable if it did not follow the measure of peoples property it followed that of their wants it was judged that every man had an equal share of what was necessary for nature that whatsoever was necessary for nature ought not to be taxed that to this succeeded the useful which ought to be taxed but less than the superfluous and that the largeness of the taxes on what was superfluous prevented superfluity in the taxing of lands it is customary to make lifts or registers in which the different classes of     estates are ranged but it is very difficult to know these differences and still more so to find people that are not interested in mistaking them here therefore are two sorts of injustice that of the man and that of the thing but if in general the tax be not exorbitant and the people continue to have plenty of necessaries these particular acts of injustice will do no harm on the contrary if the people are permitted to enjoy only just what is necessary for subsistence the least disproportion will be of the greatest consequence if some subjects do not pay enough the mischief is not so great their convenience and ease turn always to the public advantage if some private people pay too much their ruin redounds to the public detriment if the government proportions its fortune to that of individuals the ease and conveniency of the latter will soon make its fortune rise the whole depends upon a critical moment shall the state begin with impoverishing the subjects to enrich itself or had it better wait to be enriched by its subjects is it more adviseable for it to have the former or the latter advantage which shall it chuse to begin or to end with opulence the duties felt least by the people are those on merchandize because they are not demanded of them in form they may be so prudently managed that the people themselves shall hardly know they pay them for this purpose it is of the utmost consequence that the person who sells the merchandize should pay the duty he is very sensible that he does not pay it for himself and the consumer who pays it in the main confounds it with the price some authors have observed that nero had abolished the duty of the five and twentieth part arising from     the sale of slaves and yet he had only ordained that it should be paid by the seller instead of the purchaser this regulation which left the impost intire seemed nevertheless to suppress it there are two states in europe where the imposts are very heavy upon liquors in one the brewer alone pays the duty in the other it is levied indiscriminately upon all the consumers in the first no body feels the rigor of the impost in the second it is looked upon as a grievance in the former the subject is sensible only of the liberty he has of not paying in the latter he feels only the necessity that compels him to pay farther the obliging the consumers to pay requires a perpetual rummaging and searching into their houses now nothing is more contrary than this to liberty and those who establish these sorts of duties have not surely been so happy as to hit upon the best method of collecting the revenue chap viii in what manner the deception is preserved in order to make the purchaser confound the price of the commodity with the impost there must be some proportion between the impost and the value of the commodity for which reason there ought not to be an excessive duty upon merchandizes of little value there are countries in which the duty exceeds seventeen or eighteen times the value of the commodity in this case the prince removes the disguise his subjects plainly see they are dealt with   0 in an unreasonable manner which renders them most exquisitely sensible of their servile condition besides the prince to be able to levy a duty so disproportioned to the value of the commodity must be himself the vender and the people must not have it in their power to purchase it elsewhere a practice subject to a thousand inconveniencies smuggling being in this case extremely lucrative the natural and most reasonable penalty namely the confiscation of the merchandize becomes incapable of putting a stop to it especially as this very merchandize is intrinsically of an inconsiderable value recourse must therefore be had to extravagant punishments such as those inflicted for capital crimes all proportion then of penalties is at an end persons that cannot really be considered as vicious are punished like the most infamous criminals which of all things in the world is the most contrary to the spirit of a moderate government again in proportion as people are tempted to cheat the farmer of the revenues the more the latter is enriched and the former impoverished to put a stop to smuggling the farmer must be invested with extraordinary means of oppressing and then the country is ruined chap ix of a bad kind of impost we shall here by the way take notice of an impost laid in particular countries on the different articles of civil contracts as these are things subject to very nice disquisitions a vast deal of knowledge is necessary to make any tolerable defence against the farmer of the revenues who interprets     in that case the regulations of the prince and exercises an arbitrary power over peoples fortunes experience has demonstrated that a duty on the paper on which the deeds are drawn would be of far greater service chap x that the greatness of taxes depends on the nature of the government taxes ought to be very light in despotic governments otherwise who would be at the trouble of tilling the land besides how is it possible to pay heavy duties in a government that makes no manner of return to the different contributions of the subject the exorbitant power of the prince and the extreme depression of the people require that there should not be even a possibility of the least mistake between them the taxes ought to be so easy to collect and so clearly settled as to leave no opportunity for the collectors to increase or diminish them a portion of the fruits of the earth a capitation a duty of so much per cent on merchandizes are the only taxes suitable to that government merchants in despotic countries ought to have a personal safeguard to which all due respect should be paid without this they would be too weak to dispute with the customhouse officers chap xi of confiscations with respect to confiscations there is one thing very particular that contrary to the general     custom they are more severe in europe than in asia in europe not only the merchandizes but even sometimes the ships and carriages are confiscated which is never practised in asia this is because in europe the merchant can have recourse to magistrates who are able to shelter him from oppression in asia the magistrates themselves would be the greatest oppressors what remedy could a merchant have against a bashaw who was determined to confiscate his goods the prince therefore checks his own power finding himself under a necessity of acting with some kind of lenity in turkey they raise only a single duty for the importation of goods and afterwards the whole country is open to the merchant smuggling is not attended with confiscation or increate of duty in china they never look into the baggage of those who are not merchants defrauding the customs in the territory of the mogul is not punished with confiscation but with doubling the duty the princes of† tartary who reside in towns impose scarce any duty at all on the goods that pass through their country in japan it is true to cheat the customs is a capital crime but this is because they have particular reasons for prohibiting all communication with foreigners hence the fraud‡ is rather a contravention of the laws made for the security of the government than of those of commerce     chap xii relation between the weight of taxes and liberty it is a general rule that taxes may be heavier in proportion to the liberty of the subject and that there is a necessity for reducing them in proportion to the increase of slavery this has always been and always will be the case it is a rule derived from nature that never varies we find it in all parts in england in holland and in every state where liberty gradually declines till we come to turky swisserland seems to be an exception to this rule because they pay no taxes but the particular reason for that exemption is well known and even confirms what i have advanced in those barren mountains provisions are so dear and the country is so populous that a swiss pays four times more to nature than a turk does to the sultan a conquering people such as were formerly the athenians and the romans may rid themselves of all taxes as they reign over vanquished nations then indeed they do not pay in proportion to their liberty because in this respect they are no longer a people but a monarch but the general rule still holds good in moderate governments there is an indemnity for the weight of the taxes which is liberty in despotic countries there is an equivalent for liberty which is the lightness of the taxes in some monarchies in europe there are‡ particular provinces which from the very nature of     their civil government are in a more flourishing condition than the rest it is pretended that these provinces are not sufficiently taxed because through the goodness of their government they are able to be taxed higher hence the ministers seem constantly to aim at depriving them of this very government from whence a diffusive blessing is derived which redounds even to the princes advantage chap xiii in what government taxes are capable of increase taxes may be increased in most republics because the citizen who thinks he is paying himself chearfully submits to them and moreover is generally able to bear their weight from the nature of the government in a monarchy taxes may be increased because the moderation of the government is capable of procuring opulence it is a recompence as it were granted to the prince for the respect he shews to the laws in despotic governments they cannot be increased because there can be no increase of the extremity of slavery chap xiv that the nature of the taxes is relative to the government a capitation is more natural to slavery a duty on merchandizes is more natural to liberty by reason it has not so direct a relation to the person it is natural in a despotic government for the prince not to give money to his soldiers or to     those belonging to his court but to distribute lands amongst them and of course that there should be very few taxes but if the prince gives money the most natural tax he can raise is a capitation which can never be considerable for as it is impossible to make different classes of the contributors because of the abuses that might arise from thence considering the injustice and violence of the government they are under an absolute necessity of regulating themselves by the rate of what even the poorest and most wretched are able to contribute the natural tax of moderate governments is the duty laid on merchandizes as this is really paid by the consumer though advanced by the merchant it is a loan which the latter has already made to the former hence the merchant must be considered on the one side as the general debtor of the state and on the other as the creditor of every individual he advances to the state the duty which the consumer will some time or other refund and he has paid for the consumer the duty which he has advanced for the merchandize it is therefore obvious that in proportion to the moderation of the government to the prevalence of the spirit of liberty and to the security of private fortunes a merchant has it in his power to advance money to the state and to pay considerable duties for individuals in england a merchant lends really to the government fifty or sixty pounds sterling for every tun of wine he imports where is the merchant that would dare do any such thing in a country like turky and were he so presumptuous how could he do it with a crazy or shattered fortune     chap xv abuse of liberty to these great advantages of liberty it is owing that liberty itself has been abused because a moderate government has been productive of admirable effects this moderation has been laid aside because great taxes have been raised they wanted to carry them to excess and ungrateful to the hand of liberty of whom they received this present they addressed themselves to slavery who never grants the least favour liberty produces excessive taxes the effect of excessive taxes is slavery and slavery produces a diminution of tribute most of the edicts of the eastern monarchs are to exempt every year some province of their empire from paying tribute the manifestations of their will are favours but in europe the edicts of princes are disagreeable even before they are seen because they always make mention of their own wants but not a word of ours from an unpardonable indolence in the ministers of those countries owing to the nature of the government and frequently to the climate the people derive this advantage that they are not incessantly plagued with new demands the public expence does not increase because the ministers do not form new projects and if some by chance are formed they are such as are soon executed the governors of the state do not perpetually torment the people for they do not perpetually torment themselves but it is impossible there should be any fixed rule in our finances since we always     know that we shall have something or other to execute without ever knowing what it is it is no longer customary with us to give the appellation of a great minister to a wise dispenser of the public revenues but to a person of dexterity and cunning who is clever at finding out what we call the ways and means chap xvi of the conquests of the mahometans it was this excess of taxes that occasioned the prodigious facility with which the mahometans carried on their conquests instead of a continual series of extortions devised by the subtle avarice of the greek emperors the people were subjected to a simple tribute which was paid and collected with ease thus they were far happier in obeying a barbarous nation than a corrupt government in which they suffered every inconvenience of lost liberty with all the horror of present slavery chap xvii of the augmentation of troops a new distemper has spread itself over europe infecting our princes and inducing them to keep up an exorbitant number of troops it has its redoublings and of necessity becomes contagious for as soon as one prince augments his forces the rest of course do the same so that nothing is gained thereby but the public ruin each monarch keeps as many armies on foot as if his people were in danger of being exterminated and they give the     name of peace to this general effort of all against all thus is europe ruined to such a degree that were private people to be in the same situation as the three most opulent powers of this part of the globe they would not have necessary subsistance we are poor with the riches and commerce of the whole world and soon by thus augmenting our troops we shall be all soldiers and be reduced to the very same situation as the tartars‡ great princes not satisfied with hiring or buying troops of petty states make it their business on all sides to pay subsidies for alliances that is generally to throw away their money the consequence of such a situation is the perpetual augmentation of taxes and the mischief which prevents all future remedy is that they reckon no more upon their revenues but in waging war against their whole capital it is no unusual thing to see governments mortgage their funds even in time of peace and to employ what they call extraordinary means to ruin themselves means so extraordinary indeed that such are hardly thought on by the most extravagant young spendthrift chap xviii of an exemption from taxes the maxim of the great eastern empires of exempting such provinces as have very much suffered from taxes ought to be extended to monarchical states there are some indeed where this practice is established yet the country is more     oppressed than if no such rule took place because as the prince levies still neither more nor less the state becomes bound for the whole in order to ease a village that pays badly they load another that pays better the former is not relieved and the latter is ruined the people grow desperate between the necessity of paying for fear of exactions and the danger of paying for fear of new burdens a wellregulated government ought to set aside for the first article of its expence a determinate sum to answer contingent cases it is with the public as with individuals who are ruined when they live up exactly to their income with regard to an obligation for the whole amongst the inhabitants of the same village some pretend that it is but reasonable because there is a possibility of a fraudulent combination on their side but was it ever heard that upon mere supposition we are to establish a thing in itself unjust and ruinous to the state chap xix which is most suitable to the prince and to the people the farming the revenues or managing them by commission the managing of the revenues by commission is like the conduct of a good father of a family who collects his own rents himself with œconomy and order by this management of the revenues the prince is at liberty to press or retard the levy of the taxes either according to his own wants or to   0 those of his people by this he saves to the state the immense profits of the farmers who impoverish it a thousand ways by this he prevents the people from being mortified with the sight of sudden fortunes by this the public money passes through few hands goes directly to the treasury and consequently makes a quicker return to the people by this the prince avoids an infinite number of bad laws extorted from him by the importunate avarice of the farmers who pretend to offer a present advantage for regulations pernicious to posterity as the moneyed man is always the most powerful the farmer renders himself arbitrary even over the prince himself he is not the legislator but he obliges the legislator to give laws i acknowledge that it is sometimes of use to farm out a new duty for there is an art in preventing frauds which motives of interest suggest to the farmers but commissioners never think on now the manner of levying it being once established by the farmer it may afterwards be safely entrusted to a commission in england the management of the excise and of the postoffice was borrowed from that of the farmers of the revenue in republics the revenues of the state are generally managed by commission the contrary practice was a great defect in the roman government† in despotic governments the people are infinitely happier where this management is established witness persia and china‡ the unhappiest of all are those where the prince farms out his seaports and trading     cities the history of monarchies abounds with mischiefs done by the farmers of the revenue incensed at the oppressive extortions of the publicans nero formed a magnanimous but impracticable scheme of abolishing all kinds of imposts he did not think of managing the revenues by commissioners but he made four edicts that the laws enacted against publicans which had hitherto been kept secret should be promulged that they should exact no claims for above a year backward that there should be a prætor established to determine their pretensions without any formality and that the merchants should pay no duty for their vessels these were the halcyon days of that emperor chap xx of the farmers of the revenues when the lucrative profession of a farmer of the revenue becomes likewise a post of honour the state is ruined it may do well enough in despotic governments where this employment is oftentimes exercised by the governors themselves but it is by no means proper in a republic since a custom of the like nature destroyed that of rome nor is it better in monarchies nothing being more opposite to the spirit of this government all the other orders of the state are dissatisfied honour loses its whole value the gradual and natural means of distinction are no longer respected and the very principle of the government is subverted it is true indeed that scandalous fortunes were raised in former times but this was one of the calamities of the fifty years war these riches were then considered as ridiculous now we admire them     every profession has its particular lot that of the taxgatherers is wealth and wealth is its own reward glory and honour fall to the share of that nobility who are sensible of no other happiness respect and esteem are for those ministers and magistrates whose whole life is a continued series of labour and who watch day and night over the welfare of the empire book xiv of laws as relative to the nature of the climate chap i general idea if it be true that the temper of the mind and the passions of the heart are extremely different in different climates the laws ought to be relative both to the variety of those passions and to the variety of those tempers chap ii of the difference of men in different climates a cold air constringes the extremities of the external fibres of the body this increases their elasticity and favours the return of the blood from the extreme parts to the heart it contracts† those very fibres consequently it increases also their force on the contrary a warm air relaxes and lengthens the extremes of the fibres of course it diminishes their force and elasticity     people are therefore more vigorous in cold climates here the action of the heart and the reaction of the extremities of the fibres are better performed the temperature of the humours is greater the blood moves freer towards the heart and reciprocally the heart has more power this superiority of strength must produce various effects for instance a greater boldness that is more courage a greater sense of superiority that is less desire of revenge a greater opinion of security that is more frankness less suspicion policy and cunning in short this must be productive of very different tempers put a man into a close warm place and for the reasons above given he will feel a great faintness if under this circumstance you propose a bold enterprize to him i believe you will find him very little disposed towards it his present weakness will throw him into a despondency he will be afraid of every thing being in a state of total incapacity the inhabitants of warm countries are like old men timorous the people in cold countries are like young men brave if we reflect on the late‡ wars which are more recent in our memory and in which we can better distinguish some particular effects that escape us at a greater distance of time we shall find that the northern people transplanted into southern regions∥ did not perform such exploits as their countrymen who fighting in their own climate possessed their full vigour and courage this strength of the fibres in northern nations is the cause that the coarser juices are extracted from their aliments from hence two things result one that the parts of the chyle or lymph are more     proper by reason of their large surface to be applied to and to nourish the fibres the other that they are less proper from their coarseness to give a certain subtlety to the nervous juice those people have therefore large bodies and but little vivacity the nerves that terminate from all parts in the cutis form each a nervous bundle generally speaking the whole nerve is not moved but a very minute part in warm climates where the cutis is relaxed the ends of the nerves are expanded and laid open to the weakest action of the smallest objects in cold countries the cutis is constringed and the papillæ compressed the miliary glands are in some measure paralytic and the sensation does not reach the brain but when it is very strong and proceeds from the whole nerve at once now imagination taste sensibility and vivacity depend on an infinite number of small sensations i have observed the outermost part of a sheeps tongue where to the naked eye it seems covered with papillæ on these papillæ i have discerned through a microscope small hairs or a kind of down between the papillæ were pyramids shaped towards the ends like pincers very likely these pyramids are the principal organ of taste i caused the half of this tongue to be frozen and observing it with the naked eye i found the papillæ considerably diminished even some rows of them were sunk into their sheath the outermost part i examined with the microscope and perceived no pyramids in proportion as the frost went off the papillæ seemed to the naked eye to rise and with the microscope the miliary glands began to appear this observation confirms what i have been saying that in cold countries the nervous glands are less expanded they sink deeper into their sheaths     or they are sheltered from the action of external objects consequently they have not such lively sensations in cold countries they have very little sensibility for pleasure in temperate countries they have more in warm countries their sensibility is exquisite as climates are distinguished by degrees of latitude we might distinguish them also in some measure by those of sensibility i have been at the opera in england and in italy where i have seen the same pieces and the same performers and yet the same music produces such different effects on the two nations one is so cold and phlegmatic and the other so lively and enraptured that it seems almost inconceivable it is the same with regard to pain which is excited by the laceration of some fibre of the body the author of nature has made it an established rule that this pain should be more acute in proportion as the laceration is greater now it is evident that the large bodies and coarse fibres of the people of the north are less capable of laceration than the delicate fibres of the inhabitants of warm countries consequently the soul is there less sensible of pain you must flay a muscovite alive to make him feel from this delicacy of organs peculiar to warm climates it follows that the soul is most sensibly moved by whatever relates to the union of the two sexes here every thing leads to this object in northern climates scarcely has the animal part of love a power of making itself felt in temperate climates love attended by a thousand appendages endeavours to please by things that have at first the appearance though not the reality of this passion in warmer climates it is liked for its own sake it is the only cause of happiness it is life itself     in southern countries a machine of a delicate frame but strong sensibility resigns itself either to a love which rises and is incessantly laid in a seraglio or to a passion which leaves women in a greater independence and is consequently exposed to a thousand inquietudes in northern regions a machine robust and heavy finds a pleasure in whatever is apt to throw the spirits into motion such as hunting travelling war and wine if we travel towards the north we meet with people who have few vices many virtues and a great share of frankness and sincerity if we draw near the south we fancy ourselves intirely removed from the verge of morality here the strongest passions are productive of all manner of crimes each man endeavouring let the means be what they will to indulge his inordinate desires in temperate climates we find the inhabitants inconstant in their manners as well as in their vices and virtues the climate has not a quality determinate enough to fix them the heat of the climate may be so excessive as to deprive the body of all vigour and strength then the faintness is communicated to the mind there is no curiosity no enterprize no generosity of sentiment the inclinations are all passive indolence constitutes the utmost happiness scarcely any punishment is so severe as mental employment and slavery is more supportable than the force and vigour of mind necessary for human conduct     chap iii contradiction in the tempers of some southern nations the indians are naturally a pusillanimous people even the children† of europeans born in india lose the courage peculiar to their own climate but how shall we reconcile this with their customs and penances so full of barbarity the men voluntarily undergo the greatest hardships and the women burn themselves here we find a very odd compound of fortitude and weakness nature having framed these people of a texture so weak as to fill them with timidity has formed them at the same time of an imagination so lively that every object makes the strongest impression upon them that delicacy of organs which renders them apprehensive of death contributes likewise to make them dread a thousand things more than death the very same sensibility induces them to fly and dare all dangers as a good education is more necessary to children than to such as are arrived to a maturity of understanding so the inhabitants of those countries have much greater need than the european nations of a wise legislator the greater their sensibility the more it behoves them to receive proper impressions to imbibe no prejudices and to let themselves be directed by reason at the time of the romans the inhabitants of the north of europe were destitute of arts education and almost of laws and yet the good sense annexed to the gross fibres of those climates enabled them     to make an admirable stand against the power of rome till the memorable period in which they quitted their woods to subvert that great empire chap iv cause of the immutability of religion manners customs and laws in the eastern countries if to that delicacy of organs which renders the eastern nations so susceptible of every impression you add likewise a sort of indolence of mind naturally connected with that of the body by means of which they grow incapable of any exertion or effort it is easy to comprehend that when once the soul has received an impression she cannot change it this is the reason that the laws manners‡ and customs even those which seem quite indifferent such as their mode of dress are the same to this very day in eastern countries as they were a thousand years ago chap v that those are bad legislators who favour the vices of the climate and good legislators who oppose those vices the indians believe that repose and nonexistence are the foundation of all things and the end in which they terminate hence they consider entire inaction as the most perfect of all states and the object of their desires to the supreme being they give∥ the title of immoveable the inhabitants of siam believe that their utmost happiness§ consists in     not being obliged to animate a machine or to give motion to a body in those countries where the excess of heat enervates and exhausts the body rest is so delicious and motion so painful that this system of metaphysics seems natural and¶ foe the legislator of the indies was directed by his own sensations when he placed mankind in a state extremely passive but his doctrine arising from the laziness of the climate favoured it also in its turn which has been the source of an infinite deal of mischief the legislators of china were more rational when considering men not in the peaceful state which they are to enjoy hereafter but in the situation proper for discharging the several duties of life they made their religion philosophy and laws all practical the more the physical causes incline mankind to inaction the more the moral causes should estrange them from it chap vi of agriculture in warm climates agriculture is the principal labour of man the more the climate inclines him to shun this labour the more the religion and laws of the country ought to excite him to it thus the indian laws which give the lands to the prince and destroy the spirit of property among the subjects increase the bad effects of the climate that is their natural indolence  00 chap vii of monkery the very same mischiefs result from monkery it had its rise in the warm countries of the east where they are less inclined to action than to speculation in asia the number of dervises or monks seems to increase together with the warmth of the climate the indies where the heat is excessive are full of them and the same difference is found in europe in order to surmount the laziness of the climate the laws ought to endeavour to remove all means of subsisting without labour but in the southern parts of europe they act quite the reverse to those who want to live in a state of indolence they afford retreats the most proper for a speculative life and endow them with immense revenues these men who live in the midst of a plenty which they know not how to enjoy are in the right to give their superfluities away to the common people the poor are bereft of property and these men indemnify them by supporting them in idleness so as to make them even grow fond of their misery chap viii an excellent custom of china the historical relations¶ of china mention a ceremony of opening the grounds which the emperor performs every year the design of this  0  public and solemn act is to excite† the people to tillage farther the emperor is every year informed of the husbandman who has distinguished himself most in his profession and he makes him a mandarin of the eighth order among the ancient persians‡ the kings quitted their grandeur and pomp on the eighth day of the month called chorremruz to eat with the husbandmen these institutions were admirably well calculated for the encouragement of agriculture chap ix means of encouraging industry we shall shew in the nineteenth book that lazy nations are generally proud now the effect might well be turned against the cause and laziness be destroyed by pride in the south of europe where people have such a high notion of the point of honour it would be right to give prizes to husbandmen who had excelled in agriculture or to artists who had made the greatest improvements in their several professions this practice has succeeded in our days in ireland where it has established one of the most considerable linenmanufactures in europe chap x of the laws relative to the sobriety of the people in warm countries the aqueous part of the blood loses itself greatly by perspiration∥ it must therefore  0  be supplied by a like liquid water is there of admirable use strong liquors would congeal the globules§ of blood that remain after the transuding of the aqueous humour in cold countries the aqueous part of the blood is very little evacuated by perspiration they may therefore make use of spirituous liquors without which the blood would congeal they are full of humours consequently strong liquors which give a motion to the blood are proper for those countries the law of mahomet which prohibits the drinking of wine is therefore fitted to the climate of arabia and indeed before mahomets time water was the common drink of the arabs the law¶ which forbad the carthaginians to drink wine was also a law of the climate and indeed the climate of those two countries is pretty near the same such a law would be improper for cold countries where the climate seems to force them to a kind of national intemperance very different from personal ebriety drunkenness predominates throughout the world in proportion to the coldness and humidity of the climate go from the equator to the north pole and you will find this vice increasing together with the degree of latitude go from the equator again to the south pole and you will find the same vice travelling south exactly in the same proportion it is very natural that where wine is contrary to the climate and consequently to health the excess of it should be more severely punished than in countries  0  where intoxication produces very few bad effects to the person fewer to the society and where it does not make people frantic and wild but only stupid and heavy hence those laws† which inflicted a double punishment for crimes committed in drunkenness were applicable only to a personal and not to a national ebriety a german drinks through custom and a spaniard by choice in warm countries the relaxing of the fibres produces a great evacuation of the liquids but the solid parts are less transpired the fibres which act but faintly and have very little elasticity are not much impaired and a small quantity of nutritious juice is sufficient to repair them for which reason they eat very little it is the variety of wants in different climates that first occasioned a difference in the manner of living and this gave rise to a variety of laws where people are very communicative there must be particular laws and others where there is but little communication chap xi of the laws relative to the distempers of the climate herodotus‡ informs us that the jewish laws concerning the leprosy were borrowed from the practice of the egyptians and indeed the same distemper required the same remedies the greeks and the primitive romans were strangers to these laws as well as to the disease the climate of egypt and palestine rendered them necessary and the facility with which this disease is spread is  0  sufficient to make us sensible of the wisdom and sagacity of those laws even we ourselves have felt the effects of them the croisades had brought the leprosy amongst us but the wise regulations made at that time hindered it from infecting the mass of the people we find by the law of the∥ lombards that this disease was spread in italy before the croisades and merited the attention of the legislature rotharis ordained that a leper should be expelled from his house banished to a particular place and rendered incapable of disposing of his property because from the very moment he had been turned out of his house he was reckoned dead in the eye of the law in order to prevent all communication with lepers they were rendered incapable of civil acts i am apt to think that this disease was brought into italy by the conquests of the greek emperors in whose armies there might be some soldiers from palestine or egypt be that as it may the progress of it was stopt till the time of the croisades it is related that pompeys soldiers returning from syria brought a distemper home with them not unlike the leprosy we have no account of any regulation made at that time but it is highly probable that some such step was taken since the distemper was checked till the time of the lombards it is now two centuries since a disease unknown to our ancestors was first transplanted from the new world to ours and came to attack human nature even in the very source of life and pleasure most of the principal families in the south of europe were seen to perish by a distemper that was grown too common to be ignominious and was considered in no other  0  light than in that of its being fatal it was the thirst of gold that propagated this disease the europeans went continually to america and always brought back a new leven of it reasons drawn from religion seemed to require that this punishment of guilt should be permitted to continue but the infection had reached the bosom of matrimony and given the vicious taint even to guiltless infants as it is the business of legislators to watch over the health of the citizens it would have been a wise part in them to have stopped this communication by laws made on the plan of those of moses the plague is a disease whose infectious progress is much more rapid egypt is its principal seat from whence it spreads over the whole globe most countries in europe have made exceeding good regulations to prevent this infection and in our times an admirable method has been contrived to stop it this is by forming a line of troops round the infected country which cuts off all manner of communication the turks§ who have no such regulations see the christians escape this infection in the same town and none but themselves perish they buy the clothes of the infected wear them and proceed in their old way as if nothing had happened the doctrine of a rigid fate which directs their whole conduct renders the magistrate a quiet spectator he thinks that every thing comes from the hand of god and that man has nothing more to do than to submit  0  chap xii of the laws against suicides we do not find in history that the romans ever killed themselves without a cause but the english are apt to commit suicide most unaccountably they destroy themselves even in the bosom of happiness this action among the romans was the effect of education being connected with their principles and customs among the english it is the consequence of a distemper being connected with the physical state of the machine and independent of every other cause in all probability it is a defect of the filtration of the nervous juice the machine whose motive faculties are often unexerted is weary of itself the soul feels no pain but a certain uneasiness in existing pain is a local sensation which leads us to the desire of seeing an end of it the burthen of life which prompts us to the desire of ceasing to exist is an evil confined to no particular part it is evident that the civil laws of some countries may have reasons for branding suicide with infamy but in england it cannot be punished without punishing the effects of madness chap xiii effects arising from the climate of england in a nation so distempered by the climate as to have a disrelish of every thing nay even of life it is plain that the government most suitable to the inhabitants is that in which they cannot lay their uneasiness  0  to any single persons charge and in which being under the direction of the laws rather than of the prince it is impossible for them to change the government without subverting the laws themselves and if this nation has likewise derived from the climate a certain impatience of temper which renders them incapable of bearing the same train of things for any long continuance it is obvious that the government abovementioned is the fittest for them this impatience of temper is not very considerable of itself but it may become so when joined with courage it is quite a different thing from levity which makes people undertake or drop a project without cause it borders more upon obstinacy because it proceeds from so lively a sense of misery that it is not weakened even by the habit of suffering this temper in a free nation is extremely proper for disconcerting the projects of tyranny which is always slow and feeble in its commencements as in the end it is active and lively which at first only stretches out a hand to assist and exerts afterwards a multitude of arms to oppress slavery is ever preceded by sleep but a people who find no rest in any situation who continually explore every part and feel nothing but pain can hardly be lulled to sleep politics are a smooth file which cuts gradually and attains its end by a slow progression now the people of whom we have been speaking are incapable of bearing the delays the details and the coolness of negociations in these they are more unlikely  0  to succeed than any other nation hence they are apt to lose by treaties what they obtain by their arms chap xiv other effects of the climate our ancestors the ancient germans lived under a climate where the passions were extremely calm their laws decided only in such cases where the injury was visible to the eye and went no farther and as they judged of the outrages done to men from the greatness of the wound they acted with no other delicacy in respect to the injuries done to women the law of† the germans on this subject is very extraordinary if a person uncovers a womans head he pays a fine of fifty sous if he uncovers her leg up to the knee he pays the same and double from the knee upwards one would think that the law measured the insults offered to women as we measure a figure in geometry it did not punish the crime of the imagination but that of the eye but upon the migration of a german nation into spain the climate soon found a necessity for different laws the law of the visigoths inhibited the surgeons to bleed a free woman except either her father mother brother son or uncle was present as the imagination of the people grew warm so did that of the legislators the law suspected every thing when the people were become suspicious these laws had therefore a particular regard for the two sexes but in their punishments they seem rather to humour the revengeful temper of private persons than to administer public justice thus in most cases they reduced both the criminals to be  0  slaves to the offended relations or to the injured husband a freeborn woman‡ who had yielded to the embraces of a married man was delivered up to his wife to dispose of her as she pleased they obliged the slaves§ if they found their masters wife in adultery to bind her and carry her to her husband they even permitted her children∥ to be her accusers and her slaves to be tortured in order to convict her thus their laws were far better adapted to refine even to excess a certain point of honour than to form a good civil administration we must not therefore be surprized if count julian was of opinion that an affront of that kind ought to be expiated by the ruin of his king and country we must not be surprized if the moors with such a conformity of manners found it so easy to settle and to maintain themselves in spain and to retard the fall of their empire chap xv of the different confidence which the laws have in the people according to the difference of climates the people of japan are of so stubborn and perverse a temper that neither their legislators nor magistrates can put any confidence in them they set nothing before their eyes but judgments menaces and chastisements every step they take is subject to the inquisition of the civil magistrate those laws which out of five heads of families establish one as a magistrate over the other four those laws which punish a family or a whole ward for a single crime those laws in fine which find no body innocent where one may happen to be guilty are made with a   0 design to implant in the people a mutual distrust and to make every man the inspector witness and judge of his neighbours conduct on the contrary the people of india are mild¶ tender and compassionate hence their legislators repose a great confidence in them they have established very few punishments these are not severe nor are they rigorously executed they have subjected nephews to their uncles and orphans to their guardians as in other countries they are subjected to their fathers they have regulated the succession by the acknowledged merit of the successor they seem to think that every individual ought to place an intire confidence in the goodnature of his fellowsubjects they infranchise their slaves without difficulty they marry them they treat them as their children† happy climate which gives birth to innocence and produces a lenity in the laws book xv in what manner the laws of civil slavery are relative to the nature of the climate chap i of civil slavery slavery properly so called is the establishment of a right which gives to one man such a power     over another as renders him absolute master of his life and fortune the state of slavery is in its own nature bad it is neither useful to the master nor to the slave not to the slave because he can do nothing through a motive of virtue nor to the master because by having an unlimited authority over his slaves he insensibly accustoms himself to the want of all moral virtues and from thence becomes fierce hasty severe choleric voluptuous and cruel in despotic countries where they are already in a state of political servitude civil slavery is more tolerable than in other governments every one ought to be satisfied in those countries with necessaries and life hence the condition of a slave is hardly more burdensome than that of a subject but in a monarchical government where it is of the utmost importance that human nature should not be debased nor dispirited there ought to be no slavery in democracies where they are all upon an equality and in aristocracies where the laws ought to use their utmost endeavours to procure as great an equality as the nature of the government will permit slavery is contrary to the spirit of the constitution it only contributes to give a power and luxury to the citizens which they ought not to have chap ii origin of the right of slavery among the roman civilians one would never have imagined that slavery should owe its birth to pity and that this should have been excited three different ways†     the law of nations to prevent prisoners from being put to death has allowed them to be made slaves the civil law of the romans empowered debtors who were subject to be ill used by their creditors to sell themselves and the law of nature requires that children whom a father in the state of servitude is no longer able to maintain should be reduced to the same state as the father these reasons of the civilians are all false it is false that killing in war is lawful unless in a case of absolute necessity but when a man has made another his slave he cannot be said to have been under a necessity of taking away his life since he actually did not take it away war gives no other right over prisoners than to disable them from doing any farther harm by securing their persons all nations concur in detesting the murdering of prisoners in cold blood neither is it true that a freeman can sell himself sale implies a price now when a person sells himself his whole substance immediately devolves to his master the master therefore in that case gives nothing and the slave receives nothing you will say he has a peculium but this peculium goes along with his person if it is not lawful for a man to kill himself because he robs his country of his person for the same reason he is not allowed to barter his freedom the freedom of every citizen constitutes a part of the public liberty and in a democratical state is even a part of the sovereignty to sell ones freedom‡ is so repugnant to all reason as can scarcely be supposed in any man if liberty may be rated with respect to the buyer it is beyond all price to the     seller the civil law which authorizes a division of goods among men cannot be thought to rank among such goods a part of the men who were to make this division the same law annuls all iniquitous contracts surely then it affords redress in a contract where the grievance is most enormous the third way is birth which falls with the two former for if a man could not sell himself much less could he sell an unborn infant if a prisoner of war is not to be reduced to slavery much less are his children the lawfulness of putting a malefactor to death arises from this circumstance the law by which he is punished was made for his security a murderer for instance has enjoyed the benefit of the very law which condemns him it has been a continual protection to him he cannot therefore object against it but it is not so with the slave the law of slavery can never be beneficial to him it is in all cases against him without ever being for his advantage and therefore this law is contrary to the fundamental principle of all societies if it be pretended that it has been beneficial to him as his master has provided for his subsistence slavery at this rate should be limited to those who are incapable of earning their livelihood but who will take up with such slaves as to infants nature who has supplied their mothers with milk had provided for their sustenance and the remainder of their childhood approaches so near the age in which they are most capable of being of service that he who supports them cannot be said to give them an equivalent which can entitle him to be their master nor is slavery less opposite to the civil law than to that of nature what civil law can restrain a slave from running away since he is not a member of society     and consequently has no interest in any civil institutions he can be retained only by a family law that is by the masters authority chap iii another origin of the right of slavery i would as soon say that the right of slavery proceeds from the contempt of one nation for another founded on a difference in customs lopez¶ de gamar relates that the spaniards found near st martha several baskets full of crabs snails grashoppers and locusts which proved to be the ordinary provision of the natives this the conquerors turned to a heavy charge against the conquered the author owns that this with their smoking and trimming their beards in a different manner gave rise to the law by which the americans became slaves to the spaniards knowledge humanizes mankind and reason inclines to mildness but prejudices eradicate every tender disposition chap iv another origin of the right of slavery i would as soon say that religion gives its professors a right to enslave those who dissent from it in order to render its propagation more easy this was the notion that encouraged the ravagers of america in their iniquity under the influence of this idea they founded their right of enslaving so many nations for these robbers who would absolutely be both robbers and christians were superlatively devout     lewis xiii† was extremely uneasy at a law by which all the negroes of his colonies were to be made slaves but it being strongly urged to him as the readiest means for their conversion he acquiesced without farther scruple chap v of the slavery of the negroes were i to vindicate our right to make slaves of the negroes these should be my arguments the europeans having extirpated the americans were obliged to make slaves of the africans for clearing such vast tracts of land sugar would be too dear if the plants which produce it were cultivated by any other than slaves these creatures are all over black and with such a flat nose that they can scarcely be pitied it is hardly to be believed that god who is a wise being should place a soul especially a good soul in such a black ugly body it is so natural to look upon colour as the criterion of human nature that the asiatics among whom eunuchs are employed always deprive the blacks of their resemblance to us by a more opprobrious distinction the colour of the skin may be determined by that of the hair which among the egyptians the best philosophers in the world was of such importance that they put to death all the redhaired men who fell into their hands the negroes prefer a glass necklace to that gold which polite nations so highly value can there be a greater proof of their wanting commonsense     it is impossible for us to suppose these creatures to be men because allowing them to be men a suspicion would follow that we ourselves are not christians weak minds exaggerate too much the wrong done to the africans for were the case as they state it would the european powers who make so many needless conventions among themselves have failed to enter into a general one in behalf of humanity and compassion chap vi the true origin of the right of slavery it is time to enquire into the true origin of the right of slavery it ought to be founded on the nature of things let us see if there be any cases where it can be derived from thence in all despotic governments people make no difficulty in selling themselves the political slavery in some measure annihilates the civil liberty according to mr perry the muscovites sell themselves very readily their reason for it is evident their liberty is not worth keeping at achim every one is for selling himself some of the chief lords† have not less than a thousand slaves all principal merchants who have a great number of slaves themselves and these also are not without their slaves their masters are their heirs and put them into trade in those states the freemen being overpowered by the government have no better resource than that of making themselves slaves to the tyrants in office     this is the true and rational origin of that mild law of slavery which obtains in some countries and mild it ought to be as founded on the free choice a man makes of a master for his own benefit which forms a mutual convention betwixt the two parties chap vii another origin of the right of slavery there is another origin of the right of slavery and even of the most cruel slavery which is to be seen among men there are countries where the excess of heat enervates the body and renders men so slothful and dispirited that nothing but the fear of chastisement can oblige them to perform any laborious duty slavery is there more reconcileable to reason and the master being as lazy with respect to his sovereign as his slave is with regard to him this adds a political to a civil slavery aristotle‡ endeavours to prove that there are natural slaves but what he says is far from proving it if there be any such i believe they are those of whom i have been speaking but as all men are born equal slavery must be accounted unnatural though in some countries it be founded on natural reason and a wide difference ought to be made betwixt such countries and those in which even natural reason rejects it as in europe where it has been so happily abolished plutarch in the life of numa says that in saturns time there was neither slave nor master christianity has restored that age in our climates     chap viii inutility of slavery among us natural slavery then is to be limited to some particular parts of the world in all other countries even the most servile drudgeries may be performed by freemen experience verifies my assertion before christianity had abolished civil slavery in europe working in the mines was judged too toilsome for any but slaves or malefactors at present there are men employed in them who are known to live comfortably the magistrates have by some small privileges encouraged this profession to an increase of labour they have joined an increase of gain and have gone so far as to make those people better pleased with their condition than with any other which they could have embraced no labour is so heavy but it may be brought to a level with the workmans strength when regulated by equity and not by avarice the violent fatigues which slaves are made to undergo in other parts may be supplied by a skilful use of ingenious machines the turkish mines in the bannat of temeswear though richer than those of hungary did not yield so much because the working of them depended entirely on the strength of their slaves i know not whether this article be dictated by my understanding or by my heart possibly there is not that climate upon earth where the most laborious services might not with proper encouragement be performed by freemen bad laws having made lazy men they have been reduced to slavery because of their laziness     chap ix several kinds of slavery slavery is of two kinds real and personal the real annexes the slave to the land which tacitus makes† the condition of slaves among the germans they were not employed in the family a stated tribute of corn cattle or other moveables paid to their master was the whole of their servitude and such a servitude still continues in hungary bohemia and several parts of lowergermany personal slavery consists in domestic services and relates more to the masters person the worst degree of slavery is when it is at once both real and personal as that of the helotes among the lacedæmonians they underwent the fatigues of the field and suffered all manner of insults at home this helotism is contrary to the nature of things real slavery is to be found only among nations‡ remarkable for their simplicity of life all familybusiness being done by the wives and children personal slavery is peculiar to voluptuous nations luxury requiring the service of slaves in the house but helotism joins in the same person the slavery established by voluptuous nations and that of the most simple chap x regulations necessary in respect to slavery but of whatsoever kind the slavery be the civil laws should endeavour on the one hand to abolish the abuses of it and on the other to guard against its dangers   0 chap xi abuses of slavery in mahometan states∥ not only the life and goods of female slaves but also what is called their virtue or honour are at their masters disposal one of the misfortunes of those countries is that the greatest part of the nation are born only to be subservient to the pleasures of the other this servitude is alleviated only by the laziness in which such slaves spend their days which is an additional disadvantage to the state it is this indolence which renders the§ eastern seraglios so delightful to those very persons whom they were made to confine people who dread nothing but labour may imagine themselves happy in those places of indolence and ease but this shews how contrary they are to the very intent of the institution of slavery reason requires that the masters power should not extend to what does not appertain to his service slavery should be calculated for utility and not for pleasure the laws of chastity arise from those of nature and ought in all nations to be respected if a law which preserves the chastity of slaves be good in those states where an arbitrary power bears down all before it how much more will it be so in monarchies and how much more still in republics the law of the lombards¶ has a regulation which ought to be adopted by all governments if a master debauch his slaves wife the slave and his wife shall be restored to their freedom an admirable     expedient which without severity lays a powerful restraint on the incontinence of masters the romans seem to have erred on this head they allowed an unlimited scope to the masters lusts and in some measure denied their slaves the privilege of marrying it is true they were the lowest part of the nation yet there should have been some care taken of their morals especially as in prohibiting their marriage they corrupted the morals of the citizens chap xii danger from the multitude of slaves the multitude of slaves has different effects in different governments it is no grievance in a despotic state where the political servitude of the whole body takes away the sense of civil slavery those who are called freemen in reality are little more so than they who do not come within that class and as the latter in quality of eunuchs freedmen or slaves have generally the management of all affairs the condition of a freeman and that of a slave are very nearly allied this makes it therefore almost a matter of indifference whether in such states the slaves be few or numerous but in moderate governments it is a point of the highest importance that there should not be a great number of slaves the political liberty of those states adds to the value of civil liberty and he who is deprived of the latter is also bereft of the former he sees the happiness of a society of which he is not so much as a member he sees the security of others fenced by laws himself without any protection he perceives that his master has a soul capable of enlarging itself while his own labours under a continual     depression nothing more assimilates a man to a beast than living among freemen himself a slave such people as these are natural enemies of the society and their number must be dangerous it is not therefore to be wondered at that moderate governments have been so frequently disturbed by the revolts of slaves and that this so seldom happens in despotic states chap xiii of armed slaves the danger of arming slaves is not so great in monarchies as in republics in the former a warlike people and a body of nobility are a sufficient check upon these armed slaves whereas the pacific members of a republic would have a hard task to quell a set of men who having offensive weapons in their hands would find themselves a match for the citizens the goths who conquered spain spread themselves over the country and soon became very weak they made three important regulations they abolished an ancient custom which prohibited intermarriages with the† romans they enacted that all the freedmen‡ belonging to the fiscus should serve in war under penalty of being reduced to slavery and they ordained that each goth should arm and bring into the field the tenth part∥ of his slaves this was but a small proportion besides these slaves thus carried to the field did not form a separate body     they were in the army and might be said to continue in the family chap xiv the same subject continued when a whole nation is of a martial temper the slaves in arms are less to be feared by a law of the allemands a slave who had committed a clandestine theft§ was liable to the same punishment as a freeman in the like case but if he was found guilty of an open robbery¶ he was only bound to restore the things so taken among the allemands courage and intrepidity extenuated the guilt of an action they employed their slaves in their wars most republics have been attentive to dispirit their slaves but the allemands relying on themselves and being always armed were so far from fearing theirs that they were rather for augmenting their courage they were the instruments either of their depredations or of their glory chap xv precautions to be used in moderate governments lenity and humane treatment may prevent the dangers to be apprehended from the multitude of slaves in a moderate government men grow reconciled to every thing and even to servitude if not aggravated by the severity of the master the athenians treated their slaves with great lenity and this secured that state from the commotions raised by the slaves among the austere lacedæmonians     it does not appear that the primitive romans met with any trouble from their slaves those civil broils which have been compared to the punic wars were the consequence of their having divested themselves of all humanity towards their slaves a frugal and laborious people generally treat their slaves more kindly than those who are above labour the primitive romans used to live work and eat with their slaves in short they behaved towards them with justice and humanity the greatest punishment they made them suffer was to make them pass before their neighbours with a forked piece of wood on their backs their manners were sufficient to secure the fidelity of their slaves so that there was no necessity for laws but when the romans aggrandized themselves when their slaves were no longer the companions of their labour but the instruments of their luxury and pride as they then wanted morals they had need of laws it was even necessary for these laws to be of the most terrible kind in order to establish the safety of those cruel masters who lived with their slaves as in the midst of enemies they made the syllanian senatusconsultum and other laws† which decreed that when a master was murdered all the slaves under the same roof or in any place so near the house as to be within the hearing of a mans voice should without distinction be condemned to die those who in this case sheltered a slave in order to save him were punished as murderers‡ he whom his master∥ ordered     to kill him and who obeyed was reputed guilty even he who did not hinder him from killing himself was liable to be punished§ if a master was murdered on a journey they put to death¶ those who were with him and those who fled all these laws took place even against persons whose innocence was proved the intent of them was to inspire their slaves with a prodigious respect for their master they were not dependent on the civil government but on a fault or imperfection of the civil government they were not derived from the equity of civil laws since they were contrary to the principle of those laws they were properly founded on the principles of war with this difference that the enemies were in the bosom of the state the syllanian senatusconsultum was derived from the law of nations which requires that a society however imperfect should be preserved it is a misfortune in government when the magistrates thus find themselves under a necessity of making cruel laws because they have rendered obedience difficult they are obliged to increase the penalty of disobedience or to suspect the slaves sidelity a prudent legislator foresees the ill consequences of rendering the legislature terrible the slaves amongst the romans could have no confidence in the laws and therefore the laws could have none in them     chap xvi regulations between masters and slaves the magistrate ought to take care that the slave has his food and raiment and this should be regulated by law the laws ought to provide that care be taken of them in sickness and old age claudius decreed that the slaves who in sickness had been abandoned by their masters should in case they recovered be emancipated this law insured their liberty but should not there have been some care also taken to preserve their lives when the law permitted a master to take away the life of his slave he was invested with a power which he ought to exercise as judge and not as master it was necessary therefore that the law should ordain those formalities which remove the suspicion of an act of violence when fathers at rome were no longer permitted to put their children to death the magistrates ordained the† punishment which the father would have inflicted a like custom between the master and his slaves would be highly reasonable in a country where masters have the power of life and death the law of moses was extremely severe if a man struck his servant so that he died under his hand he was to be punished but if he survived a day or two no punishment ensued because he was his money‡ strange that a civil institution should thus relax the law of nature     by a law of the greeks∥ a slave too severely treated by his master might insist upon being sold to another in latter times there was a law of the same nature§ at rome a master displeased with his slave and a slave with his master ought to be separated when a citizen uses the slave of another ill the latter ought to have the liberty of complaining before the judge the laws¶ of plato and of most nations took away from slaves the right of natural defence it was necessary then that they should give them a civil defence at sparta slaves could have no justice against either insults or injuries so excessive was their misery that they were not only the slaves of a citizen but also of the public they belonged to all as well as to one at rome when they considered the injury done to a slave they had regard only to the interest of the master in the breach of the aquilian law they confounded a wound given to a beast and that given to a slave they regarded only the diminution of their value at athens† he who abused the slave of another was punished severely and sometimes even with death the law of athens was very reasonable in not adding the loss of security to that of liberty chap xvii of infranchisements it is easy to perceive that many slaves in a republican government create a necessity of making     many free the evil is if they have too great a number of slaves they cannot keep them in due bounds if they have too many freedmen they cannot live and must become a burthen to the republic besides it may be as much in danger from the multitude of freedmen as from that of slaves it is necessary therefore that the law should have an eye to these two inconveniences the several laws and decrees of the senate made at rome both for and against slaves sometimes to limit and at other times to facilitate their infranchisement plainly shew the embarrassment in which they found themselves in this respect there were even times in which they durst not make laws when under nero‡ they demanded of the senate a permission for the masters to reduce again to slavery the ungrateful freedmen the emperor declared that it was their duty to decide the affairs of individuals and to make no general decree much less can i determine what ought to be the regulations of a good republic in such an affair this depends on too many circumstances let us however make some reflections a considerable number of freedmen ought not suddenly to be made by a general law we know that among the volsinienses∥ the freedmen becoming masters of the suffrages enacted an abominable law which gave them the right of lying the first night with the young women married to the freeborn there are several ways of insensibly introducing new citizens into a republic the laws may favour the acquiring a peculium and put slaves into a condition of buying their liberty they may prescribe a     term of servitude like those of moses which limited that of the§ hebrew slaves to six years it is easy to enfranchise every year a certain number of those slaves who by their age health or industry are capable of getting a subsistence the evil may be even cured in its root as a great number of slaves are connected with the several employments which are given them to divide amongst the free born a part of these employments for example commerce or navigation is diminishing the number of slaves when there are many freedmen it is necessary that the civil laws should determine what they owe to their patron or that these duties should be fixed by the contract of infranchisement it is certain that their condition should be more favoured in the civil than in the political state because even in a popular government the power ought not to fall into the hands of the vulgar at rome where they had so many freedmen the political laws with regard to them were admirable they gave them very little and excluded them almost from nothing they had even a share in the legislature but the resolutions they were capable of taking were almost of no weight they might bear a part in the public offices and even in the dignity of the priesthood¶ but this privilege was in some sort rendered useless by the disadvantages they had to encounter in the elections they had a right to enter into the army but they were to be registered in a certain class of the census before they could be soldiers nothing hindered the freedmen from being united by marriage with the families of the freeborn but they were not permitted to   0 mix with those of the senators in short their children were freeborn though they were not so themselves chap xviii of freedmen and eunuchs thus in a republican government it is frequently of advantage that the situation of the freedmen be but little below that of the freeborn and that the laws be calculated to remove a dislike of their condition but in a despotic government where luxury and arbitrary power prevail they have nothing to do in this respect the freedmen generally find themselves above the freeborn they rule in the court of the prince and in the palaces of the great and as they study the foibles and not the virtues of their master they lead him intirely by the former not by the latter such were the freedmen of rome in the times of the emperors when the principal slaves are eunuchs let never so many privileges be granted them they can hardly be regarded as freedmen for as they are incapable of having a family of their own they are naturally attached to that of another and it is only by a kind of fiction that they are considered as citizens and yet there are countries where the magistracy is intirely in their hands in† tonquin says dampier‡ all the mandarins civil and military are eunuchs they have no families and though they are naturally avaricious the master or the prince benefits in the end by this very passion dampier tells us too that in this country the eunuchs cannot live without women and therefore     marry the law which permits their marriage may be founded partly on their respect for these eunuchs and partly on their contempt of the fairsex thus they are trusted with the magistracy because they have no family and permitted to marry because they are magistrates then it is that the sense which remains would fain supply that which they have lost and the enterprises of despair become a kind of enjoyment so in milton that spirit who has nothing left but desires enraged at his degradation would make use of his impotency itself we see in the history of china a great number of laws to deprive eunuchs of all civil and military employments but they always returned to them again it seems as if the eunuchs of the east were a necessary evil book xvi how the laws of domestic slavery have a relation to the nature of the climate chap i of domestic servitude slaves are established for the family but they are not a part of it thus i distinguish their servitude from that which the women in some countries suffer and which i shall properly call domestic servitude     chap ii that in the countries of the south there is a natural inequality between the two sexes women in hot climates are marriageable at eight nine or ten years of age thus in those countries infancy and marriage generally go together they are old at twenty their reason therefore never accompanies their beauty when beauty demands the empire the want of reason forbids the claim when reason is obtained beauty is no more these women ought then to be in a state of dependence for reason cannot procure in old age that empire which even youth and beauty could not give it is therefore extremely natural that in these places a man when no law opposes it should leave one wife to take another and that polygamy should be introduced in temperate climates where the charms of women are best preserved where they arrive later at maturity and have children at a more advanced season of life the old age of their husbands in some degree follows theirs and as they have more reason and knowledge at the time of marriage if it be only on account of their having continued longer in life it must naturally introduce a kind of equality between the two sexes and in consequence of this the law of having only one wife in cold countries the almost necessary custom of drinking strong liquors establishes intemperance amongst men women who in this respect have     a natural restraint because they are always on the defensive have therefore the advantage of reason over them nature which has distinguished men by their reason and bodily strength has set no other bounds to their power than those of this strength and reason it has given charms to women and ordained that their ascendant over man shall end with these charms but in hot countries these are found only at the beginning and never in the progress of life thus the law which permits only one wife is physically conformable to the climate of europe and not to that of asia this is the reason why mahometanism was so easily established in asia and with such difficulty extended in europe why christianity is maintained in europe and has been destroyed in asia and in fine why the mahometans have made such progress in china and the christians so little human reasons however are subordinate to that supreme cause who does whatever he pleases and renders every thing subservient to his will some particular reasons induced valentinian† to permit polygamy in the empire that law so improper for our climates was abrogated‡ by theodosius arcadius and honorius chap iii that a plurality of wives greatly depends on the means of supporting them though in countries where polygamy is once established the number of wives is principally determined by the opulence of the husband yet it cannot be said that opulence established polygamy in     those states since poverty may produce the same effect as i shall prove when i come to speak of the savages polygamy in powerful nations is less a luxury in itself than the occasion of great luxury in hot∥ climates they have few wants and it costs little to maintain a wife and children they may therefore have a great number of wives chap iv that the law of polygamy is an affair that depends on calculation according to the calculations made in several parts of europe there are here born more boys than girls§ on the contrary by the accounts we have of asia there are there born more¶ girls than boys the law which in europe allows only one wife and that in asia which permits many have therefore a certain relation to the climate in the cold climates of asia there are born as in europe more males than females and from hence say the lamas is derived the reason of that law which amongst them permits a woman to have† many husbands but it is difficult for me to believe that there are many countries where the disproportion can be great enough for any exigency to justify the introducing     either the law in favour of many wives or that of many husbands this would only imply that a majority of women or even a majority of men is more conformable to nature in certain countries than in others i confess that if what history tells us be true that at bantam‡ there are ten women to one man this must be a case particularly favourable to polygamy in all this i only give their reasons but do not justify their customs chap v the reason of a law of malabar in the tribe of the naires∥ on the coast of malabar the men can have only one wife while a woman on the contrary may have many husbands the origin of this custom is not i believe difficult to discover the naires are the tribe of nobles who who are the soldiers of all those nations in europe soldiers are forbid to marry in malabar where the climate requires greater indulgence they are satisfied with rendering marriage as little burthensome to them as possible they give one wife amongst many men which consequently diminishes the attachment to a family and the cares of housekeeping and leaves them in the free possession of a military spirit     chap vi of polygamy considered in itself with regard to polygamy in general independently of the circumstances which may render it tolerable it is not of the least service to mankind nor to either of the two sexes whether it be that which abuses or that which is abused neither is it of service to the children for one of its greatest inconveniences is that the father and mother cannot have the same affection for their offspring a father cannot love twenty children with the same tenderness as a mother can love two it is much worse when a wife has many husbands for then paternal love is only held by this opinion that a father may believe if he will or that others may believe that certain children belong to him they say that the emperor of morocco has women of all colours white black and tawny in his seraglio but the wretch has scarcely need of a single colour besides the possession of many wives does not always prevent their entertaining desires§ for those of others it is with lust as with avarice whose thirst increases by the acquisition of treasure in the reign of justinian many philosophers displeased with the constraint of christianity retired into persia what struck them the most says agathias¶ was that polygamy was permitted amongst men who did not even abstain from adultery may i not say that a plurality of wives leads to that passion which nature disallows for one depravation always draws on another i remember that in the revolution which happened at constantinople     when sultan achmet was deposed history says that the people having plundered the kiayas house they found not a single woman they tell us that at algiers in the greatest part of their seraglios they have none at all chap vii of an equality of treatment in case of many wives from the law which permitted a plurality of wives followed that of an equal behaviour to each mahomet who allowed of four would have every thing as provisions dress and conjugal duty equally divided between them this law is also in force in the maldivian isles† where they are at liberty to marry three wives the law of moses‡ even declares that if any one has married his son to a slave and this son should afterwards espouse a free woman her food her raiment and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish they might give more to the new wife but the first was not to have less than she had before chap viii of the separation of women from men the prodigious number of wives possessed by those who live in rich and voluptuous countries is a consequence of the law of polygamy their separation from men and their close confinement naturally follow from the greatness of this number domestic order renders this necessary thus an insolvent debtor seeks to conceal himself from the pursuit of his creditors     there are climates where the impulses of nature have such force that morality has almost none if a man be left with a woman the temptation and the fall will be the same thing the attack certain the resistance none in these countries instead of precepts they have recourse to bolts and bars one of the chinese classic authors considers the man as a prodigy of virtue who finding a woman alone in a distant apartment can forbear making use of force∥ chap ix of the connexion between domestic and political government in a republic the condition of citizens is moderate equal mild and agreeable every thing partakes of the benefit of public liberty an empire over the women cannot amongst them be so well exerted and where the climate demands this empire it is most agreeable to a monarchical government this is one of the reasons why it has ever been difficult to establish a popular government in the east on the contrary the slavery of women is perfectly conformable to the genius of a despotic government which delights in treating all with severity thus at all times have we seen in asia domestic slavery and despotic government walk hand in hand with an equal pace in a government which requires above all things that a particular regard be paid to its tranquility and     where the extreme subordination calls for peace it is absolutely necessary to shut up the women for their intrigues would prove fatal to their husbands a government which has not time to examine into the conduct of its subjects views them with a suspicious eye only because they appear and suffer themselves to be known let us only suppose that the levity of mind the indiscretions the tastes and caprices of our women attended by their passions of a higher and a lower kind with all their active fire and in that full liberty with which they appear amongst us were conveyed into an eastern government where would be the father of a family who could enjoy a moments repose the men would be every where suspected every where enemies the state would be overturned and the kingdom overflowed with rivers of blood chap x the principle on which the morals of the east are founded in the case of a multiplicity of wives the more a family ceases to be united the more ought the laws to reunite its detached parts in a common center and the greater the diversity of interests the more necessary it is for the laws to bring them back to a common interest this is more particularly done by confinement the women should not only be separated from the men by the walls of the house but they ought also to be separated in the same inclosure in such a manner that each may have a distinct household in the same family from hence each derives all that relates to the practice of morality modesty chastity reserve silence peace dependence respect and love   0 and in short a general direction of her thoughts to that which in its own nature is a thing of the greatest importance a single and entire attachment to her family women have naturally so many duties to fulfil duties which are peculiarly theirs that they cannot be sufficiently excluded from every thing capable of inspiring other ideas from every thing that goes by the name of amusements and from every thing which we call business we find the manners more pure in the several parts of the east in proportion as the confinement of women is more strictly observed in great kingdoms there are necessarily great lords the greater their wealth the more enlarged is their ability of keeping their wives in an exact confinement and of preventing them from entering again into society from hence it proceeds that in the empires of turkey persia of the mogul china and japan the manners of their wives are admirable but the case is not the same in india where a multitude of islands and the situation of the land have divided the country into an infinite number of petty states which from causes that we have not here room to mention are rendered despotic there are none there but wretches some pillaging and others pillaged their grandees have very moderate fortunes and those whom they call rich have only a bare subsistence the confinement of their women cannot therefore be very strict nor can they make use of any great precautions to keep them within due bounds from hence it proceeds that the corruption of their manners is scarcely to be conceived we may there see to what an extreme the vices of a climate indulged in the full liberty will carry     licentiousness it is there that nature has a force and modesty a weakness which exceeds all comprehension at patan† the wanton desires of the women are so outrageous that the men are obliged to make use of a certain apparel to shelter them from their designs according to mr smith‡ things are not better conducted in the petty kingdoms of guinea in these countries the two sexes lose even those laws which properly belong to each chap xi of domestic slavery independently of polygamy it is not only a plurality of wives which in certain places of the east requires their confinement but also the climate itself those who consider the horrible crimes the treachery the dark villanies the poisonings the assassinations which the liberty of women has occasioned at goa and in the portuguese settlements in the indies where religion permits only one wife and who compare them with the innocence and purity of manners of the women of turkey persia indostan china and japan will clearly see that it is frequently as necessary to separate them from the men when they have but one as when they have many     these are things which ought to be decided by the climate what purpose would it answer to shut up women in our northern countries where their manners are naturally good where all their passions are calm and where love rules over the heart with so regular and gentle an empire that the least degree of prudence is sufficient to conduct it it is a happiness to live in those climates which permit such a freedom of converse where that sex which has most charms seems to embellish society and where wives reserving themselves for the pleasures of one contribute to the amusement of all chap xii of natural modesty all nations are equally agreed in fixing contempt and ignominy on the incontinence of women nature has dictated this to all she has established the attack and she has established too the resistance and having implanted desires in both she has given to the one boldness and to the other shame to individuals she has granted a long succession of years to attend to their preservation but to continue the species she has granted only a moment it is then far from being true that to be incontinent is to follow the laws of nature on the contrary it is a violation of these laws which can be observed only by behaving with modesty and discretion besides it is natural for intelligent beings to feel their imperfections nature has therefore fixed shame in our minds a shame of our imperfections when therefore the physical power of certain climates violates the natural law of the two sexes and that of intelligent beings it belongs to the legislature to make civil laws with a view of opposing the     nature of the climate and reestablishing the primitive laws chap xiii of jealousy with respect to nations we ought to distinguish between the passion of jealousy and a jealousy arising from customs manners and laws the one is a hot raging fever the other cold but sometimes terrible may be joined with indifference and contempt the one an abuse of love derives its source from love itself the other depends only on manners on the customs of a nation on the laws of the country and sometimes even on religion it is generally the effect of the physical power of the climate and at the same time the remedy of this physical power chap xiv of the eastern manner of domestic government wives are changed so often in the east that they cannot have the power of domestic government this care is therefore committed to the eunuchs whom they intrust with their keys and the management of their families in persia says sir john chardin married women are furnished with clothes as they want them after the manner of children thus that care which seems so well to become them that care which every where else is the first of their concern does not at all regard them     chap xv of divorce and repudiation there is this difference between a divorce and a repudiation that the former is made by mutual consent arising from a mutual antipathy while the latter is formed by the will and for the advantage of one of the two parties independently of the will and advantage of the other the necessity there is sometimes for women to repudiate and the difficulty there always is in doing it render that law very tyrannical which gives this right to men without granting it to women a husband is the master of the house he has a thousand ways of confining his wife to her duty or of bringing her back to it so that in his hands it seems as if repudiation could be only a fresh abuse of power but a wife who repudiates only makes use of a dreadful kind of remedy it is always a great misfortune for her to go in search of a second husband when she has lost the most part of her attractions with another one of the advantages attending the charms of youth in the female sex is that in an advanced age the husband is led to complacency and love by the remembrance of past pleasures it is then a general rule that in all countries where the laws have given to men the power of repudiating they ought also to grant it to women nay in climates where women live in domestic slavery one would think that the law ought to favour women with the right of repudiation and husbands only with that of divorce when wives are confined in a seraglio the husband ought not to repudiate on account of an opposition of manners it is the husbands fault if their manners are incompatible     repudiation on account of the barrenness of the woman ought never to take place but where there is only one wife when there are many this is of no importance to the husband a law of the maldivians† permitted them to take again a wife whom they had repudiated a law of mexico‡ forbad their being reunited under pain of death the law of mexico was more rational than that of the maldivians at the time even of the dissolution it attended to the perpetuity of marriage instead of this the law of the maldivians seemed equally to sport with marriage and repudiation the law of mexico admitted only of divorce this was a particular reason for their not permitting those who were voluntarily separated to be ever reunited repudiation seems chiefly to proceed from a hastiness of temper and from the dictates of passion while divorce appears to be an affair of deliberation divorces are frequently of great political use but as to the civil utility they are established only for the advantage of the husband and wife and are not always favourable to their children chap xvi of repudiation and divorce amongst the romans romulus permitted a husband to repudiate his wife if she had committed adultery prepared poison or procured false keys he did not grant to women the right of repudiating their husbands plutarch∥ calls this a law extremely severe     as the athenian law gave§ the power of repudiation to the wife as well as to the husband and as this right was obtained by the women amongst the primitive romans notwithstanding the law of romulus it is evident that this institution was one of those which the deputies of rome brought from athens and which were inserted into the laws of the twelve tables cicero¶ says that the reasons of repudiation sprung from the law of the twelve tables we cannot then doubt but that this law increased the number of the reasons for repudiation established by romulus the power of divorce was also an appointment or at least a consequence of the law of the twelve tables for from the moment that the wife or the husband had separately the right of repudiation there was a much stronger reason for their having the power of quitting each other by mutual consent the law did not require that they should lay open the causes of divorce in the nature of the thing the reasons for repudiation should be given while those for a divorce are unnecessary because whatever causes the law may admit as sufficient to break a marriage a mutual antipathy must be stronger than them all the following fact mentioned by dionysius halicarnassensis‡ valerius maximus∥ and aulus gellius§§ does not appear to me to have the least degree of probability though they had at rome say they the power of repudiating a wife yet they had so much respect for the auspices that nobody for the     space of five hundred and twenty years ever made† life of this right till carvilius ruga repudiated his because of her sterility we need only be sensible of the nature of the human mind to perceive how very extraordinary it must be for a law to grant such right to a whole nation and yet for nobody to make use of it coriolanus setting out on his exile advised his¶ wife to marry a man more happy than himself we have just been seeing that the law of the twelve tables and the manners of the romans greatly extended the law of romulus but to what purpose were these extensions if they never made use of a power to repudiate besides if the citizens had such a respect for the auspices that they would never repudiate how came the legislators of rome to have less than they and how came the laws incessantly to corrupt their manners all that is surprizing in the fact in question will soon disappear only by comparing two passages in plutarch the regal law permitted a husband to repudiate in the three cases already mentioned and it enjoined says plutarch§ that he who repudiated in any other case should be obliged to give the half of his substance to his wife and that the other half should be consecrated to ceres they might then repudiate in all cases if they were but willing to submit to the penalty nobody had done this before carvilius ruga‡ who as plutarch says in another place∥ put away his wife for her sterility     two hundred and thirty years after romulus that is she was repudiated seventy one years before the law of the twelve tables which extended both the power and causes of repudiation the authors i have cited say that carvilius ruga loved his wife but that the censors made him take an oath to put her away because of her barrenness to the end that he might give children to the republic and that this rendered him odious to the people we must know the genius and temper of the romans before we can discover the true cause of the hatred they had conceived against carvilius he did not fall into disgrace with the people for repudiating his wife this was an affair that did not at all concern them but carvilius had taken an oath to the censors that by reason of the sterility of his wife he would repudiate her to give children to the republic this was a yoke which the people saw the censors were going to put upon them i shall discover in the prosecution of this work§ the repugnance which they always felt to regulations of the like kind but whence can such a contradiction betwixt those authors arise it is because plutarch examined into a fact and the others have recounted a prodigy     book xvii how the laws of political servitude have a relation to the nature of the climate chap i of political servitude political servitude does not less depend on the nature of the climate than on that which is civil and domestic and this we shall now demonstrate chap ii the difference between nations in point of courage we have already observed that great heat enervates the strength and courage of men and that in cold climates they have a certain vigour of body and mind which renders them patient and intrepid and qualifies them for arduous enterprizes this remark holds good not only between different nations but even in the different parts of the same country in the north of china¶ people are more courageous than those in the south and those in the south of corea have less bravery than those in the north we ought not then to be astonished that the effeminacy of the people in hot climates has almost always rendered them slaves and that the bravery of those in cold climates has enabled them to maintain their liberties this is an effect which springs from a natural cause this has also been found true in america the despotic empires of mexico and peru were near the   0 line and almost all the little free nations were and still are near the poles chap iii of the climate of asia the relations of travellers† inform us that the vast continent of the north of asia which extends from forty degrees or thereabouts to the pole and from the frontiers of muscovy even to the eastern ocean is in an extremely cold climate that this immense tract of land is divided by a chain of mountains which runs from west to east leaving siberia on the north and greattartary on the south that the climate of siberia is so cold that excepting a few places it is unsusceptible of cultivation and that though the russians have settlements all along the irtis they cultivate nothing that this country produces only some little firs and shrubs that the natives of the country are divided into wretched hords or tribes like those of canada that the reason of this cold proceeds on the one hand from the height of the land and on the other from the mountains which in proportion as they run from south to north are levelled in such a manner that the north wind every where blows without opposition that this wind which renders nova zembla uninhabitable blowing in siberia makes it a barren waste that in europe on the contrary the mountains of norway and lapland are admirable bulwarks which cover the northern countries from the wind so that at stockholm which is about fiftynine degrees latitude the earth     produces plants fruits and corn and that about abo which is sixtyone degrees and even to sixtythree and sixtyfour there are mines of silver and the land is fruitful enough we see also in these relations that greattartary situated to the south of siberia is also exceeding cold that the country will not admit of cultivation that nothing can be found but pasturage for their flocks and herds that trees will not grow there but only brambles as in iceland that there are near china and india some countries where there grows a kind of millet but that neither corn nor rice will ripen that there is scarcely a place in chinese tartary at fortythree fortyfour and fortyfive degrees where it does not freeze seven or eight months in the year so that it is as cold as iceland though it might be imagined from its situation to be as hot as the south of france that there are no cities except four or five towards the eastern ocean and some which the chinese for political reasons have built near china that in the rest of greattartary there are only a few situated in buchar turquestan and cathay that the reason of this extreme cold proceeds from the nature of the nitrous earth full of saltpetre and sand and more particularly from the height of the land father verbiest found that a certain place eighty leagues north of the great wall towards the source of kavamhuran exceeded the height of the sea near pekin three thousand geometrical paces that this height is the cause that though almost all the great rivers of asia have their source in this country there is however so great a want of water that it can be inhabited only near the rivers and lakes     these facts being laid down i reason thus asia has properly no temperate zone as the places situated in a very cold climate immediately touch upon those which are exceeding hot that is turkey persia india china corea and japan in europe on the contrary the temperate zone is very extensive though situated in climates widely different from each other there being no affinity between the climates of spain and italy and those of norway and sweden but as the climate grows insensibly cold upon our advancing from south to north nearly in proportion to the latitude of each country it thence follows that each resembles the country joining to it that there is no very extraordinary difference between them and that as i have just said the temperate zone is very extensive from hence it comes that in asia the strong nations are opposed to the weak the warlike brave and active people touch immediately on those who are indolent effeminate and timorous the one must therefore conquer and the other be conquered in europe on the contrary strong nations are opposed to the strong and those who join to each other have nearly the same courage this is the grand reason of the weakness of asia and of the strength of europe of the liberty of europe and of the slavery of asia a cause that i do not recollect ever to have seen remarked from hence it proceeds that liberty in asia never increases whilst in europe it is enlarged or diminished according to particular circumstances the russian nobility have indeed been reduced to slavery by the ambition of one of their princes but they have always discovered those marks of impatience and discontent which are never to be seen in the southern climates have they not been able     for a short time to establish an aristocratical government another of the northern kingdoms has lost its laws but we may trust to the climate that they are not lost in such a manner as never to be recovered chap iv the consequences resulting from this what we have now said is perfectly conformable to history asia has been subdued thirteen times eleven by the northern nations and twice by those of the south in the early ages it was conquered three times by the scythians afterwards it was subdued once by the medes and once by the persians again by the greeks the arabs the moguls the turks the tartars the persians and the afghans i mention only the upperasia and say nothing of the invasions made in the rest of the south of that part of the world which has most frequently suffered prodigious revolutions in europe on the contrary since the establishment of the greek and phœnician colonies we know but of four great changes the first caused by the conquest of the romans the second by the inundation of barbarians who destroyed those very romans the third by the victories of charlemagne and the last by the invasions of the normans and if this be rightly examined we shall find even in these changes a general strength diffused through all the parts of europe we know the difficulty which the romans met with in conquering europe and the ease and facility with which they invaded asia we are sensible of the difficulties the northern nations had to encounter in overturning the roman empire of the wars and labours of charlemagne and of the     several enterprizes of the normans the destroyers were incessantly destroyed chap v that when the people in the north of asia and those of the north of europe made conquests the effects of the conquest were not the same the nations in the north of europe conquered as freemen the people in the north of asia conquered as slaves and subdued others only to gratify the ambition of a master the reason is that the people of tartary the natural conquerors of asia are themselves enslaved they are incessantly making conquests in the south of asia where they form empires but that part of the nation which continues in the country find that they are subject to a great master who being despotic in the south will likewise be so in the north and exercising an arbitrary power over the vanquished subjects pretends to the same over the conquerors this is at present most conspicuous in that vast country called chinese tartary which is governed by the emperor with a power almost as despotic as that of china itself and which he every day extends by his conquests we may likewise see in the history of china that the emperors sent chinese colonies into tartary these chinese are become tartars and the mortal enemies of china but this does not prevent their carrying into tartary the spirit of the chinese government a part of the tartars who were conquerors have very often been themselves expelled when they have carried into their desarts that servile spirit which     they had acquired in the climate of slavery the history of china furnishes us with strong proofs of this assertion as does also our ancient† history from hence it proceeds that the genius of the getic or tartarian nation has always resembled that of the empires of asia the people in these are governed by the cudgel the inhabitants of tartary by whips the spirit of europe has ever been contrary to these manners and in all ages what the people of asia have called punishment those of europe have deemed the most outrageous abuse‡ the tartars who destroyed the grecian empire established in the conquered countries slavery and despotic power the goths after subduing the roman empire founded monarchy and liberty i do not know whether the famous rudbeck who in his atlantica has bestowed such praises on scandinavia has made mention of that great prerogative which ought to set this people above all the nations upon earth namely this countrys having been the source of the liberties of europe that is of almost all the freedom which at present subsists among mankind jornadez the goth called the north of europe the forge∥ of the human race i should rather call it the forge where those weapons were framed which broke the chains of southern nations in the north were formed those valiant people who sallied forth and deserted their countries to destroy tyrants and slaves and to teach men that nature having made     them equal reason could not render them dependent except where it was necessary to their happiness chap vi a new physical cause of the slavery of asia and of the liberty of europe in asia they have always had great empires in europe these could never subsist asia has larger plains it is cut out into much more extensive divisions by mountains and seas and as it lies more to the south its springs are more easily dried up the mountains are less covered with snow and the rivers being not§ so large form more contracted barriers power in asia ought then to be always despotic for if their slavery were not severe they would soon make a division inconsistent with the nature of the country in europe the natural division forms many nations of a moderate extent in which the ruling by laws is not incompatible with the maintenance of the state on the contrary it is so favourable to it that without this the state would fall into decay and become a prey to its neighbours it is this which has formed a genius for liberty that renders every part extremely difficult to be subdued and subjected to a foreign power otherwise than by the laws and the advantage of commerce on the contrary there reigns in asia a servile spirit which they have never been able to shake off and it is impossible to find in all the histories of that country a single passage which discovers a freedom     of spirit we shall never see any thing there but the excess of slavery chap vii of africa and america this is what i had to say of asia and europe africa is in a climate like that of the south of asia and is in the same servitude america¶ being lately destroyed and repeopled by the nations of europe and africa can now scarcely display its genuine spirit but what we know of its ancient history is very conformable to our principles chap viii of the capital of the empire one of the consequences of what we have been mentioning is that it is of the utmost importance to a great prince to make a proper choice of the seat of his empire he who places it to the southward will be in danger of losing the north but he who fixes it on the north may easily preserve the south i do not speak of particular cases in mechanics there are frictions by which the effects of the theory are frequently changed or retarded and policy hath also its frictions     book xviii of laws in the relation they bear to the nature of the soil chap i how the nature of the soil has an influence on the laws the goodness of the land in any country naturally establishes subjection and dependence the husbandmen who compose the principal part of the people are not very jealous of their liberty they are too busy and too intent on their own private affairs a country which overflows with wealth is afraid of pillage afraid of an army who is there that forms this goodly party said cicero to atticus are they the men of commerce and husbandry let us not imagine that these are averse to monarchy these to whom all governments are equal as soon as they bestow tranquility thus monarchy is more frequently found in fruitful countries and a republican government in those which are not so and this is sometimes a sufficient compensation for the inconveniences they suffer by the sterility of the land the barrenness of the attic soil established there a democracy and the fertility of that of lacedæmonia an aristocratical constitution for in those times greece was averse to the government of a single person and aristocracy had the nearest resemblance to that government plutarch says† that the cilonian sedition having been appeased at athens the city fell into its ancient dissensions and was divided into as many parties as     there were kinds of land in attica the men who inhabited the eminences would by all means have a popular government those of the flat open country demanded a government composed of the chiefs and they who were near the sea desired a mixture of both chap ii the same subject continued these fertile provinces are always of a level surface where the inhabitants are unable to dispute against a stronger power they are then obliged to submit and when they have once submitted the spirit of liberty cannot return the wealth of the country is a pledge of their fidelity but in mountainous districts as they have but little they may preserve what they have the liberty they enjoy or in other words the government they are under is the only blessing worthy of their defence it reigns therefore more in mountainous and rugged countries than in those which nature seems to have most favoured the mountaineers preserve a more moderate government because they are not so liable to be conquered they defend themselves easily and are attacked with difficulty ammunition and provisions are collected and carried against them with great expence for the country furnishes none it is then a more arduous a more dangerous enterprize to make war against them and all the laws that can be enacted for the safety of the people are there of least use   0 chap iii what countries are best cultivated countries are not cultivated in proportion to their fertility but to their liberty and if we make an imaginary division of the earth we shall be astonished to see in most ages desarts in the most fruitful parts and great nations in those where nature seems to refuse every thing it is natural for a people to leave a bad soil to seek a better and not to leave a good soil to go in search of a worse most invasions have therefore been made in countries which nature seems to have formed for happiness and as nothing is more nearly allied than desolation and invasion the best provinces are most frequently depopulated while the frightful countries of the north continue always inhabited from their being almost uninhabitable we find by what historians tell us of the passage of the people of scandinavia along the banks of the danube that this was not a conquest but only a migration into desart countries these happy climates must therefore have been depopulated by other migrations though we know not the tragical scenes that happened it appears by many monuments of antiquity says aristotle‡ that the sardinians were a grecian colony they were formerly very rich and aristeus so famed for his love of agriculture was their lawgiver but they are since fallen to decay for the carthaginians becoming their masters destroyed every thing proper for the nourishment of man and forbade the cultivation of     the lands on pain of death sardinia was not recovered in the time of aristotle nor is it to this day the most temperate parts of persia turkey muscovy and poland have not been able to recover perfectly from the devastations of the tartars chap iv new effects of the barrenness and fertility of countries the barrenness of the earth renders men industrious sober inured to hardship courageous and fit for war they are obliged to procure by labour what the earth refuses to bestow spontaneously the fertility of a country gives ease effeminacy and a certain fondness for the preservation of life it has been remarked that the german troops raised in those places where the peasants are rich as for instance in saxony are not so good as the others military laws may provide against this inconvenience by a more severe discipline chap v of the inhabitants of islands the inhabitants of islands have a higher relish for liberty than those of the continent islands are commonly of a small∥ extent one part of the people cannot be so easily employed to oppress the other the sea separates them from great empires tyranny cannot so well support itself within a small compass conquerors are stopped by the sea and the islanders being without the reach of their arms more easily preserve their own laws     chap vi of countries raised by the industry of man those countries which the industry of man has rendered habitable and which stand in need of the same industry to provide for their subsistence require a mild and moderate government there are principally three of this species the two fine provinces of kiangnan and tcekiang in china egypt and holland the ancient emperors of china were not conquerors the first thing they did to aggrandize themselves was what gave the highest proof of their wisdom they raised from beneath the waters two of the finest provinces of the empire these owe their existence to the labour of man and it is the inexpressible fertility of these two provinces which has given europe such ideas of the felicity of that vast country but a continual and necessary care to preserve from destruction so considerable a part of the empire demanded rather the manners of a wise than of a voluptuous nation rather the lawful authority of a monarch than the tyrannic sway of a despotic prince power was therefore necessarily moderated in that country as it was formerly in egypt and as it is now in holland which nature has made to attend to herself and not to be abandoned to negligence or caprice thus in spite of the climate of china where they are naturally led to a servile obedience in spite of the apprehensions which follow too great an extent of empire the first legislators of this country were obliged to make excellent laws and the government was frequently obliged to follow them     chap vii of human industry mankind by their industry and by the influence of good laws have rendered the earth more proper for their abode we see rivers flow where there have been lakes and marshes this is a benefit which nature has not bestowed but it is a benefit maintained and supplied by nature when the persians§ were masters of asia they permitted those who conveyed a spring to any place which had not been watered before to enjoy the benefit for five generations and as a number of rivulets flowed from mount taurus they spared no expence in directing the course of their streams at this day without knowing how they came thither they are found in the fields and gardens thus as destructive nations produce evils more durable than themselves the actions of an industrious people are the source of blessings which last when they are no more chap viii the general relation of laws the laws have a very great relation to the manner in which the several nations procure their subsistence there should be a code of laws of a much larger extent for a nation attached to trade and navigation than for people who are content with cultivating the earth there should be a much greater for the latter than for those who subsist by their flocks and herds there must be a still greater for these than for such as live by hunting     chap ix of the soil of america the cause of there being such a number of savage nations in america is the fertility of the earth which spontaneously produces many fruits capable of affording them nourishment if the women cultivate a spot of land round their cottages the maiz grows up presently and hunting and fishing put the men in a state of complete abundance besides black cattle as cows buffaloes c thrive there better than carnivorous beasts the latter have always reigned in africa we should not i believe have all these advantages in europe if the land were left uncultivated it would scarcely produce any thing besides forests of oaks and other barren trees chap x of population in the relation it bears to the manner of procuring subsistence let us see in what proportion countries are peopled where the inhabitants do not cultivate the earth as the produce of uncultivated land is to that of land improved by culture so the number of savages in one country is to that of husbandmen in another and when the people who cultivate the land cultivate also the arts this is also in such proportions as would require a minute detail they can scarcely form a great nation if they are herdsmen and shepherds they have need of an extensive country to furnish subsistence for a small number if they live by hunting their number must     be still less and in order to find the means of life they must constitute a very small nation their country commonly abounds with forests which as the inhabitants have not the art of draining off the waters are filled with bogs here each troop canton themselves and form a petty nation chap xi of savage and barbarous nations there is this difference between savage and barbarous nations the former are dispersed in clans which for some particular reason cannot be joined in a body and the latter are commonly small nations capable of being united the savages are generally hunters the barbarians are herdsmen and shepherds this appears plain in the north of asia the people of siberia cannot live in bodies because they are unable to find subsistence the tartars may live in bodies for some time because their herds and flocks may for a time be reassembled all the clans may then be reunited and this is effected when one chief has subdued many others after which they may do two things either separate or set out with a design to make a great conquest in some southern empire chap xii of the law of nations among people who do not cultivate the earth as these people do not live in circumscribed territories many causes of strife arise between them they quarrel about waste land as we about inheritances thus they find frequent occasions for war in disputes relative either to their hunting their fishing     the pasture for their cattle or the violent seizing of their slaves and as they are not possessed of landed property they have many things to regulate by the law of nations and but few to decide by the civil law chap xiii of the civil law of those nations who do not cultivate the earth the division of lands is what principally increases the civil code amongst nations where they have not made this division there are very few civil laws the institutions of these people may be called manners rather than laws amongst such nations as these the old men who remember things past have great authority they cannot there be distinguished by wealth but by wisdom and valour these people wander and disperse themselves in pasture grounds or in forests marriage cannot there have the security which it has amongst us where it is fixed by the habitation and where the wife continues in one house they may then more easily change their wives possess many and sometimes mix indifferently like brutes nations of herdsmen and shepherds cannot leave their cattle which are their subsistence neither can they separate themselves from their wives who look after them all this ought then to go together especially as living generally in a flat open country where there are few places of considerable strength their wives their children their flocks may become the prey of their enemies their laws regulate the division of plunder and have like our salique laws a particular attention to theft     chap xiv of the political state of the people who do not cultivate the land these people enjoy great liberty for as they do not cultivate the earth they are not fixed they are wanderers and vagabonds and if a chief should deprive them of their liberty they would immediately go and seek it under another or retire into the woods and there live with their families the liberty of the man is so great among these people that it necessarily draws after it that of the citizen chap xv of people who know the use of money aristippus being cast away swam and got safe to the next shore where beholding geometrical figures traced in the sand he was seized with a transport of joy judging that he was amongst greeks and not in a nation of barbarians should you ever happen to be cast by some adventure amongst unknown people upon seeing a piece of money you may be assured that you are arrived in a civilized country the culture of lands requires the use of money this culture supposes many inventions and many degrees of knowledge and we always see ingenuity the arts and a sense of want making their progress with an equal pace all this conduces to the establishment of a sign of value torrents and eruptions¶ have made the discovery that metals are contained in the bowels of the earth     when once they have been separated they have easily been applied to their proper use chap xvi of civil laws among people who know not the use of money when a people have not the use of money they are seldom acquainted with any other injustice than that which arises from violence and the weak by uniting defend themselves from its effects they have nothing there but political regulations but where money is established they are subject to that injustice which proceeds from craft an injustice that may be exercised a thousand ways hence they are forced to have good civil laws which spring up with the new practices of iniquity in countries where they have no specie the robber takes only bare moveables which have no mutual resemblance but where they make use of money the robber takes the signs and these always resemble each other in the former nothing can be concealed because the robber takes along with him the proofs of his conviction but in the latter it is quite the contrary chap xvii of political laws amongst nations who have not the use of money the greatest security of the liberties of a people who do not cultivate the earth is their not knowing the use of money what is gained by hunting fishing or keeping herds of cattle cannot be assembled in such great quantity nor be sufficiently preserved for one man to find himself in a condition to corrupt     many others but when instead of this a man has a sign of riches he may obtain a large quantity of these signs and distribute them as he pleases the people who have no money have but few wants and these are supplied with ease and in an equal manner equality is then unavoidable and from hence it proceeds that their chiefs are not despotic chap xviii of the power of superstition if what travellers tell us be true the constitution of a nation of louisiana called the natches is an exception to this their chief disposes of the goods of all his subjects and obliges them to work and toil according to his pleasure he has a power like that of the grand signior and they cannot even refuse him their heads when the presumptive heir enters into the world they devote all the sucking children to his service during life one would imagine that this is the great sesostris he is treated in his cottage with as much ceremony as an emperor of japan or china the prejudices of superstition are superior to all others and have the strongest influence on the human mind thus though the savage nations have naturally no knowledge of despotic tyranny still they feel the weight of it they adore the sun and if their chief had not imagined that he was the brother of this glorious luminary they would have thought him a wretch like themselves   0 chap xix of the liberty of the arabs and the servitude of the tartars the arabs and tartars are nations of herdsmen and shepherds the arabs find themselves in that situation of which we have been speaking and are therefore free whilst the tartars the most singular people on earth are involved in a† political slavery i have already given reasons‡ for this and shall now assign some others they have no towns no forests and but few marshes their rivers are generally frozen and they dwell in a level country of an immense extent they have pasture for their herds and slocks and consequently property but they have no kind of retreat or place of safety a khan is no sooner overcome than they cut off his∥ head his children are treated in the same manner and all his subjects belong to the conqueror these are not condemned to a civil slavery for in that case they would be a burthen to a simple people who have no lands to cultivate and no need of any domestic service they therefore add to the bulk of the nation but instead of civil servitude a political slavery must naturally be introduced amongst them it is apparent that in a country where the several clans make continual war and are perpetually conquering each other in a country where by the death of the chief the body politic of the vanquished clan is always destroyed the nation in general can     enjoy but little freedom for there is not a single party that must not have been often subdued a conquered people may preserve some degree of liberty when by the strength of their situation they are in a state that will admit of capitulating after their defeat but the tartars always defenceless being once overcome can never be able to obtain conditions i have said in chap ii that the inhabitants of cultivated plains are seldom free circumstances have occurred to put the tartars who dwell in uncultivated plains in the same situation chap xx of the law of nations as practised by the tartars the tartars appear to be mild and humane amongst themselves and yet they are most cruel conquerors when they take cities they put the inhabitants to the sword and imagine that they act humanely if they only sell the people or distribute them amongst their soldiers they have destroyed asia from india even to the mediterranean and all the country which forms the east of persia they have rendered a desart this law of nations is owing i think to the following cause these people having no towns all their wars are carried on with eagerness and impetuosity they fight whenever they hope to conquer and when they have no such hope they join the stronger army with such customs it is contrary to the law of nations that a city incapable of repelling their attack should stop their progress they regard not cities as an association of inhabitants but as places made to bid defiance to their power they besiege them without military skill and expose themselves     greatly in the attack and therefore revenge themselves on all those who have spilt their blood chap xxi the civil law of the tartars father du halde says that amongst the tartars the youngest of the males is always the heir by reason that as soon as the elder brothers are capable of leading a pastoral life they leave the house with a certain number of cattle given them by their father and build a new habitation the last of the males who continues at home with the father is then his natural heir i have heard that a like custom was also observed in some small districts of england and we find it still in brittany in the dutchy of rohan where it obtains with regard to ignoble tenures this is doubtless a pastoral law conveyed thither by some of the people of britain or established by some german nation by cæsar and tacitus we are informed that the latter cultivated but little land chap xxii of a civil law of the german nations i shall here explain how that particular passage of the salique law which is commonly distinguished by the term the salique law relates to the institutions of a people who do not cultivate the earth or at least who cultivate it but very little the salique§ law ordains that when a man has left children behind him the males shall succeed to the salique land in prejudice to the females     to understand the nature of those salique lands there needs no more than to search into the usages or customs of the franks with regard to lands before they left germany mr echard has very plainly proved that the word salic is derived from sala which signifies a house and therefore that the salique land was the land belonging to the house i shall proceed farther and examine into the nature of the house and of the land belonging to the house among the germans they dwell not in towns says¶ tacitus nor can they bear to have their habitations contiguous to those of others every one leaves a space or small piece of ground about his house which is inclosed tacitus is very exact in this account for many laws of the barbarian codes have different decrees against those who threw down this inclosure as well as against such as broke into the house we learn from tacitus and cæsar that the lands cultivated by the germans were given them only for the space of a year after which they again became public they had no other patrimony but the house and a piece of land within the† inclosure that surrounded it it was this particular patrimony which belonged to the males and indeed how could it belong to the daughters they were to pass into another habitation the salique land was then within that inclosure which belonged to a german house this was the only property they had the franks after their     conquests acquired new possessions and continued to call them salique lands when the franks lived in germany their wealth consisted of slaves flocks horses arms c the habitation and the small portion of land adjoining to it were naturally given to the male children who were to dwell there but afterwards when the franks had by conquest acquired large tracts of land they thought it hard that the daughters and their children should be incapable of enjoying any part of them hence it was that they introduced a custom of permitting the father to settle the estate after his death upon his daughter and her children they silenced the law and it appears that these settlements were frequent since they were entered in the formularies‡ amongst these formularies i find one∥ of a singular nature a grandfather ordained by will that his grandchildren should share his inheritance with his sons and daughters what then became of the salique law in those times either it could not be observed or the continual use of nominating the daughters to an inheritance had made them consider their ability to succeed as a case authorized by custom the salique law had not in view a preference of one sex to the other much less had it a regard to the perpetuity of a family a name or the transmission of land these things did not enter into the heads of the germans it was purely an œconomical law which gave the house and the land dependent thereon to the males who should dwell in it and to whom it consequently was of most service     we need here only transcribe the title of the allodial lands of the salique law that famous text of which so many have talked and which so few have read if a man dies without issue his father or mother shall succeed him   if he has neither father nor mother his brother or sister shall succeed him   if he has neither brother nor sister the sister of his mother shall succeed him   if his mother has no sister the sister of his father shall succeed him   if his father has no sister the nearest relation by the male side shall succeed   not§ any part of the salique land shall pass to the females but it shall belong to the males that is the male children shall succeed their father it is plain that the first five articles relate to the inheritance of a man who dies without issue and the sixth to the succession of him who has children when a man dies without children the law ordains that neither of the two sexes shall have the preference to the other except in certain cases in the two first degrees of succession the advantages of the males and females were the same in the third and fourth the females had the preference and the males in the fifth tacitus points out the source of these extravagances the sisters¶ children says he are as dear to their uncle as to their own father there are men who regard this degree of kindred as more strict and even more holy they prefer it when they receive hostages from hence it proceeds that     our earliest historians speak in such strong terms of the love of the kings of the franks for their sisters and their sisters children and indeed if the children of the sister were considered in her brothers house as his own children it was natural for these to regard their aunt as their mother the sister of the mother was preferred to the fathers sister this is explained by other texts of the salique law when a† woman became a widow she fell under the guardianship of her husbands relations the law preferred to this guardianship the relations by the females before those by the males indeed a woman who entered into a family joining herself with those of her own sex became more united to her relations by the female than by the male moreover when‡ a man killed another and had not wherewithal to pay the pecuniary penalty the law permitted him to deliver up his substance and his relations were to supply the deficiency after the father mother and brother the sister of the mother was to pay as if this tie had something in it most tender now the degree of kindred which imposes the burthens ought also to confer the advantages the salique law enjoins that after the fathers sister the succession should be held by the nearest relation male but if this relation was beyond the fifth degree he should not inherit thus a female of the fifth degree might inherit to the prejudice of a male of the sixth and this may be seen in the∥ law of the ripurian franks a faithful interpreter of the     salique law under the title of allodial lands where it closely adheres to the salique law on the same subject if the father left issue the salique law would have the daughters excluded from the inheritance of the salique land and determined that it should belong to the male children it would be easy for me to prove that the salique law did not absolutely exclude the daughters from the possession of the salique land but only in the case where they were debarred by their brothers this appears from the letter of the salique law which after having said that the women shall possess none of the salique land but only the males interprets and restrains itself by adding that is the son shall succeed to the inheritance of the father   the text of the salique law is cleared up by the law of the ripurian franks which has also a title§ on allodial lands very conformable to that of the salique law   the laws of these barbarous nations who all sprung from germany interpret each other more particularly as they all have nearly the same spirit the saxon¶ law enjoined the father and mother to leave their inheritance to their son and not to their daughter but if there were none but daughters they were to have the whole inheritance   we have two ancient formularies that state the case in which according to the salique law the daughters were excluded by the males that is when they stood in competition with their brother       another formulary† proves that the daughter succeeded to the prejudice of the grandson she was therefore excluded only by the son   if daughters had been generally debarred by the salique law from the inheritance of land it would be impossible to explain the histories formularies and charters which are continually mentioning the lands and possessions of the females under the first race people‡ have been wrong in asserting that the salique lands were fiefs   this head is distinguished by the title of allodial lands   fiefs at first were not hereditary   if the salique lands had been fiefs how could marculfus treat that custom as impious which excluded the women from inheriting when the males themselves did not succeed to fiefs   the charters which have been cited to prove that the salique lands were fiefs only shew that they were freeholds   fiefs were not established till after the conquest and the salique customs existed long before the franks left germany   it was not the salique law that formed the establishment of fiefs by setting bounds to the succession of females but it was the establishment of fiefs that prescribed limits to the succession of females and to the regulations of the salique law after what has been said one would not imagine that the perpetual succession of males to the crown of france should have taken its rise from the salique law and yet this is a point indubitably certain i prove it from the several codes of the barbarous nations the salique law∥ and the law of the burgundians§ debarred the daughters from the right of     succeeding to the land in conjunction with their brothers neither did they succeed to the crown the law of the¶ visigoths on the contrary permitted the daughters to inherit the land with their brothers and the women were† capable of inheriting the crown amongst these people the regulations of the civil law had an effect on the political this was not the only case in which the political law of the franks gave way to the civil by the salique law all the brothers succeeded equally to the land and this was also decreed by a law of the burgundians thus in the kingdom of the franks and in that of the burgundians all the brothers succeeded to the crown if we except a few murders and usurpations which took place amongst the burgundians chap xxiii of the regal ornaments among the franks a people who do not cultivate the land have no idea of luxury we may see in tacitus the admirable simplicity of the german nations they had no artificial elegancies of dress their ornaments were derived from nature if the family of their chief was to be distinguished by any sign it was no other than that which nature bestowed the kings of the franks of the burgundians and the visigoths wore their long hair for a diadem   0 chap xxiv of the marriages of the kings of the franks i have already mentioned that with people who do not cultivate the earth marriages are less fixed than with others and that they generally take many wives of‡ all the barbarous nations the germans were almost the only people who were satisfied with one wife if we except∥ says tacitus some persons who not from a dissoluteness of manners but because of their nobility had many this explains the reason why the kings of the first race had so great a number of wives these marriages were less a proof of incontinence than a consequence of dignity and it would have wounded them in a tender point to have deprived them of such a prerogative§ this also explains the reason why the example of the kings was not followed by the subjects chap xxv childeric the laws of matrimony amongst the germans says tacitus are strictly observed¶ vice is not there a subject of ridicule to corrupt or be corrupted is not called fashion or the custom of the age there are few examples in this populous nation of the violation of conjugal faith this was the reason of the expulsion of childeric he shocked their rigid virtue which conquest had not had time to corrupt     chap xxvi of the time when the kings of the franks became of age barbarians who do not cultivate the earth have strictly speaking no jurisdiction and are as we have already remembered rather governed by the law of nations than by civil institutions they are therefore always armed thus tacitus tells us that the germans‡‡ undertook no affairs either of a public or private nature unarmed they gave their† vote by the sound of their arms‡ as soon as they could carry them they were presented to the assembly they put a javelin∥ into their hands and from that moment they§ were out of their minority they had been a part of the family now they became a part of the republic the eagles said¶ the king of the ostrogoths cease to feed their young ones as soon as their wings and talons are formed the latter have no need of their assistance when they are able themselves to seize their prey it would be a disgrace if the young people in our armies were thought to be of an age unfit for managing their estates or regulating the conduct of their lives it is virtue that constitutes full age among the goths childebert ii was fifteen years old when gontram his uncle declared that he was of age and     capable of governing by himself we find in the ripuarian laws that the age of fifteen the ability of bearing arms and majority went together it is there said† that if a ripuarian dies or is killed and leaves a son behind him that son can neither prosecute nor be prosecuted till he has completely attained the age of fifteen and then he may either answer for himself or choose a champion it was necessary that his mind should be sufficiently formed to be able to defend himself in court and that his body should have all the strength that was proper for his defence in single combat amongst the burgundians‡ who also made use of this combat in their judiciary proceedings they were of age at fifteen agathias tells us that the arms of the franks were light they might therefore be of age at fifteen in succeeding times the arms they made use of were heavy and they were already greatly so in the time of charlemagne as appears by our capitularies and romances those who had∥ fiefs and were consequently obliged to do military service were not then of age till they were twentyone years old§ chap xxvii the same subject continued we have seen that the germans did not appear in their assemblies before they were of age they were a part of the family but not of the republic this was the reason that the children of clodomir king of orleans and conqueror of burgundy were     not proclaimed kings because they were of too tender an age to be present at the assembly they were not yet kings but they had a right to the regal dignity as soon as they were able to bear arms and in the mean time clotildis their grandmother governed the state but their uncles clotarius and childebert assassinated them and divided their kingdom this was the cause that in the following ages princes in their minority were proclaimed kings immediately after the death of their fathers thus duke gondovald saved childebert ii from the cruelty of chilperic and caused him to be proclaimed king† when he was only five years old but even in this change they followed the original spirit of the nation for the public acts did not pass in the name of the young monarch so that the franks had a double administration the one which concerned the person of the infant king and the other which regarded the kingdom and in the fiefs there was a difference between the guardianship and the civil administration chap xxviii of adoption among the germans as the germans became of age by the wielding of arms so they were adopted by the same sign thus gontram willing to declare his nephew childebert of age and to adopt him for his son made use of these words i have put‡ this javelin into thy hands as a token that i have given thee all     my kingdom then turning toward the assembly he added you see that my son childebert is grown a man obey him theodoric king of the ostrogoths intending to adopt the king of the heruli wrote to him thus∥ it is a noble cusstom of ours to be adopted by arms for men of courage alone deserve to be our children such is the efficacy of this act that whoever is the object of it had rather die than submit to any thing ignominious therefore in compliance with the national usage and because you are a man of courage we adopt you for our son by these bucklers these swords these horses which we send you as a present chap xxix of the sanguinary temper of the kings of the franks clovis was not the only prince amongst the franks who had invaded gaul many of his relations had penetrated into this country with particular tribes but as he had met with much greater success and could grant considerable settlements to such as followed him the franks flocked to him from all parts so that the other chiefs found themselves too weak to resist him he formed a design of exterminating his whole race and he succeeded§ he feared says gregory of tours¶ lest the franks should choose another chief his children and successors followed this practice to the utmost of their power thus the brother the uncle the nephew and what is still worse the father or the son were perpetually conspiring against their whole family the law continually divided the monarchy while fear ambition and cruelty wanted to reunite it     chap xxx of the national assemblies of the franks it has been remarked above that nations who do not cultivate the land enjoy great liberty this was the case of the germans tacitus says that they gave their kings or chiefs a very moderate degree of power and cæsar adds farther† that in times of peace they had no common magistrates but their princes administered justice in each village thus as gregory of tours‡ sufficiently proves the franks in germany had no king the princes says tacitus∥ deliberate on matters of no great concern while affairs of importance are submitted to the whole nation but in such a manner that these very affairs which are under the cognizance of the people are at the same time laid before the princes this custom was observed by them after their conquests as may be seen§ in all their records tacitus says¶ that capital crimes might be carried before the assembly it was the same after the conquest when the great vassals were tried before that body     chap xxxi of the authority of the clergy under the first race the priests of barbarous nations are commonly invested with power because they have both that authority which is due to them from their religious character and that influence which amongst such a people is the offspring of superstition thus we see in tacitus that priests were held in great veneration by the germans and that they presided in the assemblies of the people they alone were permitted† to chastise to bind to smite which they did not by order of the prince or as his ministers of justice but as by an inspiration of that deity ever supposed to be present with those who made war we ought not therefore to be astonished when from the very beginning of the first race we meet with bishops the dispensers of‡ justice when we see them appear in the assemblies of the nation when they have such a prodigious influence on the minds of sovereigns and when they acquire so large a share of property     book xix of laws in relation to the principles which form the general spirit the morals and customs of a nation chap i of the subject of this book this subject is very extensive in that croud of ideas which present themselves to my mind i shall be more attentive to the order of things than to the things themselves i shall be obliged to wander to the right and to the left that i may investigate and discover the truth chap ii that it is necessary peoples minds should be prepared for the reception of the best laws nothing could appear more insupportable to the germans∥ than the tribunal of varus that which justinian§ erected amongst the lazi to proceed against the murderers of their king appeared to them as an affair the most horrid and barbarous mithridates¶ haranguing against the romans reproached them more particularly for their law proceedings the parthians could not bear with one of their kings who having been educated at rome rendered himself affable and† easy of access to all liberty itself has appeared intolerable to     those nations who have not been accustomed to enjoy it thus a pure air is sometimes disagreeable to such as have lived in a fenny country balbi a venetian being at‡ pegu was introduced to the king when the monarch was informed that they had no king at venice he burst into such a fit of laughter that he was seized with a cough and with difficulty could speak to his courtiers what legislator could propose a popular government to a people like this chap iii of tyranny there are two sorts of tyranny one real which arises from oppression the other is seated in opinion and is sure to be felt whenever those who govern establish things shocking to the present ideas of a nation dio tells us that augustus was desirous of being called romulus but having been informed that the people feared that he would cause himself to be crowned king he changed his design the old romans were averse to a king because they could not suffer any man to enjoy such power these would not have a king because they could not bear his manners for though cæsar the triumvirs and augustus were really invested with regal power they had preserved all the outward appearance of equality while their private lives were a kind of contrast to the pomp and luxury of foreign monarchs so that when the romans were resolved to have no king this only signified that they would     preserve their customs and not imitate those of the african and eastern nations the same writer informs us that the romans were exasperated against augustus for making certain laws which were too severe but as soon as he had recalled pylades the comedian whom the jarring of different factions had driven out of the city the discontent ceased a people of this stamp have a more lively sense of tyranny when a player is banished than when they are deprived of their laws chap iv of the general spirit of mankind mankind are influenced by various causes by the climate by the religion by the laws by the maxims of government by precedents morals and customs from whence is formed a general spirit of nations in proportion as in every country any one of these causes acts with more force the others in the same degree are weakened nature and the climate rule almost alone over the savages customs govern the chinese the laws tyrannize in japan morals had formerly all their influence at sparta maxims of government and the ancient simplicity of manners once prevailed at rome chap v how far we should be attentive lest the general spirit of a nation be changed should there happen to be a country whose inhabitants were of a social temper openhearted chearful endowed with taste and a facility of communicating their thoughts who were sprightly and   0 agreeable sometimes imprudent often indiscreet and besides had courage generosity frankness and a certain notion of honour no one ought to endeavour to restrain their manners by laws unless he would lay a restraint on their virtues if in general the character be good the little foibles that may be found in it are of small importance they might lay a restraint upon women enact laws to reform their manners and to reduce their luxury but who knows but that by these means they might lose that peculiar taste which would be the source of the wealth of the nation and that politeness which would render the country frequented by strangers it is the business of the legislature to follow the spirit of the nation when it is not contrary to the principles of government for we do nothing so well as when we act with freedom and follow the bent of our natural genius if an air of pedantry be given to a nation that is naturally gay the state will gain no advantage from it either at home or abroad leave it to do frivolous things in the most serious manner and with gaiety the things most serious chap vi that every thing ought not to be corrected let them but leave us as we are said a gentleman of a nation which had a very great resemblance to that we have been describing and nature will repair whatever is amiss she has given us a vivacity capable of offending and hurrying us beyond the bounds of respect this same vivacity is corrected by the politeness it procures inspiring us with a taste of     the world and above all for the conversation of the fairsex let them leave us as we are our indiscretions joined to our goodnature would make the laws which should constrain our sociability not at all proper for us chap vii of the athenians and lacedæmonians the athenians this gentleman adds were a nation that had some relation to ours they mingled gaiety with business a stroke of raillery was as agreeable in the senate as in the theatre this vivacity which discovered itself in their councils went along with them in the execution of their resolves the characteristic of the spartans was gravity seriousness severity and silence it would have been as difficult to bring over an athenian by teazing as it would a spartan by diverting him chap viii effects of a sociable temper the more communicative a people are the more easily they change their habits because each is in a greater degree a spectacle to the other and the singularities of individuals are better observed the climate which influences one nation to take a pleasure in being communicative makes it also delight in change and that which makes it delight in change forms its taste the society of the fairsex spoils the manners and forms the taste the desire of giving greater pleasure than others establishes the embellishments of dress and the desire of pleasing others more than ourselves gives rise to fashions this mode is a subject of importance     by giving a trifling turn of mind it continually increases the branches of its commerce∥ chap ix of the vanity and pride of nations vanity is as advantageous to a government as pride is dangerous to be convinced of this we need only represent on the one hand the numberless benefits which result from vanity as industry the arts fashions politeness and taste on the other the infinite evils which spring from the pride of certain nations as laziness poverty a total neglect of every thing in fine the destruction of the nations which have happened to fall under their government as well as of their own laziness§ is the effect of pride labour a consequence of vanity the pride of a spaniard leads him to decline labour the vanity of a frenchman to work better than others all lazy nations are grave for those who do not labour regard themselves as the sovereigns of those who do if we search amongst all nations we shall find that for the most part gravity pride and indolence go hand in hand the people of achim¶ are proud and lazy those who have no slaves hire one if it be only to carry a quart of rice a hundred paces they would be dishonoured if they carried it themselves in many places people let their nails grow that all may see they do not work     women in the indies believe it shameful for them to learn to read this is they say the business of their slaves who sing their spiritual songs in the temples of their pagods in one tribe they do not spin in another they make nothing but baskets and mats they are not even to pound rice and in others they must not go to fetch water these rules are established by pride and the same passion makes them followed there is no necessity for mentioning that the moral qualities according as they are blended with others are productive of different effects thus pride joined to a vast ambition and notions of grandeur produced such effects among the romans as are known to all the world chap x of the character of the spaniards and chinese the characters of the several nations are formed of virtues and vices of good and bad qualities from the happy mixture of these great advantages result and frequently where it would be least expected there are others from whence great evils arise evils which one would not suspect the spaniards have been in all ages famous for their honesty justin† mentions their fidelity in keeping whatever was entrusted to their care they have frequently suffered death rather than reveal a secret they have still the same fidelity for which they were formerly distinguished all the nations who trade to cadiz trust their forunes to the spaniards and have never yet repented it but this admirable quality joined to their indolence forms a mixture from whence such effects result as to them     are most pernicious the rest of the european nations carry on in their very sight all the commerce of their monarchy the character of the chinese is formed of another mixture directly opposite to that of the spaniards the precariousness of their subsistence‡ inspires them with a prodigious activity and such an excessive desire of gain that no trading nation can confide in them∥ this acknowledged infidelity has secured them the possession of the trade to japan no european merchant has ever dared to undertake it in their name how easy soever it might be for them to do it from their maritime provinces in the north chap xi a reflection i have said nothing here with a view to lessen that infinite distance which must ever be between virtue and vice god forbid that i should be guilty of such an attempt i would only make my readers comprehend that all political are not moral vices and that all moral are not political vices and that those who make laws which shock the general spirit of a nation ought not to be ignorant of this chap xii of custom and manners in a despotic state it is a capital maxim that the manners and customs of a despotic empire ought never to be changed for nothing would more speedily produce a revolution the reason is that in these states there are no laws that is none that can be properly called     so there are only manners and customs and if you overturn these you overturn all laws are established manners are inspired these proceed from a general spirit those from a particular institution now it is as dangerous nay more so to subvert the general spirit as to change a particular institution there is less communication in a country where each either as superior or inferior exercises or is oppressed by arbitrary power than there is in those where liberty reigns in every station they do not therefore so often change their manners and behaviour fixed and established customs have a near resemblance to laws thus it is here necessary that a prince or a legislator should less oppose the manners and customs of the people than in any other country upon earth their women are commonly confined and have no influence in society in other countries where they have an intercourse with men their desire of pleasing and the desire men also have of giving them pleasure produce a continual change of customs the two sexes spoil each other they both lose their distinctive and essential quality what was naturally fixt becomes quite unsettled and their customs and behaviour alter every day chap xiii of the behaviour of the chinese but china is the place where the customs of the country can never be changed besides their women being absolutely separated from the men their customs like their morals are taught in the schools a man of§ letters may be known by his easy address     these things being once taught by precept and inculcated by grave doctors become fixed like the principles of morality and are never changed chap xiv what are the natural means of changing the manners and customs of a nation we have said that the laws were the particular and precise institutions of a legislator and manners and customs the institutions of a nation in general from hence it follows that when these manners and customs are to be changed it ought not to be done by laws this would have too much the air of tyranny it would be better to change them by introducing other manners and other customs thus when a prince would make great alterations in his kingdom he should reform by law what is established by law and change by custom what is settled by custom for it is very bad policy to change by law what ought to be changed by custom the law which obliged the muscovites to cut off their beards and to shorten their cloaths and the rigour with which peter i made them crop even to their knees the long cloaks of those who entered into the cities were instances of tyranny there are means that may be made use of to prevent crimes these are punishments there are those for changing our customs these are examples the facility and ease with which that nation has been polished plainly shew that this prince had a worse opinion of his people than they deserved and that they were not brutes though he was pleased to call them so the violent measures which he employed were needless he would have attained his end as well by milder methods     he himself experienced the facility of bringing about these alterations the women were shut up and in some measure slaves he called them to court he sent them silks and fine stuffs and made them dress like the german ladies this sex immediately relished a manner of life which so greatly flattered their taste their vanity and their passions and by their means it was relished by the men what rendered the change the more easy was that their manners at that time were foreign to the climate and had been introduced amongst them by conquest and by a mixture of nations peter i in giving the manners and customs of europe to an european nation found a facility which he did not himself expect the empire of the climate is the first the most powerful of all empires he had then no occasion for laws to change the manners and customs of his country it would have been sufficient to have introduced other manners and other customs nations are in general very tenacious of their customs to take them away by violence is to render them unhappy we should not therefore change them but engage the people to make the change themselves all punishment which is not derived from necessity is tyrannical the law is not a mere act of power things in their own nature indifferent are not within its province     chap xv the influence of domestic government on the political this alteration in the manners of women will doubtless have a great influence on the government of muscovy one naturally follows the other the despotic power of the prince is connected with the servitude of women the liberty of women with the spirit of monarchy chap xvi how some legislators have confounded the principles which govern mankind manners and customs are those habits which are not established by legislators either because they were not able or were not willing to establish them there is this difference between laws and manners that the laws are most adapted to regulate the actions of the subject and manners to regulate the actions of the man there is this difference between manners and customs that the former principally relate to the interior conduct the latter to the exterior these things¶ have been sometimes confounded lycurgus made the same code for the laws manners and customs and the legislators of china have done the same we ought not to be surprized that the legislators of china and sparta should confound the laws manners and customs the reason is their manners represent their laws and their customs their manners the principal object which the legislators of china had in view was to make their subjects live in     peace and tranquility they would have people filled with a veneration for one another that each should be every moment sensible of his dependence on society and of the obligations he owed to his fellowcitizens they therefore gave rules of the most extensive civility thus the inhabitants of the villages of china practise amongst themselves the same ceremonies as those observed by persons of an exalted station a very proper method of inspiring mild and gentle dispositions of maintaining peace and good order and of banishing all the vices which spring from an asperity of temper in effect would not the freeing them from the rules of civility be to search out a method for them to indulge their own humours civility is in this respect of more value than politeness politeness flatters the vices of others and civility prevents ours from being brought to light it is a barrier which men have placed within themselves to prevent the corruption of each other lycurgus whose institutions were severe had no regard to civility in forming the external behaviour he had a view to that warlike spirit with which he would fain inspire his people a people who were in a continual state of discipline and instruction and who were endued with equal simplicity and rigour atoned by their virtues for their want of complaisance  00 chap xvii of the peculiar quality of the chinese government the legislators of china went farther† they confounded together their religion laws manners and customs all these were morality all these were virtue the precepts relating to these four points were what they called rites and it was in the exact observance of these that the chinese government triumphed they spent their whole youth in learning them their whole life in the practice they were taught by their men of letters they were inculcated by the magistrates and as they included all the ordinary actions of life when they found the means of making them strictly observed china was well governed two things have contributed to the ease with which these rites are engraved in the hearts and minds of the chinese one the difficulty of writing which during the greatest part of their lives wholly employs their attention‡ because it is necessary to prepare them to read and understand the books in which they are comprized the other that the ritual precepts having nothing in them that is spiritual but being merely rules of common practice are more adapted to convince and strike the mind than things merely intellectual those princes who instead of ruling by these rites governed by the force of punishments wanted to accomplish that by punishments which it is not in their power to produce that is to give habits of morality by punishments a subject is very justly  0  cut off from society who having lost the purity of his manners violates the laws but if all the world were to lose their moral habits would these reestablish them punishments may be justly inflicted to put a stop to many of the consequences of the general evil but they will not remove the evil itself thus when the principles of the chinese government were discarded and morality was banished the state fell into anarchy and revolutions succeeded chap xviii a consequence drawn from the preceding chapter from hence it follows that the laws of china are not destroyed by conquest their customs manners laws and religion being the same thing they cannot change all these at once and as it will happen that either the conqueror or the conquered must change in china it has always been the conqueror for the manners of the conquering nation not being their customs nor their customs their laws nor their laws their religion it has been more easy for them to conform by degrees to the vanquished people than the latter to them there still follows from hence a very unhappy consequence which is that it is almost impossible for christianity∥ ever to be established in china the vows of virginity the assembling of women in churches their necessary communication with the ministers of religion their participation in the sacraments auricular confession extreme unction the marriage of only one wife all these overturn the manners  0  and customs of the country and with the same blow strike at their religion and laws the christian religion by the establishment of charity by a public worship by a participation of the same sacraments seems to demand that all should be united while the rites of china seem to ordain that all should be separated and as we have seen that this separation§ depends in general on the spirit of despotism this will shew us the reason why monarchies and indeed all moderate governments are more consistent¶ with the christian religion chap xix how this union of religion laws manners and customs among the chinese was effected the principal object of government which the chinese legislators had in view was the peace and tranquility of the empire and subordination appeared to them as the most proper means to maintain it filled with this idea they believed it their duty to inspire a respect for parents and therefore exerted all their power to effect it they established an infinite number of rites and ceremonies to do them honour when living and after their death it was impossible for them to pay such honours to deceased parents without being led to reverence the living the ceremonies at the death of a father were more nearly related to religion those for a living parent had a greater relation to the laws manners and customs however these were only parts of the same code but this code was very extensive  0  a veneration for their parents was necessarily connected with a suitable respect for all who represented them such as old men masters magistrates and the sovereign this respect for parents supposed a return of love towards children and consequently the same return from old men to the young from magistrates to those who were under their jurisdiction and from the emperor to his subjects this formed the rites and these rites the general spirit of the nation we shall now shew the relation which things in appearance the most indifferent may have to the fundamental constitution of china this empire is formed on the plan of a government of a family if you diminish the paternal authority or even if you retrench the ceremonies which express your respect for it you weaken the reverence due to magistrates who are considered as fathers nor would the magistrates have the same care of the people whom they ought to look upon as their children and that tender relation which subsists between the prince and his subjects would insensibly be lost retrench but one of these habits and you overturn the state it is a thing in itself very indifferent whether the daughterinlaw rises every morning to pay such and such duties to her motherinlaw but if we consider that these exterior habits incessantly revive an idea necessary to be imprinted on all minds an idea that forms the ruling spirit of the empire we shall see that it is necessary that such or such a particular action be performed  0  chap xx explication of a paradox relating to the chinese it is very remarkable that the chinese whose lives are guided by rites are nevertheless the greatest cheats upon earth this appears chiefly in their trade which in spite of its natural tendency has never been able to make them honest he who buys of them ought to carry with him his own weights every merchant having three sorts the one heavy for buying another light for selling and another of the true standard for those who are upon their guard it is possible i believe to explain this contradiction the legislators of china had two objects in view they were desirous that the people should be submissive and peaceful and that they should also be laborious and industrious by the nature of the soil and climate their subsistence is very precarious nor can it be any other way secured than by industry and labour when every one obeys and every one is employed the state is in a happy situation it is necessity and perhaps the nature of the climate that has given to the chinese an inconceivable greediness for gain and laws have never been made to restrain it every thing has been forbidden when acquired by acts of violence every thing permitted when obtained by artifice or labour let us not then compare the morals of china with those of europe every one in china is obliged to be attentive to what will be for his advantage if the cheat has been watchful over his own interest he who is the dupe ought to be attentive  0  to his at sparta they were permitted to steal in china they are suffered to deceive chap xxi how the laws ought to have a relation to manners and customs it is only singular institutions which thus confound laws manners and customs things naturally distinct and separate but though they are in themselves different there is nevertheless a great relation between them solon being asked if the laws he had given to the athenians were the best he replied i have given them the best they were able to bear a fine expression that ought to be perfectly understood by all legislators when divine wisdom said to the jews i have given you precepts which are not good this signified that they had only a relative goodness which is the sponge that wipes out all the difficulties in the law of moses chap xxii the same subject continued when a people have pure and regular manners their laws become simple and natural plato† says that rhadamanthus who governed a nation extremely religious finished every process with extraordinary dispatch administering only the oath on each accusation but says the same plato‡ when a people are not religious we should never have recourse to an oath except he who swears is intirely disinterested as in the case of a judge and a witness  0  chap xxiii how the laws are founded on the manners of a people at the time when the manners of the romans were pure they had no particular law against the embezzlement of the public money when this crime began to appear it was thought so infamous that to be condemned to restore∥ what they had taken was considered as a sufficient disgrace for a proof of this see the sentence of l scipio§ chap xxiv the same subject continued the laws which gave the right of tutelage to the mother were most attentive to the preservation of the infants person those which granted it to the next heir were most attentive to the preservation of the state when the manners of a people are corrupted it is much better to give the tutelage to the mother amongst those whose laws confide in the manners of the subjects the guardianship is granted either to the next heir or to the mother and sometimes to both if we reflect on the roman laws we shall find that the spirit of these was conformable to what i have advanced at the time when the laws of the twelve tables were made the manners of the romans were most admirable the guardianship was given to the nearest relation of the infant from a consideration that he ought to have the trouble of the tutelage who might enjoy the advantage of possessing the inheritance they did not imagine the life of the heir in danger though it was put into a persons hands who would reap a benefit by his death but  0  when the manners of rome were changed her legislators altered their conduct if in the pupillary substitution say caius¶ and justinian the testator is afraid that the substitute will lay any snares for the pupil he may leave the vulgar† substitution open and put the pupillary into a part of the testament which cannot be opened till after a certain time these fears and precautions were unknown to the primitive romans chap xxv the same subject continued the roman law gave the liberty of making presents before marriage after marriage they were not allowed this was founded on the manners of the romans who were led to marriage only by frugality simplicity and modesty but might suffer themselves to be seduced by domestic cares by complacency and the constant tenour of conjugal felicity a law of the‡ visigoths forbade the man giving more to the woman he was to marry than the tenth part of his substance and his giving her any thing during the first year of their marriage this also took its rise from the manners of the country the legislators were willing to put a stop to that spanish ostentation which only led them to display an excessive liberality in acts of magnificence the romans by their laws put a stop to some of the inconveniences which arose from the most durable empire in the world that of virtue the spaniards  0  by theirs would prevent the bad effects of a tyranny the most frail and transitory that of beauty chap xxvi the same subject continued the law∥ of theodosius and valentinian drew the causes of repudiation from the ancient manners§ and customs of the romans it placed in the number of these causes the behaviour of the husband¶ who beat his wife in a manner that disgraced the character of a freeborn woman this cause was omitted in the following laws for their manners in this respect had undergone a change the eastern customs having banished those of europe the first eunuch of the empress wife to justinian ii threatened her says the historian to chastise her in the same manner as children are punished at school nothing but established manners or those which they were seeking to establish could raise even an idea of this kind we have seen how the laws follow the manners of a people let us now observe how the manners follow the laws chap xxvii how the laws contribute to form the manners customs and character of a nation the customs of an enslaved people are a part of their servitude those of a free people are a part of their liberty i have spoken in the eleventh book† of a free people and have given the principles of their constitution  0  let us now see the effects which follow from this liberty the character it is capable of forming and the customs which naturally result from it i do not deny that the climate may have produced great part of the laws manners and customs of this nation but i maintain that its manners and customs have a close connection with its laws as there are in this state two visible powers the legislative and executive and as every citizen has a will of his own and may at pleasure assert his independence most men have a greater fondness for one of these powers than for the other and the multitude have commonly neither equity nor sense enough to shew an equal affection to both and as the executive power by disposing of all employments may give great hopes and no fears every man who obtains any favour from it is ready to espouse its cause while it is liable to be attacked by those who have nothing to hope from it all the passions being unrestrained hatred envy jealousy and an ambitious desire of riches and honours appear in their full extent were it otherwise the state would be in the condition of a man weakened by sickness who is without passions because he is without strength the hatred which arises between the two parties will always subsist because it will always be impotent these parties being composed of freemen if the one becomes too powerful for the other as a consequence of liberty this other is depressed while the citizens take the weaker side with the same readiness as the hands lend their assistance to remove the infirmities and disorders of the body every individual is independent and being commonly led by caprice and humour frequently changes parties he abandons one where he left all his   0 friends to unite himself to another in which he finds all his enemies so that in this nation it frequently happens that the people forget the laws of friendship as well as those of hatred the sovereign is here in the same case with a private person and against the ordinary maxims of prudence is frequently obliged to give his confidence to those who have most offended him and to disgrace the men who have best served him he does that by necessity which other princes do by choice as we are afraid of being deprived of the blessing we already enjoy and which may be disguised and misrepresented to us and as fear always enlarges objects the people are uneasy under such a situation and believe themselves in danger even in those moments when they are most secure as those who with the greatest warmth oppose the executive power dare not avow the selfinterested motives of their opposition so much the more do they increase the terrors of the people who can never be certain whether they are in danger or not but even this contributes to make them avoid the real dangers to which they may in the end be exposed but the legislative body having the confidence of the people and being more enlightened than they may calm their uneasiness and make them recover from the bad impressions they have entertained this is the great advantage which this government has over the ancient democracies in which the people had an immediate power for when they were moved and agitated by the orators these agitations always produced their effect but when an impression of terror has no certain object it produces only clamour and abuse it has however this good effect that it puts all the springs of government into motion and fixes the attention     of every citizen but if it arises from a violation of the fundamental laws it is sullen cruel and produces the most dreadful catastrophes soon we should see a frightful calm during which every one would unite against that power which had violated the laws if when the uneasiness proceeds from no certain object some foreign power should threaten the state or put its prosperity or its glory in danger the little interests of party would then yield to the more strong and binding and there would be a perfect coalition in favour of the executive power but if the disputes were occasioned by a violation of the fundamental laws and a foreign power should appear there would be a revolution that would neither alter the constitution nor the form of government for a revolution formed by liberty becomes a confirmation of liberty a free nation may have a deliverer a nation enslaved can have only another oppressor for whoever is able to dethrone an absolute prince has a power sufficient to become absolute himself as the enjoyment of liberty and even its support and preservation consists in every mans being allowed to speak his thoughts and to lay open his sentiments a citizen in this state will say or write whatever the laws do not expressly forbid to be said or written a people like this being always in a ferment are more easily conducted by their passions than by reason which never produces any great effect in the mind of man it is therefore easy for those who govern to make them undertake enterprizes contrary to their true interest     this nation is passionately fond of liberty because this liberty is real and it is possible for it in its defence to sacrifice its wealth its ease its interest and to support the burthen of the most heavy taxes even such as a despotic prince durst not lay upon his subjects but as the people have a certain knowledge of the necessity of submitting to those taxes they pay them from the wellfounded hope of their discontinuance their burthens are heavy but they do not feel their weight while in other states the uneasiness is infinitely greater than the evil this nation must therefore have a fixed and certain credit because it borrows of itself and pays itself it is possible for it to undertake things above its natural strength and employ against its enemies immense sums of fictitious riches which the credit and nature of the government may render real to preserve its liberty it borrows of its subjects and the subjects seeing that its credit would be lost if ever it were conquered have a new motive to make fresh efforts in defence of its liberty this nation inhabiting an island is not fond of conquering because it would be weakened by distant conquests especially as the soil of the island is good for it has then no need of enriching itself by war and as no citizen is subject to another each sets a greater value on his own liberty than on the glory of one or any number of citizens military men are there regarded as belonging to a profession which may be useful but is often dangerous and as men whose very services are burthensome to the nation civil qualifications are therefore more esteemed than the military this nation which liberty and the laws render easy on being freed from pernicious prejudices is become     a trading people and as it has some of those primitive materials of trade out of which are manufactured such things as from the artists hand receive a considerable value it has made settlements proper to procure the enjoyment of this gift of heaven in its fullest extent as this nation is situated towards the north and has many superfluous commodities it must want also a great number of merchandizes which its climate will not produce it has therefore entered into a great and necessary intercourse with the southern nations and making choice of those states whom it is willing to favour with an advantageous commerce it enters into such treaties with the nation it has chosen as are reciprocally useful to both in a state where on the one hand the opulence is extreme and on the other the taxes are excessive they are hardly able to live on a small fortune without industry many therefore under a pretence of travelling or of health retire from amongst them and go in search of plenty even to the countries of slavery a trading nation has a prodigious number of little particular interests it may then injure or be injured an infinite number of ways thus it becomes immoderately jealous and is more afflicted at the prosperity of others than it rejoices at its own and its laws otherwise mild and easy may be so rigid with respect to the trade and navigation carried on with it that it may seem to trade only with enemies if this nation sends colonies abroad it must rather be to extend its commerce than its dominion as men are fond of introducing into other places what they have established amongst themselves they have given the people of the colonies their own form     of government and this government carrying prosperity along with it they have raised great nations in the forests they were sent to inhabit having formerly subdued a neighbouring nation which by its situation the goodness of its ports and the nature of its products inspires it with jealousy though it has given this nation its own laws yet it holds it in great dependence the subjects there are free and the state itself in slavery the conquered state has an excellent civil government but is oppressed by the law of nations laws are imposed by one country on the other and these are such as render its prosperity precarious and dependent on the will of a master the ruling nation inhabiting a large island and being in possession of a great trade hath with extraordinary ease grown powerful at sea and as the preservation of its liberties requires that it should have neither strong holds nor fortresses nor land forces it has occasion for a formidable navy to defend it against invasions a navy which must be superior to that of all other powers who employing their treasures in wars at land have not sufficient for those at sea the empire of the sea has always given those who have enjoyed it a natural pride because thinking themselves capable of extending their insults whereever they please they imagine that their power is as boundless as the ocean this nation has a great influence in the affairs of its neighbours for as its power is not employed in conquests its friendship is more courted and its resentment more dreaded than could naturally be expected from the inconstancy of its government and its domestic divisions     thus it is the fate of the executive power to be almost always disturbed at home and respected abroad should this nation on some occasions become the center of the negociations of europe probity and good faith would be carried to a greater height than in other places because the ministers being frequently obliged to justify their conduct before a popular council their negociations could not be secret and they would be forced to be in this respect a little more honest besides as they would in some sort be answerable for the events which an irregular conduct might produce the surest the safest way for them would be take the straitest path if the nobles were formerly possessed of an immoderate power and the monarch had found the means of abasing them by raising the people the point of extreme servitude must have been that between humbling the nobility and that in which the people began to feel their power thus this nation having been formerly subject to an arbitrary power on many occasions preserves the stile of it in such a manner as to let us frequently see upon the foundation of a free government the form of an absolute monarchy with regard to religion as in this state every subject has a free will and must consequently be either conducted by the light of his own mind or by the caprice of fancy it necessarily follows that every one must either look upon all religion with indifference by which means they are led to embrace the established religion or they must be zealous for religion in general by which means the number of sects is increased it is not impossible but that in this nation there may be men of no religion who would not however     bear to be obliged to change that which they would choose if they cared to choose any for they would immediately perceive that their lives and fortunes are not more particularly theirs than their manner of thinking and that whoever would deprive them of the one might even with better reason take away the other if amongst the different religions there is one that has been attempted to be established by methods of slavery it must there be odious because as we judge of things by the appendages we join with them it could never present itself to the mind in conjunction with the idea of liberty the laws against those who profess this religion could not however be of the sanguinary kind for liberty can never inflict such punishments but they may be so rigorous as to do all the mischief that can be done in cold blood it is possible that a thousand circumstances might concur to give the clergy so little credit that other citizens may have more therefore instead of a separation they have chosen rather to support the same burthens as the laity and in this respect to make only one body with them but as they always seek to conciliate the respect of the people they distinguish themselves by a more retired life a conduct more reserved and a greater purity of manners the clergy not being able to protect religion nor to be protected by it only seek to persuade their pens therefore furnish us with excellent works in proof of a revelation and of the providence of the supreme being yet the state prevents the sitting of their assemblies and does not suffer them to correct their own abuses it chooses thus through a caprice of liberty     rather to leave their reformation imperfect than to suffer the clergy to be the reformers those dignities which make a fundamental part of the constitution are more fixed than elsewhere but on the other hand the great in this country of liberty are nearer upon a level with the people their ranks are more separated and their persons more confounded as those who govern have a power which in some measure has need of fresh vigour every day they have a greater regard for such as are useful to them than for those who only contribute to their amusement we see therefore fewer courtiers flatterers and parasites in short fewer of all those who make their own advantage of the folly of the great men are less esteemed for frivolous talents and attainments than for essential qualities and of this kind there are but two riches and personal merit they enjoy a solid luxury founded not on the refinements of vanity but on that of real wants they ask nothing of nature but what nature can bestow the rich enjoy a great superfluity of fortune and yet have no relish for frivolous amusements thus many having more wealth than opportunities of expence employ it in a fantastical manner in this nation they have more judgement than taste as they are always employed about their own interest they have not that politeness which is founded on indolence and they really have not leisure to attain it the æra of roman politeness is the same as that of the establishment of arbitrary power an absolute government produces indolence and this gives birth to politeness the more people there are in a nation who require a circumspect behaviour and a care not to displease     the more there is of politeness but it is rather the politeness of morals than that of manners which ought to distinguish us from barbarous nations in a country where every man has in some sort a share in the administration of the government the women ought scarcely to live with the men they are therefore modest that is timid and this timidity constitutes their virtue whilst the men without a taste for gallantry plunge themselves into a debauchery which leaves them at leisure and in the enjoyment of their full liberty their laws not being made for one individual more than another each considers himself as a monarch and indeed the men of this nation are rather confederates than fellowsubjects as the climate has given many persons a restless spirit and extended views in a country where the constitution gives every man a share in its government and political interests conversation generally turns upon politics and we see men spend their lives in the calculation of events which considering the nature of things and the caprices of fortune or rather of men can scarcely be thought subject to the rules of calculation in a free nation it is very often a matter of indifference whether individuals reason well or ill it is sufficient that they do reason from hence springs that liberty which is a security from the effects of these reasonings but in a despotic government it is equally pernicious whether they reason well or ill their reasoning is alone sufficient to shock the principle of that government many people who have no desire of pleasing abandon themselves to their own particular humour and most of those who have wit and ingenuity are     ingenious in tormenting themselves filled with a contempt or disgust for all things they are unhappy amidst all the blessings that can possibly contribute to promote their felicity as no subject fears another the whole nation is proud for the pride of kings is founded only on their independence free nations are haughty others may more properly be called vain but as these men who are naturally so proud live much by themselves they are commonly bashful when they appear among strangers and we frequently see them behave for a considerable time with an odd mixture of pride and illplaced shame the character of the nation is more particularly discovered in their literary performances in which we find the men of thought and deep meditation as society gives us a sense of the ridicules of mankind retirement renders us more fit to reflect on the folly of vice their satirical writings are sharp and severe and we find amongst them many juvenals without discovering one horace in monarchies extremely absolute historians betray the truth because they are not at liberty to speak it in states remarkably free they betray the truth because of their liberty itself which always produces divisions every one becoming as great a slave to the prejudices of his faction as he could be in a despotic state their poets have more frequently an original rudeness of invention than that particular kind of delicacy which springs from taste we there find something which approaches nearer to the bold strength of a michael angelo than to the softer graces of a raphael the end of the first volume  it was a work in the form of letters the purpose of which was to prove
