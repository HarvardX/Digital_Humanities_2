on rheumatism and gout a letter addressed to sir george baker bart md frs fas etc etc  by john latham md fellow of the royal college of physicians physician to st bartholomews hospital physician to the magdalen and physician extraordinary to his royal highness the prince of wales  london printed for t n longman no    paternosterrow        a letter etc dear sir the liberty which i take of addressing you on the present occasion very naturally arises from that indulgence which you have always shown to me and from the opportunity which both as president of the college of physicians and as a private gentleman you have constantly granted for freedom of communication easy access very often invites intrusion and therefore if your doors have been open and i have not denied myself the satisfaction of walking in you must lay to that account the visits which i have sometimes made you and blame yourself alone for the interruption i know not however whether at this time i ought to presume to consider myself as a welcome visitor since the subject which i shall propose for your examination and on which i shall ultimately hope for your approbation will be an attack upon old opinions  in which perhaps i shall find you fortified by numbers against me but which i conceive to have been defended by a supposed impracticability of the approach rather than by the real strength of the fortress  the opinions to which i allude are such which the world in general medical as well as other men have hitherto held concerning those two very frequent diseases rheumatism and gout and which floating as it were in the minds of mankind without any compass to direct or rudder to steer their course have been tossed about by prejudices and at last lost in uncertainty it is no argument to say that in one of them sometimes and in the other often we sail on prosperously and reach the expected coast since this is more the effect of chance than of any well concerted plan and is owing rather to the nature of the vessel itself than to the regular management of the pilot  which being well built is blown over shoals by strong popular gales and is driven not conducted into harbor  our ideas on the diseases of rheumatism and gout have long indeed been very vague and very indeterminate for although each practitioner might be guided in the treatment of them by a particular theory of his own yet i should suppose that every one of us has observed phenomena both in one and in the other which he was unable to reconcile either to any preconceived opinion of the disease or rationally and satisfactorily to deduce from the laws of the animal machine for myself i will heartily confess that i have always considered rheumatism as a disease as little understood and as great a reproach to the faculty of physic as the gout  having been equally at a loss to account for facts as they occurred in both for although i have now passed several years of medical life and have had the honor i will also say the pleasure of spending some of them in the largest hospital of this metropolis as one of its physicians where there is annually admitted a number exceeding  0000 patients and although i have been and i mention it with pride am still connected with gentlemen of the first rank in their profession yet these opportunities have merely been sufficient to convince me that all the notions concerning these diseases are almost as unsettled and precarious as the symptoms of them are anomalous and irregular  it is somewhat singular amidst the contrariety of opinions which have been held concerning these two diseases that all practitioners should hitherto have agreed in one point that both of them are inflammations but notwithstanding the mass of assertion which we may find industriously collected in the earliest as well as in later writers i feel myself not only altogether unwilling to allow it but must contend decidedly and unequivocally against it we know the several ways in which inflammatory action terminates and when uninterrupted by art we generally find that it ends in suppuration or in gangrene for the slow kind of inflammation which now and then ends in schirrus may here be left out of the account but i believe none of us ever saw the rheumatism or the gout terminate either in the suppurative or the gangrenous process it may however be told me that the termination of every rheumatic and gouty case may be by resolution the other only remaining way in which inflammation is known to cease and therefore that every argument in support of a contrary doctrine must become unnecessary but to say nothing of the improbability of every case though unassisted and left to itself necessarily and uniformly ending by resolution when the very great majority of real inflammations treated by every means which skill can dictate are known to terminate otherwise if meeting the question fairly i shall show what may be the seat and natural progress of these diseases and succeeding as i hope i shall be found to do in those particulars i trust i shall then be thought to have established a more direct theory however independent it may prove to be on the doctrine of inflammations  although in the sequel of this letter i shall produce arguments for a close analogy between the two diseases yet i will to avoid confusion consider them distinctly from each other as what i shall advance concerning rheumatism will then more easily apply and perhaps be better understood in the explanation of gout which will afterward follow  i need not bring to your recollection that the system of arterial vessels has a twofold termination and that it very gradually diminishes by branching first from the trunk and by ramifying again from the branches until it ends either in most minute capillary tubes which convey the blood into continuous veins or in secerning extremities which prepare and deposit the matter of which the body is composed and which like spiracles give vent as it were to a portion of fluid separated from the common mass which as a kind of irriguous exhalation bedews and softens every interstice of the animal machine these from their office have properly enough attained the name of exhalants and would very soon distribute throughout the whole cellular texture as well as every other cavity of the body such a quantity of moisture as when collected would necessarily occasion dropsy were not this extravasation almost immediately corrected by another set of vessels which have been denominated absorbents or inhalants and which at their origin are of inconceivable exility for if as arbuthnot has stated ten capillary arteries are not equal in size to the finest hair and the least lymphatic vessel be more than an hundred times less than the smallest capillary artery the inhalant or absorbent vessel must at its commencement be minute almost beyond computation but we need not at all go to the extent of such a supposition since it will be sufficient for our purpose to consider the lymphatic system as beginning by innumerable orifices leading directly to tubes which in their capacities are collectively equal at least to the exhaling extremities of the arteries and which may be considered together as forming a series of vessels which in their turn are also collected into another series and so on until we are able to trace them into a distinct and regular arrangement conveying fluid back again into the sanguiferous system it is in these exquisitely fine and slender radicles of the lymphatic vessels that i place the seat of rheumatism  i think we may be allowed to assume it as an incontrovertible fact that any obstacle to the free passage of a fluid through a canal must of necessity occasion an accumulation in the several streams from which the canal is supplied and that these also having their current interrupted must thereby as necessarily impede the course of the numberless rivulets which should otherwise ordinarily flow into them and this we find universally to be the case with respect to the lymphatic system for whatever may be the obstructing cause every vessel immediately leading to the part obstructed must be filled and consequently the vessels forming the next series must be also distended a swelling and turgescence must therefore always arise in extent proportionate to the size and number of collateral and anastomosing branches which may for a certain space divert the fluid and then circuitously convey it into the regular trunk again  every body knows what usually happens when a gland in the axilla has been so greatly enlarged no matter from what cause as to prevent the fluid not only from passing through it but also by pressing upon the neighboring lymphatics from passing through them also that the arm swells and for a time remains in almost intolerable pain until the swollen gland subsides or until the fluid finds a passage by other more indirect courses if it be objected that the sanguiferous system is here also obstructed from the same cause and that thence alone may arise the painful distension of the limb i would answer that where lymphatic glands have been cut out by the knife as must be the case when in the removal of a cancerous breast they have been found to be diseased from the absorbed sanies that then where there is no tumor but a considerable vacuity from an actual loss of substance an interruption takes place from the destruction of the usual passages tumefaction is produced and pain equally excruciating follows when a diseased gland is extirpated from the groin as now and then has been practiced in some syphilitic cases the leg and thigh will long afterward continue in a painfully tumesied state until the collateral canals shall be capable of conveying forwards the accumulated fluid we have all of us seen after some difficult cases of parturition that one or both of the lower extremities have become oedematous and excessively painful during a very considerable length of time until the lymphatic vessels of the pelvis which have suffered by the difficulty of the labor shall have recovered from the injury then sustained or until others in their vicinity shall by gradual enlargement be fully competent to discharge their office for them i know however that there are instances where the pain is not so great as i have generally stated it to be in the examples which i have here adduced of obstructed lymphatics but i believe those will only be found to happen in very debilitated systems where there must consequently also be a very diminished energy in the action of the absorbents  the cases which i have just enumerated will be sufficient to show not only the general effect produced by any obstruction in the course of a lymphatic vessel but will very much tend to elucidate the doctrine which i am now about to deliver concerning rheumatism i have already said that i consider the seat of this disease as established in the minuter series of those vessels which afterward may more visibly be demonstrated to be lymphatics i suppose that the common causes producing rheumatism such as the sudden application of severe cold to the body when greatly heated and more especially of cold and moisture at the same time affect all the different series of the lymphatic system by occasioning a preternatural constriction of the vessels and consequently diminishing their diameters i need but mention the ready communicability of heat in bodies of unequal temperatures as it is a law so universally understood to show that a part possessing a given degree of warmth may suddenly be deprived of it and contracted in its dimensions according to another general law by exposing it to a medium intensely cold for as the lymphatics about the joints usually run more superficially than in other parts and as there we generally find fewer collateral branches obstruction struction may perhaps really happen more frequently from cold in those parts than in others but should it be otherwise yet from the paucity of vessels and the consequent difficulty in the transmission of their fluid when those vessels have been constricted obstruction must from any common cause be oftener there produced accumulation must take place and tumor heat redness and pain must follow when any set of vessels have thus had their natural arrangement altered and their usual offices interrupted the distension may have been so great as not only to have weakened them for the present but to have deprived them of the power of discharging their duty afterward in some instances indeed even actual rupture of a lymphatic as i have occasionally seen in rheumatism may be the consequence of distension for as the fluid which is absorbed cannot possibly regurgitate notwithstanding the doctrine of retrograde absorbents in a late popular work because absolutely prevented by the intervention of valves and as the extremities of the absorbing vessels are here in a constant state of activity still taking up fresh matter the lymphatic must either burst and discharge itself into the neighboring cellular membrane or the anastomosing and collateral vessels must adapt their capacities to the reception and transmission of the increased quantity of fluid in either case however whether of rupture or of such preternatural distension we may easily observe that if the part itself be not destroyed yet the economy of it must be extremely disturbed and in consequence of such disturbance that there will always be a liability to similar attacks in future although the cause should even be less forcibly applied i would even venture to say that whenever either of those cases rupture or distension has happened that almost any increased action of the sanguiferous system whether accompanied by exposure of the body to cold or not may produce rheumatism more or less violent according to the continuance of that action and according to the previous injury which may have been done to the lymphatic here then we see the precise difference between acute and chronic rheumatism the first always depending upon the operation of external and evident causes which when powerfully applied produce a proportionate constriction of the lymphatic vessels and consequently an accumulation of fluid in them the other arising from causes less evident indeed yet not less certain but connected already with circumstances which now always necessarily existing must constitute a predisposition in the system to be affected by such causes and subject it at all times to the effect of their immediate action  i hope i may presume to say that the sudden alteration both of the state and seat of the disease as well as its tendency to frequent and unexpected recurrence cannot militate against the doctrine which i have just advanced the very inconsistent idea of metastasis or transition of humor from one place to another where there is no actual communication of vessels ought not certainly to be adduced in argument to the contrary unless it can be proved by something more than assertion for whoever can suppose a lymphatic capable of being suddenly constricted may reasonably also imagine that constriction may sometimes be as suddenly removed and that the tension of the joint may therefore subside and if an enlargement even of the opposite limb should then take place with all the usual concomitants of heat and pain and redness i should think it much more likely to have happened from the general disposition to contractibility which then particularly exists in the lymphatic system and which may possibly have been aided by the concurrent though unheeded circumstance of an unguarded exposure to cold than that the fluid should so suddenly have passed to a distant part of the body through vessels hitherto unobserved and surely there can be nothing very absurd in the supposition of an increased contractibility if we allow that the fever as it is usually called which attends rheumatic cases can be so propagated as to affect the system generally since that very affection in the then very irritable state of the body may carry along with it even into the remotest lymphatic vessel a greater contractile tendency for every body knows that there are circumstances in which there is almost an exclusive affection of some parts of the animal machine without much disturbing the rest that opium for example shall more especially affect the nerves mercury the absorbents and antimony the exhalants that fat shall be generally deposited in the cellular membrane osseous matter in arteries venereal virus in bones impetiginous acrimony on the skin there is nothing therefore very wonderful that under certain circumstances also the lymphatic system should be more liable to be affected than at other times and if we can believe it ever to be brought into that sort of inactive or languid state which we generally denominate relaxed we shall find no difficulty in allowing that it may sometimes be influenced by an unusual degree of energy and thence deviate into that morbid excess of it which i have called i know not whether properly or not its contractibility  from this general view which i have taken of the lymphatics the frequent recurrence of the disease may easily be explained and if we also recollect what i have said above respecting their rupture and distension the probability of that explanation will be placed beyond all possible doubt whether it be applied to the acute or to the chronic rheumatism  it will be told me perhaps that as tumor heat pain and redness rigor thirst occasional vomiting quickened circulation and other symptoms of inflammatory action are present that the rheumatism is an inflammation of a peculiar kind having its own distinct and particular termination but strong as these signs certainly are and characteristic as they may be thought to be of the presence of actual inflammation yet who cannot almost immediately produce the whole of them by the application of a tight bandage the limb shall swell feel hot look red throb and be exceedingly painful and yet although the pulse shall beat more frequently shivering come on sickness sometimes supervene and the tongue and fauces even become dry these symptoms of inflammation shall immediately cease by the mere removal of the bandage but here by the way it may be said that something more than obstructed lymphatics are concerned and that the sanguiferous system is obstructed also but if where a general obstruction has taken place as to produce at once such a powerful combination of symptoms so strongly indicatory of inflammation and yet without inflammation actually arising the argument taken singly with respect to the lymphatic system will certainly go to prove that inflammation is not very likely to be the consequence of an obstruction there since it is not at all produced when we make the application to both of them together i might go on to say that even the very signs of inflammation which i have mentioned are sometimes very ambiguous for the passing of a stone from the kidney into the bladder or of a biliary calculus into the duodenum will be accompanied with most of them the spasmodic colic from lead and cholera and some other diseases which might be instanced are attended also by several and yet none of us ever dream of any thing like actual inflammation and with respect to the idea of the rheumatism having its inflammatory action terminated in a manner peculiar only to itself the same might with equal propriety be said of those diseases which i have just enumerated and where we know for certain that inflammation never happens neither will the buffy and sizy state of the blood i suppose be now insisted upon as an infallible proof of inflammation since we all know that in any of the diseases to which i am alluding and in others where the system is acting strongly the very same appearance will undoubtedly occur but the truth exactly is that the rheumatism can only terminate as i have before stated by the lymphatic recovering its usual office or by neighboring branches performing its duty for it or by its rupture and the consequent effusion of fluid into the cellular membrane terminations sufficiently distinct except that of resolution which i have above considered from those of inflammation  it may be needless for me to enter into the history of the symptoms of this disease as it is in general so well described by others and as i should suppose known almost to all there is no season of the year in which the rheumatism does not very frequently occur but those in which the vicissitudes of temperature are most sudden produce it oftener than others exposure to cold and moisture after violent exercise sitting in a strong current of air when the body is heated going into a damp bed wearing wet clothes or any such similar cause will generally produce it rigor heat restlessness thirst and all the common symptoms of fever usually precede a sense of soreness and stiffness which in a day or two are followed by pain and swelling all over but more especially about the joints of the body these swellings increasing in size look red and become smooth and glossy they now and then suddenly subside and sometimes as suddenly appear again in the same or in other joints they do not receive the impression of the finger like anasarcous tumors except toward the termination of the complaint when they will occasionally recede a little upon pressure the tongue is commonly white through the whole course of the disease the bowels are usually costive and the urine is of a palish amber color with a floating semipellucid cloud the fever after an uncertain duration diminishes by degrees the water becomes turbid and deposits a pinkcoloured sediment the skin feels cool and moist and the pain irregularly abates although it does not often entirely cease and the swelling diminishes in the order in which it arose first in the larger branches of the lymphatics then in the smaller first for example in the wrist then in the hand and afterward in the fingers but distorsion with little knotty protuberances containing a glary fluid and sometimes an indurated cretaceouslike matter too frequently continues the patient remains weak and recovers very slowly from a severe attack of this disease and which from its aptitude to recur both with and without fever generally harasses him more or less through the rest of his life  the different appellations which have been given to this disease seem only to be of consequence as pointing out to us the part affected for under whatever name it may be known the method which we employ for its cure after we have exactly ascertained its nature is commonly the same there are some indeed who think that a particular remedy is more proper in one variety of rheumatism than in another and will use that in lumbago which they never think of in sciatica but if there is general fever throughout the system and great pain with tumor of a part it is not material with respect to the curative intention whether it may be seated in the loins or the shoulders in an arm or a leg an upper or a lower extremity the thing most necessary therefore for us to determine in the method of cure is the simple distinction of the disease into acute and chronic rheumatism and when that is once exactly known we should employ that mode which reason and experience tell us to be the best and if the case be rendered sometimes obscure by being as it were blended and by partaking of the nature both of one and of the other we must be guided by symptoms and regulate our conduct accordingly for if merely the part affected was to determine the remedy and nothing more than just knowing it to be rheumatism was judged necessary for its cure i am afraid that lameness and deformity would but too frequently be the result of such irregular and unscientific practice  one would suppose from the precision with which men speak and write upon this disease that there was nothing so easy as the distinction of it into the acute and chronic state and that putting the patient to bed and increasing the external heat by covering him with a great number of blankets would at once determine it but although in the generality of cases we can from circumstances certainly declare which is of one kind and which of the other yet i can by no means either allow that the application of external heat is the best criterion by which we are to be directed or that it always increases the pain in the acute whilst it diminishes it in chronic rheumatism  it necessarily falls to my lot in the discharge of my public duty for i would not be thought vain and ostentatious by arguing from what i may observe in private practice to see annually a great number of patients afflicted with this disease but i do not find their pains so regularly increased by external heat as common opinion would have us to suppose nay i will even venture to affirm that where heat can be applied without pressure as in warm and vapor baths and sweating rooms the reverse is the fact and that not only chronic rheumatism as is allowed by all will be thereby relieved but that the acute also will be considerably mitigated the idea of comfort which we attach to a warm bed has become so habitual to us that when the accustomed rest does not follow it is no wonder in our disappointment that we should sometimes confound terms together and deduce an effect from a cause incapable of producing it for i think it much more reasonable to suppose that a patient who cannot bear the pressure of the hand as is almost always the case in acute rheumatism should experience pain equally intolerable by pressure upon him in bed than that warmth which under other circumstances undoubtedly relieves should here act otherwise  but if i should be told that external pressure is so guarded against in many cases that increased pain cannot thence be supposed to arise i would rather hazard the opinion that from the patient being placed in a reclined and horizontal position the muscles must be put into other states than they were in before and that in this deviation from their ordinary posture pressure more or less must consequently be produced upon the distended lymphatic than to allow any thing to the agency of external heat during this muscular alteration also we are impressed with the idea that rheumatic pain pursues the course of the muscle when in reality it is felt in the direction of the lymphatics and is no farther connected with muscle than water is with muscle in dropsical swellings of the cellular membrane which lies indeed contiguous to it but does not occupy it as the actual seat of the disease  it has generally been the fate of those diseases which have not been well understood to have been treated in very different and even very contradictory methods and as nature often prevails over the most irrational practice each of these several methods has at one time or other succeeded we need not therefore wonder that men should sometimes err in referring that to art which is the effect of causes purely natural i might instance diseases not a few in which either false observation or obstinacy of opinion or wrong deduction or indolence or superstition has introduced such confusion and incongruity that it is extremely difficult for a physician who puts too much faith in what he has read to form a proper decision from what he sees for he finds it almost impossible to shake off the authoritative opinions of others although the evidence of his own senses would lead him to a fairer and more obvious conclusion whoever but even superficially considers the treatment of rheumatism will observe one strong example of the truth of the general remark which i have just now made for he will find phlebotomy and blisters and purges and fomentations and bark and opium and mercury and antimony and guaiacum and volatile alkali and turpentine and a variety of other remedies applied indiscriminately in any stage of the disease and which too have all of them in their turns at one time or other appeared to be useful but he will not if he has not lost his reasoning faculties easily believe that from such a discordant collection of remedies it is a matter of indifference which he shall choose to employ notwithstanding he might be told by this or that author that each and all of them would certainly cure the disease  what i shall deliver concerning the cure of rheumatism will be taken as i think every curative indication ought to be from comparing the circumstances as they generally succeed each other with those which in the natural state of the body are known to constitute health and without being influenced either by the plausibility of a theory where facts seem not to accord with it or by the authority of great names which sometimes we know can stamp a value upon inconsistency i will just state the progress of the disease and follow it as well as i am able with the appropriate means of relief  when a patient first complains of stiffness and soreness and these are accompanied by the common sebrile symptoms we know not exactly what disease is about to succeed for it may turn out to be ague or any other species of fever strictly so called it may possibly be one of the exanthematous diseases or it may be any one of several other disorders just as likely as it may be rheumatism  but we know such an attack to be a deviation from the natural state of the body and therefore immediately employ those means which a proper consideration of the concurrent symptoms seems to require  the patient is perhaps accordingly advised to go to bed and to use those remedies which are calculated to promote an evacuation from the bowels and produce an increased perspiration  but the choice of these remedies is certainly not a matter of indifference a disease of considerable activity as we judge from the previous and then existing circumstances is now approaching and therefore in our endeavor to regulate the disordered state of the animal economy we should be careful lest our attempt should be the cause of much greater confusion in such cases i should suppose physicians would rather simply employ the neutral salts than purge with calomel or jalap or colocynth or any of the resinous articles of the materia medica notwithstanding it might appear to the patient and to his friends as a thing of very little moment how the evacuation was procured or whether a cooling or a stimulating medicine had produced it and for the same reason would bath the legs in warm water and use antimony and ipecacuanha and saline mixtures and all the milder kinds of diluent and diaphoretic remedies in preference to guaiacum or contrayerva or spice or alkohol or volatile alkali for if by relaxing the excretories perspiration can by the common and the natural power of the system be more copiously produced there is no need of quickening the circulation and consequently of stimulating any set of vessels to produce the same effect when an increased action of the system is not only not desirable but is even hurtful  but i must suppose for the sake of argument that the disease does not in a day or two yield to this method of treatment but as is then always the case shows itself by more evident symptoms actually to be rheumatism we may then if we please certainly proceed with strict propriety to phlebotomy as another powerful means of diminishing the activity of the system we may urge our relaxant plant with greater energy we may supply our diluents plentifully we may use fomentations or the warm bath we may apply leeches and we may give opiates by this time perhaps the disease may have been mitigated and as the system may probably have been much weakened by the necessary evacuations something more cordial as well as tonic may now be allowed along with the relaxant remedies but we should be well convinced that the rheumatism has very much subsided before we hazard the use of wine or steel or bark singly  irregular pains will now perhaps occupy different parts although the febrile symptoms shall have ceased altogether and therefore in this latter stage of the disease we may apply cupping glasses and blisters and stimulating plasters and liniments and we may use calomel or volatile alkali or turpentine or guaiacum or any other remedy of that class which we may then more particularly approve  this we may consider as the general outline of the cure of rheumatism which it is sufficiently easy for any of us to fill up according as the symptoms of the disease may vary or as circumstances may require  i will further however endeavor to show as briefly as i can how the several classes of remedies into which i have thought it right to divide the materia medica can be applied and of which i shall more especially mention those medicines whose use has commonly obtained in this disease  the class of astringents seems but of little use in the commencement of rheumatism for where there is too much obstruction already one would not hazard any remedy which might possibly diminish the area of vessels  and although it might be said that the obstructed vessels cannot admit of further constriction from the impossibility of receiving the astringent remedy into them yet no one will doubt that it may find admission into the neighboring vessels and consequently deny to the collateral branches that ready communication with the obstructed part by which it usually experiences relief and here i will observe once for all that i consider every medicine as carried through the system and as capable of acting upon the containing vessels for although it may be asked how can we conceive it probable that a grain or two of an astringent medicine can be so divided as to affect every part of the body i would answer that perhaps on this very divisibility of it depends its greater efficacy and that if by the common tests of chemical experiments we can certainly discover a single grain of vitriolated iron minutely diffused through every drop of several gallons of water there is no good reason to reject the supposition that the same or any other medicine may be equally divided and diffused through the whole animal machine i am well aware of opinions to the contrary but it is unnecessary to make any further digression upon a subject which is not immediately before us but although in the early stages of rheumatism an astringent remedy cannot be employed with advantage yet when the pain and swelling have subsided and the strength of the patient has necessarily been greatly diminished by the continuance as well as by the treatment of the disease it may then be given with considerable benefit it does not belong to this place to show how astringents may secondarily produce a tonic effect otherwise i might state that a gentle astrictive power constantly applied to the simple fiber must increase the cohesion of its parts and consequently render it stronger and that whilst this application is made as i conceive it may be made universally whether by acids or by metallic or vegetable matters a greater energy is given to the whole system by which it is enabled to discharge its several functions more and more perfectly until at last the regular and natural tone of it is completely restored  emollients from affecting the simple fiber in a manner directly the reverse of astringents i need not say ought to be used when the tension is great and heat and pain consequently very urgent for under contrary circumstances every one thinks the mollifying power of oil or mucilage or water either applied separately or in the form of liniments poultices or fomentations not only unnecessary but sometimes hurtful  i have before taken occasion to observe that every thing which stimulates the system in some stages of the acute rheumatism must be improper the class of stimulants therefore which increases the action of the living solid can only be employed under particular circumstances of this disease notwithstanding the frequent and indiscriminate use which is made of some of the remedies which are therein contained if anatomists are right in saying that there is a secerning extremity of an artery whose secretion may be augmented in proportion as the circulation is increased and if i am right also in fixing the eat of rheumatism as i have already done in those smaller vessels which constitute the first orders of the lymphatic system surely no remedy can be proper which tends to promote the secretion of a larger quantity of a fluid which is at present in too great abundance and whose absorption must undoubtedly add to the existing difficulties for here i suppose strong absorptive efforts always to take place since in rheumatism the extremities of the lymphatics are active and vigorous and the body not otherwise in a state of disease than as it may be induced by the obstruction and distention in the lymphatic vessels  far different from that state where the energy of the animal machine has been destroyed by previous disease where the fluid is permitted as it were to escape from the artery through its secerning extremity where it is collected in every cavity where it is diffused every where throughout the cellular membrane and where the absorbents are as it should almost seem in a state of flaccidity and have not force sufficient either to expand their orifices or power to imbibe the extravasated humidity  as these observations will abundantly suffice to elucidate the idea which i have entertained both of the abuse of stimulants in rheumatic cases and of the time also when they may occasionally be given with advantage i will only observe that the nearer the state of the disease is to that which we commonly call chronic and of course the less connected it may be with pain and heat and tumor the more rationally will this class of remedies be applied although the guaiacum is chiefly used yet any of the resins or the balsams may properly enough be employed with similar intentions  for when the system is languid the circulation feeble the pains irregular and the lymphatic weakened by distention we want something to promote a steady uniform action  for as debility will equally operate in occasioning congestion in the lymphatics as in other places so any thing which increases the activity of the living solid may remove it and by producing an uniformity of action afterward prevent its recurrence i know very well that my opinion respecting the use of stimulants in acute rheumatism will be attacked by the argument of volatile alkali which we all allow to be one of the most active medicines of this class being very frequently given with considerable success and promoting an easy and a copious diaphoresis but that i may not shrink from the opinion and desert it as illfounded i beg leave to urge in favor of it that in nine cases out of ten the stimulant power of ammonia is destroyed before it can possibly act upon the system in general every one who knows any thing about chemical affinities will agree with me when i assert that the mucus of the stomach will immediately unite with it into a kind of saponaceous mass and as such directly render its stimulant effect very doubtful but if it be allowed that acrid or acid matters ever exist in the stomach the ammonia which was given under the impression of its stimulating power will be converted into a neutral salt into a kind of spiritus mindereri and act upon the system with a truly relaxant power i have no hesitation in saying that such is my opinion also with respect to the two fixed alkalies the kali and natron which i consider as stimulants in less degree but which are convertible into very different medicines by the means abovementioned if likewife as is usual the patient dilutes plentifully with simple watery fluids the fact will be more obvious and the relaxation much more complete although i shall not perhaps be allowed by some to reckon calomel and other mercurial preparations as belonging to the class of stimulants yet experience will bear me out in saying that mercury is as hurtful in the acute as it is useful in the chronic rheumatism i do not mean to say that an occasional mercurial purge can do any particular mischief in the most acute stage of the disease but wish my observation respecting this mineral to be applied only to its regularly repeated dose which i suppose given after certain intervals like any other stimulant medicine and which i believe in acute cases always aggravates the disease all acrid matters taken from the vegetable kingdom as stimulants must not for the same reasons be indiscriminately employed for the arum cochlearia nasturtium raphanus and such like cannot be proper except in chronic cases in the same kind of general observation i might include the aromata which are sometimes given as well as those other more strictly medicinal articles contrayerva serpentaria and cascarilla there are others such as sarsaparilla and sassafras which might also be included in the above remark but the effects which i should otherwise expect from their stimulant power are often obviated by the watery vehicle with which they are diluted when given as they usually are in the form of decoctions i need not add that vinous liquors of every kind must however they may be diluted be considered as very highly improper in acute rheumatism whether administered under the denomination of spirits tinctures wines or ales the tepid springs of buxton and of bath when taken internally seem to me to produce that gently continued stimulant effect which i have conceived to be so very essential toward obtaining the cure of chronic rheumatism  i know very well that cases also of the acute kind are relieved by both of those waters by those of buxton more especially but i suppose in those instances that the good effects produced have arisen rather from the emollient and relaxant power of the external application than from their internal exhibition i will not however pretend to deny that as diluents also they may sometimes be serviceable in acute rheumatism and that when used as baths they likewise very constantly relieve the chronic state of the disease  if what i have said respecting stimulants be founded in reason very little argument will be necessary to prove that the class of sedatives must in almost every stage of the disease be proper i would beg however to be understood that i call those remedies sedative which without weakening the system diminish its activity and which may from a state of motion bring it under certain circumstances entirely to rest all medicines therefore of the narcotic kind will be included under that distinction which i intend by the class of sedatives for the great variety of remedies which are said to produce a sedative effect produce it secondarily only through the intervention of some primarily acting cause thus will asafoetida or ammoniacum or amber or castor or musk which we every day see given in some spasmodic affections overcome irregularity or inequality of action by means of their stimulant power indirectly producing with respect to the existing symptoms a complete sedative effect opium and cicuta are the sedatives which i have more especially employed in this disease and such as may boldly be given every three or four hours when the circumstances of tension and pain and watchfulness seem to require them  aconitum hyoscyamus digitalis and some others may perhaps likewise be found occasionally serviceable but custom has not yet sufficiently familiarised these even within the sphere of medical practice i think from the effects observable after a large dose of camphor that i am authorized in considering it also as a powerful sedative  as such i have very frequently given it and as such also from the benefit generally obtained i cannot but very strongly recommend it  tonics which may be said to maintain the power of the system without increasing its action may certainly very often be given with great advantage but when the body is already strong when the circulation is powerful the muscles firm and the secretions regular they cannot i believe do any good whatever for in acute rheumatism where the system in point of strength deviates little or nothing from its natural state we usually amongst other modes of relief attempt the recovery of our patient by means also which have a tendency to diminish both its force and its activity and therefore i should suppose when in the course of this disease the body becomes exhausted the circulation weak the muscular power enfeebled and the functions imperfectly discharged that bark and steel and bitters and such like remedies were then only admissible  the benefit which may be traced from the use of relaxants in the acute stage of this disease will always attach a very considerable value to this class of remedies if we examine the opinions of those who are the best informed upon this subject we shall at least find the majority of them favoring and recommending a relaxant plan for bleeding purging and sweating are as it were the three great cardinal pivots on which both the ancient and modern practice seems to turn that the loss of blood will diminish the acuteness of this disease experience abundantly confirms but if we keep in view the account which i have above given of its nature and of its seat we shall then most clearly see that the diminished quantity of circulating fluids must necessarily occasion a diminution in the quantity to be separated by the secerning extremity of the artery and consequently afford proportionally less to the active and healthy operation of the orifices of the absorbent vessels hence if any part of the lymphatic system be overcharged and distended it hereby acquires time to accommodate itself to the obstructing cause for as a depletion has been made in the blood vessels it is neither equally pressed upon from behind by the accession of fresh fluid nor meets an equal obstacle to the regular discharge of its burden into the veins but then more readily propels its contents and contracts itself to its usual dimensions the advantages to be derived from purging in acute rheumatism do not merely depend upon the excrementitious matter evacuated but upon the loss of a large quantity of fluid poured from the different excretories into the intestinal canal during the operation for the sudden evacuation of any fluid tends directly to diminish the quantity in the circulating vessels and must consequently produce a proportionate degree of general relaxation the remedies which will promote a determination as it is called to the surface have always been held to be proper both in the acute and in the chronic rheumatism but the choice of them is not as i have before observed a matter of small moment for there is a manifest difference whether the diaphoresis be produced by stimulant or by relaxant remedies i need not again go over arguments to prove that the chronic rheumatism which is more especially confined to a part owes its very existence to the debility there produced by previous injury either from distension or from rupture  in either of these cases a regularly exhibited stimulant by giving a little more energy to the whole system promotes a more uniform action of the diseased part and often completely effects a cure but it is not necessary i think that actual sweating should be produced for the cure depends as i suppose not upon excess of action but upon its uniformity for the excess either with but more particularly without sweating often aggravates the disease in the acute rheumatism however where the system is in general acting powfully and where the part diseased has really become so from causes of obstruction which are entirely independent of debility the diaphoresis must be produced by very different means and here the neutral mixture of acid and alkali would hold a most distinguished place were it given in large and proper doses but as the prejudices of mankind will not often allow them to get out of a beaten path we are too frequently obliged either to exhibit this mildest and very efficacious relaxant in a manner so inert as almost to disgrace its character as a medicine or to call in the aid of other remedies which are active in smaller doses for if it is intended to produce the full effect of a relaxant i think it should be given as an ordinary drink in the way in which we would direct barleywater lemonade imperial or any other common or medicated diluent in this mode of administration it would operate upon the bowels also as a gentle laxative and render the use of kali vitriolatum kali tartarisatum natron vitriolatum and others of this class which we usually distinguish by the general name of neutral salts almost altogether unnecessary some of which however by the bye and perhaps all of them if given in smaller doses than those in which they are commonly exhibited as purgatives would be little if at all inferior to the celebrated draught of riverius  in the class of relaxants useful in acute rheumatism i must very particularly reckon the antimonials i need not say that all of them may be so managed as to produce their proper effect and that even in the chronic state of the disease they may be so combined with calomel guaiacum or other stimulants as to form a remedy often very highly serviceable ipecacuanha and perhaps some other remedies which in certain doses provoke nauses belong also to this class of relaxants the pulvis ipecacuanhae compositus dovers powder has long been considered as a medicine of very great utility in acute rheumatism and is one of those happy compounds where the relaxant effects derived from two of its ingredients seem to be improved by the sedative power of the opium  water milk and water milkwhey buttermilk barleywater and such others as may alter the state of the fluids simply by diluting them are very proper both in the acute and in the chronic rheumatism but indeed i do not know whether i ought to have stated any thing as diluent besides water for the others which i have enumerated together with all the various mucilaginous decoctions mixtures and emulsions which might be mentioned seem more particularly to belong to the class of demulcents which in rheumatism as we do not suppose any acrimony present in the system as its cause we need not particularly consider  the remaining classes of remedies which merely promote the discharge of matters from the body which have become oppressive or excrementitious without affecting or affecting but little the general economy of the animal machine are but in a small degree applicable in the cure of rheumatism thus apophlegmatics or those remedies which cleanse the mouth and fauces are not at all necessarily employed in this disease emetics indeed may indirectly promote the action of the absorbents and may or may not as circumstances happen to combine be useful in some cases and if they are given only in such small doses as to create a constant nausea they may certainly produce a relaxant effect the same observation may also be extended to purgatives which besides evacuating the intestinal canal may as i have above observed be followed by other very beneficial effects but until we shall be convinced that there is some morbific matter to be expelled which is the cause of rheumatism or granting that until we can bring ourselves to suppose that by means of glandular secretion such a matter can be separated from the general mass of fluids and moreover that the kidneys are the glands more directly appropriated to that purpose we shall not i think completely trust the cure of this disease to the very fallacious and uncertain action of diuretics  such dear sir are the opinions which i have long entertained respecting rheumatism i have been led toward them by no blind guides for in this as well as in most other things which bear any relation to our profession i have endeavored to follow reason and experience i may indeed have mistaken my conductors and been imposed upon by the meretricious charms of fancy and hypothesis but unless you who are so well qualified to be my judge convict me of error i must still continue to advance and to maintain them influenced therefore by the same sentiments and guided as i believe by the same directors i will now proceed to consider the principal phenomena attendant upon gout and to point out as consistently as i am able some of those almost unintelligible circumstances which have always accompanied this disease  as i have endavoured in the former part of this letter to make it appear that neither gout nor rheumatism are at all connected with the doctrine of inflammation it will be unnecessary for me here to repeat the arguments which i then adduced in support of an opinion which was intended to be distinctly and unequivocally understood the analogy which thence i think exists between the two diseases will become however much more obvious when we shall have considered that the seat of both is precisely the same that their progress is not much unlike and their termination not very dissimilar  flatulence eructation nausea coldness in the region of the stomach dyspepsia borborygmi languor vertigo palpitation dyspnaea quick small and interrupted pulse slight rigors with irregular and clammy sweats all or some of them usually accompany the gout and if pain be constant and excessive either in the hands or feet wrists elbows ancles or knees attended with the common febrile symptoms and increasing for several hours with heat redness and tumor and in the course of a few days gradually again subsiding with itching and sweating of the part the patient is said to have had a regular sit of the gout but if the pain should be equally violent and instead of the extremities should affect the head or lungs or stomach or bowels or kidneys or bladder the gout is denominated misplaced but if the pain should be inconstant with respect to its duration and attack one place and then another without producing any very considerable heat or tumor it generally obtains the name of an irregular fit to these may i think be referred all the varieties of gout which we meet with either in books or in practice and these again as we shall presently see might i believe be more properly distinguished like rheumatism into the acute and chronic  the sensations which patients experience during a fit of the gout are so differently described by them that we cannot collect any thing very accurately from their descriptions except one circumstance and in that they all agree that the pain is exquisite in one it gnaws in another it lacerates in this it burns like red hot iron in that it chills him like ice this feels the bones screwed out of their sockets and that declares them to be bruised to a jelly in short in this as in other diseases where there is excess of pain the senses must necessarily be disturbed and as sensation has thus consequently been rendered imperfect we may very naturally expect a diversity in their descriptions  it has been observed of gout that it seldom attacks any persons but those of adult age  and of these more particularly perhaps only such as have indulged in those kinds of excesses which have done violence to the system by disturbing or destroying its functions and here in the very foremost rank must i place that most pernicious of all possible habits which consists in the use of vinous and spirituous liquors for not only gout but dropsy palsy apoplexy and insanity in a manner most evident and incontrovertible are too frequently derived from the abuse of them i need not endeavor to make the picture more horrible by filling it up with groupes of miserable wretches who deduce their diseases from the same undoubted cause otherwise i might state it as a fact that at least the half of all their infirmities is so produced and that there is not perhaps more than one fourth of the catalogue unconnected with it i might also extend my observation to the influence which this most fatal custom has upon the morals of the world were i not likely to be considered as straying a little beyond the line of my profession i cannot however help mentioning that in one of the hospitals where i have the honor of having my services accepted as the physician that not one in six of those unhappy females who have been addicted to intemperance in drinking is reclaimed although more than two thirds of the whole number there admitted are eventually reformed but let not the argument against the abuse of liquors be supposed only to be applied to those in the lowest ranks of society for it will be found just and applicable to all as well to those who are in a station below mediocrity as to those who are very much removed above it one may indeed dispatch his business sooner than the other but both of them are found at last to have done it surely and effectually but as it will naturally enough occur as a question what may really be the abuse of wines or of spirits i will not hesitate to declare that whenever it disturbs the animal economy it must be improper and that the use of it at all will then constitute its abuse i know very well that in a state of health there are sometimes certain conditions which require the use of wine or of spirit but if those conditions frequently occur the occupation which produced them ought rather to be changed than that the necessity for the remedy should by its repetition by degrees at last convert it into a poison for the natural antidote of languor and fatigue is rest and if we substitute a remedy which by its stimulant powers compels the system to do more than in its ordinary state it is accustomed to perform the constitution must at last break down and disease of some kind or other must inevitably follow the very constant custom of drinking wine and spirits has now indeed so very much obtained that one would almost think that they were equally necessary to life as food and that they were as conducive to easy and complete digestion as they are in reality in the end destructive of it i may very possibly be told that there are numbers in the regular habit of taking all sorts of liquors and who are living to a good old age without experiencing any bad effects from them  but i would ask in return whether they actually experience any good effects whether one who may thus be said to be fortunate has not outlived an hundred instances to the contrary  and whether the single example which has thus happily resisted injury ought to be admitted as a fair argument to prove the innocence of a custom when it is in the power of every medical practitioner to point out numbers who are daily becoming martyrs to it  during this habitual and pernicious practice which might produce any of those diseases which i have said most commonly follow as the effects of it the indulgence with respect to food determines it rather to be gout than any other for the stomach already enfeebled by being accustomed to the most powerful stimulants seems now to relish or to bear only that sort of aliment which is immoderately spiced and seasoned and which if it yields any nutriment at all must afford it in consequence of a hurried and incomplete digestion from which there must necessarily be prepared a crude and vitiated chyle and although probably in the natural and regular discharge of the functions of the body any little error may by the powers of the system itself be corrected yet where any organ has lost its energy and the means which destroyed it are still continually applied to it we must not expect that nature can any longer resist such reiterated violence but these indulgencies are often unavoidably connected with another circumstance which is almost equally injurious to the regular economy of the animal machine the usual hours of rest are generally encroached upon by a debauch and when an opportunity of retiring at last arrives sleep which ought to renew his strength for the various employments of the succeeding day if it comes at all generally visits him in all the horrors of apoplectic stertor oppressive colliquation sickness dreams and incubus  from the observations which i have already made it will easily be seen that i consider a preternatural degree of irritability to be generated in the system as the effect of excessive stimulus and that the digestive faculties being thereby also deranged chyle in an imperfect state is constantly forced upon the lacteals and thence into the circulation in a greater quantity than the ordinary offices of the intervening glands and of the lungs are able to correct an incongruous unassimilated fluid must therefore every where be circulated and exposed to the action of the secerning extremities of the arteries here indeed it may be modified and rendered more fit to enter by the absorbent system where it is further modified before it is ultimately conveyed into the circulation again but the body may be in such an extreme state of irritability that the lymphatics upon receiving this imperfect fluid may thence immediately be disturbed their functions interrupted constriction produced and pain heat redness and tension follow gout therefore according to this idea may as the common expression has it be flying all over the body for every lymphatic throughout the system may more or less be affected if situated in a patients extremities it is generally attended by the usual symptoms which in an active state of the body constitute it a regular fit but if misplaced or seated in parts very essential to life the same activity of system immediately produces such imminent distress that death too frequently unexpected suddenly destroys him i need not say that this is the gout which may reasonably enough be denominated acute since it is quick in its accession and speedy in its progress the same common causes which were enumerated as tending to bring on an attack of rheumatism may here also very likely cooperate and six a man at once with a fit of the gout which might otherwise have deferred its visit to a more distant period  for the constitution sometimes suffers long under a variety of symptoms proceeding from indigestion and the want of a proper assimilation until such occasional causes concurring with the increasing irritability of the system at last render the disease more manifest  i might perhaps with more propriety of arrangement have added above to the excesses which become the foundation of an irritable and depraved state of the body that any thing superadded to those irregularities which in its consequences diminishes the vigor of the system must necessarily increase that irritability and deprativity thus it has always been maintained that immoderate venery and intense study as they are two principal causes of debility must very considerably augment any previously existing disposition to a gouty affection but i think also that independent of such a previous disposition they may eventually produce the disease for whatever debilitates the general frame must debilitate its functions and by that means ultimately induce not only preternatural irritability of the solids but such a depravity of the humors that may or may not terminate as occasional causes may conspire in a fit of gout i think too that a constant anxiety of mind accompanied with daily bodily fatigue as for example must inevitably happen in the professions of physic and of law may for the same reasons even in early life create such a disposition as when the frame grows old and the powers of the system become weaker may end according to circumstances in actual gout i know very well that some of my friends will here smile and say that in speaking of causes i have purposely omitted to mention all the good living which professional men have the credit of enjoying with the world in general but be that as it may there certainly are to be found some instances in both of them as well as in several other very active employments where from causes not at all connected with any such sort of enjoyment the gout torments a man who really does not seem to have deserved it and i believe also that a solitary instance may even now and then arise in persons of advanced age and irritable fiber where from merely an alteration in the state of the lymphatic by induration or ossification the hands and feet suddenly become swollen and painful and assume every appearance of a regular fit but the gout which seizes a patient under the several circumstances which i have just been endeavoring to describe is seldom very violent in its attack or very quick in its progress as it appears in debilitated habits and is irregular in its accession it has been usually called atonic gout but as it is generally of long duration i would rather wish to follow the analogy and give it the appellation of chronic for the seat of it is the same with its kindred disease of rheumatism and like it too it continues through the remainder of life at uncertain intervals to distress the miserable sufferer  i have above mentioned that the gout may be misplaced as it is commonly termed and by seizing upon some of the nobler parts immediately destroy life but i beg leave here to assert it as my opinion that either in the acute or chronic state of the disease the patient may suddenly die without any attack of actual gout upon those parts without any misplacement without any retrocession i believe it will be admitted by all that there is both in health and in disease a particular consent throughout the system and a sort of sympathy existing between distant parts that when one is affected another without any direct communication shall be affected also the dislocation of a joint shall be attended with syncope and an inflammation of the kidneys with vomiting  an overcharged stomach shall produce headache cholera shall be accompanied with spasms of the legs and a wound of the toe or singer be followed by a lockedjaw or even universal tetanus and why may we not suppose that in the exquisite irritability of system which always accompanies gout that from causes which must probably for ever remain inexplicable the head the lungs the stomach or the intestines may also sympathise with the distantly affected part in a similar manner  it i were not afraid of entering into a contest about a matter of mere opinion for which i have but little leisure and less inclination i should almost be disposed to dispute the doctrine of hereditary gout i will allow that it has attacked father and son from one generation to another through a long series of years but unless it can be shown that the education of the child has been correctly proper and unless it can be proved that the son has not lived as the father i have a right to maintain that the gout might originate with the son as well as with the father before him and if it can be proved as it may in a thousand instances that a gouty family by change of fortune  from a state of affluence to that of an inferior condition has ever lost the disease we may then very justly doubt the truth of the opinion we hear every day from patients that their bilious disorders are hereditary but every physician knows that the secretion of the bile is disturbed by causes evidently more reasonable than the supposed inherent disposition derived from their ancestors the dropsy too and stone and other diseases which might be enumerated have been reckoned hereditary for no better reasons as well perhaps might the ague in the hundreds of essex be called hereditary which arises from the very same general cause operating upon all or the itch which in some families seems to be handed down as an heirloom from generation to generation  there is another very generally received opinion which i cannot admit to be founded in fact notwithstanding it may be stated upon the authority of almost every gouty person that a paroxysm of the gout is salutary to the system and relieves it from every other disorder no one of the medical profession will doubt the veracity of sydenham who tells us that his repeated fits of the gout were at last accompanied with a disease equally or more deplorable the stone and each of us might also from our own observation enumerate others but a less temperate man than this our english hippocrates strangely suffers himself to become the dupe of a fanciful delusion and boldly rushes amidst precipices until he suddenly tumbles down headlong for he does not blush by daily irregularity to build upon that foundation which he has so assiduously been laying and where structures very different to that which he had intended arise along with it but there cannot in any view of the matter be the least excuse for his intemperance for by this time he may assure himself if he has any reflection that he has unadvisedly embraced what he now knows to be an error and that the pernicious consequences of the custom are as certain as the pleasures attending its commission are transient one would suppose too that the gout even if it really was the cure of every other disorder afforded not in the misery which it brings along with it any very great cause of exultation and would rather heartily pity a man than wish him joy of the remedy in which he thus prides himself and which he sometimes has the happiness of trying at least nine months out of the year but the plan of administering this remedy although it be generally so exactly suited to his inclinations does not so well accord with his constitution for wine and brandy and such like stimulants which invariably constitute the chief part of his regimen not only give the full effect to his favorite disease but undoubtedly very often produce other disorders vertigo dyspepsia tremor restlessness and all the indescribable marks of nervous and bilious affections soon begin to show themselves which being too frequently mistaken for wandering and misplaced gout call again in the opinion of the misguided sufferer for fresh quantities of these baneful cordials which instead of proving the antidote for those diseases tend only the more to fix and to confirm them jaundice dropsy marasmus haemorrhagy hectic fever and colliquative sweats teach him too late that to obstinacy in his error his life must soon become an inevitable sacrifice cordials then fail him his stomach nauseates the scorching doses and none but the mildest means which he has hitherto reprobated and neglected can only now a little while unkindly prolong that misery which death is anxiously waiting to terminate  the progress of a fit of the gout as i believe i have above mentioned is quick or slow according as it may be influenced by particular circumstances for if the system be acting strongly and vigorously the limb as in rheumatism will swell become red and excessively painful and in the course of a few days again subside and recover gradually its proper functions but if the constitution has already been much impaired by repeated attacks or has previously been debilitated from other causes the gout though attended with symptoms sufficiently painful does not proceed with that rapidity which would characterise it as the acute gout but slowly and irregularly like a truly chronic disease advances toward its termination and here i must take occasion to observe  that whether in its acute or chronic state this disease like the rheumatism must end either by the lymphatic recovering its proper office or by collateral channels vicariously discharging its duty or by the fluid being effused into the adjacent cellular texture in consequence of its rupture  where from the dissipation of its thinner parts it concretes into an indurated mass and is vulgarly called a chalk stone  upon the cure of a disease which common opinion almost supposes to be incurable you must not expect me to deliver any thing very decisive the prejudices of the multitude are always opposed to the experience of the few and therefore what you and others of the medical profession may concur with me in considering as proper and correct the world in general will very probably disregard as trifling and hypothetical whilst i profess myself therefore to be one of those who think that the gout may be often alleviated by other means than patience and flannel i do not expect to be implicitly believed and when the prepossessions of a patient have induced him to entertain the idea that nothing else can be done for him i would rather give him up to his own remedies which will often undoubtedly afford him very great assistance than press any method upon him in which he had not a reasonable confidence and consequently in which he could not be expected unremittingly to perserve  during a fit of the gout it is in vain to attempt any thing more than a mitigation of the existing distress it is only after the paroxysm has ceased that the expectation of a complete cure can rationally be entertained  for the sake of arrangement we will suppose a man just seized for the first time with a regular fit of the gout in his hand or foot accompanied with the usual symptoms attendant upon pain and tumefaction although it may not be so very exactly marked as to distinguish it at once from rheumatism or from rheumatic gout a name by the bye which seems to have been invented to cover the difficulty of nicer discrimination yet if the circulation be found quick the skin hot the mouth dry or clammy and the mind as well as body in a state of restlessness and agitation there will be a sufficient assemblage of symptoms to determine a physician in his method of cure i should suppose that nothing very materially different from the plan which was laid down as useful in the active state of acute rheumatism could here be thought wrong and that relaxant and diluent remedies aided by moderate external heat could not be improper the general irritability of the system will demand also a proportionate dose of a sedative medicine and constipation must be prevented by the seasonable use of purgatives the proper administration of such a method will commonly produce an alleviation of all the symptoms and a little time with the assistance of proper tonics will usually complete the cure but by the frequent repetition of such attacks as the system must now be considerably debilitated we will suppose its uniformity greatly interrupted and instead of the regular swelling and the commonly continued degree of torture the appearance of the tumefaction shall be ambiguous and the pain variable and inconstant and here in this irregular state of the disease with a body almost worn out and a mind equally shattered and enervated what concurrence of symptoms shall i describe from which we may reasonably deduce any curative intention what sydenham calls an unconnected and disorderly set of phenomena farrago quoedam  incomposita atque inordinata and which he applies so properly to hysterical affections may give some idea of that contrariety of symptoms which very often appears in a fit of irregular and chronic gout if indeed this very confusion itself does not afford us the best indication of the nature of the disease i am at least sure that some physicians and those of no mean account are disposed to think that a better characteristic of it is still wanting and therefore do not hesitate to call it gout because they cannot with certainty so develope the symptoms as to denominate it any other disease the dyspeptic condition of the stomach the paralytic tremors of the limbs the convulsive twitchings of the muscles the relaxed joints the frequent syncope the interrupted respiration the apoplectic vertigo the oedematous extremities the universal marasmus and the despondency of mind are all of them and more indeed might be added to the catalogue the genuine marks of the chronic state of this disease and as they must necessarily call for their own appropriate remedies no general method of cure can be established as applicable to them all i cannot therefore attempt to introduce any certain and specific plan for the relief of the disease so accompanied but will consider the several circumstances as they arise according to my own therapeutic classification  the astringent order of medicines inasmuch as it may sometimes indirectly answer the purpose of tonics as i have above endeavored to explain when treating of rheumatism may occasionally be used when the system is laboring under the evident effects of debility when the digestive organs tardily perform their functions and the bodily strength is still wasting by colliquative perspirations i will not unnecessarily extend this letter by mentioning particular remedies as the choice of each must be directed by circumstances not only depending upon the period of the disease and the constitution of the patient but upon a variety of others which can only be known as they are combined with and arise out of the occasion of administering them and in this i am confident that every physician who practices upon a rational and comprehensive scale will agree with me whatever may be the opinion of those who consult their memorandumbook rather than their judgment and look for a nostrum ready prepared and manufactured instead of examining the case and then adopting a formula from the plain dictates of a common understanding  the emollient class may certainly be very well employed whenever there may be tension and consequent pain whether the disease be of the acute or chronic kind  and any of those external means which are calculated to soften the part without impeding perspiration or any other office of the skin will be proper  stimulants in the acute state of gout notwithstanding their use has so very commonly obtained both in the practice of almost every patient and in the recommendation of almost every physician cannot surely be entitled to such a general approbation from the actual experience of either they have adopted the remedy because it is pleasant and customary not because it is good and serviceable for if they practice upon the old idea that gout is a disease highly inflammatory one would suppose it impossible that brandy and madeira could be chosen as the proper remedies to diminish its activity and if the opinion which i have entertained of the nature of the disease be thought by them in anywise consonant to reason they will easily also agree with me in thinking that the indiscriminate use of stimulants cannot mitigate it but in the chronic state of this disease where the debility is extreme where dyspepsia greatly oppresses the patient and where there is a general tardiness in the performance of the ordinary functions i am very far from supposing that a regularly and properly administered stimulant which produces a constant equal and uniform action throughout the system can be wrong when innumerable examples of the contrary are occurring every day upon this principle i suppose that blisters and sinapisms which are commonly applied to the extremities may be useful for so long as they contribute toward promoting a greater degree of energy in the habit they may be of advantage to it  i think there can be very little doubt about the propriety of admitting the class of sedatives into the method of cure for the gout whether it be acute or chronic for pain must in either case be mitigated and as we know that in the most active state of the disease opium and the rest may be very well combined with those medicines which are calculated to diminish the power and force of the system so may they also with an equal degree of fitness be joined with those which correct its irregularity and restore to it its firmness and its stability in the common attack therefore upon the stomach and indeed upon other parts where the idea of misplaced gout has usually called for the strongest stimulants in very immoderate quantities i would rather trust to a sedative for immediate relief either alone or in conjunction with other medicines as circumstances might then indicate and seem to require  the weak and debilitated state to which patients are sometimes reduced by a long continued fit of the gout and in which we generally find them during the tedious lingering attack of it in its chronic form demands the use of tonics  and therefore the peruvian bark and bitters and other strengthening remedies will here maintain their place and character as very useful  the relaxant class will always merit considerable attention in the first attack of the acute gout the vigor and activity which then prevail in the system  the quickened circulation the general heat and restlessness the thirst and other febrile symptoms all require the immediate exhibition of relaxants and the neutralized saline remedies antimonials and others which relax the system without heating it will be given with manifest advantage i have no great doubt upon my mind that under the above circumstances phlebotomy might very often be productive of considerable benefit to the patient notwithstanding its use appears not yet sufficiently to have obtained in practice  for in all the doubtful cases where it has not been exactly determined whether the disease was gout or rheumatism and where phlebotomy has been employed as the cure it has evidently relieved and it would be ridiculous to allow in matters of ambiguity that the chance has always fallen on the right disease and that bleeding which we sometimes judge proper in rheumatism has invariably and although we found it so very difficult to discriminate been performed in one and never in the other i will not however press the opinion which both reason and analogy have thus induced me to support since no one will suppose that there are not many cases of gout in which its use may be very hazardous and many in which it would be absolutely hurtful for it is only in the very acute stage of this disease where the body has not been previously reduced by general irregularity but is strong and vigorous that i should ever consider the necessity of venaesection in all cases otherwise circumstanced there cannot possibly be a doubt about its impropriety  the topical application of leeches where the limb is greatly loaded and distended i have never found injurious but on the contrary i might perhaps say that i have always found it beneficial  diluents and demulcents whether we consider them merely as vehicles for more efficacious remedies or as capable themselves of correcting or altering the state of the circulating fluids cannot in any stage of the disease be improper  as to the other classes of remedies which may or may not be requisite as the state of the constitution may or may not be influenced by the disease under which it labors i do not think it of any importance to endeavor to call your particular attention toward them for every one readily knows when there is any necessity for their exhibition  the protuberances which often appear upon the extremities in consequence of a severe fit of the gout and which i have before observed have been denominated chalkstones as they sometimes degenerate into ulcers very difficult of cure will frequently require the assistance of surgery i have no opinion of the utility of the marine acid bath in such cases notwithstanding it has been much employed upon the continent and lately recommended here for unless these protuberances can be proved to consist of uncombined calcareous earth as their name would import but of which as detached from phosphoric acid i believe there exists not a single particle the marine acid cannot easily affect them without equally destroying the intermediate and connecting animal fibers  when the paroxysm has completely ceased if the patient has the resolution to enter upon a very strict regimen he may generally prevent its recurrence i must be understood to speak of such cases only where the gout has properly subsided and where the parts being entire are again performing their functions perfectly herethen if he determines upon abstinence from every thing which stimulates and which in the end most assuredly produces a morbid irritability of the system if he is moderate in his pleasures his business and his exercise if he strictly denies himself every kind of spirituous vinous or other fermented liquor if he steadily adheres to a milk and vegetable diet if he observes early hours supports a regular warmth of body and keeps the passions of the mind equal and undisturbed he will i have no doubt not only deserve a cure but find it and in the chronic state likewise of this disease it might be well for him to consider whether a general plan of forbearance and moderation might not better alleviate the miseries which always accompany it than the contrary habit which too commonly prevails and whether a disease which when thus fixed affords us but little hope of eradicating it may not however be rendered much more severe and intolerable by the many additional evils which must necessarily arise from intemperance  after having thus brought my letter to its conclusion i have only to hope that in the course of it i have not manifested an indecorous presumption in delivering particular opinions nor betrayed an unreasonable confidence in maintaining them what i have written has been suggested entirely by cases which have fallen under my own care and if any observations have been made which do not exactly accord with former theories i can only say that they are the result of reflections which have been faithfully copied from practice i may be wrong but i am not conscious of my error let me therefore trust if better information than that which i have hitherto acquired should detect my mistakes that it will be advanced with temper and urged against me with liberality for the cause of science is best promoted by candid discussion and calm investigation  i have the honor to be dear sir with the greatest respect your very obedient and much obliged humble servant j latham badford row nov
