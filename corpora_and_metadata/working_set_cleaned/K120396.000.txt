frequently a powerful influence on the conduct of life and either throws it into the retreat of uniform obscurity or marks it with irregularities that lead to misery and disquiet the gifts of imagination bring the heaviest task upon the vigilance of reason and to bear those faculties with unerring rectitude or invariable propriety requires a degree of firmness and of cool attention which does not always attend the higher gifts of the mind yet difficult as nature herself seems to have rendered the task of regularity to genius it is the supreme consolation of dullness and folly to point with gothic triumph to these excesses which are the overflowings of faculties they never enjoyed perfectly unconscious that they are indebted to their stupidity for the consistency of their conduct they plume themselves on an imaginary virtue which has its origin in what is really their disgrace  let such if such dare approach the shrine of collins withdraw to a respectful distance and should they behold the ruins of genius or the weakness of an exalted mind let them be taught to lament that nature has left the noblest of their works imperfect  of such men of genius as have borne no public character it seldom happens that any memoirs can be collected of consequence enough to be recorded by the biographer if their lives pass in obscurity they are generally too uniform to engage our attention if they cultivate and obtain popularity envy and malignity will mingle their poison with the draughts of praise and through the industry of those unwearied fiends their reputation will be so chequered and their characters so disguised that it shall become difficult for the historian to separate truth from falsehood  of our exalted poet whose life though far from being popular did not altogether pass in privacy we meet with few other accounts than such as the life of every man will afford viz when he was born where he was educated and where he died yet even these simple memoirs of the man will not be unacceptable to those who admire the poet for we never receive pleasure without a desire to be acquainted with the source from whence it springs a species of curiosity which as it seems to be instinctive was probably given us for the noble end of gratitude and finally to elevate the enquiries of the mind to that fountain of perfection from which all human excellence is derived  chichester a city in sussex had the honor of giving birth to the author of the following poems about the year      his father who was a reputable tradesman in that city intended him for the service of the church and with this view in the year      he was admitted a scholar of that illustrious seminary of genius and learning winchester college where so many distinguished men of letters so many excellent poets have received their classical education here he had the good fortune to continue seven years under the care of the very learned dr burton and at the age of nineteen in the year    0 he had merit sufficient to procure a distinguished place in the list of those scholars who are elected upon the foundation of winchester to new college in oxford but as there were then no vacancies in that society he was admitted a commoner of queens college in the same university where he continued till july      when he was elected a demi of magdalen college during his residence at queens he was at once distinguished for genius and indolence his exercises when he could be prevailed upon to write bearing the visible characteristics of both this remiss and inattentive habit might probably arise in some measure from disappointment he had no doubt indulged very high ideas of the academical mode of education and when he found science within the fetters of logic and of aristotle it was no wonder if he abated of his diligence to scek her where the search was attended with artificial perplexities and where at last the pursuer would grasp the shadow for the substance  while he was at magdalen college he applied himself chiefly to the cultivation of poetry and wrote the epistle to sir thomas hanmer and the oriental eclogues which in the year      were published under the title of persian eclogues  the success of these poems was far from being equal to their merit but to a novice in the pursuit of fame the least encouragement is sufficient if he does not at once acquire that reputation to which his merit intitles him he embraces the encomiums of the few forgives the many and intends to open their eyes to the striking beauties of his next publication  with prospects such as these probably mr collins indulged his fancy when in the year      after having taken the degree of a bachelor of arts he left the university and removed to london  to a man of small fortune a liberal spirit and uncertain dependencies the metropolis is a very dangerous place mr collins had not been long in town before he became an instance of the truth of this observation his pecuniary resources were exhausted and to restore them by the exertion of genius and learning though he wanted not the power he had neither steadiness nor industry his necessities indeed sometimes carried him as far as a scheme or a title page for a book but whether it were the power of dissipation or the genius of repose that interfered he could proceed no farther several books were projected which he was very able to execute and he became in idea an historian a critic and a dramatic poet by turns at one time he determined to write an history of the revival of letters at another to translate and comment upon aristotles poetics then he turned his thoughts to the drama and proceeded so far toward a tragedy  as to become acquainted with the manager  under this unaccountable dissipation he suffered the greatest inconveniences day succeeded day for the support of which he had made no provision and in which he was to subsist either by the longrepeated contributions of a friend or the generosity of a casual acquaintance  yet indolence triumphed at once over want and shame and neither the anxieties of poverty nor the heartburning of dependence had power to animate resolution to perseverance  as there is a degree of depravity into which if a man falls he becomes incapable of attending to any of the ordinary means that recall men to virtue so there are some circumstances of indigence so extremely degrading that they destroy the influences of shame itself and most spirits are apt to sink under their oppression into a sullen and unambitious despondence  however this might be with regard to mr collins we find that in the year      he had spirit and resolution enough to publish his odes descriptive and allegorical mr millar a bookseller in the strand and a favourer of genius when once it has made its way to same published them on the authors account  he happened indeed to be in the right not to publish them on his own for the sale was by no means successful and hence it was that the author conceiving a just indignation against a blind and tasteless age burnt the remaining copies with his own hands  allegorical and abstracted poetry was above the taste of those times as much or more than it is of the present it is in the lower walks the plain and practical paths of the muses only that the generality of men can be entertained the higher efforts of imagination are above their capacity and it is no wonder therefore if the odes descriptive and allegorical met with few admirers  under these circumstances so mortifying to every just expectation when neither his wants were relieved nor his reputation extended he found some consolation in changing the scene and visiting his uncle colonel martin who was at that time with our army in flanders soon after his arrival the colonel died and left him a considerable fortune  here then we should hope to behold him happy possessed of independence and removed from every scene and every monument of his former misery but fortune had delayed her favors till they were not worth receiving his faculties had been so long harrassed by anxiety dissipation and distress that he fell into a nervous disorder which brought with it an unconquerable depression of spirits and at length reduced the finest understanding to the most deplorable childishness in the first stages of his disorder he attempted to relieve himself by travel and passed into france but the growing malady obliged him to return and having continued with short intervals it seems to have been in one of these intervals that he was visited by an ingenious friend who tells us he found him with a book in his hand and being asked what it was he answered that he had but one book but that was the best it was the new testament in english in this pitiable state till the year      he died in the arms of a sister at chichester  mr collins was in stature somewhat above the middle size of a brown complexion keen expressive eyes and a sixed sedate aspect which from intense thinking had contracted an habitual frown his prosiciency in letters was greater than could have been expected from his years he was skilled in the learned languages and acquainted with the italian french and spanish  it is observable that none of his poems bear the marks of an amorous disposition and that he is one of those few poets who have sailed to delphi without touching at cythera the allusions of this kind that appear in his oriental eclogues were indispensable in that species of poetry and it is very remarkable that in his passions an ode for music love is omitted though it should have made a principal figure there  oriental eclogues  eclogue i selim or the shepherds moral scene a valley near bagdat time the morning ye persian maids attend your poets lays and hear how shepherds pass their golden days not all are blessed whom fortunes hand sustains with wealth in courts nor all that haunt the plains well may your hearts believe the truths i tell it is virtue makes the bliss wherever we dwell thus selim sung by sacred truth inspired nor praise but such as truth bestowed desired wise in himself his meaning songs conveyed informing morals to the shepherd maid or taught the swains that surest bliss to find what groves nor streams bestow a virtuous mind when sweet and blushing like a virgin bride the radiant morn resumed her orient pride when wanton gales along the valleys play breathe on each flower and bear their sweets away by tigris wandering waves he sat and sung this useful lesson sor the fair and young ye persian dames he said to

gentler ray delicious to your eyes for you those flowers her fragrant hand bestow and yours the love that kings delight to know yet think not these all beauteous as they are the best kind blessings heaven can grant the fair who trust alone in beautys feeble ray boast but the worth bassoras pearls display drawn from the deep we own their surface bright but dark within they drink no lustrous light such are the maids and such the charms they boast by sense unaided or to virtue lost selfflattering sex your hearts believe in vain that love shall blind when once he fires the swain or hope a lover by your faults to win as spots on ermin beautify the skin who seeks secure to rule be first her care each softer virtue that adorns the fair each tender passion man delights to find the loved perfections of a female mind blessed were the days when wisdom held her reign and shepherds sought her on the silent plain with truth she wedded in the secret grove immortal truth and daughters blessed their love o haste fair maids ye virtues come away sweet peace and plenty lead you on your way the balmy shrub for you shall love our shore by ind excelled or araby no more lost to our fields for so the fates ordain the dear deserters shall return again come thou whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear to lead the train sweet modesty appear here make thy court amidst our rural scene and shepherdgirls shall own thee for their queen with thee be chastity of all afraid distrusting all a wise suspicious maid but man the most  not more the mountain do holds the swift falcon for her deadly

meekness with her downcast eyes and friendly pity full of tender sighs and love the last by these your hearts approve these are the virtues that must lead to love thus sung the swain and ancient legends say the maids of bagdat verified the lay dear to the plains the virtues came along the shepherds loved and selim blessed his song eclogue ii hassan or the cameldriver scene the desert time midday in silent horror over the boundless waste the driver hassan with his camels past one cruise of water on his back he bore and his light scrip contained a scanty store a fan of painted feathers in his hand to guard his shaded face from scorching sand the sultry sun had gained the middle sky and not a tree and not an herb was nigh the beasts with pain their dusty way pursue shrill roared the winds and dreary was the view with desperate sorrow wild the affrighted man thrice sighed thrice struck his breast and thus began sad was the hour and luckless was the day when first from schiraz walls i bent my way ah little thought i of the blasting wind the thirst or pinching hunger that i find bethink thee hassan where shall thirst assuage when fails this cruise his unrelenting rage soon shall this scrip its precious load resign then what but tears and hunger shall be thine ye mute companions of my toils that bear in all my griefs a more than equal share here where no springs in murmurs break away or mosscrownd fountains mitigate the day in vain ye hope the green delights to know which plains more blessed or verdant vales bestow here rocks alone and tasteless sands are found and faint and sickly winds for ever howl around sad was the hour and luckless was the day when first from schiraz walls i bent my way cursed be the gold and silver which persuade weak men to follow farfatiguing trade the lilly peace outshines the silver store and life is dearer than the golden ore yet money tempts us over the desert brown to every distant mart and wealthy town full often we tempt the land and often the sea and are we only yet repaid by thee ah why was ruin so attractive made or why fond man so easily betrayed why heed we not while mad we haste along the gentle voice of peace or pleasures song or wherefore think the flowery mountains side the fountains murmurs and the valleys pride why think we these less pleasing to behold than dreary deserts if they lead to gold sad was the hour and luckless was the day when first srom schiraz walls i bent my way o cease my fears  all frantic as i go when thought creates unnumberd scenes of woe what if the lion in his rage i meet  often in the dust i view his printed feet and fearful often when days declining light yields her pale empire to the mourner night by hunger roused he scours the groaning plain gaunt wolves and sullen tigers in his train before them death with shrieks directs their way fills the wild yell and leads them to their prey sad was the hour and luckless was the day when first from schiraz walls i bent my way at that dead hour the silent asp shall creep if aught of rest i find upon my sleep or some swollen serpent twist his scales around and wake to anguish with a burning wound thrice happy they the wise contented poor from lust of wealth and dread of death secure they tempt no deserts and no griefs they find peace rules the day where reason rules the mind sad was the hour and luckless was the day when first from schiraz walls i bent my way o hapless youth for she thy love has won the tender zara will be most undone big swelled my heart and owned the powerful maid when fast she dropped her tears as thus she said farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain whom zaras breaking heart implored in vain yet as thou go may every blast arise weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs safe over the wild no perils may thou see no griefs endure nor weep false youth like me o let me safely to the fair return say with a kiss she must not shall not mourn o let me teach my heart to lose its fears recalled by wisdoms voice and zaras tears he said and called on heaven to bless the day when back to schiraz walls he bent his way eclogue iii abra or the georgian sultana scene a forest time the evening in georgias land where tefflis towers are seen in distant view along the level green while evening dews enrich the glittering glade and the tall forests cast a longer shade

tender strain who led her youth with flocks upon the plain at morn she came those willing flocks to lead where lilies rear them in the watery mead from early dawn the livelong hours she told till late

golden power and love go leave the simple pipe and shepherds strain with love delight thee and with abbas reign be every youth like royal abbas moved and every georgian maid like abra loved yet midst the blaze of courts she fixed her love on the cool fountain or the shady grove still with the shepherds innocence her mind to the sweet vale and flowery mead inclined and often as spring renewed the plains with flowers breathed his soft gales and led the fragrant hours with sure return she sought the sylvan scene the breezy mountains and the forests green her maids around her moved a duteous band each bore a crook allrural in her hand some simple lay of flocks and herds they sung with joy the mountain and the forest rung be every youth like royal abbas moved and every georgian maid like abra

for every maid was kind at that still hour when awful midnight reigns and none but wretches haunt the twilight plains what time the moon had hung her lamp on high and past in radiance through the cloudless sky sad over the dews two brother shepherds fled where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led fast as they pressed their flight behind them lay wide ravaged plains and valleys stole away along the mountains bending sides they ran till faint and weak secander thus began secander o stay thee agib for my feet deny no longer friendly to my life to fly friend of my heart o turn thee and

the swains like us in deep despair and leave to ruffian bands their fleecy care  secander unhappy land whose blessings tempt the sword in vain unheard thou callst thy persian lord in vain thou courtst him helpless to thine aid to shield the shepherd and protect the maid far off in thoughtless indolence resigned soft dreams of love and pleasure soothe his mind midst fair sultanas lost in idle joy no wars alarm him and no fears annoy  agib yet these green hills in summers sultry heat have left the monarch often a cool retreat sweet to the sight is zabrans flowery plain and once by maids and

limbs of giant mold what mortal eye can fixed behold who stalks his round an hideous form howling amidst the midnight storm or throws him on the ridgy steep of some loose hanging rock to sleep and with him thousand phantoms joined who prompt to deeds accursed the mind and those the fiends who near allied over natures wounds and wrecks preside while vengeance in the lurid air lifts her red arm

partial choice the grieffull muse addressed her infant tongue the maids and matrons on her awful voice silent and pale in wild amusement hung yet he the bard aeschylus who first invoked thy name disdained in marathon its power to feel for not alone he nursed the poets flame but reached from virtues hand the patriots steel but who is he whom later garlands grace who left awhile over hyblas dews to rove with trembling eyes thy dreary steps to trace where thou and furies shared the baleful grove wrapped in thy cloudy veil the incestuous queen jocasta  sighed the sad call her son and husband heard when once alone it broke the silent scene and he the wretch of thebes no more appeared o fear i know thee by thy throbbing heart thy withering power inspired each mournful line though

pleasures nursed the powers of song thou who with hermit heart disdainst the wealth of art and gauds and pageant weeds and trailing pall but come a decent maid in attic robe arrayed o chaste unboastful nymph to thee i call by all the honneyd store on hyblas thymy shore by all her blooms and mingled murmurs dear by her whose lovelorn woe in evening musings slow soothed sweetly sad electras

respectable species of poetry had its origin in the east and from thence was transplanted by the muses of greece but whether from the continent of the lesser asia or from egypt which about the era of the grecian pastoral was the hospitable nurse of letters it is not easy to determine from the subjects and the manner of theocritus one would incline to the latter opinion while the history of bion is in savor of the former  however though it should still remain a doubt through what channel the pastoral traveled westward there is not the least shadow of uncertainty concerning its oriental origin  in those ages which guided by sacred chronology from a comparative view of time we call the early ages it appears from the most authentic historians that the chiess of the people employed themselves in rural exercises and that astronomers and legislators were at the same time shepherds thus strabo informs us that the history of the creation was communicated to the egyptians by a chaldean shepherd  from these circumstances it is evident not only that such shepherds were capable of all the dignity and elegance peculiar to poetry but that whatever poetry they attempted would be of the pastoral kind would take its subjects from those scenes of rural simplicity in which they were conversant and as it was the offspring of harmony and nature would employ the powers it derived from the former to celebrate the beauty and benevolence of the latter  accordingly we find that the most ancient poems treat of agriculture astronomy and other objects within the rural and natural systems  what constitutes the difference between the georgic and the pastoral is love and the colloquial or dramatic form of composition peculiar to the latter this form of composition is sometimes dispensed with and love and rural imagery alone are thought sufficient to distinguish the pastoral the tender passion however seems to be essential to this species of poetry and is hardly ever excluded from those pieces that were intended to come under this denomination even in those eclogues of the amoebean kind whose only purport is a trial of skill between contending shepherds love has its usual share and the praises of their respective mistesses are the general subjects of the competitors  it is to be lamented that scarce any oriental compositions of this kind have survived the ravages of ignorance tyranny and time we cannot doubt that many such have been extant possibly as far down as that fatal period never to be mentioned in the world of letters without horror when the glorious monuments of human ingenuity perished in the ashes of the alexandrian library  those ingenious creeks whom we call the parents of pastoral poetry were probably no more than imitators of imitators that derived their harmony from higher and remoter sources and kindled their poetical fires at those unextinguished lamps which burned within the tombs of oriental genius  it is evident that homer has availed himself of those magnificent images and descriptions so frequently to be met with in the books of the old testament and why may not theocritus moschus and bion have found their archetypes in other eastern writers whose names have perished with their works yet though it may not be illiberal to admit such a supposition it would certainly be invidious to conclued what the malignity of cavillers alone could suggest with regard to homer that they destroyed the sources from which they borrowed and as it is fabled of the young of the pelican drained their supporters to death  as the septuaginttranslation of the old testament was performed at the request and under the patronage of ptolemy philadelphus it were not to be wondered if theocritus who was entertained at that princes court had borrowed some part of his pastoral imagery from the poetical passages of those books  i think it can hardly be doubted that the sicilian poet had in his eye certain expressions of the prophet isaiah when he wrote the following lines       let vexing brambles the blue violet bear on the rude thorn narcissus dress his hair  all all reversed  the pine with pears be crowned and the bold deer shall drag the trembling hound the cause indeed of these phenomena is very different in the greek from what it is in the hebrew poet the former employing them on the death the latter on the birth of an important person but the marks of imitation are nevertheless obvious  it might however be expected that if theocritus had borrowed at all from the sacred writers the celebrated pastoral epithalamium of solomon so much within his own walk of poetry would not certainly have escaped his notice his epithalamium on the marriage of helena moreover gave him an open field for imitation therefore if he has any obligations to the royal bard we may expect to find them there the very opening of the poem is in the spirit of the hebrew song  the color of imitation is still stronger in the following passage      this description of helen is infinitely above the style and figure of the sicilian pastoral  she is like the rising of the golden morning when the night departs and when the winter is over and gone she resembles the cypress in the garden the horse in the chariots of thessaly these figures plainly declare their origin and others equally imitative might be pointed out in the same idyllium  this beautiful and luxuriant marriagepastoral of solomon is the only perfect form of the oriental eclogue that has survived the ruins of time a happiness for which it is probably more indebted to its sacred character than to its intrinsic merit not that it is by any means destitute of poetical excellence like all the eastern poetry it is bold wild and unconnected in its figures allusions and parts and has all that graceful and magnificent daring which characterises its metaphorical and comparative imagery  in consequence of these peculiarities so ill adapted to the frigid genius of the north mr collins could make but little use of it as a precedent for his oriental eclogues and even in his third eclogue where the subject is of a similar nature he has chosen rather to follow the mode of the doric and the latian pastoral  the scenery and subjects then of the following eclogues alone are oriental the style and coloring are purely european and for this reason the authors preface in which he intimates that he had the originals from a merchant who traded to the east is omitted as being now altogether superfluous  with regard to the merit of these eclogues it may justly be asserted that in simplicity of description and expression in delicacy and softness of numbers and in natural and unaffected tenderness they are not to be equalled by any thing of the pastoral kind in the english language  eclogue i this eclogue which is entitled selim or the shepherds moral as there is nothing dramatic in the subject may be thought the least entertaining of the four but it is by no means the least valuable the moral precepts which the intelligent shepherd delivers to his fellowswains and virgins their companions are such as would infallibly promote the happiness of the pastoral life  in impersonating the private virtues the poet has observed great propriety and has formed their genealogy with the most perfect judgment when he represents them as the daughters of truth and wisdom  the characteristics of modesty and chastity are extremely happy and peinturesque come thou whose thoughts as limpid springs are clear to lead the train sweet modesty appear with thee be chastity of all afraid distrusting all a wise suspicious maid cold is her breast like flowers that drink the dew a silken veil conceals her from the view the two similes borrowed from rural objects are not only much in character but perfectly natural and expressive there is notwithstanding this defect in the former that it wants a peculiar propriety for purity of thought may as well be applied to chastity as to modesty and from this instance as well as from a thousand more we may see the necessity of distinguishing in characteristic poetry every object by marks and attributes peculiarly its own  it cannot be objected to this eclogue that it wants both these essential criteria of the pastoral love and the drama for though it partakes not of the latter the former still retains an interest in it and that too very material as it professedly consults the virtue and happiness of the lover while it informs what are the qualities  that must lead to love  eclogue ii all the advantages that any species of poetry can derive from the novelty of the subject and scenery this eclogue possesses the rout of a cameldriver is a scene that scarce could exist in the imagination of an european and of its attendant distresses he could have no idea  these are very happily and minutely painted by our descriptive poet what sublime simpliciry of expression what nervous plainness in the opening of the poem in silent horror over the boundless waste the driver hassan with the camels past the magic pencil of the poet brings the whole scene before us at once as it were by enchantment and in this single couplet we feel all the effect that arises from the terrible wildness of a region unenlivened by the habitations of men the verses that describe so minutely the cameldrivers little provisions have a touching influence on the imagination and prepare to enter more feelingly into his future apprehensions of distress bethink thee hassan where shall thirst assuage when fails this cruise his unrelenting rage it is difficult to say whether his apostrophe to the mute companions of his toils is more to be admired for the elegance and beauty of the poetical imagery or for the tenderness and humanity of the sentiment he who can read it without being affected will do his heart no injustice if he concludes it to be destitute of sensibility ye mute companions of my toils that bear in all my griess a more than equal share here where no springs in murmur break away or mosscrownd fountains mitigate the day in vain ye hope the green delights to know which plains more blessed or verdant vales bestow here rocks alone and tasteless sands are found and faint and sickly winds for ever howl around yet in these beautiful lines there is a flight error which writers of the greatest genius very frequently fall into  it will be needless to observe to the accurate reader that in the fifth and sixth verses there is a verbal pleonasm where the poet speaks of the green delights of verdant vales there is an oversight of the same kind in the manners an ode where the poet says  seines blue nymphs deplore in watchet weeds  this fault is indeed a common one but to a reader of taste it is nevertheless disgustful and it is mentioned here as the error of a man of genius and judgment that men of genius and judgment may guard against it  mr collins speaks like a true poet as well in sentiment as expression when with regard to the thirst of wealth he says why heed we not while mad we haste along the gentle voice of peace or pleasures song or wherefor think die flowery mountains side the fountains murmurs and the valleys pride why think we these less pleasing to behold than dreary deserts if they lead to gold but however just these sentiments may appear to thofse who have not revolted from nature and simplicity had the author proclaimed them in lombard street or cheapside he would not have been complimented with the understanding of the bellman  a striking proof that our own particular ideas of happiness regulate our opinions concerning the sense and wisdom of others  it is impossible to take leave of this most beautiful eclogue without paying the tribute of admiration so justly due to the following nervous lines what if the lion in his rage i meet  often in the dust i view his printed feet and fearful often when days declining light yields her pale empire to thc mourner night by hunger roused he scours the groaning plain gaunt wolves and fullen tigers in his train before them death with shrieks directs their way fills the wild yell and leads them to their prey this amongst many other passages to be met with in the writings of collins shows that his genius was perfectly capable of the grand and magnificent in description notwithstanding what a learned writer has advanced to the contrary nothing certainly could be more greatly conceived or more adequately expressed than the image in the last couplet  that deception sometimes used in rhetoric and poetry which presents us with an object or sentiment contrary to what we expected is here introduced to the greatest advantage farewell the youth whom sighs could not detain whom zaras breaking heart implored in vain yet as thou go may every blast arise  weak and unfelt as these rejected sighs but this perhaps is rather an artificial prettyness than a real or natural beauty  eclogue iii that innocence and native simplicity of manners which in the first eclogue was allowed to constitute the happiness of love is here beautifully described in its effects the sultan of persia marries a georgian shepherdess and finds in her embraces that genuine felicity which unperverted nature alone can bestow the most natural and beautiful parts of this eclogue are those where the fair sultana refers with so much pleasure to her pastoral amusements and those scenes of happy innocence in which she had passed her early years particularly when upon her first departure often as she went she backward turned her view and bad that crook and bleating flock adieu this picture of amiable simplicity reminds one of that passage where proserpine when carried off by pluto regrets the loss of the flowers she had been gathering  collecti flores tunicis cecidere remissis tantaque simplicitas puerilibus adfuit annis haec quoque virgineum movit jactura dolorem eclogue iv the beautiful but unfortunate country where the scene of this pathetic eclogue is laid had been recently torn in pieces by the depredations of its savage neighbors when mr collins so affectingly described its misfortunes this ingenious man had not only a pencil to pourtray but a heart to feel for the miseries of mankind and it is with the utmost tenderness and humanity he enters into the narrative of circassias ruin while he realizes the scene and brings the present drama before us of every circumstance that could possibly contribute to the tender effect this pastoral was designed to produce the poet has availed himself with the utmost art and address thus he prepares the heart to pity the distresses of circassia by representing it as the scene of the happiest love  in fair circassia where to love inclined each swain was blessed for every maid was kind to give the circumstances of the dialogue a more affecting solemnity he makes the time midnight and describes the two shepherds in the very act of flight from the destruction that swept over their country sad over the dews two brother shepherds fled where wildering fear and desperate sorrow led there is a beauty and propriety in the epithet wildering which strikes us more forcibly the more we consider it  the opening of the dialogue is equally happy natural and unaffected when one of the shepherds weary and overcome with the flight calls upon his companion to review the length of way they had passed  this is certainly painting from nature and the thoughts however obvious or destitute of refinement are perfectly in character but as the closest pursuit of nature is the surest way to excellence in general and to sublimity in particular in poetical description so we find that this simple suggestion of the shepherd is not unattended with magnificence there is grandeur and variety in the landscape he describes and first review that long extended plain and yon wide groves already past with pain yon ragged cliff whose dangerous path we tried and last this lofty mountains weary side there is in imitative harmony an act of expressing a slow and difficult movement by adding to the usual number of pauses in a verse this is observable in the line that describes the ascent of the mountain and last this losty mountains weary side here we find the number of pauses or musical bars which in an heroic verse is commonly two increased to three  the liquid melody and the numerous sweetness of expression in the following descriptive lines is almost inimitably beautiful sweet to the fight is zabrans flowery plain and once by nymphs and shepherds loved in vain no more the virgins shall delight to rove by sargis banks or irwans shaddy grove on tarkies mountain catch the cooling gale or breathe the sweets of alys flowery vale nevertheless in this delightful landscape there is an obvious sault there is no distinction between the plain of zabran and the vale of aly they are both flowery and consequently undiversisied this could not proceed from the poets want of judgment but from inattention it had not occurred to him that he had employed the epithet flowery twice within so short a compass an oversight which those who are accustomed to poetical or indeed to any other species of composition know to be very possible  nothing can be more beautifully conceived or more pathetically expressed than the shepherds apprehensions for his fair countrywomen exposed to the ravages of the invaders  in vain circassia boasts her spicy groves for ever famed for pure and happy loves in vain she boasts her fairest of the fair their eyes blue languish and their golden hair those eyes in tears their fruitless grief shall send those hairs the tartars cruel hand shall rend there is certainly some very powerful charm in the liquid melody of sounds the editor of these poems could never read or hear the following verse repeated without a degree of pleasure otherwise entirely unaccountable their eyes blue languish and their golden hair such are the oriental eclogues which we leave with the same kind of anxious pleasure we feel upon a temporary parting with a beloved friend  observations on the odes descriptive and allegorical  observations etc the genius of collins was capable of every degree of excellence in lyric poetry and perfectly qualified for that high province of the muse possessed of a native ear for all the varieties of harmony and modulation susceptible of the finest feelings of tenderness and humanity but above all carried away by that high enthusiasm which gives to imagination its strongest coloring he was at once capable of soothing the ear with the melody of his numbers of influencing the passions by the force of his pathos and of gratifying the fancy by the luxury of description  in consequence of these powers but more particularly in consideration of the last he chose such subjects for his lyric essays as were most favorable for the indulgence of description and allegory where he could exercise his powers in moral and personal painting where he could exert his invention in conferring new attributes on images or objects already known and described by a determinate number of characteristics where he might give an uncommon eclat to his figures by placing them in higher attitudes or in more advantageous lights and introduce new forms from the moral and intellectual world into the society of inpersonated beings  such no doubt were the advantages he derived from the descriptive and allegorical nature of his themes  it seems to have been the whole industry of our author and it is at the same time almost all the claim to moral excellence his writings can boast to promote the influence of the social virtues by painting them in the fairest and happiest lights melior fieri tuendo would be no improper motto to his poems in general but of his lyric poems it seems to be the whole moral tendency and effect if therefore it should appear to some readers that he has been more industrious to cultivate description than sentiment it may be observed that his descriptions themselves are sentimental and answer the whole end of that species of writing by embellishing every feature of virtue and by conveying through the effects of the pencil the finest moral lessons to the mind  horace speaks of the fidelity of the ear in preserence to the uncertainty of the eye but if the mind receives conviction it is certainly of very little importance through what medium or by which of the senses it is conveyed the impressions left on the imagination may possibly be thought less durable than the deposits of the memory but it may very well admit of a question whether a conclusion of reason or an impression of imagination will soonest make its way to the heart a moral precept conveyed in words is only an account of truth in its effects a moral picture is truth exemplified and which is most likely to gain on the affections it may not be difficult to determine  this however must be allowed that those works approach the nearest to perfection which unite these powers and advantages which at once influence the imagination and engage the memory the former by the force of animated and striking description the latter by a brief but harmonious conveyance of precept thus while the heart is influenced through the operation of the passions or the fancy the effect which might otherwise have been transient is secured by the cooperating power of the memory which treasures up in a short aphorism the moral of the scene  this is a good reason and this perhaps is the only reason that can be given why our dramatic performances should generally end with a chain of couplets in these the moral of the whole piece is usually conveyed and that assistance which the memory borrows from rhyme as it was probably the original cause of it gives its usefulness and propriety even there  after these apologies for the descriptive turn of the following odes something remains to be said on the origin and use of allegory in poetical composition  by this we are not to understand the trope in the schools which is defined aliud verbis aliud sensu ostendere and of which quintilian says usus est ut tristia dicamus melioribus verbis out bonae rei gratia quaedam contrariis significemus etc it is not the verbal but the sentimental allegory not allegorical expression which indeed might come under the term of metaphor but allegorical imagery that is here in question  when we endeavor to trace this species of figurative sentiment to its origin we find it coeval with literature itself it is generally agreed that the most ancient productions are poetical and it is certain that the most ancient poems abound with allegorical imagery  if then it be allowed that the first literary productions were poetical we shall have little or no difficulty in discovering the origin of allegory  at the birth of letters in the transition from hieroglyphical to literal expression it is not to be wondered if the custom of expressing ideas by personal images which had so long prevailed should still retain its influence on the mind though the use of letters had rendered the practical application of it superfluous those who had been accustomed to exprefs strength by the image of an elephant swiftness by that of a panther and courage by that of a lion would make no scruple of substituting in letters the symbols for the ideas they had been used to represent  here we plainly see the origin of allegorical expression that it arose from the ashes of hieroglyphics and if to the same cause we should refer that figurative boldness of style and imagery which distinguish the oriental writings we shall perhaps conclude more justly than if we should impute it to the superior grandeur of the eastern genius  from the same source with the verbal we are to derive the sentimental allegory which is nothing more than a continuation of the metaphorical or symbolical expression of the several agents in an action or the different objects in a scene  the latter most peculiarly comes under the denomination of allegorical imagery and in this species of allegory we include the impersonation of passions affections virtues and vices etc on account of which principally the following odes were properly termed by their author allegorical  with respect to the utility of this figurative writing the same arguments that have been advanced in favor of descriptive poetry will be of weight likewise here it is indeed from impersonation or as it is commonly termed personification that poetical description borrows its chief powers and graces without the aid of this moral and intellectual painting would be flat and unanimated and even the scenery of material objects would be dull without the introduction of fictitious life  these observations will be most effectually illustrated by the sublime and beautiful odes that occasioned them in those it will appear how happily this allegorical painting may be executed by the genuine powers of poetical genius and they will not fail to prove its force and utility by passing through the imagination to the heart  ode to pity by pellas bard a magic name by all the griefs his thought could frame receive my humble rite long pity let the nations view thy skyworn robes of tenderest blue and eyes of dewy light the propriety of invoking pity through the mediation of euripides is obvious  that admirable poet had the keys of all the tender passions and therefore could not but stand in the highest esleem with a writer of mr collins sensibility  he didindeed admire him as much as milton professedly did and probably for the same reasons but we do not find that he has copied him so closely as the last mentioned poet has sometimes done and particularly in the opening of samsonagonistes which is an evident imitation of the following passage in the        the eyes of dewy light is one of the happiest strokes of imagination and may be ranked among those expressions which  give us back the image of the mind wild arun too has heard thy strains and echo midst thy native plains been soothed with pitys lute there first the wren thy myrtles shed on gentlest otways infant head  suffex in which country the arun is a small river had the honor of giving birth to otway as well as to collins both these poets became the objects of that pity by which their writings are distinguished there was a similitude in their genius and in their sufferings there was a resemblance in the misfortunes and in the dissipation of their lives and the circumstances of their death cannot be remembered without pain  the thought of painting in the temple of pity the history of human misfortunes and of drawing the scenes from the tragic muse is very happy and in every respect worthy the imagination of collins  ode to fear mr c  who had often determined to apply himself to dramatic poetry seems here with the same view to have addressed one of the principal powers of the drama and to implore that mighty influence she had given to the genius of shakespeare hither again thy fury deal teach me but once like him to feel his cypress wreath my meed decree and i o fear will dwell with thee in the construction of this nervous ode the author has shown equal power of judgment and imagination nothing can be more striking than the violent and abrupt abbreviation of the measure in the fifth and sixth verses when he feels the strong influences of the power he invokes ah fear ah frantic fear i see i see thee near the editor of these poems has met with nothing in the same species of poetry either in his own or in any other language equal in all respects to the following description of danger danger whose limbs of giantmold what mortal eye can fixed behold who stalks his round and hideous sorm howling amidst the midnight storm or throws him on the ridgy steep of some loose hanging rock to sleep it is impossible to contemplate the image conveyed in the two last verses without these emotions of terror it was intended to excite it has moreover the entire advantage of novelty to recommend it sor there is too much originality in all the circumstances to suppose that the author had in his eye that description of the penal situation of cataline in the ninth aeneid  te catalina minaci pendentem scopulo  the archetype of the english poets idea was in nature and probably to her alone he was indebted for the thought from her likewise he derived that magnificence of conception that horrible grandeur of imagery displayed in the following lines and those the fiends who near allied over natures wounds and wrecks preside while vengeance in the lurid air lifts her red arm exposed and bare on whom the ravening brood of fate who lap the blood of sorrow wait that nutritive enthusiasm which cherishes the seeds of poetry and which is indeed the only soil wherein they will grow to perfection lays open the mind to ail the influences of fiction a passion for whatever is greatly wild or magnificent in the works of nature seduces the imagination to attend to all that is extravagant however unnatural milton was notoriously fond of high romance and gothic diableries and collins who in genius and enthusiasm bore no very distant resemblance to milton was wholly carried away by the same attachments be mine to read the visions old which thy awakening bards have told and lest thou meet my blasted view hold each strange tale devoutly true on that thrice hallowed eve etc there is an old traditionary superstition that on st marks eve the forms of all such persons as shall die within the ensuing year make their solemn entry into the churches of their respective parishes as st patrick swam over the channel without their heads  ode to simplicity the measure of the ancient ballad seems to have been made choice of for this ode on account of the subject and it has indeed an air of simplicity not altogether unaffecting  by all the honeyd store on hyblas thymy shore by all her blooms and mingled murmurs dear by her whose lovelorn woe in evening musings slow soothed sweetly sad electras poets ear this allegorical imagery of the honeyd store the blooms and mingled murmurs of hybla alluding to the sweetness and beauty of the attic poetry has the finest and the happiest effect yet possibly it will bear a question whether the ancient greek tragedians had a general claim to simplicity in any thing more than the plans of their drama their language at least was infinitely metaphorical yet it must be owned that they justly copied nature and the passions and so far certainly they were entitled to the palm of true simplicity the following most beautiful speech of polynices will be a monument of this so long as poetry shall last           eurip but staid to sing alone to one distinguished throne the poet cuts off the prevalence of simplicity among the romans with the reign of augustus and indeed it did not continue much longer most of the compositions after that date giving into false and artificial ornament  no more in hall or bower the passions own thy power love only love her forceless numbers mean in these lines the writings of the provencial poets are principally alluded to in which simplicity is generally sacrificed to the rapsodies of romantic love  ode on the poetical character procul o procul este profani this ode is so infinitely abstracted and replete with high enthusiasm that it will find few readers capable of entering into the spirit of it or of relishing its beauties there is a style of sentiment as utterly unintelligible to common capacities as if the subject were treated in an unknown language and it is on the same account that abstratcted poetry will never have many admirers the authors of such poems must be content with the approbation of those heavenfavoured geniuses who by a similiarity of taste and sentiment are enabled to penetrate the high mysterics of inspired fancy and to pursue the loftiest flights of enthusiastic imagination nevertheless the praise of the distinguished few is certainly preferable to the applause of the undiscerning million for all praise is valuable in proportion to the judgment of those who conser it  as the subject of this ode is uncommon so are the style and expression highly metaphorical and abstracted thus the sun is called the richhaird youth of morn the ideas are termed the shadowy tribes of mind etc we are struck with the propriety of this mode of expression here and it assords us new proofs of the analogy that subsists between language and sentiment  nothing can be more lostily imagined than the creation of the cestus of fancy in this ode the allegorical imagery is rich and sublime and the observation that the dangerous passions kept aloof during the operation is founded on the strictest philosophical truth for poetical fancy can exist only in minds that are perfectly serene and in some measure abstracted from the influences of sense  the scene of miltons inspiring hour is perfectly in character and described with all those wildwood appearances of which the great poet was so enthusiastically fond i view that oak the fancied glades among by which as milton lay his evening ear nigh spherd in heaven its native strains could hear   ode written in the year mdccxlvi ode to mercy the ode written in      and the ode to mercy seem to have been written on the same occasion viz the late rebellion the sormer in memory of those heroes who fell in defense of their country the latter to excite sentiments of compassion in savor of those unhappy and deluded wretches who became a sacrifice to public justice  the language and imagery of both are very beautiful but the seen and figures described in the strophe of the ode to mercy are exquisitely striking and would afford a painter one of the finest subjects in the world  ode to liberty the ancient states of greece perhaps the only ones in which a perfect model of liberty ever existed are naturaily brought to view in the opening of the poem  who shall awake the spartan sise and call in solemn sounds to life the youths whose locks divinely spreading like vernal hyacinths in sullen hue etc there is something extremely bold in this imagery of the locks of the spartan youths and greatly superior to that deseription jocasta gives us of the hair of polynices    what new alcaeus facyblest shall sing the sword in myrtles dressed etc this alludes to a fragment of alcaeus still remaining in which the poet celebrates harmodius and aristogiton who slew the tyrant hipparchus and thereby restored the liberty of athens  the fall of rome is here most nervously described in one line with heaviest sound a giantstatue fell the thought seems altogether new and the imitative harmony in the structure of the verse is admirable  after bewailing the ruin of ancient liberty the poet considers the influence it has retained or still retains among the moderns and here the republics of italy naturally engage his attention  florence indeed only to be lamented on the account of losing its liberty under those patrons of letters the medicean family the jealous pisa justly so called in respect to its long impatience and regret under the same yoke

this perhaps is owing to the repetition of the strain in the same stanza for sorrow rejects variety and affects an uniformity of complaint it is needless to observe that this ode is replete with harmony spirit pathos and there surely appears no reason why the seventh and eighth stanzas should be omitted in that copy printed in dodsleys collection of poems  ode to evening the blank ode has for some time solicited admission into the english poetry but its efforts hitherto seem to have been vain at least its reception has been no more than partial it remains a question then whether there is not something in the nature of blank verse less adapted to the lyric than to the heroic measure since though it has been generally received in the latter it is yet unadopted in the former in order to discover this we are to consider the different modes of these different species of poetry that of the heroic is uniform that of the lyric is various and in these circumstances of uniformity and variety probably lies the cause why blank verse has been successful in the one and unacceptable in the other while it presented itself only in one form it was familiarized to the ear by custom but where it was obliged to assume the different shapes of the lyric muse it seemed still a stranger of uncouth figure was received rather with curiosity than with pleasure and entertained without that ease or satisfaction which acquaintance and familiarity produce  moreover the heroic blank verse obtained a sanction of infinite importance to its general reception when it was adopted by one of the greatest poets the world ever produced and was made the vehicle of the noblest poem that ever was written when this poem at length extorted that applause which ignorance and prejudice had united to withhold the versification soon found its imitators and became more generally successful than even in those countries from whence it was imported but lyric blank verse has met with no such advantages for mr collins whose genius and judgment in harmony might have given it so powerful an effect has left us but one specimen of it in the ode to evening  in the choice of his measure he seems to have had in his eye horaces ode to pyrrha for this ode bears the nearest resemblance to that mixed kind of the asclepiad and pherecratic verse and that resemblance in some degree reconciles us to the want of rhyme while it reminds us of those great masters of antiquity whose works had no need of this whimsical jingle of sounds  from the following passage one might be induced to think that the poet had it in view to render his subject and his versification suitable to each other on this occasion and that when he addressed himself to the sober power of evening he had thought proper to lay aside the soppery of rhyme now teach me maid composed to breathe some sostend strain whose numbers stealing through thy darkning vale may not unseemly with its stillness suit as musing slow i hail thy genial loved return but whatever were the numbers or the versification of this ode the imagery and enthusiasm it contains could not fail of rendering it delightful no other of mr collinss odes is more generally characteristic of his genius in one place we discover his passion for visionary beings for when thy solding star arising shows his paly circlet at his warning lamp the fragrant hours and elves who slept in buds the day and many a nymph who wreaths her brows with fedge and sheds the freshening dew and lovelier still the pensive pleasures sweet prepare thy shadowy car in another we behold his strong bias to melancholy then let me rove some wild and heathy scene or find some ruin midst its dreary dells whose walls more awful nod by thy religious gleams then appears his taste for what is wildly grand and magnificent in nature when prevented by storms from enjoying his evening walk he wishes for a situation that from the mountains side views wilds and swelling floods and through the whole his invariable attachment to the expression of painting  and marks over all thy dewy fingers draw the gradual dusky veil it might be a sufficient encomium on this beautiful ode to observe that it has been particularly admired by a lady to whom nature has given the most perfect principles of taste she has not even complained of the want of rhyme in it a circumstance by no means unfavourable to the cause of lyric blank verse sor surely if a fair reader can endure an ode without bells and chimes the masculine genius may dispense with them  the manners an ode from the subject and sentiments of this ode it seems not improbable that the author wrote it about the time when he left the university when weary with the pursuit of academical studies he no longer confined himself to the search of theoretical knowledge but commenced the scholar of humanity to study nature in her works and man in society  the following farewell to science exhibits a very just as well as striking picture for however exalted in the theory the platonic doctrines may appear it is certain that platonism and pyrrhonism are nearly allied farewell the porch whose roof is seen arched with the enlivening olives green where science prankd in tissued vest by reason pride and fancy dressed comes like a bride so trim arrayed to wed with doubt in platos shade when the mind goes in pursuit of visionary systems it is not far from the regions of doubt and the greater its capacity to think abstractedly to reason and refine the more it will be exposed to and bewildered in uncertainty  from an enthusiastic warmth of temper indeed we may for a while be encouraged to persist in some adopted system but when that enhusiasm which is founded on the vivacity of the passions gradually cools and dies away with them the opinions it supported drop from us and we are thrown upon the inhospitable shore of doubt  a striking proof of the necessity of some moral rule of wisdom and virtue and some system of happiness established by unerring knowledge and unlimited power  in the poets address to humor in this ode there is one image of singular beauty and propriety the ornaments in the hair of wit are of such a nature and disposed in such a manner as to be perfectly symbolical and characteristic me too amidst thy band admit there where the youngeyd healthful wit whose jewels in his crisped hair are placed each others beams to share whom no delights from thee divide in laughter loosed attends thy side nothing could be more expressive of wit which consists in a happy collision of comparative and relative images than this reciprocal reflection of light from the disposition of the jewels o humor thou whose name is known to britons favored isle alone the author could only mean to apply this to the time when he wrote since other nations had produced works of great humor as he himself acknowleges afterward by old miletus etc by all you taught the tuscan maids etc the milesian and tuscan romances were by no means distinguished for humor but as they were the models of that species of writing in which humor was afterward employed they are probably for that reason only mentioned here  the passions an ode for music if the music which was composed for this ode had equal merit with the ode itself it must have been the most excellent performance of the kind in which poetry and music have in modern times united other pieces of the same nature have derived their greatest reputation from the perfection of the music that accompanied them having in themselves little more merit than that of an ordinary ballad but in this we have the whole soul and power of poetry  expression that even without the aid of music strikes to the heart and imagery of power enough to transport the attention without the forceful alliance of corresponding sounds what then must have been the effect of these united  it is very observable that though the measure is the same in which the musical efforts of fear anger and despair are described yet by the variation of the cadence the character and operation of each is strongly expressed thus particularly of despair with woeful measures wan despair  low sullen sounds his grief beguiled a solemn strange and mingled air twas sad by fits by starts twas wild he must be a very unskilful composer who could not catch the power of imitative harmony from these lines  the picture of hope that follows this is beautiful almost beyond imitation by the united powers of imagery and harmony that delightful being is exhibited with all the charms and graces that pleasure and fancy have appropriated to her relegat qui semel percurrit qui nunquam legit legate but thou o hope with eyes so fair what was thy delighted measure still it

descriptions of joy jealousy and revenge are excellent though not equally so those of melancholy and cheerfulness are superior to every thing of the kind and upon the whole there may be very little hazard in asserting that this is the finest ode in the english language  an epistle addressed to sir thomas hanmer on his edition of shakespeares works this poem was written by our author at the university about the time when sir thomas hanmers pompous edition of shakespeare was printed at oxford if it has not so much merit as the rest of his poems it has still more than the subject deserves the versification is easy and genteel and the allusions always poetical the character of the poet fletcher in particular is very justly drawn in this epistle  dirge in cymbeline ode on the death of mr thomson mr collins had skill to complain of that mournful melody and those tender images which are the distinguishing excellencies of such pieces as bewail departed friendship or beanty he was an almost unequalled master he knew perfectly to exhibit such circumstances peculiar to the objects as awaken the influences of pity and while from his own great sensibility he felt what he wrote he naturally addressed himself to the feelings of others  to read such lines as the following all beautiful and tender as they are without corresponding emotions of pity is surely impossible the tender thought on thee shall dwell each lonely scene shall thee restore for thee the tear be duly shed beloved till life can charm no more and mourned till pitys self be dead the ode on the death of thomson seems to have been written in an excursion to richmond by water the rural scenery has a proper effect in an ode to the memory of a poet much of whose merit lay in descriptions of the same kind and the appellations of druid and meek natures child are happily characteristic for the better understanding of this ode it is necessary to remember that mr thomson lies buried in the church of richmond  the
