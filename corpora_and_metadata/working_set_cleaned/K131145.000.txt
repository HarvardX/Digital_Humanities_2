naturalists and physicians that ubi physicus definit ibi medicus incipit may be applied in another sense to this present treatise it being designed there to begin where venereal cures generally end i shall not here trouble my readers with any account at all of the venereal or secret disease but refer them to the three and twentieth edition of the practical scheme of that distemper and broken constitutions to be had gratis where this book is given away wherein is given an account of a certain specific remedy for that disease which of late years has cured with great privacy certainty and expedition great numbers of persons to their entire satisfaction from the slightest infection to very bad cases indeed without fluxing astringents and other such pernicious and dangerous methods of cure for which reason to say any thing on that matter would be only crambe repetita and by consequence rather tiresome than acceptable to em my present design therefore is to continue here and not to repeat that subject by presenting my readers with a small discourse which shall commence and take its beginning where treatises on the secret disease and veneral cures usually end  so that this book is not designed for persons who have any degree or stage of the secret disease actually upon them till after they are esteemed cured and have taken leave of their physician and then it is that i address this present work to them in which to proceed in order and method i must take notice to my reader that  a gleet to apply here the language of dr keil in another sense in the preface to his treatise of anim secretion being a disorder of one particular part of the animal economy whatever adds any new light to the knowledge of this must necessarily clear the discovery of the cause seat and nature of that and by consequence establish its cure upon a surer foundation than hitherto has been done by enabling us to make a truer and more certain judgment of the disorder since therefore the animal body is now known to be a pure machine and many of its motions and actions are demonstrated to be the necessary consequences of its structure it as necessarily follows that the symptoms of diseases in general and of gleets in particular are likewise the necessary consequences of the alteration of the structures of certain particular parts of this economy insomuch that a gleet as hereafter will clearly be showed as necessarily follows from a change of this economy and structure of the part which is its proper seat as perfect health without any disorder of a gleet at all is the consequence of the perfect economy of the part before any such change happened  if a pendulum of such a length makes a clock to go exactly true does not the alteration of this pendulum as necessarily cause it to go too fast or too slow and when all the movement is known to be in good order does not the quick or slow motion of the clock as necessarily show the fault of the pendulum it is the same thing in that part of the animal body which is the seat of a gleet for the same reasonings hold good caeteris paribus in all sorts of machines whose motions are the necessary consequences of their structures now suppose a person to be entirely ignorant of the structure of a clock or watch it is impossible he should ever be able to put it in right order though he had never so exact a history of its irregular motions  it is on this account that the ancients not acquainted with our modern anatomical discoveries were wholly ignorant of the true seat of the infirmity we here treat of the know of which is the only thing capable of informing our judgment as to the cause and cure of it this so puzzled them in explicating it is nature and origin that some placed it in one thing and some in another but none of them in the right for which reason it was that the generality of them missing of its cure it began to be reputed an infirmity and weakness truly not much less the opprobrium medicorum then the gout and on this account it is that a gleet especially if of any date having eluded the skill of very able physicians has been by the greatest part of them pronounced incurable which reproach is not at all to be wondered at since the seat and nature of it was so little understood and therefore might still have remained so had it not been for those most excellent discoveries of late made by that great and ingenious anatomist mr cowper whose nice observations of the inward frame and structure of that particular part where a gleet is situated has given more light and information in this our present question than all the writings of the ancients put together the best of which upon this subject were only the effect of a happy guess and nothing at all of certainty or demonstration ever did before if therefore the anatomical world in these latter years had not been indefatigable in the pursuit of farther discoveries we might have set down to this day by the glimmering lights of the old anatomists and satisfy our selves with their chance guesses as well in this as many other matters so that to this ignorance of the true seat of the disorder has seen all along owing the frequent want of success in its cure for how can any person be supposed to form a true method of cure for any ailment or infirmity the seat and by consequence the nature and cause of which he is not first rightly apprised of  as to the motive of publishing this present treatise which i shall endeavor to perform with as much circumspection and wariness as the nicety of the subject will possibly admit of and therefore throughout the whole i shall take care not to sully the chastest imagination or give any the least offense to the most modest of mankind it is twofold   st the great uneasiness notwithstanding a daily change of linen which a great many gentlemen and others oftentimes for many years labor under by reason of this infirmity continually upon them which though for the present may give no other trouble than as it is opposite to cleanliness being no pleasant companion at all to a clean neat person yet will in time impair and break the very best of constitutions and bring on a consumption as hereafter will clearly be showed   ly the great inconvenience persons afflicted with gleets and other such weaknesses frequently labor under from the great quantities of physic exhibited to them for their cure which even it self is a disease and oftentimes serves for little else than breaking a sound constitution or making a bad one worse  in order therefore to explicate more clearly the true cause and nature of gleets and other such weaknesses and thereby be led into the truest and most rational method of their cure it will first of all be absolutely necessary to examine a little the anatomy of that particular part where this weakness is situated as  st its inward structure and make  ly what alterations this its structure is subject to and capable of  ly what effects such alterations are likely to produce and lastly whether or no these effects are such as gentlemen and others find in themselves who have the unhappiness of a gleet and other such weaknesses upon them  chap i some few anatomical observations necessary to be taken notice of in order to a right knowledge of the true cause seat and nature of gleets and other such weaknesses by a gleet is understood an involuntary and almost constant efflux or dripping away of matter from a human body and that in much the same quantity whether the person be asleep or awake from which definition it naturally offers it self to our consideration to enquire into the cause of this efflux of matter and how it happens that such a quantity of matter should thus involuntarily come away which difficulty will easily be removed by examining the inward anatomical structure of the part where this weakness is situated which is the only thing that can give light to our present question and then to examine if there is naturally any liquor separated in that part capable of becoming the matter of that epidemical weakness and common companion of mankind usually called a gleet  it is observable by anatomy that in the nervospongious substance of the urethra or urinary passage there are several glandulous openings first discovered by that great anatomist mr cowper which serve as so many excretory ducts or channels designed by naure constantly to convey and furnish a certain viscid clammy mucous kind of liquor or moisture into the urinary passage the use of which liquor is to lubricate and besmear by its viscidity the pipe or passage and thereby to preserve and defend it from being fretted and corroded by the sharp salts of the urine which is daily passing through it and which without this defensative liquor would certainly be fretted and become raw and by consequence sore as any fleshy part would be that should have such a salt sharp acrimonious fretting liquor as urine so often passing on it unless it were preserved by some such proper defensative as the continual anointing or besmearing it with some such smooth soft balsamic unctious substance would be insomuch that were it not for this unctious liquor or moisture that nature is continually supplying the urinary passage with by means of those glandulous openings abovementioned to keep it thus moist it would in a little time become so fretted and raw by the sharpness of the urine daily passing through it that all mankind would have a perpetual scalding and heat of urine by which i do not mean that the urine in it self would be hotter in that supposition than it is now but that the passage being raw and sore for want of that defensative slimy moisture which now protects it it would be fretted by the saltness of the urine and so would smart and seem as it were to burn and scald whenever the urine passed through it just as any other raw sore place divested of its scarfskin would smart and seem as it were to burn if one should throw urine or salt water upon it  this being thus established from the nice anatomical inspection of the urethra we are now to consider what changes and alterations these glandulous openings in the passage are subject to and capable of and then whether or no such changes can furnish us with such a large supply of matter as daily is experienced involuntarily to drip away from persons who have that weakness commonly called a gleet upon them so that a thorough enquiry into this matter will lead us directly into an exact knowledge of the true seat cause and nature of gleets without being put upon any necessity of having recourse to any other part that in reality has no manner of claim to fall under our present consideration as for example the prostatae or seminal vessels which though vulgarly esteemed to furnish the matter of a gleet yet have no share at all in it and for this reason it is that the vulgar commonly though very ignorantly and improperly call a gleet a gonorrhaea which are widely different as hereafter will appear the true and only seat of a gleet being the urethra or urinary passage as by and by will clearly be made appear  our next endeavor therefore must be to examine how the urethra only and the glandulous openings abovementioned which it contains are able to furnish so great a quantity of matter as is observed to be involuntarily discharged in the course of a gleet in order to which we must consider that nature designing these glands in the urethra constantly to furnish and supply a certain moisture to the whole pipe or passage which may defend it from being fretted by the sharp urine so frequently passing through it as has been already showed the orifices or mouths of these glands in entire healthy sound hail persons are in some measure if i may use the comparison servata always debita proportione like the sphincter muscles of the anus bladder etc i mean by this that the openings of these glands notwithstanding their being so very small have a certain springiness and elasticity proportionable to their bigness and size belong ing to them by which they are endowed with a certain power of straitning contracting and drawing themselves togather more or less upon every emission of that moisture nature designs them to supply the urethra with just as the sphincter muscle of the bladder is endowed with a power of retaining holding and keeping in the urine and by this means it is that just so much and no more of this moisture is thrown out of these glands into the urethra than is just necessary for the lubrication and moistening of it preparatively for the passage of the urine nor is this at at all to be questioned viz that the orifices and mouths of these small minute glands in the passage have every one of them a proper power of opening and contracting themselves proportionable to their bigness and size not unlike as i just now said to the sphincter muscles in other parts of the body since we see that even a small mite taken for example out of corrupted cheese and which is scarce discernable by the naked eye yet by the help of a good microscope it appears to be an animal as completely furnished with all necessary parts as other animals whose size makes them the conspicuous objects of our unassisted sight so that as by reason of the strength and vigor of the sphincter muscles for example of the bladder the neck and mouth of it is endowed with a power of straitening contracting and closing it self together after every emission of urine every one experiences in themselves a power of either holding or letting go their water so much in the same manner by reason of the strength and vigor of the orifices of these glandules they are endowed with not an unlike power of straitening contracting and drawing themselves together which i desire my reader always to suppose to be in a degree proportionable still to their bigness after every emission of the mucous slimy liquor they contain which strength being once lost the power also of retaining and keeping in this liquor is also lost with it the state then and condition of these glandulous openings or as dr drake calls them mucous glands from their thus furnishing and supplying the passage with this mucous liqor being thus considered in healthy persons our next enquiry must be into the state of these mucous glands in persons afflicted with a gleet which state we shall soon be apprised of by considering that when a person has been under cure for the secret disease the fatigue of antivenereal medicines especially if ill administered by a frequent pressure upon and irritation of these glands has rendered them flaccid limber weak and loose which before were healthy vigorous springy and strong the truth of these assertions abstracting from the reasonableness they carry along with them will appear by giving my reader an account of the state of these glands as they have been observed in some anatomical dissections made of that particular part where all gleets are seated i mean the urethra or urinary passage  that great anatomist mr cowper tells us that to inform himself the better in this point he dissected the urinary passage of several criminals who had been executed some of which were healthy found persons the others were executed with gleets upon them in the healthy sound persons he found these glandulous openings to be so firm as to have had a perfect elasticity or springiness insomuch that upon pressing them he says they discharged a certain quantity of a transparent viscous liquor such as it shows it self and ought to be in statu sano whereas if these glands had not had such a firmness and strength in which consisted their power of retaining or letting go the viscid clammy liquor they contain this liquor would have slipped out of them without any pressure at all and by consequence its not owzing out but upon such a pressure was an evident mark of their springyness and strength he also observed the whole urethra to be besmeared and lined with a liquor of a viscous clammy contexture which he supposed to have been discharged from these glandulae mucosae in order to lubricate the passage  but in the urethra of criminals executed with a gleet actually upon them and which they had had many years the case was quite different he observed the mucous glands to be limber flaccid and loose very much stretched and dilated and their orifices by the help of a nice microscope to be visibly open and thereby totally destitute of their strength and vigor from whence he judiciously concluded that they were also entirely deprived of their retentive faculty and springyness having no power left of contracting themselves upon any emission of that mucous clammy liquor they contain as those other glands could do in the criminals that were executed in perfect health after this he examined in the executed criminals that were thus dissected the state of the prostatae the vesiculae seminales and the parastatae all which he found to be as perfectly sound and entire as in any healthy person he ever dissected in his life which is a convincing proof that neither the prostatae vesiculae seminales nor the parastatae have any the least share at all in the seat or cause of a gleet this will appear still more clear by an example from persons who have a diabetes upon them for from the loss of the springiness and tone of the sphincter muscle of the bladder the neck and mouth of it is so weakened and relaxed as to be deprived of its retentive faculty through a want of that power of contracting and drawing it self together after any emission of urine which healthy persons experience in themselves from whence it follows that the urine comes away involuntarily from them being altogether deprived of both that expulsive as well as retentive power which healthy persons have  these observations being thus premised and which are fully sufficient to convince any one whose eyes are not shut against demonstration that what the ancients generally thought as to the cure of gleets was built upon a very wrong foundation viz an erroneous notion of its cause and seat we must now enquire how it happens that this change of state of these mucous glands viz from an elastick springy and strong state to a limber loose and flaccid one can produce and be the cause of that quantity of matter which continually drips and comes away in the course a gleet or in other terms but the meaning is still the same whether or no the productive cause of a gleet i e the relaxation of the orifices of the mucous glands in the urethra can so far increase the quantity of liquor naturally produced by these glands as to be such as is daily experienced by gentlemen and others who have this infirmity upon them  chap ii how the weakness and flaccid state abovementioned of the mucous glands and their orifices or mouths in the urethra are the true cause of glects the springiness and retentive faculty of the mucous glands in the urethra of healthy sound persons who are supposed never to have had the secret disease upon them consisting in their strength and power of either disating or contracting their orifices or ostiola as in the foregoing chapter has been showed by which power of retaining or letting out the viscous liquor they contain they discharge just so much and no more of it than is just necessary for the lubrication and besmearing of the passage it must of necessity follow that when these glands are by the long use of medicines or other means as a long continuance of the disease etc so weakened as to become limber flaccid flabby and loose they must also be deprived of this retentive power or faculty insomuch that although these glands in healthy sound persons who never had the misfortune of the secret disease are naturally so springy and strong as to discharge and let out into the urethra just so much and no more of the slimy liquor designed by nature to besmear and as it were cover over the whole tube or passage and there by defend it from the sharpness of the urine yet in most persons who have been ever cured of the secret disease the case is generally speaking not so for the orifices or ostiola of these glands in these cured persons are so weakened and relaxed by the fatigue of the disease and its cure as to be in a manner always open by which means the mucous liquor they contain is continually slipping out of them into the urethra the openings of these glands not having springiness elasticity nor strength left to contract themselves and thereby to keep it in as formerly by which means the contained liquor involuntarily and continually comes out into the urethra and by successive quantities of it pushing one after another drips and owzes away involuntarily from the body  the difficulty then that now remains is to conceive how such very small glands and their orifices can furnish such a quantity of matter as is daily experienced to flow away in some gleets and how the mucous liquor which is naturally discharged out of these glands into the urethra in healthy persons should be increased to such a degree as it is in persons who have a gleet this difficulty will easily be removed to any person who will but allow that the mucous glands in the urethra although so very small in themselves as to be invisible to the naked eye unless assisted by the help of a microscope yet they may naturally secerne such a quantity of fluid in any determinate time as is fully sufficient to become the matter of that common accident now adays a gleet  to illustrate this matter i hope it will be allowed that these mucous glands as little as they are may naturally discharge into the urethra for its lubrication as much of this liquor in one minute as may weigh at least one quarter of a grain this in an hour will be    grains or a quarter of a dram in    hours or a natural day it will amount to   drams which is   quarters of an ounce a quantity sufficient in all reason to give that uneasiness to the person as well as wetness to the linen which is usually experienced by those under the uncomfortable circumstances of a gleet and which is more than either the vesiculae seminales or the prostatae can continue to furnish in any considerable space of time without infinite more detriment to the body than persons afflicted with gleets usually experience hence it is evident that the glands the urethra are full as capable of being the springs that supply the liquor that drips away in a gleet as the prostatae or any other pretended part situated at a distance  if you ask how these glands in the urethra can discharge so great a quantity of fluid in the time of a gleet above what they do in their natural state i answer that it is manifest from the animal economy that if any gland or excretory duct be weakened and deprived of its retentive faculty the quantity of liquor that it discharges by reason of that weakness is considerably augmented in proportion to the greater or less degrce of weakness with which these glands or ducts are affected just as a little powder of cantharides applied any where by breaking through the texture of the cuticular scarfskin does so weaken the glands as soon to excite a blister and by it thus weakening the glands makes them discharge a quantity of matter immensly greater than what would naturally flow away from that part by insensible perspiration only much in the same manner the orifices of these glands being weakened and relaxed have thereby lost their retentive faculty and therefore cannot hold in the liquor they contain but lets more of it slip away than the mere lubrication of the urethra requires and therefore it continually is discharging it self by that dripping which is commonly called a gleet  hence all the difficulties about a gleet are overcome in a few words its symptoms become obvious upon a small principle so clear in anatomy as to carry not only evidence along with it but also more clearly explicates all the symptoms and effects of it than hitherto is observed to have been done  but besides a gleet from the abovementioned causes it frequently happens that some persons after even a safe and sure cure of the secret disease especially where the infection has been confiderable have for a long time after been vexed with the appearance of a little owzing of a slimy transparent substance not so much as the quantity of a drop at a time which upon their linen looks sometimes of no ill color though also sometimes it will give it a yellowish tinge no bigger perhaps than a great pins head which frequently alarms em they thinking some infection lies still lurking when the cause in reality has been overweakness and overheating of the parts etc and which upon endeavoring to carry off by purging has rather increased by relaxing the vessels and weakening their springiness and and tone persons with such gleets as these have generally little threads and skins or such like swimming in variety of figures about their urine and the orifice of the urinary passage is frequently gummd up therewith these gleets usual attend hot sanguine constitutions and in time brings on pains and weakness in the loins and has at last terminated in incureable consumptions whereas if some strengthening medicines peculiarly adapted to those parts had but at first been judiciously applied not only the disorder it self might have been timely cured but also these ill consequences happily prevented by which medicines i understand such as are appropriated to restore the injured parts to a state of soundness as well as to preserve them so thus if the tone of the parts be but reestablished by proper restorative medicines their acquired strength will enable them to resist the ingress of new supplies of peccant matter and turn them off to be discharged another way thus the cure is attained without violence pain or inconvenience to the patient and in this sense it is generally speaking to be understood that sometimes a gleet will remain after the best of cures  chap iii of self abuses in particular and how they are the causes of gleets simple gonorrhaeas and other dreadful effects the missortune i here mean is that which the holy scriptures mention genesis c    v  0 of onan whose name only will put my reader at once in mind not only of the sin but also of the terrible punishment which almighty god instantly and out of hand inflicted upon him expressed in these words and therefore the lord cut him off because he had done a detestable thing ideo percussit eum dominus quod rem detestabilem faceret says the vulgate edition and yet notwithstanding so very severe an expression of the scripture this unhappy misfortune is so frequent and crying an offense especially amongst the more flourishing part of man kind that there is a great deal of reason to imagine that many delinquents would never have been such if they had but been thoroughly apprised of the heinousness of the crime and the very sad consequences to the body as well as the soul which follow from it and which indeed is the motive that has induced me to the writing of this chapter  but as it is very difficult to write on a subject of so nice a nature as this is within the reach of the meanest capacities without making some encroachment upon the rules and bounds of decency and the risque of giving some offense notwithstanding it may proceed from a design to promote virtue and discourage vice i shall therefore rather choose to express my self so as to be less intelligible to some by leaving several things to my readers private consideration than by an overfreedom of expression to run the hazard of putting that into any chaste mind which every person ought with the utmost christian courage and care to stifle and destroy subjects of this nature being as dr baynard calls it res faeda dictu and the scripture a detestable thing and what if mere necessity did not urge st paul forbids even to be so much as named amongst christians nec nominetur in vobis for which reason if ever caution care and circumspection is necessary in the treating of any moral subject in the world it is most certainly in this wherein st paul thought he could express the enormity of the crime by no word more emphatical and expressive than by imposing a perpetual silence of it amongst those persons whose not only name but life and conversation spoke them to be christians for which reason it was that an ancient author thought he could give no better a mark to distinguish between christians and heathens who being totally absorpt drowned and given up to a reprobate sense uncleanness and their own passions they dishonored their own bodies to use the expression of the scripture then the purity of life and conversation in the former and not in their outward name and profession only and therefore says he we christians non magn loquimur sed vivimus  i doubt not but those persons whose guilty conscience shall tell them that they are concerned in this present chapter will understand the meaning of it without much explication and it is to them i recommend it with my hearty desire of their most serious consideration of what is contained in it and as for those whom it no way concerns and by consequence who understand it not o happy ignorance i cougratulate them their unspotted innocence rara avis in terris i will endeavor to say nothing which shall endanger their loosing but rather confirm their happy keeping it  to proceed therefore in our subject by this doctrine is excluded every even the least impure and immodest action as unlawful and to be banished the conversation of christians whose characteristick mark ought to be modesty as being thereby the very ts of the holy chost than which consideration st paul thought he could produce no one more powerful to dissuade christians from all manner of uncleanness whatsoever the apostles argument is this that if material temples dedicated only to the external worship of almighty god are in no wise to be prosaned much less spiritual ones such as our bodies are in which the spirit of almighty god inhabits this reflection of st paul gives us clearly to understand that whenever we give our selves over to uncleanness our bodies are no more the temples of the holy ghost for which reason he tells us expressly that not being our own by consequence we are not at our own disposal being bought with a great price and ought therefore to be so far from abusing and defiling our selves that we ought to glorify god in even our bodies which are gods as well as our spirits all which is utterly destroyed by those misfortunes this chapter here treats of  my reader may therefore take this for a general rule that a christian is bound to shun whatever sensualizes the soul and tends only to gratify unlawful i e out of a conjugal state passions it being always unlawful out of that state to draw any immodest pleasure from our own bodies on any pretense whatsoever  to condemn therefore and dissuade against a sin so very displeasing to almighty god so detrimental to the commonwealth and so highly injurious to our selves requires no arguments which are not entirely agreeable to truth and can stand the test of the strictest reason  first its being a very great offense against almighty god sufficiently appears in that there is not a place in holy writ where sins of uncleanness are condemned but that unhappy one this chapter treats of is amongst others hinted at with a conclusion that nothing impure nor who acts any such abominable things shall ever inherit the kingdom of god but are to have a part in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone and although it is a saying no less true than terrible of an ancient author that sinners are always sure of their sin and uncertain of their pardon yet from what has hitherto been said all persons herein concerned ought seriously to betake themselves to true repentance and that betimes too lest by neglect in the end they misfortunately find themselves in the circumstances of antiochus of whom it is related that orabat scelsius dominum a quo non esset misericordiam consecuturus the case of too many delayed till on a deathbed repentance nor ought the example of the good theifs late repentance to embolden any delay because as an ancient author very well says that the scripture furnishes us with this example that we may not despair but it is the only one that we may not presume the best mark therefore of a true and sincere repentance is to leave off sinning betimes and returning no more to it after a conversion noli ampus pec care ne aliquid tib deterius contingat   ly the detriment which this misfortune brings to a commonwealth in general no less appears from so many noble families being frequently extinct for want of heirs which were it to be traced up to its true origin is owing to nothing else but the misfortune we here treat of by which the strength of youth has been so profusely squandred away that very few can afterward much boast of the fruits of a married state but suppose such persons have children which happens not often they are most commonly weak puny little things that either die soon or if they happen by chance and mere force more of physic than the kitchen to grow up they become tender sickly persons always ailing and complaining of one malady or another  what a pleasure is it to see says an ancient author a man at the age of fourscore with a wife near the same antiquity both blessed with healthy hail constitutions fresh wholesome looks sound minds and perfect senses  mens sana in corpore sano as juvenal says with active strait upright limbs walking without the adventitious support of either stick or staff and cheerful tempers residing over a healthful numerous progeny perhaps to the  d or  th generation and all these blessings owing under almighty god to the temperance and continence of their youths and now willing in a good old age to resign their breath in peace et factus est in pace locus ejus  when if we do but turn our eyes upon licentious livers we shall find them surrounded with a whole legion and complication of diseases lean jaws hagged pale livid looks hollow eyes sunk into their heads feeble hams legs without calves limping and hobling with a stick gouty unactive limbs continually complaining of weaknesses and pains in the small of their backs in fine worn and wasted away in the prime of their years by such selfdefilements and in their latter years by gleets gonorrhaeas and consumptions their spirits sunk body wasted strength decayed still shifting about for change of air trying all the baths in christendom always consulting one physician or another and yet after all upon the least rigor of any season or any other small accident to give up their sinful and it is well if not almost despairing breath and all this from having enervated exhausted consumed and worn out their bodies and strength with the sins of their youths and by which means they are now become a jest to others and oftentimes thought though how unjustly plainly appears to any one that only confiders the unhappy conduct of their flourishing youthful days the reproach of physicians and a torment to themselves and all these ain of disorders the sole effect of their abusing emselves in their youths what pangs and tortures have such persons in reflecting on the past actions of their lives who hardly come at half the age they might reasonably have expected to arrive at find themselves enervated exhausted consumed and worn out by the sins of their youths what a dismal thing is it for a person thus to to see that they are old and have destroyed themselves oftentimes before they are even  0 years of age insomuch that no sin draws its slaves and votaries into a greater abyss of evils and ruin than this  as to the injuries persons do themselves by this miserable practice they are no less evident since of such persons who have these abominarions in their youth prostrated and enervated their strength very few ever come to that strength and robustness which otherwise they would have arrived at befides stranguries gleets gonorrhaeas and other such weaknesses far more difficult to be cured than those contracted from either the secret disease or its cure so that well suppose   persons to be afflicted with gleets one of these gleets is purely the effect of the secret disease and its cure in a person whom we will suppose never to have been in all their life guilty of the misfortune this chapter treats of the other gleet is not only the effect of the secret disease and its cure but also is on a person whom well suppose to be concerned in this chapter this last gleet is much harder to cope with and cure than the former the reason of this will be obvious to every person who does but consider that such detestable actions being altogether unnatural by consequence are so many violences strains and forces upon and against nature and therefore not only the mucous glands in the passage but even the prostatae parastatae and seminal vessels themselves are so extremely relaxed debilitated weakened and enervated thereby that it is no wonder that the whole constitution pays dearly for it afterward as the gonerality of persons too fatally experience who ever in their youths have been guilty of this abominable practice insomuch that many young persons who were strong and lusty before they abandoned themselves to this vice have been so entirely worn out and ruined by it as to become old before half their years came on for by thus robbing themselves of their strength and empoverishing their spirits by depriving their bodies of its balmy and vital juice by this abominable practice they have become so dry and emaciated as to be sent to their graves a great many years sooner than otherwise they would have been  perhaps my reader may ask of me that since the weakness of mankind and propension to ill is so very great that if we run through the whole decalogue there is not one precept whose transgressors deserve more commiseration and pity than this what way must youth preserve themselves from it no ones strength being to be depended on in this point for those who think themselves secure st paul charges to take care least they fall so that if we trust only to our reason we shall find in the end that this is no manner of match at all to our inclinations which are infinitely stronger insomuch that whoever beats a parley with sensual pleasures is already capitulating with his enemy and will be vanquished at last the great preservative then is chiefly to avoid idleness and fly all occasions of ill apprehende fugam says an ancient author si vis habere victoriam for qui tangit picem as surely inquinabitur ab ea as he who loves periculum most certainly sooner or later in illo peribit and therefore they will find to their sorrow that a short fleeting pleasure of only a moment in fine mordebit ut coluber like a poor silly fly hovering about the flame thinking it to be as sweet as it appears fair perishes at the first trial and however such persons may through the instigation of the devil flatter themselves that whenever the fact is committed that it is but a trifling fault yet it has so tarnished their soul that afterward they can have no innocence to boast of having prodigally bartered it for a momentary satisfaction as esau did with his birthright for the transient sensuality of a mess of pottage the barrier that fenced their chastity being broke the enemy to purity and holiness makes daily incursions and ravages through every passage of the conquered soul and although by a demure outward be haviour and carriage the eyes of men may be deceived yet an allseeing god cannot be hindered from witnessing an act which his holiness so much abominates as to exclude us without true repentance for it eternally from the kingdom of heaven a loss to balance which our savior expressly tells us that the whole world is not an aequivalent what profit is it to a man to gain the whole world if he loses his own soul  how many unhappy souls are there in the world who never would have been guilty of enormous crimes if they had not in their youths been initiated in sin by this unhappy practice and how many again are there whose affairs in the world almighty god has attended with judgments ever since as a punishment of such horrid facts committed formerly in their youth to avert all which the only way is to practice virtue betimes and early to leave off these abominations and whatever difficulty is experienced in overcoming a vicious habit the persons must consider that it is a burden of their own making and therefore they ought the more cheerfully to undergo the overcomeing it  chap   of a simple gonorrhaea whence it proceeds and how it differs from a common gleet besides the infirmity hitherto treated of there is yet another sort of weakness of much worse consequence and which for the resemblance it bears to a gleet is often confounded under the same name by persons unacquainted with the difference whereas in rigor it is no such thing and is properly called a simple gonorrhaea to distinguish it from that virulent efflux of matter commonly though very improperly called a gonorrhaea and is that which afflicts persons who have actually the secret disease  a simple gonorrhaea is an involuntary emission of a real seminal matter by reason of the caruncles through which it owzes from the neck of the vesiculae seminales into the urethra being so injured weakened and relaxed in their fibers as to permit the seminal matter insensibly to come away this is an infirmity that may indeed but does not often happen and when it does the person in a little time grows lean pale weak and feeble especially about the loins and is soon brought into a tales dorsalis and if not speedily taken care of to his grave so that notwithstanding the vulgar call almost every involuntary emission of matter from a human body a gonorrhaea ye this infirmity last mentioned is only and truly a gonorrhaea or efflux of real and true seminal matter wherea neither in a gleet nor in any stage or degree of the secret disease any true seminal matter comes away as i manifest from what has been already said of a gleet and also in the first chapter of the practical scheme abovementioned concerning a gonorrhaea so that a gleet which is commonly tho most improperly called a gonorrhaea is in reality nothing but only a dripping or owzing away of that mucous slimy liquor separated by the glands in the urethra for the lubrication of it as has been above fully said and generally speaking free from any venereal infection so that a person may have a gleet upon them a considerable time without being so visibly emaciated and weakened as they would be in a very small time by a simple gonorrhaea though nevertheless to let a gleet run on from year to year as many do without seeking a remedy for it is a most certain means to bring on a consumption as hereafter will be showed  a simple gonorrhaea is caused by falls strains lifting too great a weight wrestling violent riding running jumping carrying of heavy burdens etc and is so very difficult an infirmity to cure as oftentimes to be even incurable but as for a gleet it is only after venereal cures or some certain overstrainings and selfabuses too much or unskilful purging etc insomuch that through a very great weakness and relaxation of the orifices of the glands in the urethra from the abovementioned causes a great many persons have been left with seeming incurable gleets upon them though under the care of otherwise reputed ingenious men in their profession for which reason it is that few persons get clear of a clap without more or less of a gleet  from what has hitherto been said it appears that the true seat of a simple gonorrhaea is in the seminal vessels whereas the seat of a virulent running and a gleet is in no other part than the urethra as fully has already been showed and also in the first chapter of the practical scheme and it is for want of a true distinction in this point that so many people are ruined by improper applications from an erroneous notion of the seat of the disease  moreover besides the abovementioned causes of a simple gonorrhaea an efflux of matter very much reseming it frequently follows from the prostate glands themselves having been in a manner so worn as to be almost aten fretted and corroded away or at least have been extremely relaxed and debilitated by their being so continually ulcerated as they frequently are in many patients under cure for the secret disease or if not this they at least have been ver much heated and distended by repeated strong purgations by which means the tone of the parts had been so relaxed and destroyed as to cause a thin seminal matter almost continually to flow away from the urethra which fluxion though commonly called a gleet yet in rigor it is a kind of a simple gonorrhaea and is frequently the consequence and result of preposterous management and ill finished cures  chap   of weaknesses in women these are infirmities i should here take no notice of if it were not for the sake of a great many virtuous persons laboring under them who to besure will send for this little book in expectation of assistance from it and in hopes thereby to avoid the shock of discovering and making known those ailments to others which most who labor under them use their utmost diligence to screen and hide that therefore this present little tract may not be defective but fully answer whatever can be expected from its title these weaknesses being inconveniences which although some women are more subject to then others yet at some time or another so many labor under them that scarce any are wholly exempt from them and what is still worse out of such great numbers as are afflicted with them very few ever get a true and solid cure either through a difficulty in themselves to discover em or a neglect of their cure by thinking them trivial infirmities which time will cure without considering the ill consequences they will produce or for want of judgment in those that undertake their cure they through a bashfulness of discovering their case to persons of skill consult only such whose knowledge reaches no farther then turpentine pills bole armenick and astringents archangel clary and other such like things as insignificant to many as the judgment was defective that prescribed them  i must here therefore take notice that the imperfections observable in most accounts of these weaknesses for by this name of weakness i shall always for decency sake throughout this chapter mean the subject it treats of hitherto published and the shocking expressions in describing them have induced me to say some thing on this subject which i will endeavor to do in such a manner as may lead those of my readers to whom this chapter only belongs into a true knowledge of their state and method of its cure with as little information to others not concerned in it i mean the men as possibly the subject will admit of  these weaknesses are of much the same nature as gleets in men for as the abovementioned relaxed and weakened mucous glands in the urethra or urinary passage separate and discharge that matter which constitutes a gleet in men so observing a requisite proportion other cervical glandules or small vessels of the same nature proportionably in the neck of the womb in women and designed for much the same use of lubricating it separates and discharges also the matter of these weaknesses so that these glandules being rendered weak lax and loose and thereby deprived of their natural due tone and springyness either from the ill constitution of the stomach and a serosity or crude chyle in the mass of blood depraved by distempers or some ill accidents by which means those vessels cannot sufficiently retain the proper humor separated by them from the blood for much the same use proportionably as in men viz to lubricate or moisten the passage tho for another end but let it gleet thus involuntarily and slide away and although women being of a more cold and moist habit of body then men and on that account and some others more liable to be afflicted with these weaknesses then men are with gleets yet a gleet in men and these weaknesses in women are oftentimes one and the same disease and owe their origin very often to the same causes which generally in men are venereal ones tho not always so in women but sometimes hard and difficult labors colds or hurts in lying in especially in weak and diseased habits of body and many other accidents which attend the sex but to speak the truth gleets in men most commonly owe their beginning to the secret disease and so sometimes does also these weaknesses in women the infection of which having been carried off the eibres in the ostiola or excretory ducts of he glands so often abovementioned are not easily restoed in either sex to their pristine tone strength and vigor but will remain relaxed and weak from whence  weeping or dripping properly called a gleet in men and weaknesses in women will especially in an ill habit of body for a long time after remain unless proper measures be taken for a cure  from what has been hitherto said plainly appears what a simple gonorrhaea which very seldom happens and what a gleet in men and what weaknesses in women are which are very common infirmities they are all generally speaking free from any infection and can never let practitioners say what they please to fright timorous patients degenerate into the venereal disease these weaknesses as well as gleets in men are generally esteemed very hard to cure and so indeed frequently they are but if proper measures and means be but taken both men and women may in a competent time and without much inconvenience be freed from these troublesome and disagreeable companions especially to neat and cleanly persons  there are few women especially of the weaker sort but at one time or other are aflicted with these weaknesses they being an infirmity often attendant upon and caused by concomitant or preceding distempers insomuch that generally speaking whatever disease reduces a woman to a languid weakly state it is commonly succeeded by this indisposition for which reason women that are naturally of a more weak constitution or habit of body than ordinary are more subject to these weaknesses than others  some women indeed have these weaknesses much more moderate than others and not continually but at certain times only without causing any great or remarkable prostration of strength till after a year or   or more but then it becomes more violent and dangerous weakening the body excessively and is then much more hard to cure this being a known and undoubted truth that the longer these weaknesses have afflicted the patient and the larger in quantity they are the longer time will be required and the more difficult will it be to accomplish the cure the humors being more habituated to come away and the glandules in the vessels more weakened and spoiled  it is equally as hard a matter as it is useful for a physician sometimes to distinguish well between these weaknesses and other distempers which resemble them their consequences and their cure being widely different for numbers of women who have met with ill husbands have labored under the venereal or secret disease for some years together still imagining it to be that weakness this present chapter treats of  thus it being very difficult for women to distinguish these distempers and yet absolutely necessary that they should it may generally speaking be done by this rule of hippocrates which although for decency sake i shall be very cautious in expressing yet those persons to whom this chapter belongs and is designed for will sufficiently comprehend the rule is this that these weaknesses of which this present chapter treats ceases in women at certain periodical times and do not trouble them till such times are over whereas a venereal running remains constantly upon the patient and does nor cease at any time  many are the deplorable ill effects of these weaknesses the unhappy companion of womankind if not in time remedied but as this subject s more proper for the following chapter where i shall treat at large of the ill consequences of these weaknesses i shall refer my readers to it  chap vi of the ill consequences and effects of gleets and other such weaknesses a great many persons not knowing or at least not reflecting and considering the ill consequences of gleets and other such weaknesses look upon them as trivial infirmities which time and patience will cure whereas although at present these infirmities may give no other uneasiness or trouble than what is opposite to neatness and cleanliness being no grateful companions to a clean neat man yet by their continuance greatly empair the health by wasting the body and bringing it into a visible consumption the reason of which is a gleet may in some measure and not improperly be compared to an issue which seems as a receptacle for the humors of the whole body but more especially of the adjacent parts to run to so that persons who have a gleet or any other like weakness upon them have thereby a constant drain to their body which as has been already showed by a continual discharge of that matter which comes away not only exhausts it of that mucous liquor which is a strength and support to the parts where a gleet is situated but also draws away thereby a constant supply of those other juices wherein the vigor and strength of the constitution consists the reason of which is that near these parts both of men and women there are certain emunctories placed whose use is to receive the superfluous humors or recrements of the whole body and discharge them through the genital parts so that the greater this discharge of humors is the more are the parts not only weaknd by it and the more incessantly and plentifully do these humors flow but also the nutritious juices destined to the nourishment and support of the neighboring parts flows down with it and are evacuated so that at length by reason of this loss of the nutritious juice which flowing to the same place is also corrupted and continually sent away not only weakness and pains together with a pining and wasting of the neighboring parts but of the whole body does succeed from a poor weak and dispirited chyle the blood abounds with and to this cause it is that the greatest part of broken and decayed constitutions are owing but as i have treated at large on this subject of spoiled and broken constitutions by fast living former ill cures salivations and mercury in the  d chapter of my practical scheme to be had gratis where this book is given away i shall not repeat that subject here but refer my reader to it  the body therefore being thus emptied and drained of those nutritious juices which in healthy hail sound persons are its support in length of time excessive pains and weakness especially in the loins and small of the back ensues together with a debility and weakness in the nerves and joints pale faint and livid looks especially about the eyes melancholy loss of appetite decay of spirits and strength a remarkable wearyness over the whole body swelling in the legs and an universal decay of strength  so that these symptoms not stoping in time as most persons in the beginning deceive themselves they will fancing a gleet to be an inconsiderable thing and that it will wear off of it self in process of time they increase and are followed also by others as an almost continual thirst a hectical disposition atrophy and wasting of flesh till at length the body is so drained as to be brought into the highest degree of a consumption  all which symptoms are occasioned by the great loss of the mucous liquor of the glands which being thus weakened and relaxed have their meatuss or openings so widened and loosened as not be able to restrain the flux or dripping away of the matter whereby the withering of the whole body with a dryness and siccity of the nerves and nervous juices must necessarily in a short time ensue  as for the effects or ill consequences of a real simple gonorrhaea they are no less dismal then speedy for in a little time says dr willis from the vast efflux of real seminal matter the whole strength is prostrated a tabes dorsalis presently ensues and terminates in the grave  it remains now to speak a word or two of the ill effects and consequences of weaknesses in women as i have already done of gleets in men as i promised above in the foregoing chapter since therefore what i have already said in this chapter is to be proportionably applied to women the effects of these weaknesses are pains in the small of the back and head want of appetite bad digestion weariness and restlessness sometimes swellings of the legs pale livid countenance etc and as this evil is mostly occasioned by foregoing distempers tho also sometimes by sudden frights violent exercise irregular living etc so it weakens the body also more and more bringing the whole human frame into a pining desperate state unless cured by proper remedies skillfully administered in time no evil in the world that usually happens to women being of so very ill consequence to the looks complexion mind habit strength and whole body as this  insomuch that if this great evil which too often proves the bane and ruin of woman kind be not timely remedied it certainly causes either untimely barrenness or if they have children they are weak infirm and diseased and the blood and juices become more and more impoverished till an inevitable consumption dropsy and other distempers prove only the forerunners of immediately ensuing death  chap vii how to know when a gleet or other such weakness is free from or partakes still of the relics of a former venereal infection  or which is the same thing signs to know when a person is properly well and the malignity carried off after former cures although they may have a gleet or other such weakness still remaining upon them the design of this chapter being to show how every person that has received an injury and been under cure for it may know whether the malignity be wholly carried off or not and if there be any running or gleeting still remaining afterward whether it proceeds from any secret infection still lurking behind or from medicines taken for a cure or from a natural weakness of the parts which some persons from a more then ordinary delicacy and tenderness of constitution are liable to notwithstanding the utmost care both of themselves and the person under whose hands they were during their cure my reader is to take notice that after a due evacuation and clearing of the body of the venereal infection the mattery running which before was yellowish green or bloody looses by degrees both it is color and quantity and comes at last to a perfect whiteness or transparency resembling very much the white of an egg and is slimy mucilaginous and ropy and the parts are easy and cool all which are admirable signs and the strongest presumption that the malignity is carried off and the person cured and well but since it frequently also happens that a person may be said to be not ill cured although these signs of a good cure may not be altogather so very perfect as here they are described to be we must examine this matter still a little farther for the full satisfaction of the most timorous of my readers  it has indeed been a common opinion that in gleets when the matter that comes away is still discouloured being either yellowish or green that it is a certain sign and indeed an only one of a remaining infection and an imperfect or ill cure it is true that when the matter that comes away in a gleet or other such weakness is not discouloured at all but is pure white glutinous and ropy and the parts in all respects entirely cool and easy there is no difficulty to pronounce such  person entirely free from infection and not ill cured because if there were any infection and malignity still remaining behind these signs would not be so perfect a here i suppose them to be but yet for all this it is no always a certain sign and consequence of either an actua lurking infection or a former ill cure when even these signs are not so very perfect the reason of this is that in some habits of body the owzing matter which constitutes a gleet will in some length of time and in diseased habits of body in its separation from the blood be so permixt with some certain corrosive but not at all venereal particles as thereby to be so colliquated and altered in it is texture and cohesion of it is constituent parts as to appear a sort of pus sanies or matter something discolored that will very much resemble the relics and remains of a venereal infection or an ill cure and if a person should think to change this color by purging one might as dr harvey observes purge a persons life away as soon as change either it is color or cause it is entire abatement so that the practitioner imagining that all yellowish runnings are malignant which is a vulgar error goes on still in hopes of changing it till at length the parts are so weakened that the poor patient has a gleet fixed upon him and thereby rendered worse instead of better and perhaps at last told they are incurable  to show the truth of this it is to be observed that the imprudent continuation of venereal catharticks rather keeps on the yellowness of the running then abates it by keeping up the humors in a constant ferment and ebullition and thereby inflaming and frothing them up into a yellow bilous spume or scum which is daily separated in the parts that are now become as it were a cistern to which custom has made an open channel and converted the orifice of the urethra into as it were an issue to which the depraved humors of the body and especially of the adjacent parts flow and which humors as the blood even in very well cured persons is tinctured with choler and depraved and altered by a long course of physic do also proportionably partake more or less of a yellowish color hence it plainly appears that some returns of yelwish small runnings after some cures of the secret sease do not always indicate any remaining infection  lay any blame or aspersion upon the former cure is yellowness frequently owing it is origin to the yelow liquors of the blood besides when the efflux f a gleet is thus continued the glands and vessels are hereby every day more and more weakened by which he liquors will be separated more impure and mixed hen they were formerly in a healthy state at the same glands and therefore it is manifest how gall mixing with the liquor will make it come away of a yellowish color this is not only in reason possible but what we find true by daily experience in ulcers and common sores from whence a yellowish matter will flow owing it is color purely to the bilous part of the blood separated and secerned by the adjacent glands hence as dr cockburn takes notice it frequently happens that virulent runnings in persons who have the secret disease actually upon them have been cured when the yellowness has continued to the last drop which could not be if the yellowness were always a part or mark of the contagion  chap viii of the most rational and true method of cure of gleets simple gonorrhaeas and other such weaknesses in either sex proceeding from former cures etc as i have endeavored hitherto demonstratively to deduce the seat and nature of a gleet and other such weaknesses from it is symptoms and the anatomical structure of the part it affects without engaging in any of the hypotheses of the ancients so i will now endeavor to draw such consequences from the nature of the infirmity thus discovered which will prove the plainest and most satisfactory course that can be taken to arrive at the most exact ways of curing it especially since the common methods of cure of late years in practice are found from their want of success not sufficiently grounded on reason and experience it being a manifest truth that the best methods of cure are always taken from a rational notion of the nature and cause of a disease human reason being never of greater use in any part of human life then it is in the practice of physic for as dr mead says in the preface to his essays on poisons he alone is the most likely person to cure any ailment or disorder in a human body who best understands the human oconomy the texture of the parts the motions of the fluids and by consequence the source and origin of the disorder according to that of celsus recte curaturum quem prima origo causae non fefellerit having therefore above in the second and following chapters clearly accounted for the most rational cause of gleets simple gonorrhaeas and other weaknesses the subject matter of this present treatise i hope also as clearly now to show the most rational method of their cure as follows  in omnibus contrarietas remedio est is an aphorism of the great hippocrates and holds good in the cure of our present infirmity as well as in the cure of any other particular disorder of the body whatsoever insomuch that if there be a heat and inflammation in any part recourse must be had to those things that are cooling in cold diseases to warm medicines if any humor is sharp and corrosive it must be reduced to a due degree of softness by mollifying medicines if any parts are injured and weakened strengthening healing and balsamic ones must be made use of before ever a cure can be effected in order to restore the debilitated parts to their first tone and vigor so that in our present infirmity which we have now before us we find from what has been hitherto said the following obstacle and which must necessarily be removed before ever we can hope to reinstate the patient viz  the openings of the mucous glands so often abovementioned in the urethra being weakened loosned and relaxed by the above mentioned causes are thereby become flabby limber and loose which before in a sound state were springy vigorous and strong so that by this means the ostiola or mouths of them being deprived of their natural power of in some measure proportionable at least to their bigness contracting and drawing themselves together after every emission of that mucous slimy liquor they contain are by consequence always open by which means this liquor is continually owzing out from them and coming away this being the true state of our present question and the rational obstacle we have now to encounter with as sufficiently appears from what has been above said it is natural to conclude that the only true and rational method of cure of gleets and any other weaknesses of the same kind whether in men or women must consist in one word for all without any manner of evasion or going round the bush in affecting the very place it self from whence the dripping liquor is discharged and this is done by strengthening these glands and thereby restoring their openings and mouths to their former power of contracting and constringing themselves after every emission of the mucous liquor they contain by which means a certain bar and hindrance will be put to their discharging more of it then is wisely intended by nature as just enough for the lubrication and moistening of the passage and no more and for which end alone she has designed it this being once effected just so much and no more of this liquor will afterward proceed from these glands as just the defense of the urethra requires as a preservative against the sharpness and saltness of the urine as it passes through it being an established maxim in philosophy that upon the removal of any cause the effect presently ceases so that wherever the cause lies that must be applied to before ever we can expect the effects to cease but how to bring this about hic labor hoc opus est it is residence being in a part which nature seems particularly to have affected the concealment  hence my reader may plainly see that the great difficulty which has now puzzled so many ages in the cure of gleets and other such sorts of weaknesses is all from only a few evidently demonstrable principles above established reduceable to one only single intention of cure viz to strengthen these glands it is no wonder then that the ancients found such difficulty in this matter as after all possible endeavors sometimes to leave their patients at best only in statu quo though in rigor this may be very much doubted it being pretty certain that neither the continuance of a gloet nor any of the common methods of its cure have been ever as yet found to improve a constitution or to change it otherwise then from a strong to a weaker one  our next enquiry then must be how this intention of cure is to be brought about and effected with the greatest ease and security to the patient and what t nature of those medicines must be that can perform i in order to which we must consider that since glee procced from the mucous glands in the urethra an the contiguous parts being particularly weakened through long continuance of the secret disease and its cure repeated selfabuses etc the intention of cure mus consist in strengthening and contracting these relaxe glands and parts adjacent and thereby restore them t their former natural state of vigor and soundness after having been thus injured and debilitated either by the distemper or its cure reiterated selfabuses o other whatsoever causes and for want of such a method as this it is that a great many persons although otherwise perfectly well come to have seemingly incureable gleets fixed and entailed upon them for which reason it is that a gleet is always more or less difficult to cure as it is of greater or less continuance or is occasioned by more or less frequent self abuses or a more or less virulent humor which gave the preceding infection by every one of which causes the glands are always more or less stretched weakened and debilitated  the method then i here aim at in the cure of our present infirmities is by such medicines as are appropriated in a peculiar manner and by a singular specific quality influence and tendency to the injured and debilitated glands in the urethra and parts adjacent chiefly above any other part or parts of the body whatsoever and thereby not only so to act upon and affect them in particular as to strengthen close and constringe their mouths and orifices but also to preserve them hereafter in this sound state so that these glands being reestablished by this method of cure their acquired vigor will enable them to resist any future ingress of faster supplies of the matter they separate and secerne then is just necessary and no more for the moistening and lubrication of the urethra and so turning them off to be discharged by nature another way so that whilst the ancients were trifling with their long tedious and uncertain methods of cure wonders are performed by this besides this method of cure succeeding to the satisfaction of the patient is a strong confirmation of the truth of the theory above established whereas n the other hand most other methods formerly pracisedby the ancients either did not succeed at at or f at any time they did it was not till after a very ong while  from what has been hitherto said it plainly appears that this our method of cure is not only effectual in men but will be found upon trial to be inferior to few for those weaknesses mentioned above in the  th chap in women  i will not here trouble my readers in proving that in nature there are some certain medicines which being taken into the stomach will immediately tend toward and make their way to some one particular part of the body electively and preferably to any other having fully cleared that difficulty in the  th  th and  0th chapters of the  d edition of my new system of the gout and rheumatism to be had gratis where this book is given away i desire them therefore to read those chapters wherein i have clearly shown how medicines by a particular specific quality they are endowed with will being taken into the stomach tend to and have an influence over some one peculiar part of the body which they are designed particularly to relieve rather then any other as is there clearly showed in medicines appropriated to the cure of the gout all which i hope will fully convince any person of the possibility of a strengthening restorative medicines being taken into the stomach and from thence to tend toward and make it is way by means of the bloods circulation immediately to that part in particular above any other in the body whatsoever which is the true seat of a gleet i mean the urethra or urinary passage this point therefore being fully discussed in those chapters of the abovementioned system i will say nothing more of that subject here but refer my reader to the perusal of that book which he may have for only asking for at the places abovementioned where this book is given away  as to the change of the color of the gleet etc since it generally proceeds as above has been said from a mixture of choler bile gall and several impurities with the blood by consequence to cleanse and rectify the ill crasis of this will effectually change the ill color of that care therefore must be taken that al strengthening medicines that are made use of in the cure of gleets be also endowed with a certain detergent faculty by which they may in their passage to those parts they are chiefly designed for so cleanse sweeten and purify the blood as at the same time that they strengthen the glands in the urethra they may also change the color of the liquor these glands contain and by thus changing of it is ill color it is substance if too thin will also secundario and per accidens be changed at the same time for since whenever the matter dripping and owzing away in gleets and other such weaknesses is too thin it proceeds from its being colliquated and if i may use the expression as it were in a manner melted down and liquid by those impurities which are mixed and blended with it out of the mass of blood these impurities and foulnesses being once cleansed out of the blood the mucous slimy matter will naturally reassume again its own natural tenacious and glutinous consistence as it has in statu sano  my reader perhaps will ask me whether or no this method of cure is proper in all sorts of gleets and other such weaknesses to which i answer that when a gleet is purely such and entirely free from any relics or remains of former infection the abovementioned method of cure is inferior to few in the world if therefore the gleet or other such weakness be what proceeds from a former cured injury and that the person had no manner of such infirmity upon them before they received and were cured of that injury it is absolutely necessary for the patients safety first of all to be satisfied that there is no remaining malignity attending it which my reader will sufficiently be instructed in from what has been above said in the foregoing chapter but if persons are any ways doubtful whether or no the gleet may still partake of any preceding infection it will be necessary to clear the body and by consequence the gleet or any other such weakness of whatever former infection it may be still blended and mixed with least instead of cureing a person of a gleet something of worse consequence be fixed and rivetted upon him what therefore is most proper for every such doubtfu person to do previous to the taking of the following great restorative is fully mentioned in the directions sealed up along with it and which method will effectually carry of all the remainder of any former taint or infection whatsoever out of any persons body in order to be perfectly and safely cured of their gleet by the following restorative so that how effectual so ever any other usually practiced method of cure of gleets etc may be it will scarce prove a more safe one then this the chief consideration we have of the goodness of any method of cure is its efficacy safety and time wherein we are cured by it all which being after repeated experiments found to be best answered by the method here proposed then by any other whatsoever of the ancients i presume i shall do no small piece of service to that unhappy part of mankind that labors under these uncomfortable infirmities in publishing it  hence it appears that gleets and other such weaknesses are not so difficult of cure as a great many persons make them to be who after all their endeavors to rid the patients of them to no purpose dismiss them at last with their opinion that they will never be cured assuring them at the same time it will never hurt them and that nature at length will wear and throw it off and the like which a great many give credit to in hopes of finding it true till time has made this error too manifestly appear for instead of natures overcoming it and their finding no inconvenience by it it has grown worse and worse and proved at last so very inconvenient that the poor patient has born it with no small uneasyness  chap ix of a certain strengthening restorative medicine for the cure of gleets and other such weaknesses the learned dr cockburn in his treatise of a gonorrhaea  d edition page   0 lays this down for a general rule in physic viz that no medicine is to be received for its singular use till it has had many trials in proper circumstances i e till it has been used on a number of people equally ill or that it has its effects when no reasonable hopes are left of a cure by the best of other medicines skilfully administered hence it is by consequence to be concluded that when a medicine has showed its efficacy in these circumstances it not only may but even ought to be received by every person solicitous for their health and welfare  after therefore having proceeded thus far with this treatise i should be injurious to my readers thus to explicate the origin cause symptoms effects and ill consequences together with the most rational method of cure of their infirmities if i should leave them there perhaps something wiser then they were before as to the just now enumerated heads but not a bit the nearer to a cure in order then not to entertain them with mere speculations i will endeavor to give them some practical assistance by proposing here to the world a truly great and noble remedy for those weaknesses and disorders here treated of  the medicine i propose is a most excellent balsamic restorative which for recovering nature in those many weaknesses so frequently abovementioned has not many equals it being a most noble strengthner in all weaknesses whether from hard labors overstrainings wrenches miscarriages selfabuses and other secret injuries and their cures in either sex its efficacy also reaches still farther being of admirable use to cure pains weaknesses and all imbecilities of nature either in the back reins loins or elsewhere to remove or take away any stoppage of urine by effectually and yet gently as nature seems to defire carrying off all mucous filthy sanious and infectious matter slime or gravel lodged in the reins and elsewhere by ill cures or other causes and which either produces a sharpness in the urine or a too frequent provocation to make it and thereby recovers the lost tone of the seminal vessels and mucous glands in the urethra so often abovementioned destroying thereby all relics of venereal venom that lurking in the body insensibly wastes and decays the flesh and strength  and least my readers should suspect the possibility of the operation of a medicine taken in at the mouth and from thence conveyed into the stomach on a part so remote from it as that is which i have proved above in the  d chap to be true real and indeed only seat of a gleet and other such weakness i must refer them to what i have said on this subject in the  th and  0th chapters of my abovementioned system of the gout and rheumatism in which chapters is as clearly showed as so nice and intricate a subject will admit from the principles of the modern philosophy how it is very possble for a medicine to be taken in at the mouth and conveyed into the stomach and from thence to be mixed with that portion of the mass of blood which it finds circulating in the vessels there by which means of the bloods circulation it is soon carried about the body and by consequence to that very individual part it is designed to relieve as is fully proved in those chapters of the just now mentioned system of the operation of the antiarthritick medicine there proposed to act upon even the very utmost and remotest extremities of the body viz those joints which usually the gout seizes i desire therefore my readers that since they may have that system for only asking for they will be pleased to peruse the  th and  0th chapters of it and apply them to this subject that i may not repeat the same matter here over again for as a medicine taken for the gout if it be a true and real antiarthritick never attempts to exert its principal force of acting till it arrives along with the blood at the glands of those very joints it is designed to relieve just so the great restorative and stengthing medicine i here propose being taken a few drops of it in a little wine ale or beer is thereby carried down into the stomach from whence it mixes it self being of a spirituous volatile nature with the mass of blood and is carried with it about the body and among other parts to that which is the true seat of those infirmities here treated of being arrived there by a particular specific influence it bears over and tendency to that part above any other and the mucous glands contained in it it there begins to exert its force and to operate by strengthening healing and restoring the mouths and ostiola of those little glands to their former elasticity springyness and vigor by which means they will naturally again recover that power they formerly had of constringing themselves as naturally they ought to do after every emission of the mucous slimy liquor they contain and which nature has wisely designed for the lubrication of the passage as has sufficiently been above explicated this being once performed by this great restorative medicine and the mouths of these glands being recovered from their looseness and flabbyness to an elastick springy state by consequence a bar will thereby be put for the future by which just so much and no more of this mucous slimy liquor will be let out and come away then just the moistening and lu brication of the passage in a hail sound state requires by which means a gleet which perhaps for a long time has afflicted the patient will be taken away and the parts restored to their former due state of health and strength  the property of this great restorative is not only traumatick i e only to heal and thereby to strengthen the mucous glands in the passage and the wombvessels by gently straitening them and reducing them to their natural tone but also to deterge and cleanse them of whatever filth they may by their weakness have contracted never disordering the body but keeping it in a due state it is not unpleasant to take and being once received in a proper vehicle as a glass of wine ale beer etc into the stomach it by means of the bloods circulation displays its virtues after a wonderful manner effectually answering the intentions of cure besides all which it is a very great purifier and sweetner of the blood and juices and thereby invigorates enlivens and strengthens the whole body taking away weaknesses and pains in the back loins and elsewhere rendering the person brisk lively healthy and strong and puts an end to those troublesome companions commonly called gleets and other such weaknesses  so that to a person even never so well in health that should take of it it will cleanse sweeten and purify the blood and thereby wonderfully enliven animate strengthen and invigorate the whole constitution but above all in a more particular manner then ordinary those parts which being hidden in the body are too remote for any manual operation to act upon as the seminal and urinary vessels the prostatae parastatae and mucous glands in the urethra this noble medicine being to be taken by drops may be carried in the pocket and taken as well abroad as at home without any manner of uneasiness trouble suspicion or confinement for example at the tavern coffeehouse or any other public place by which means gentlemen and others will be cured in a manner insensibly and before they are almost aware of it its operation is principally by urine but nevertheless it will in most constitutions so assist nature as to promote the having one stool in about    hours nothing does exceed this admirable remedy in the abovementioned cases where either too much purging has over relaxed and weakened the tone of the parts or too free a use of mercury and other pernicious methods of cure have been made use of restoring the body to a due state of health and strength  this great restorative in fine neat bottles is sealed up with the print of the anodyne necklace which the late dr paul chamberlen in his life time recommended for childrens teeth so often abovementioned to distinguish it from any counterfeit together with printed directions in english and french for its use so clear easy full and plain that persons may cure themselves with it in any remote country season climate or part of the world for if well corked it will not grow worse with keeping price a guinea and is to be had at the places mentioned above in the title page of this book  appendix having above in the title page of this book made mention of a certain anodyne necklage recommended by the late dr paul chamberlen for the easy breeding and cutting of childrens teeth etc i will here subjoin two testimonies published by dr chamberlen

carry with them to sea they all now finding it their interest and indeed their cheapest way to buy these remedies to cure their own patients with as the gentleman the seasurgeon was pleased to say who some time ago by dr chamberlen express advice took along with him oversea a large quantity of them also another gentleman owned in his letter incerted in the practical scheme p    that out of    persons that took of the specific remedy only one missed of his cure and that the person confessed was by his own mismanagement so that of late years it has been a common practice of several surgeons and other practitioners in physic to buy these romedies to cure their own patients with by which they have gained both money and reputation see more of the allowance by wholesale in my system of the

these necklaces i dere my reader to peruse a particular treatise by it self entitled a philosophical essay upon this necklace etc given gratis at those places where this book is given away  i desire my reader to give me leave to trouble him him here with an account of a particular cure of the gout performed by the antiarthritick tincture mentioned in the new system of the gout and rheumatism and of some few other cures of other ailments and disorders  the following certificate was sent entirely unknown to the author to london enclosed in a letter to mr pinckard attorney at law over the waterstairs in durhamyard in the strand part of which letter is as follows  dear son histon jan        this is to acquaint you how i have been attacked and how wonderfully also i have been relieved by the tincture for the gout which you sent me last spring i desire this testimony which i here send you may be published and i will testify the truth of it to all persons enquiring of me about it as i desire also the same of you to do etc   i robert needham the elder of hilston near monmouth gent having been above    years afflicted with the gout and many of those years i had it in my shoulders elbows hands knees and feet and this frequently altogether at one and the same time and thereby obliged for near six weeks together at a time to lie both night and day in my clothes and my stomach pauld and my self reduced to the utmost weakness i abovementioned do for the benefit of others hereby certify that some time ago i was violently seized in both my feet with the gout expecting the same or worse treatment i usually had but then and for some small time after i continuing to take of the remedy prepared for this end by the author of the new system of the gout and rheumatism having sent for it from london to have in readiness by me through god almightys blessing in three days time it carried off all pain preserved my stomach very well and kept my body very easy and in such good temper that i could walk about my house and do now walk abroad without a cane or staff which for most part of   months past i could not do having frequently pains in my ancles and feet of which i am now entirely freed  witness my hand this  0 th of december      robert needham   having been extreme ill with wandering pains and broken constitution etc so very bad and was so weak and worn away that all my friends were of opinion that i was in a consumption i applied my self to several physicians but to no effect till i bought that famous specific elixir for broken constitutions mentioned in the practical scheme which has perfectly cured me so that i am as well as ever i was in my life and publish this that others laboring under the same misfortune may happily find relief as i have done as i am ready to satisfy any person that will call upon me at my house braces coffeehouse in silverstreet near woodstreet  nov  0      william smith   a young lady having had from her infancy the evil so broke out in great holes in her body that for    years she could never go alone or stir out of her chamber without help being indeed a most miserable object continually weeping whole days and nights scarce having one easy hour her life being a perpetual torment to her fifty guineas were offered to dr brigs in bloomsbury if he could cure her dr chamberlen dr mead dr west and several other eminent physicians mr giffard mr tocket and several other skilful surgeons were all eyewitnesses of this her condition being given over by all as incurable and indeed she utterly despaired of ever being cured at last dr chamberlen advised her to take of the specific remedy she only took a few times of it by which the holes and sores which for    years had drained her body to a perfect skeleton are now healed up she is brisk and well and can go up and down stairs and abroad alone which she could never do in her life before and blesses the happy day that even dr chamberlen advised her to it the lady her self is willing to see and satisfy any person about it at the green door in waterstreet behind arundalstreet in the strand   a young gentleman   years ago got the secret disease in a violent manner and soon after the injury received applied himself to a certain eminent and noted surgeon for his practice in venereal cures in london who salivated him but did not cure him after which he took a certain remedy sold in town which is a counterfeit of this specific remedy but as it was a counterfeit of this true remedy it proved to no more purpose then his salivation but he grew worse after it being ulcerated and in a very deplorable condition insomuch that he was thought by all his friends past cure but in november      by taking of this famous specific remedy he was perfectly cured as i will fully satisfy any person who will be pleased to enquire for mr peter riscorla at my house the green ball in cowcross near westsmithfield where for the good of the public or any that labor under the like misfortune the gentleman will be seen and give an account himself of the truth of this   having had the kings evil for  0 years past to such a degree that the continual running of the many sores and blotches of the distemper had drained my body almost to a skeleton insomuch that i was brought so low that for some years past i have been entirely confined at home i used all means the hospital and several physicians could prescribe but to no manner of purpose at last hearing of the many cures performed by the famous specific remedy belonging to the practical scheme recommended by the late dr paul chamberlen i went in a coach to the sign of the anodyne necklace for childrens teeth without temple bar to fetch the remedy not being able to go a foot having been confined at home for several years and having taken now of this wonderful remedy most of my blotches holes and sores are finely healed up and i am so well recovered that i have gone a foot through the city to the astonishment of all who knew me of the truth of which i will satisfy any person at my house  geo wadkns barber and perewigmaker at the blew boar in whitechappel  dec           from a distemper of    years standing the result of which were scabs and nodes in my body as big as nuts blotches and sores from head to foot and some of them in my legs large enough to lay an egg in my body so weak and my flesh so rotten that upon my stretching it it would rend asunder as tho cut with a knife i william forbush capmaker over against queen elizabethshead in churchlane near whitechappel am now relieved and made whole by god almightys blessing on the specific remedy and elixir mentioned the practical scheme of the secret disease and broken constitutions the amazement of all my friends at my cure when declared incurable by many physicians will no doubt raise the curiosity of several to see me to whom i shall with incredible pleasure declare the fact more at large with many surprising particulars  april        william forbush   to all persons afflicted and laid up with the gout i hereby testify that having had a confirmed gout these   years past to such a degree that i was an entire cripple and not able to go without crutches having lost almost the total use of my limbs by it i took all things i could hear of but to no purpose till i took of that most excellent antiarthritick remedy belonging to the new system of the gout and rheumatism by which i am to a miracle recovered cured and restored to the perfect use of my limbs being as able to go without my crutches as ever i could in my life which before i happily took of this remedy i could never do of the truth of which i will satisfy any person  tho wiggins printer at the black bull in osterlaue near westsmithfield dec           i james davis at his majestys printing house in blackfryars was about   years ago seized with a violent fever which settling first in my feet and then flying into my head and all over my body attended with a prodigious swelling and inflammation made me incapable of getting out of my bed for several months and so has continued ever since excepting some small intervals i had the advice of several eminent physicians and surgeons as dr cade dr mills dr levet and others who were all eyewitnesses of this my unhappy condition and who by the various removings of my distemper knew not what to call it yet ordered me medicines but to no purpose about   years ago i went to st bartholomews hospital and was an outpatient several months where the physicians told me it was a violent gout but could have no ease having thus had the advice of the learned without success i began to hearken to every bodies instructions sending for and taking all the medicines i could hear of and as the expense was large so was their number i think innumerable which only added to my misfortune not hearing of any person so violently afflicted as my self being in this miserable condition and given over by all as incurable the gout still increasing so violently that my joints became so knotted that i was rendered quite unable to follow my business and destitute of all relief some time ago i was recommended by a gentleman to the antiarthritick tincture mentioned in a new system of the gout and rheumatism given away gratis etc i had not taken above a doses before i found a great alteration the gout which was then in my stomach abated and by some continuance of the remedy i still grew sensibly better every day so that i am now free from all pain and stiffness in my joints and as well in health and strength as ever i was in my life this benefit i have received by gods blessing and that inestimable remedy being so very great i desire this may be published for the good of others the truth of which i am ready to testify living in printinghousestreet in blackfryars  october        james davis   i could reckon up great numbers more of other such undeniable testimonies of cures by these remedies on persons even given over by all others but having trespassed on my readers patience too long already i will make an end desiring him to peruse the several news papers of these   years last past wherein he will find great numbers of authentic certificates of surprising cures wrought by them for to recite the particular cases of every one that has happily experienced the good effects of this specific remedy and elixir only since march      that the  st edition of this book was published would swell this little treatise far beyond my present design therefore i will leave every one to the perusal of the news papers and then to be informed of the persons themselves as to their success all which are as sufficient as even  0000 more would be to convince any person of the great virtue and efficacy of these remedies persons indeed may go from place to place to seek a cure but when they have sought and tried all they can they will scarce find a better nor surer then by these remedies as any person who trys them will to their comfort find  advertisement given gratis the four following books viz  st the   th edition in english and french and also abridged in most other european languages dedicated to dr chamberlen of the practical scheme of secret injuries and broken constitutions by fast living former ill cures salivations and mercury published ever since march        ly the new system of the gout and rheumatism drawn from reason anatomical observations and experience   ly a rational account of the true seat cause nature and cure of gleets and other such weaknesses usually attending persons after former cures selfabuses etc   thly the philosophical essay dedicated to the royal society upon the celebrated anodyne neck lace recommended by the late dr paul chamberlen for childrens teeth etc pr   s  published by reason of the great increase of late years in the bills of mortality by which it appears that in and about london the same may be said of paris or any other great city generally speaking near upon   000 children have yearly died of their teeth and convulsions and fevers caused thereby before this admirable physical necklace was published in the world besides the great numbers of women that are daily lost in childbed and the multitudes of persons that die of distempers of the head  whereas since this necklace has been published the bills of mortality have so decreased as to be less than ever they have been known to be before more children dying of their teeth then of all other distempers put together whatsoever  so that indeed no family ought to be without one of these necklaces for the great numbers of children who of late years have worn it have not only bred and cut their teeth easily and all the while thrived extremely but even multitudes have been retrieved by it from the jaws of death in a nights time after all hopes were past to the astonishment of all people the property of this most excellent necklace being to take off fevers fits convulsions loosnesses etc beyond expectation  these   books all by the author of the practical scheme are given gratis at the following places viz  up one pair of stairs between the rose
