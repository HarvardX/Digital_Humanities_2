the age of reason  price half a crown  the age of reason being an investigation of true and fabulous theology by thomas pain  secretary for foreign affairs to congress in the american war and author of the works entitled common sense and rights of man etc  paris printed by barrois        second year of the french republic  the age of reason being an investigation of true and of fabulous theology it has been my intention for several years past to publish my thoughts upon religion i am well aware of the difficulties that attend the subject and from that consideration had reserved it to a more advanced period of life i intended it to be the last offering i should make to my fellowcitizens of all nations and that at a time when the purity of the motive that induced me to it could not admit of a question even by those who might disapprove the work  the circumstance that has now taken place in france of the total abolition of the whole national order of priesthood and of every thing appertaining to compulsive systems of religion and compulsive articles of faith has not only precipitated my intention but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary lest in the general wreck of superstition of false systems of government and false theology we lose sight of morality of humanity and of the theology that is true  as several of my colleagues and others of my fellowcitizens of france have given me the example of making their voluntary and individual profession of faith i also will make mine and i do this with all that sincerity and frankness with which the mind of man communicates with itself  i believe in one god and no more and i hope for happiness beyond this life  i believe the equality of man and i believe that religious duties consist in doing justice loving mercy and endeavoring to make our fellow creatures happy  but lest it should be supposed that i believe many other things in addition to these i shall in the progress of this work declare the things i do not believe and my reasons for not believing them  i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church  all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit  i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe  it is impossible to calculate the moral mischief if i may so express it that mental lying has produced in society when a man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime he takes up the trade of a priest for the sake of gain and in order to qualify himself for that trade he begins with a perjury can we conceive any thing more destructive to morality than this  soon after i had published the pamphlet commonsense in america i saw the exceeding probability that a revolution in the system of government would be followed by a revolution in the system of religion the adulterous connection of church and state wherever it had taken place whether jewish christian or turkish had so effectually prohibited by pains and penalties every discussion upon established creeds and upon first principles of religion that until the system of government should be changed those subjects could not be brought fairly and openly before the world but that whenever this should be done a revolution in the system of religion would follow human inventions and priestcraft would be detected and man would return to the pure unmixed and unadulterated belief of one god and no more  every national church or religion has established itself by pretending some special mission from god communicated to certain individuals the jews have their moses the christians their jesus christ their apostles and saints and the turks their mahomet as if the way to god was not open to every man alike  each of those churches show certain books which they call revelation or the word of god the jews say that their word of god was given by god to moses face to face the christians say that their word of god came by divine inspiration and the turks say that their word of god the koran was brought by an angel from heaven each of those churches accuses the other of unbelief and for my own part i disbelieve them all  as it is necessary to affix right ideas to words i will before i proceed further into the subject offer some observations on the word revelation revelation when applied to religion means something communicated immediately from god to man  no one will deny or dispute the power of the almighty to make such a communication if he pleases but admitting for the sake of a case that something has been revealed to a certain person and not revealed to any other person it is revelation to that person only when he tells it to a second person a second to a third a third to a fourth and so on it ceases to be a revelation to all those persons it is revelation to the first person only and hearsay to every other and consequently they are not obliged to believe it  it is a contradiction in terms and ideas to call any thing a revelation that comes to us at second hand either verbally or in writing revelation is necessarily limited to the first communication after this it is only an account of something which that person says was a revelation made to him and though he may find himself obliged to believe it it cannot be incumbent on me to believe it in the same manner for it was not a revelation made to me and i have only his word for it that it was made to him  when moses told the children of israel that he received the two tables of the commandments from the hand of god they were not obliged to believe him because they had no other authority for it than his telling them so and i have no other authority for it than some historian telling me so the commandments carrying no internal evidence of divinity with them they contain some good moral precepts such as any man qualified to be a lawgiver or a legislator could produce himself without having recourse to supernatural intervention this is however necessary to except the declaration which says that god visits the sins of the fathers upon the children it is contrary to every principle of moral justice   when i am told that the koran was written in heaven and brought to mahomet by an angel the account comes to near the same kind of hearsay evidence and second hand authority as the former i did not see the angel myself and therefore i have a right not to believe it  when also i am told that a woman called the virgin mary said or gave out that she was with child without any cohabitation with a man and that her betrothed husband joseph said that an angel told him so i have a right to believe them or not such a circumstance required a much stronger evidence than their bare word for it but we have not even this for neither joseph nor mary wrote any such matter themselves it is only reported by others that they said so it is hearsay upon hearsay and i do not choose to rest my belief upon such evidence  it is however not difficult to account for the credit that was given to the story of jesus christ being the son of god he was born when the heathen mythology had still some fashion and repute in the world and that mythology had prepared the people for the belief of such a story almost all the extraordinary men that lived under the heathen mythology were reputed to be the sons of some of their gods it was not a new thing at that time to believe a man to have been celestially begotten the intercourse of gods with women was then a matter of familiar opinion their jupiter according to their accounts had cohabited with hundreds the story therefore had nothing in it either new wonderful or obscene it was conformable to the opinions that then prevailed among the people called gentiles or mythologists and it was those people only that believed it the jews who had kept strictly to the belief of one god and no more and who had always rejected the heathen mythology never credited the story  it is curious to observe how the theory of what is called the christian church sprung out of the tail of the heathen mythology a direct incorporation took place in the first instance by making the reputed founder to be celestially begotten the trinity of gods that then followed was no other than a reduction of the former plurality which was about twenty or thirty thousand the statue of mary succeeded the statue of diana of ephesus the deification of heroes changed into the cannonization of saints the mythologists had gods for every thing the christian mythologists had saints for every thing the church became as crowded with the one as the pantheon had been with the other and rome was the place of both the christian theory is little else than the idolatry of the ancient mythologists accommodated to the purposes of power and revenue and it yet remains to reason and philosophy to abolish the amphibious fraud  nothing that is here said can apply even with the most distant disrespect to the real character of jesus christ he was a virtuous and an amiable man the morality that he preached and practiced was of the most benevolent kind and though similar systems of morality had been preached by confucius and by some of the greek philosophers many years before by the quakers since and by many good men in all ages it has not been exceeded by any  jesus christ wrote no account of himself of his birth parentage or any thing else not a line of what is called the new testament is of his writing the history of him is altogether the work of other people and as to the account given of his resurrection and ascension it was the necessary counterpart to the story of his birth his historians having brought him into the world in a supernatural manner were obliged to take him out again in the same manner or the first part of the story must have fallen to the ground  the wretched contrivance with which this latter part is told exceeds every thing that went before it the first part that of the miraculous conception was not a thing that admitted of publicity and therefore the tellers of this part of the story had this advantage that though they might not be credited they could not be detected they could not be expected to prove it because it was not one of those things that admitted of proof and it was impossible that the person of whom it was told could prove it himself  but the resurrection of a dead person from the grave and his ascension through the air is a thing very different as to the evidence it admits of to the invisible conception of a child in the womb the resurrection and ascension supposing them to have taken place admitted of public and occular demonstration like that of the ascension of a balloon or the sun at noon day to all jerusalem at least a thing which every body is required to believe requires that the proof and evidence of it should be equal to all and universal and as the public visibility of this last related act was the only evidence that could give sanction to the former part the whole of it falls to the ground because that evidence never was given instead of this a small number of persons not more than eight or nine are introduced as proxies for the whole world to say they saw it and all the rest of the world are called upon to believe it but it appears that thomas did not believe the resurrection and as they say would not believe without having occular and manual demonstration himself so neither will i and the reason is equally as good for me and for every other person as for thomas  it is in vain to attempt to palliate or disguise this matter the story so far as relates to the supernatural part has every mark of fraud and imposition stamped upon the face of it who were the authors of it is as impossible for us now to know as it is for us to be assured that the books in which the account is related were written by the persons whose names they bear the best surviving evidence we now have respecting this affair is the jews they are regularly descended from the people who lived in the times this resurrection and ascension is said to have happened and they say it is not true it has long appeared to me a strange inconsistency to cite the jews as a proof of the truth of the story it is just the same as if a man were to say i will prove the truth of what i have told you by producing the people who say it is false  that such a person as jesus christ existed and that he was crucified which was the mode of execution at that day are historical relations strictly within the limits of probability he preached most excellent morality and the equality of man but he preached also against the corruptions and avarice of the jewish priests and this brought upon him the hatred and vengeance of the whole order of priesthood the accusation which those priests brought against him was that of sedition and conspiracy against the roman government to which the jews were then subject and tributary and it is not improbable that the roman government might have some secret apprehension of the effects of his doctrine as well as the jewish priests neither is it improbable that jesus christ had in contemplation the delivery of the jewish nation from the bondage of the romans between the two however this virtuous reformer and revolutionist lost his life  it is upon this plain narrative of facts together with another case i am going to mention that the christian mythologists calling themselves the christian church have erected their fable which for absurdity and extravagance is not exceeded by any thing that is to be found in the mythology of the ancients  the ancient mythologists tell that the race of giants made war against jupiter and that one of them threw an hundred rocks against him at one throw that jupiter defeated him with thunder and confined him afterward under mount etna and that every time the giant turns himself mount etna belches fire it is here easy to see that the circumstance of the mountain that of its being a volcano suggested the idea of the fable and that the fable is made to fit and wind itself up with that circumstance  the christian mythologists tell that their satan made war against the almighty who defeated him and confined him afterward not under a mountain but in a pit it is here easy to see that the first fable suggested the idea of the second for the fable of jupiter and the giants was told many hundred years before that of satan  thus far the ancient and the christian mythologists differ very little from each other but the latter have contrived to carry the matter much farther they have contrived to connect the fabulous part of the story of jesus christ with the fable originating from mount etna and in order to make all the parts of the story tie together they have taken to their aid the traditions of the jews for the christian mythology is made up partly from the ancient mythology and partly from the jewish traditions  the christian mythologists after having confined satan in a pit were obliged to let him out again to bring on the sequel of the fable he is then introduced into the garden of eden in the shape of a snake or a serpent and in that shape he enters into familiar conversation with eve who is no ways surprised to hear a snake talk and the issue of this teteatete is that he persuades her to eat an apple and the eating of that apple damns all mankind  after giving satan this triumph over the whole creation one would have supposed that the church mythologists would have been kind enough to send him back again to the pit or if they had not done this that they would have put a mountain upon him for they say that their faith can remove a mountain or have put him under a mountain as the former mythologists had done to prevent his getting again among the women and doing more mischief but instead of this they leave him at large without even obliging him to give his parole the secret of which is that they could not do without him and after being at the trouble of making him they bribed him to stay they promised him all the jews all the turks by anticipation ninetenths of the world beside and mahomet into the bargain after this who can doubt the bountifulness of the christian mythology  having thus made an insurrection and a battle in heaven in which none of the combatants could be either killed or wounded  put satan into the pit  let him out again  given him a triumph over the whole creation  damned all mankind by the eating of an apple these christian mythologists bring the two ends of their fable together they represent this virtuous and amiable man jesus christ to be at once both god and man and also the son of god celestially begotten on purpose to be sacrificed because they say that eve in her longing had eaten an apple  putting aside every thing that might excite laughter by its absurdity or detestation by its profaneness and confining ourselves merely to an examination of the parts it is impossible to conceive a story more derogatory to the almighty more inconsistent with his wisdom more contradictory to his power than this story is  in order to make for it a foundation to rise upon the inventors were under the necessity of giving to the being whom they call satan a power equally as great if not greater than they attribute to the almighty they have not only given him the power of liberating himself from the pit after what they call his fall but they have made that power increase afterward to infinity before this fall they represent him only as an angel of limited existence as they represent the rest after his fall he becomes by their account omnipresent he exists every where and at the same time he occupies the whole immensity of space  not content with this deification of satan they represent him as defeating by stratagem in the shape of an animal of the creation all the power and wisdom of the almighty they represent him as having compelled the almighty to the direct necessity either of surrendering the whole of the creation to the government and sovereignty of this satan or of capitulating for its redemption by coming down upon earth and exhibiting himself upon a cross in the shape of a man  had the inventors of this story told it the contrary way that is had they represented the almighty as compelling satan to exhibit himself on a cross in the shape of a snake as a punishment for his new transgression the story would have been less absurd less contradictory but instead of this they make the transgressor triumph and the almighty fall  that many good men have believed this strange fable and lived very good lives under that belief for credulity is not a crime is what i have no doubt of in the first place they were educated to believe it and they would have believed any thing else in the same manner there are also many who have been so enthusiastically enraptured by what they conceived to be the infinite love of god to man in making a sacrifice of himself that the vehemence of the idea has forbidden and deterred them from examining into the absurdity and profaneness of the story the more unnatural any thing is the more is it capable of becoming the object of dismal admiration  but if objects for gratitude and admiration are our desire do they not present themselves every hour to our eyes do we not see a fair creation prepared to receive us the instant we were born  a world furnished to our hands that cost us nothing is it we that light up the sun that pour down the rain and fill the earth with abundance whether we sleep or wake the vast machinery of the universe still goes on are these things and the blessings they indicate in future nothing to us can our gross feelings be excited by no other subjects than tragedy and suicide or is the gloomy pride of man become so intolerable that nothing can flatter it but a sacrifice of the creator  i know that this bold investigation will alarm many but it would be paying too great a compliment to their credulity to forbear it upon that account the times and the subject demand it to be done the suspicion that the theory of what is called the christian church is fabulous is becoming very extensive in all countries and it will be a consolation to men staggering under that suspicion and doubting what to believe and what to disbelieve to see the subject freely investigated i therefore pass on to an examination of the books called the old and the new testament  these books beginning with genesis and ending with revelations which by the bye is a book of riddles that requires a revelation to explain it are we are told the word of god it is therefore proper for us to know who told us so that we may know what credit to give to the report the answer to this question is that nobody can tell except that we tell one another so the case however historically appears to be as follows  when the church mythologists established their system they collected all the writings they could find and managed them as they pleased it is a matter altogether of uncertainty to us whether such of the writings as now appear under the name of the old and the new testament are in the same state in which those collectors say they found them or whether they added altered abridged or dressed them up  be this as it may they decided by vote which of the books out of the collection they had made should be the word of god and which should not they rejected several they voted others to be doubtful such as the books called the apocraphy and those books which had a majority of votes were voted to be the word of god had they voted otherwise all the people since calling themselves christians had believed otherwise for the belief of the one comes from the vote of the other who the people were that did all this we know nothing of they called themselves by the general name of the church and this is all we know of the matter  as we have no other external evidence or authority for believing those books to be the word of god than what i have mentioned which is no evidence or authority at all i come in the next place to examine the internal evidence contained in the books themselves  in the former part of this essay i have spoken of revelation i now proceed further with that subject for the purpose of applying it to the books in question  revelation is a communication of something which the person to whom that thing is revealed did not know before for if i have done a thing or seen it done it needs no revelation to tell me i have done it or seen it nor to enable me to tell it or to write it  revelation therefore cannot be applied to any thing done upon earth of which man is himself the actor or the witness and consequently all the historical and anecdotal part of the bible which is almost the whole of it is not within the meaning and compass of the word revelation and therefore is not the word of god  when samson ran off with the gateposts of gaza if he ever did so and whether he did or not is nothing to us or when he visited his delilah or caught his foxes or did any thing else what has revelation to do with these things if they were facts he could tell them himself or his secretary if he kept one could write them if they were worth either telling or writing and if they were fictions revelation could not make them true and whether true or not we are neither the better nor the wiser for knowing them  when we contemplate the immensity of that being who directs and governs the incomprehensible whole of which the utmost ken of human sight can discover but a part we ought to feel shame at calling such paltry stories the word of god  as to the account of the creation with which the book of genesis opens it has all the appearance of being a tradition which the israelites had among them before they came into egypt and after their departure from that country they put it at the head of their history without telling as it is most probable that they did not know how they came by it the manner in which the account opens shows it to be traditionary it begins abruptly it is nobody that speaks it is nobody that hears it is addressed to nobody it has neither first second nor third person it has every criterion of being a tradition it has no voucher moses does not take it upon himself by introducing it with the formality that he uses on other occasions such as that of saying the lord spoke unto moses saying  why it has been called the mosaic account of the creation i am at a loss to conceive moses i believe was too good a judge of such subjects to put his name to that account he had been educated among the egyptians who were a people as well skilled in science and particularly in astronomy as any people of their day and the silence and caution that moses observes in not authenticating the account is a good negative evidence that he neither told it nor believed it  the case is that every nation of people has been worldmakers and the israelites had as much right to set up the trade of worldmaking as any of the rest and as moses was not an israelite he might not choose to contradict the tradition the account however is harmless and this is more than can be said for many other parts of the bible  whenever we read the obscene stories the voluptuous debaucheries the cruel and torturous executions the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the bible is filled it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon than the word of god it is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind and for my own part i sincerely detest it as i detest every thing that is cruel  we scarcely meet with any thing a few phrases excepted but what deserves either our abhorrence or our contempt till we come to the miscellaneous parts of the bible in the anonymous publications the psalms and the book of job more particularly in the latter we find a great deal of elevated sentiment reverentially expressed of the power and benignity of the almighty but they stand on no higher rank than many other compositions on similar subjects as well before that time as since  the proverbs which are said to be solomons though most probably a collection because they discover a knowledge of life which his situation excluded him from knowing are an instructive table of ethics they are inferior in keenness to the proverbs of the spaniards and not more wise and oeconomical than those of the american franklin  all the remaining parts of the bible generally known by the name of the prophets are the works of the jewish poets and itinerant preachers who mixed poetry anecdote and devotion together and those works still retain the air and style of poetry though in translation as there are many readers who do not see that a composition is poetry unless it be in rhyme it is for their information that i add this note  poetry consists principally in two things imagery and composition the composition of poetry differs from that of prose in the manner of mixing long and short syllables together take a long syllable out of a line of poetry and put a short one in the room of it or put a long syllable where a short one should be and that line will lose its poetical harmony it will have an effect upon the line like that of misplacing a note in a song  the imagery in those books called the prophets appertains altogether to poetry it is fictitious and often extravagant and not admissible in any other kind of writing than poetry  to show that these writings are composed in poetical numbers i will take ten syllables as they stand in the book and make a line of the same number of syllables heroic measure that shall rhyme with the last word it will then be seen that the composition of those books is poetical measure the instance i shall first produce is from isaiah  hear o ye heavens and give ear o earth it is god himself that calls attention forth another instance i shall quote is from the mournful jeremiah to which i shall add two other lines for the purpose of carrying out the figure and showing the intention of the poet  o that mine head were waters and mine eyes were fountains flowing like the liquid skies then would i give the mighty flood release and weep a deluge for the human race    there is not throughout the whole book called the bible any word that describes to us what we call a poet nor any word that describes what we call poetry the case is that the word prophet to which later times have affixed a new idea was the bible word for poet and the word prophesying meant the art of making poetry it also meant the art of playing poetry to a tune upon any instrument of music  we read of prophesying with pipes tabrets and horns of prophesying with harps with psalteries with cymbals and with every other instrument of music then in fashion were we now to speak of prophesying with a fiddle or with a pipe and tabor the expression would have no meaning or would appear ridiculous and to some people contemptuous because we have changed the meaning of the word  we are told of saul being among the prophets and also that he prophesied but we are not told what they prophesied nor what he prophesied the case is there was nothing to tell for these prophets were a company of musicians and poets and saul joined in the concert and this was called prophesying  the account given of this affair in the book called samuel is that saul met a company of prophets a whole company of them coming down with a psaltery a tabret a pipe and a harp and that they prophesied and that he prophesied with them but it appears afterward that saul prophesied badly that is he performed his part badly for it is said that an evil spirit from god as those men who call themselves divines and commentators are very fond of puzzling one another i leave them to contest the meaning of the first part of the phrase that of an evil spirit of god i keep to my text i keep to the meaning of the word prophesy came upon saul and he prophesied  now were there no other passage in the book called the bible than this to demonstrate to us that we have lost the original meaning of the word prophesy and substituted another meaning in its place this alone would be sufficient for it is impossible to use and apply the word prophesy in the place it is here used and applied if we give to it the sense which later times have affixed to it the manner in which it is here used strips it of all religious meaning and shows that a man might then be a prophet or might prophesy as he may now be a poet or a musician without any regard to the morality or the immorality of his character the word was originally a term of science promiscuously applied to poetry and to music and not restricted to any subject upon which poetry and music might be exercised  deborah and barak are called prophets not because they predicted any thing but because they composed the poem or song that bears their name in celebration of an act already done david is ranked among the prophets for he was a musician and was also reputed to be though perhaps very erroneously the author of the psalms but abraham isaac and jacob are not called prophets it does not appear from any accounts we have that they could either sing play music or make poetry  we are told of the greater and the lesser prophets they might as well tell us of the greater and the lesser god for there cannot be degrees in prophesying consistently with its modern sense but there are degrees in poetry and therefore the phrase is reconcilable to the case when we understand by it the greater and the lesser poets  it is altogether unnecessary after this to offer any observations upon what those men styled prophets have written the axe goes at once to the root by showing that the original meaning of the word has been mistaken and consequently all the inferences that have been drawn from those books the devotional respect that has been paid to them and the labored commentaries that have been written upon them under that mistaken meaning are not worth disputing about  in many things however the writings of the jewish poets deserve a better fate than that of being bound up as they now are with the trash that accompanies them under the abused name of the word of god  if we permit ourselves to conceive right ideas of things we must necessarily affix the idea not only of unchangeableness but of the utter impossibility of any change taking place by any means or accident whatever in that which we would honor with the name of the word of god and therefore the word of god cannot exist in any written or human language  the continually progressive change to which the meaning of words is subject the want of an universal language which renders translations necessary the errors to which translations are again subject the mistakes of copyists and printers together with the possibility of wilful alteration are of themselves evidences that human language whether in speech or in print cannot be the vehicle of the word of god  the word of god exists in something else  did the book called the bible excel in purity of ideas and expression all the books that are now extant in the world i would not take it for my rule of faith as being the word of god because the possibility would nevertheless exist of my being imposed upon but when i see throughout the greatest part of this book scarcely any thing but a history of the grossest vices and a collection of the most paltry and contemptible tales i cannot dishonor my creator by calling it by his name  thus much for the bible i now go on to the book called the new testament the new testament that is the new will as if there could be two wills of the creator  had it been the object or the intention of jesus christ to establish a new religion he would undoubtedly have written the system himself or procured it to be written in his life time but there is no publication extant authenticated with his name all the books called the new testament were written after his death he was a jew by birth and by profession and he was the son of god in like manner that every other person is for the creator is the father of all  the first four books called matthew mark luke and john do not give a history of the life of jesus christ but only detached anecdotes of him it appears from these books that the whole time of his being a preacher was not more than eighteen months and it was only during this short time that those men became acquainted with him they make mention of him at the age of twelve years sitting they say among the jewish doctors asking and answering them questions as this was several years before their acquaintance with him began it is most probable they had this anecdote from his parents from this time there is no account of him for about sixteen years where he lived or how he employed himself during this interval is not known most probably he was working at his fathers trade which was that of a carpenter it does not appear that he had any school education and the probability is that he could not write for his parents were extremely poor as appears from their not being able to pay for a bed when he was born  it is somewhat curious that the three persons whose names are the most universally recorded were of very obscure parentage moses was a foundling jesus christ was born in a stable and mahomet was a mule driver the first and the last of these men were founders of different systems of religion but jesus christ founded no new system he called men to the practice of moral virtues and the belief of one god the great trait in his character is philanthropy  the manner in which he was apprehended shows that he was not much known at that time and it shows also that the meetings he then held with his followers were in secret and that he had given over or suspended preaching publicly judas could no otherways betray him than by giving information where he was and pointing him out to the officers that went to arrest him and the reason for employing and paying judas to do this could arise only from the causes already mentioned that of his not being much known and living concealed  the idea of his concealment not only agrees very ill with his reputed divinity but associates with it something of pusillanimity and his being betrayed or in other words his being apprehended on the information of one of his followers shows that he did not intend to be apprehended and consequently that he did not intend to be crucified  the christian mythologists tell us that christ died for the sins of the world and that he came on purpose to die would it not then have been the same if he had died of a fever or of the small pox of old age or of any thing else  the declaratory sentence which they say was passed upon adam in case he ate of the apple was not that thou shall surely be crucified but thou shall surely die the sentence was death and not the manner of dying crucifixion therefore or any other particular manner of dying made no part of the sentence that adam was to suffer and consequently even upon their own tactic it could make no part of the sentence that christ was to suffer in the room of adam a fever would have done as well as a cross if there was any occasion for either  this sentence of death which they tell us was thus passed upon adam must either have meant dying naturally that is ceasing to live or have meant what these mythologists call damnation and consequently the act of dying on the part of jesus christ must according to their system apply as a prevention to one or other of these two things happening to adam and to us  that it does not prevent our dying is evident because we all die and if their accounts of longevity be true men die faster since the crucifixion than before and with respect to the second explanation including with it the natural death of jesus christ as a substitute for the eternal death or damnation of all mankind it is impertinently representing the creator as coming off or revoking the sentence by a pun or a quibble upon the word death that manufacturer of quibbles st paul if he wrote the books that bear his name has helped this quibble on by making another quibble upon the word adam he makes there to be two adams the one who sins in fact and suffers by proxy the other who sins by proxy and suffers in fact a religion thus interlarded with quibble subterfuge and pun has a tendency to instruct its professors in the practice of these arts they acquire the habit without being aware of the cause  if jesus christ was the being which those mythologists tell us he was and that he came into this world to suffer which is a word they sometimes use instead of to die the only real suffering he could have endured would have been to live his existence here was a state of exilement or transportation from heaven and the way back to his original country was to die  in fine every thing in this strange system is the reverse of what it pretends to be it is the reverse of truth and i become so tired with examining into its inconsistencies and absurdities that i hasten to the conclusion of it in order to proceed to something better  how much or what parts of the books called the new testament were written by the persons whose names they bear is what we can know nothing of neither are we certain in what language they were originally written the matters they now contain may be classed under two heads anecdote and epistolary correspondence  the four books already mentioned matthew mark luke and john are altogether anecdotal they relate events after they had taken place they tell what jesus christ did and said and what others did and said to him and in several instances they relate the same event differently revelation is necessarily out of the question with respect to those books not only because of the disagreement of the writers but because revelation cannot be applied to the relating of facts by the persons who saw them done nor to the relating or recording of any discourse or conversation by those who heard it the book called the acts of the apostles an anonymous work belongs also to the anecdotal part  all the other parts of the new testament except the book of enigmas called the revelations are a collection of letters under the name of epistles and the forgery of letters has been such a common practice in the world that the probability is at least equal whether they are genuine or forged one thing however is much less equivocal which is that out of the matters contained in those books together with the assistance of some old stories the church has set up a system of religion very contradictory to the character of the person whose name it bears it has set up a religion of pomp and of revenue in pretended imitation of a person whose life was humility and poverty  the invention of a purgatory and of the releasing of souls therefrom by prayers bought of the church with money the selling of pardons dispensations and indulgences are revenue laws without bearing that name or carrying that appearance but the case nevertheless is that those things derive their origin from the proxysm of the crucifixion and the theory deduced therefrom which was that one person could stand in the place of another and could perform meritorious services for him the probability therefore is that the whole theory or doctrine of what is called the redemption which is said to have been accomplished by the act of one person in the room of another was originally fabricated on purpose to bring forward and build all those secondary and pecuniary redemptions upon and that the passages in the books upon which the idea or theory of redemption is built have been manufactured and fabricated for that purpose why are we to give this church credit when she tells us that those books are genuine in every part any more than we give her credit for every thing else she has told us or for the miracles she says she has performed that she could fabricate writings is certain because she could write and the composition of the writings in question is of that kind that any body might do it and that she did fabricate them is not more inconsistent with probability than that she should tell us as she has done that she could and did work miracles  since then no external evidence can at this long distance of time be produced to prove whether the church fabricated the doctrine called redemption or not for such evidence whether for or against would be subject to the same suspicion of being fabricated the case can only be referred to the internal evidence which the thing carries of itself and this affords a very strong presumption of its being a fabrication for the internal evidence is that the theory or doctrine of redemption has for its basis an idea of pecuniary justice and not that of moral justice  if i owe a person money and cannot pay him and he threatens to put me in prison another person can take the debt upon himself and pay it for me but if i have committed a crime every circumstance of the case is changed moral justice cannot take the innocent for the guilty even if the innocent would offer itself to suppose justice to do this is to destroy the principle of its existence which is the thing itself it is then no longer justice it is indiscriminate revenge  this single reflection will show that the doctrine of redemption is founded on a mere pecuniary idea corresponding to that of a debt which another person might pay and as this pecuniary idea corresponds again with the system of second redemptions obtained through the means of money given to the church for pardons the probability is that the same persons fabricated both the one and the other of those theories and that in truth there is no such thing as redemption that it is fabulous and that man stands in the same relative condition with his maker he ever did stand since man existed and that it is his greatest consolation to think so  let him believe this and he will live more consistently and morally than by any other system it is by his being taught to contemplate himself as an outlaw as an outcast as a beggar as a mumper as one thrown as it were on a dunghill at an immense distance from his creator and who must make his approaches by creeping and cringing to intermediate beings that he conceives either a contemptuous disregard for every thing under the name of religion or becomes indifferent or turns what he calls devout in the latter case he consumes his life in grief or the affectation of it his prayers are reproaches his humility is ingratitude he calls himself a worm and the fertile earth a dunghill and all the blessings of life by the thankless name of vanities he despises the choicest gift of god to man the gift of reason and having endeavored to force upon himself the belief of a system against which reason revolts he ungratefully calls it human reason as if man could give reason to himself  yet with all this strange appearance of humility and this contempt for human reason he ventures into the boldest presumptions he finds fault with every thing his selfishness is never satisfied his ingratitude is never at an end he takes on himself to direct the almighty what to do even in the government of the universe he prays dictatorially when it is sunshine he prays for rain and when it is rain he prays for sunshine he follows the same idea in every thing that he prays for for what is the amount of all his prayers but an attempt to make the almighty change his mind and act otherwise than he does it is as if he were to say  thou know not so well as i  but some perhaps will say are we to have no word of god  no revelation i answer yes there is a word of god there is a revelation  the word of god is the creation we behold and it is in this word which no human invention can counterfeit or alter that god speaks universally to man  human language is local and changeable and is therefore incapable of being used as the means of unchangeable and universal information the idea that god sent jesus christ to publish as they say the glad tidings to all nations from one end of the earth unto the other is consistent only with the ignorance of those who know nothing of the extent of the world and who believed as those worldsaviours believed and continued to believe for several centuries and that in contradiction to the discoveries of philosophers and the experience of navigators that the earth was flat like a trencher and that a man might walk to the end of it  but how was jesus christ to make any thing known to all nations he could speak but one language which was hebrew and there are in the world several hundred languages scarcely any two nations speak the same language or understand each other and as to translations every man who knows any thing of languages knows that it is impossible to translate from one language into another not only without losing a great part of the original but frequently of mistaking the sense and besides all this the art of printing was wholly unknown at the time christ lived  it is always necessary that the means that are to accomplish any end be equal to the accomplishment of that end or the end cannot be accomplished it is in this that the difference between finite and infinite power and wisdom discovers itself man frequently fails in accomplishing his end from a natural inability of the power to the purpose and frequently from the want of wisdom to apply power properly but it is impossible for infinite power and wisdom to fail as man fails the means it uses are always equal to the end but human language more especially as there is not an universal language is incapable of being used as an universal means of unchangeable and uniform information and therefore it is not the means that god uses in manifesting himself universally to man  it is only in the creation that all our ideas and conceptions of a word of god can unite the creation speaks an universal language independently of human speech or human language multiplied and various as they be it is an ever existing original which every man can read it cannot be forged it cannot be counterfeited it cannot be lost it cannot be altered it cannot be suppressed it does not depend upon the will of man whether it shall be published or not it publishes itself from one end of the earth to the other it preaches to all nations and to all worlds and this word of god reveals to man all that is necessary for man to know of god  do we want to contemplate his power we see it in the immensity of the creation do we want to contemplate his wisdom we see it in the unchangeable order by which the incomprehensible whole is governed do we want to contemplate his munificence we see it in the abundance with which he fills the earth do we want to contemplate his mercy we see it in his not withholding that abundance even from the unthankful in fine do we want to know what god is search not the book called the scripture which any human hand might make but the scripture called the creation  the only idea man can affix to the name of god is that of a first cause the cause of all things and incomprehensibly difficult as it is for man to conceive what a first cause is he arrives at the belief of it from the tenfold greater difficulty of disbelieving it it is difficult beyond description to conceive that space can have no end but it is more difficult to conceive an end it is difficult beyond the power of man to conceive an eternal duration of what we call time but it is more impossible to conceive a time when there shall be no time in like manner of reasoning every thing we behold carries in itself the internal evidence that it did not make itself every man is an evidence to himself that he did not make himself neither could his father make himself nor his grandfather nor any of his race neither could any tree plant or animal make itself and it is the conviction arising from this evidence that carries us on as it were by necessity to the belief of a first cause eternally existing of a nature totally different to any material existence we know of and by the power of which all things exist and this first cause man calls god  it is only by the exercise of reason that man can discover god take away that reason and he would be incapable of understanding any thing and in this case it would be just as consistent to read even the book called the bible to a horse as to a man how then is it that those people pretend to reject reason  almost the only parts in the book called the bible that convey to us any idea of god are some chapters in job and the   th psalm i recollect no other those parts are true deistical compositions for they treat of the deity through his works they take the book of creation as the word of god they refer to no other book and all the inferences they make are drawn from that volume  i insert in this place the   th psalm as paraphrased into english verse by addison i recollect not the prose and where i write this i have not the opportunity of seeing it  the spacious firmament on high with all the blue etherial sky and spangled heavens a shining frame their great original proclaim the unwearied sun from day to day does his creators power display and publishes to every land the work of an almighty hand soon as the evening shades prevail the moon takes up the wondrous tale and nightly to the listening earth repeats the story of her birth whilst all the stars that round her burn and all the planets in their turn confirm the tidings as they roll and spread the truth from pole to pole what though in solemn silence all move round this dark terrestrial ball what though no real voice nor sound amidst their radiant orbs be found in reasons ear they all rejoice and utter forth a glorious voice for ever singing as they shine the hand that made us is divine what more does man want to know than that the hand or power that made these things is divine is omnipotent let him believe this with the force it is impossible to repel if he permits his reason to act and his rule of moral life will follow of course  the allusions in job have all of them the same tendency with this psalm that of deducing or proving a truth that would be otherwise unknown from truths already known  i recollect not enough of the passages in job to insert them correctly but there is one that occurs to me that is applicable to the subject i am speaking upon can thou by searching find out god can thou find out the almighty to perfection  i know not how the printers have pointed this passage for i keep no bible but it contains two distinct questions that admits of distinct answers  first can thou by searching find out god yes because in the first place i know i did not make myself and yet i have existence and by searching into the nature of other things i find that no other thing could make itself and yet millions of other things exist therefore it is that i know by positive conclusion resulting from this search that there is a power superior to all those things and that power is god  secondly can thou find out the almighty to perfection no not only because the power and wisdom he has manifested in the structure of the creation that i behold is to me incomprehensible but because even this manifestation great as it is is probably but a small display of that immensity of power and wisdom by which millions of other worlds to me invisible by their distance were created and continue to exist  it is evident that both these questions were put to the reason of the person to whom they are supposed to have been addressed and it is only by admitting the first question to be answered affirmatively that the second could follow it would have been unnecessary and even absurd to have put a second question more difficult than the first if the first question had been answered negatively the two questions have different objects the first refers to the existence of god the second to his attributes reason can discover the one but it falls infinitely short in discovering the whole of the other  i recollect not a single passage in all the writings ascribed to the men called apostles that convey any idea of what god is those writings are chiefly controversial and the gloominess of the subject they dwell upon that of a man dying in agony on a cross is better suited to the gloomy genius of a monk in a cell by whom it is not impossible they were written than to any man breathing the open air of the creation the only passage that occurs to me that has any reference to the works of god by which only his power and wisdom can be known is related to have been spoken by jesus christ as a remedy against distrustful care behold the lilies of the field they toil not neither do they spin this however is far inferior to the allusions in job and in the nineteenth psalm but it is similar in idea and the modesty of the imagery is correspondent to the modesty of the man  as to the christian system of faith it appears to me as a species of atheism a sort of religious denial of god it professes to believe in a man rather than in god it is a compound made up chiefly of manism with but little deism and is as near to atheism as twilight is to darkness it introduces between man and his maker an opaque body which it calls a redeemer as the moon introduces her opaque self between the earth and the sun and it produces by this means a religious or an irreligious eclipse of light it has put the whole orbit of reason into shade  the effect of this obscurity has been that of turning every thing upside down and representing it in reverse and among the revolutions it has thus magically produced it has made a revolution in theology  that which is now called natural philosophy embracing the whole circle of science of which astronomy occupies the chief place is the study of the works of god and of the power and wisdom of god in his works and is the true theology  as to the theology that is now studied in its place it is the study of human opinions and of human fancies concerning god it is not the study of god himself in the works that he has made but in the works or writings that man has made and it is not among the least of the mischiefs that the christian system has done to the world that it has abandoned the original and beautiful system of theology like a beautiful innocent to distress and reproach to make room for the hag of superstition  the book of job and the   th psalm which even the church admits to be more ancient than the chronological order in which they stand in the book called the bible are theological orations conformable to the original system of theology the internal evidence of those orations proves to a demonstration that the study and contemplation of the works of creation and of the power and wisdom of god revealed and manifested in those works made a great part of the religious devotion of the times in which they were written and it was this devotional study and contemplation that led to the discovery of the principles upon which what are now called sciences are established and it is to the discovery of these principles that almost all the arts that contribute to the convenience of human life owe their existence every principal art has some science for its parent though the person who mechanically performs the work does not always and but very seldom perceive the connection  it is a fraud of the christian system to call the sciences human inventions it is only the application of them that is human every science has for its basis a system of principles as fixed and unalterable as those by which the universe is regulated and governed man cannot make principles he can only discover them  for example every person who looks at an almanac sees an account when an eclipse will take place and he sees also that it never fails to take place according to the account there given this shows that man is acquainted with the laws by which the heavenly bodies move but it would be something worse than ignorance were any church on earth to say that those laws are an human invention  it would also be ignorance or something worse to say that the scientific principles by the aid of which man is enabled to calculate and foreknow when an eclipse will take place are an human invention man cannot invent any thing that is eternal and immutable and the scientific principles he employs for this purpose must and are of necessity as eternal and immutable as the laws by which the heavenly bodies move or they could not be used as they are to ascertain the time when and the manner how an eclipse will take place  the scientific principles that man employs to obtain the foreknowledge of an eclipse or of any thing else relating to the motion of the heavenly bodies are contained chiefly in that part of science that is called trigonometry or the properties of a triangle which when applied to the study of the heavenly bodies is called astronomy when applied to direct the course of a ship on the ocean it is called navigation when applied to the construction of figures drawn by a rule and compass it is called geometry when applied to the construction of plans of edifices it is called architecture when applied to the measurement of any portion of the surface of the earth it is called landsurveying in fine it is the soul of science it is an eternal truth it contains the mathematical demonstration of which man speaks and the extent of its uses are unknown  it may be said that man can make or draw a triangle and therefore a triangle is an human invention  but the triangle when drawn is no other than the image of the principle it is a delineation to the eye and from thence to the mind of a principle that would otherwise be imperceptible the triangle does not make the principle any more than a candle taken into a room that was dark makes the chairs and tables that before were invisible all the properties of a triangle exist independently of the figure and existed before any triangle was drawn or thought of by man man had no more to do in the formation of those properties or principles than he had to do in making the laws by which the heavenly bodies move and therefore the one must have the same divine origin as the other  in the same manner as it may be said that man can make a triangle so also may it be said he can make the mechanical instrument called a lever but the principle by which the lever acts is a thing distinct from the instrument and would exist if the instrument did not it attaches itself to the instrument after it is made the instrument therefore can act no otherwise than it does act neither can all the effort of human invention make it act otherwise that which in all such cases man calls the effect is no other than the principle itself rendered perceptible to the senses  since then man cannot make principles from whence did he gain a knowledge of them so as to be able to apply them not only to things on earth but to ascertain the motion of bodies so immensely distant from him as all the heavenly bodies are from whence i ask could he gain that knowledge but from the study of the true theology  it is the structure of the universe that has taught this knowledge to man that structure is an ever existing exhibition of every principle upon which every part of mathematical science is founded the offspring of this science is mechanics for mechanics is no other than the principles of science applied practically the man who proportions the several parts of a mill uses the same scientific principles as if he had the power of constructing an universe but as he cannot give to matter that invisible agency by which all the component parts of the immense machine of the universe have influence upon each other and act in motional unison together without any apparent contact and to which man has given the name of attraction gravitation and repulsion he supplies the place of that agency by the humble imitation of teeth and cogs all the parts of mans microcosm must visibly touch but could he gain a knowledge of that agency so as to be able to apply it in practice we might then say that another canonical book of the word of god had been discovered  if man could alter the properties of the lever so also could he alter the properties of the triangle for a lever taking that sort of lever which is called a steelyard for the sake of explanation forms when in motion a triangle the line it descends from one point of that line being in the fulcrum the line it descends to and the chord of the arc which the end of the lever describes in the air are the three sides of a triangle the other arm of the lever describes also a triangle and the corresponding sides of those two triangles calculated scientifically or measured geometrically and also the sines tangents and secants generated from the angles and geometrically measured have the same proportions to each other as the different weights have that will balance each other on the lever leaving the weight of the lever out of the case  it may also be said that man can make a wheel and axis that he can put wheels of different magnitudes together and produce a mill still the case comes back to the same point which is that he did not make the principle that gives the wheels those powers that principle is as unalterable as in the former cases or rather it is the same principle under a different appearance to the eye  the power that two wheels of different magnitudes have upon each other is in the same proportion as if the semidiameter of the two wheels were joined together and made into that kind of lever i have described suspended at the part where the semidiameters join for the two wheels scientifically considered are no other than the two circles generated by the motion of the compound lever  it is from the study of the true theology that all our knowledge of science is derived and it is from that knowledge that all the arts have originated  the almighty lecturer by displaying the principles of science in the structure of the universe has invited man to study and to imitation it is as if he had said to the inhabitants of this globe that we call ours i have made an earth for man to dwell upon and i have rendered the starry heavens visible to teach him science and the arts he can now provide for his own comfort and learn from my munificence to all to be kind to each other  of what use is it unless it be to teach man something that his eye is endowed with the power of beholding to an incomprehensible distance an immensity of worlds revolving in the ocean of space or of what use is it that this immensity of worlds is visible to man what has man to do with the pleiades with orion with sirius with the star he calls the north star with the moving orbs he has named saturn jupiter mars venus and mercury if no uses are to follow from their being visible a less power of vision would have been sufficient for man if the immensity he now possesses were given only to waste itself as it were on an immense desert of space glittering with shows  it is only by contemplating what he calls the starry heavens as the book and school of science that he discovers any use in their being visible to him or any advantage resulting from his immensity of vision but when he contemplates the subject in this light he sees an additional motive for saying that nothing was made in vain for in vain would be this power of vision if it taught man nothing  as the christian system of faith has made a revolution in theology so also has it made a revolution in the state of learning that which is now called learning was not learning originally learning does not consist as the schools now make it consist in the knowledge of languages but in the knowledge of things to which language gives names  the greeks were a learned people but learning with them did not consist in speaking greek any more than in a romans speaking latin or a frenchmans speaking french or an englishmans speaking english from what we know of the greeks it does not appear that they knew or studied any language but their own and this was one cause of their becoming so learned it afforded them more time to apply themselves to better studies the schools of the greeks were schools of science and philosophy and not of languages and it is in the knowledge of the things that science and philosophy teach that learning consists  almost all the scientific learning that now exists came to us from the greeks or the people who spoke the greek language it therefore became necessary to the people of other nations who spoke a different language that some among them should learn the greek language in order that the learning the greeks had might be made known in those nations by translating the greek books of science and philosophy into the mother tongue of each nation  the study therefore of the greek language and in the same manner for the latin was no other than the drudgery business of a linguist and the language thus obtained was no other than the means or as it were the tools employed to obtain the learning the greeks had it made no part of the learning itself and was so distinct from it as to make it exceeding probable that the persons who had studied greek sufficiently to translate those works such for instance as euclids elements did not understand any of the learning the works contained  as there is now nothing new to be learned from the dead languages all the useful books being already translated the languages are become useless and the time expended in teaching and in learning them is wasted so far as the study of languages may contribute to the progress and communication of knowledge for it has nothing to do with the creation of knowledge it is only in the living languages that new knowledge is to be found and certain it is that in general a youth will learn more of a living language in one year than of a dead language in seven and it is but seldem that the teacher knows much of it himself the difficulty of learning the dead languages does not arise from any superior abstruseness in the languages themselves but in their being dead and the pronunciation entirely lost it would be the same thing with any other language when it becomes dead the best greek linguist that now exists does not understand greek so well as a grecian plowman did or a grecian milkmaid and the same for the latin compared with a plowman or a milkmaid of the romans and with respect to pronunciation and idiom not so well as the cows that she milked it would therefore be advantageous to the state of learning to abolish the study of the dead languages and to make learning consist as it originally did in scientific knowledge  the apology that is sometimes made for continuing to teach the dead languages is that they are taught at a time when a child is not capable of exerting any other mental faculty than that of memory but this is altogether erroneous the human mind has a natural disposition to scientific knowledge and to the things connected with it the first and favorite amusement of a child even before it begins to play is that of imitating the works of man it builds houses with cards or sticks it navigates the little ocean of a bowl of water with a paper boat or dams the stream of a gutter and contrives something which it calls a mill and it interests itself in the fate of its works with a care that resembles affection it afterward goes to school where its genius is killed by the barren study of a dead language and the philosopher is lost in the linguist  but the apology that is now made for continuing to teach the dead languages could not be the cause at first of cutting down learning to the narrow and humble sphere of linguistry the cause therefore must be sought for elsewhere in all researches of this kind the best evidence that can be produced is the internal evidence the thing carries with itself and the evidence of circumstances that unites with it both of which in this case are not difficult to be discovered  putting then aside as matter of distinct consideration the outrage offered to the moral justice of god by supposing him to make the innocent suffer for the guilty and also the loose morality and low contrivance of supposing him to change himself into the shape of a man in order to make an excuse to himself for not executing his supposed sentence upon adam putting i say those things aside as matter of distinct consideration it is certain that what is called the christian system of faith including in it the whimsical account of the creation the strange story of eve the snake and the apple the amphibious idea of a mangod the corporeal idea of the death of a god the mythological idea of a family of gods and the christian system of arithmetic that three are one and one is three are all irreconcilable not only to the divine gift of reason that god has given to man but to the knowledge that man gains of the power and wisdom of god by the aid of the sciences and by studying the structure of the universe that god has made  the setters up therefore and the advocates of the christian system of faith could not but foresee that the continually progressive knowledge that man would gain by the aid of science of the power and wisdom of god manifested in the structure of the universe and in all the works of creation would militate against and call into question the truth of their system of faith and therefore it became necessary to their purpose to cut learning down to a size less dangerous to their project and this they effected by restricting the idea of learning to the dead study of dead languages  they not only rejected the study of science out of the christian schools but they persecuted it and it is only within about the last two centuries that the study has been revived so late as    0 galileo a florentine discovered and introduced the use of telescopes and by applying them to observe the motions and appearances of the heavenly bodies afforded additional means for ascertaining the true structure of the universe instead of being esteemed for these discoveries he was sentenced to renounce them or the opinions resulting from them as a damnable heresy and prior to that time vigilius was condemned to be burned for asserting the antipodes or in other words that the earth was a globe and habitable in every part where there was land yet the truth of this is now too well known even to be told  if the belief of errors not morally bad did no mischief it would make no part of the moral duty of man to oppose and remove them there was no moral ill in believing the earth was flat like a trencher any more than there was moral virtue in believing it was round like a globe neither was there any moral ill in believing that the creator made no other world than this any more than there was moral virtue in believing that he made millions and that the infinity of space is filled with worlds but when a system of religion is made to grow out of a supposed system of creation that is not true and to unite itself therewith in a manner almost inseparable therefrom the case assumes an entirely different ground it is then that errors not morally bad become fraught with the same mischiefs as if they were it is then that the truth though otherwise indifferent itself becomes an essential by becoming the criterion that either confirms by corresponding evidence or denies by contradictory evidence the reality of the religion itself in this view of the case it is the moral duty of man to obtain every possible evidence that the structure of the heathens or any other part of creation affords with respect to systems of religion but this the supporters or partisans of the christian system as if dreading the result incessantly opposed and not only rejected the sciences but persecuted the professors had newton or descartes lived three or four hundred years ago and pursued their studies as they did it is most probable they would not have lived to finish them and had franklin drawn lightning from the clouds at the same time it would have been at the hazard of expiring for it in flames  latter times have laid all the blame upon the goths and vandals but however unwilling the partisans of the christian system may be to believe or to acknowledge it it is nevertheless true that the age of ignorance commenced with the christian system there was more knowledge in the world before that period than for many centuries afterward and as to religious knowledge the christian system as already said was only another species of mythology and the mythology to which it succeeded was a corruption of an ancient system of theism it is impossible for us now to know at what time the heathen mythology began but it is certain from the internal evidence that it carries that it did not begin in the same state or condition in which it ended all the gods of that mythology except saturn were of modern invention the supposed reign of saturn was prior to that which is called the heathen mythology and was so far a species of theism that it admitted the belief of only one god saturn is supposed to have abdicated the government in favor of his three sons and one daughter jupiter pluto neptune and juno after this thousands of other gods and demigods were imaginarily created and the calendar of gods increased as fast as the calendar of saints and the calendar of courts have increased since  all the corruptions that have taken place in theology and in religion have been produced by admitting of what man calls revealed religion the mythologists pretended to more revealed religion than the christians do they had their oracles and their priests who were supposed to receive and deliver the word of god verbally on almost all occasions  since then all corruptions down from moloch to modern predestinarianism and the human sacrifices of the heathens to the christian sacrifice of the creator have been produced by admitting what is called revealed religion the most effectual means to prevent all such evils and impositions and is not to admit of any other revelation than that which is manifested in the book of creation and to contemplate the creation as the only true and real word of god that ever did or ever will exist and that every thing else called the word of god is fable and imposition     it is owing to this long interregnum of science and to no other cause that we have now to look back through a vast chasm of many hundred years to the respectable characters we call the ancients had the progression of knowledge gone on proportionably with the stock that before existed that chasm would have been filled up with characters rising superior in knowledge to each other and those ancients we now so much admire would have appeared respectably in the back ground of the scene but the christian system laid all waste and if we take our stand about the beginning of the sixteenth century we look back through that long chasm to the times of the ancients as over a vast sandy desert in which not a shrub appears to intercept the vision to the fertile hills beyond  it is an inconsistency scarcely possible to be credited that any thing should exist under the name of a religion that held it to be irreligious to study and contemplate the structure of the universe that god had made but the fact is too well established to be denied the event that served more than any other to break the first link in this long chain of despotic ignorance is that known by the name of the reformation by luther from that time though it does not appear to have made any part of the intention of luther or of those who are called reformers the sciences began to revive and liberality their natural associate began to appear this was the only public good the reformation did for with respect to religious good it might as well not have taken place the mythology still continued the same and a multiplicity of national popes grew out of the downfall of the pope of christendom  having thus shown from the internal evidence of things the cause that produced a change in the state of learning and the motive for substituting the study of the dead languages in the place of the sciences i proceed in addition to the several observations already made in the former part of this work to compare or rather to confront the evidence that the structure of the universe affords with the christian system of religion but as i cannot begin this part better than by referring to the ideas that occurred to me at an early part of life and which i doubt not have occurred in some degree to almost every other person at one time or other i shall state what those ideas were and add thereto such other matter as shall arise out of the subject giving to the whole by way of preface a short introduction  my father being of the quaker profession it was my good fortune to have an exceedingly good moral education and a tolerable stock of useful learning though i went to the grammar school the same school thetford in norfolk that the present counselor mingay went to and under the same master i did not learn latin not only because i had no inclination to learn languages but because of the objection the quakers have against the books in which the language is taught but this did not prevent me from being acquainted with the subjects of all the latin books used in the school  the natural bent of my mind was to science i had some turn and i believe some talent for poetry but this i rather repressed than encouraged as leading too much into the field of imagination as soon as i was able i purchased a pair of globes and attended the philosophical lectures of martin and ferguson and became afterward acquainted with dr bevis of the society called the royal society then living in the temple and an excellent astronomer  i had no disposition for what was called politics it presented to my mind no other idea than is contained in the word jockeyship when therefore i turned my thoughts toward matters of government i had to form a system for myself that accorded with the moral and philosophic principles in which i had been educated i saw or at least i thought i saw a vast scene opening itself to the world in the affairs of america and it appeared to me that unless the americans changed the plan they were then pursuing with respect to the government of england and declare themselves independent they would not only involve themselves in a multiplicity of new difficulties but shut out the prospect that was then offering itself to mankind through their means it was from these motives that i published the work known by the name of common sense which is the first work i ever did publish and so far as i can judge of myself i believe i never should have been known in the world as an author on any subject whatever had it not been for the affairs of america i wrote common sense the latter end of the year      and published it the first of january      independence was declared the fourth of july following  any person who has made observations on the state and progress of the human mind by observing his own cannot but have observed that there are two distinct classes of what are called thoughts those that we produce in ourselves by reflection and the act of thinking and those that bolt into the mind of their own accord i have always made it a rule to treat those voluntary visitors with civility taking care to examine as well as i was able if they were worth entertaining and it is from them i have acquired almost all the knowledge that i have as to the learning that any person gains from school education it serves only like a small capital to put him in the way of beginning learning for himself afterward every person of learning is finally his own teacher the reason of which is that principles being of a distinct quality to circumstances cannot be impressed upon the memory their place of mental residence is the understanding and they are never so lasting as when they begin by conception thus much for the introductory part  from the time i was capable of conceiving an idea and acting upon it by reflection i either doubted the truth of the christian system or thought it to be a strange affair i scarcely new which it was but i well remember when about seven or eight years of age hearing a sermon read by a relation of mine who was a great devotee of the church upon the subject of what is called redemption by the death of the son of god after the sermon was ended i went into the garden and as i was going down the garden steps for i perfectly recollect the spot i revolted at the recollection of what i had heard and thought to myself that it was making god almighty act like a passionate man that killed his son when he could not revenge himself any other way and as i was sure a man would be hanged that did such a thing i could not see for what purpose they preached such sermons this was not one of those kind of thoughts that had any thing in it of childish levity it was to me a serious reflection arising from the idea i had that god was too good to do such an action and also too almighty to be under any necessity of doing it i believe in the same manner to this moment and i moreover believe that any system of religion that has any thing in it that shocks the mind of a child cannot be a true system  it seems as if parents of the christian profession were ashamed to tell their children any thing about the principles of their religion they sometimes instruct them in morals and talk to them of the goodness of what they call providence for the christian mythology has five deities there is god the father god the son god the holy ghost the god providence and the goddess nature but the christian story of god the father putting his son to death or employing people to do it for that is the plain language of the story cannot be told by a parent to a child and to tell him that it was done to make mankind happier and better is making the story still worse as if mankind could be improved by the example of murder and to tell him that all this is a mystery is only making an excuse for the incredibility of it  how different is this to the pure and simple profession of deism the true deist has but one deity and his religion consists in contemplating the power wisdom and benignity of the deity in his works and in endeavoring to imitate him in every thing moral scientifical and mechanical  the religion that approaches the nearest of all others to true deism in the moral and benign part thereof is that professed by the quakers but they have contracted themselves too much by leaving the works of god out of their system though i reverence their philanthropy i cannot help smiling at the conceit that if the taste of a quaker could have been consulted at the creation what a silent and drabcoloured creation it would have been not a flower would have blossomed its gaities nor a bird been permitted to sing  quitting these reflections i proceed to other matters after i had made myself master of the use of the globes and of the orrery as this book may fall into the hands of persons who do not know what an orrery is it is for their information i add this note as the name gives no idea of the uses of the thing the orrery has its name from the person who invented it it is a machinery of clockwork representing the universe in miniature and in which the revolution of the earth round itself and round the sun the revolution of the moon round the earth the revolution of the planets round the sun their relative distances from the sun as the center of the whole system their relative distances from each other and their different magnitudes are represented as they really exist in what we call the heavens and conceived an idea of the infinity of space and of the eternal divisibility of matter and obtained at least a general knowledge of what is called natural philosophy i began to compare or as i have before said to confront the internal evidence those things afford with the christian system of faith  though it is not a direct article of the christian system that this world that we inhabit is the whole of the habitable creation yet it is so worked up therewith from what is called the mosaic account of the creation the story of eve and the apple and the counterpart of that story the death of the son of god that to believe otherwise that is to believe that god created a plurality of worlds at least as numerous as what we call stars renders the christian system of faith at once little and ridiculous and scatters it in the mind like feathers in the air the two beliefs cannot be held together in the same mind and he who thinks that he believes both has thought but little of either  though the belief of a plurality of worlds was familiar to the ancients it is only within the last three centuries that the extent and dimensions of this globe that we inhabit have been ascertained several vessels following the tract of the ocean have sailed entirely round the world as a man may march in a circle and come round by the contrary side of the circle to the spot he set out from the circular dimensions of our world in the widest part as a man would measure the widest round of an apple or a ball is only twenty five thousand and twenty english miles reckoning sixty nine miles and an half to an equatorial degree and may be sailed round in the space of about three years allowing a ship to sail on an average three miles in an hour she would sail entirely round the world in less than one year if she could sail in a direct circle but she is obliged to follow the course of the ocean   a world of this extent may at first thought appear to us to be great but if we compare it with the immensity of space in which it is suspended like a bubble or a balloon in the air it is infinitely less in proportion than the smallest grain of sand is to the size of the world or the finest particle of dew to the whole ocean and is therefore but small and as will be hereafter shown is only one of a system of worlds of which the universal creation is composed  it is not difficult to gain some faint idea of the immensity of space in which this and all the other worlds are suspended if we follow a progression of ideas when we think of the size or dimensions of a room our ideas limit themselves to the walls and there they stop but when our eye or our imagination darts into space that is when it looks upward into what we call the open air we cannot conceive any walls or boundaries it can have and if for the sake of resting our ideas we suppose a boundary the question immediately renews itself and asks what is beyond that boundary and in the same manner what is beyond the next boundary and so on till the fatigued imagination returns and says there is no end certainly then the creator was not pent for room when he made this world no larger than it is and we have to seek the reason in something else  if we take a survey of our own world or rather of this of which the creator has given us the use as our portion in the immense system of creation we find every part of it the earth the waters and the air that surround it filled and as it were crowded with life down from the largest animals that we know of to the smallest insects the naked eye can behold and from thence to others still smaller and totally invisible without the assistance of the microscope every tree every plant every leaf serves not only as an habitation but as a world to some numerous race till animal existence becomes so exceedingly refined that the effluvia of a blade of grass would be food for thousands  since then no part of our earth is left unoccupied why is it to be supposed that the immensity of space is a naked void lying in eternal waste there is room for millions of worlds as large or larger than ours and each of them millions of miles apart from each other  having now arrived at this point if we carry our ideas only one thought further we shall see perhaps the true reason at least a very good reason for our happiness why the creator instead of making one immense world extending over an immense quantity of space has preferred dividing that quantity of matter into several distinct and separate worlds which we call planets of which our earth is one but before i explain my ideas upon this subject it is necessary not for the sake of those that already know but for those who do not to show what the system of the universe is  that part of the universe that is called the solar system meaning the system of worlds to which our earth belongs and of which sol or in english language the sun is the center consists besides the sun or six distinct orbs or planets or worlds besides the secondary bodies called the satellites or moons of which our earth has one that attends her in her annual revolution round the sun in like manner as the other satellites or moons attend the planets or worlds to which they severally belong as may be seen by the assistance of the telescope  the sun is the center round which those six worlds or planets revolve at different distances therefrom and in circles concentric to each other each world keeps constantly in nearly the same tract round the sun and continues at the same time turning round itself in nearly an upright position as a top turns round itself when it is spinning on the ground and leans a little sideways  it is this leaning of the earth    degrees that occasions summer and winter and the different length of days and nights if the earth turned round itself in a position perpendicular to the plane or level of the circle it moves in round the sun as a top turns round when it stands erect on the ground the days and nights would be always of the same length twelve hours day and twelve hours night and the season would be uniformly the same throughout the year  every time that a planet our earth for example turns round itself it makes what we call day and night and every time it goes entirely round the sun it makes what we call a year consequently our world turns three hundred and sixtyfive times round itself in going once round the sun those who supposed that the sun went round the earth every twentyfour hours made the same mistake in idea that a cook would do in fact that should make the fire go round the meat instead of the meat turning round itself toward the fire   the names that the ancients gave to those six worlds and which are still called by the same names are mercury venus this world that we call ours mars jupiter and saturn they appear larger to the eye than the stars being many million miles nearer to our earth than any of the stars are the planet venus is that which is called the evening star and sometimes the morning star as she happens to set after or rise before the sun which in either case is never more than three hours  the sun as before said being the center the planet or world nearest the sun is mercury his distance from the sun is thirtyfour million miles and he moves round in a circle always at that distance from the sun as a top may be supposed to spin round in the tract in which a horse goes in a mill the second world is venus she is fiftyseven million miles distant from the sun and consequently moves round in a circle much greater than that of mercury the third world is this that we inhabit and which is eightyeight million miles distant from the sun and consequently moves round in a circle greater than that of venus the fourth world is mars he is distant from the sun one hundred and thirtyfour million miles and consequently moves round in a circle greater than that of our earth the fifth is jupiter he is distant from the sun five hundred and fiftyseven million miles and consequently moves round in a circle greater than that of mars the sixth world is saturn he is distant from the sun seven hundred and sixtythree million miles and consequently moves round in a circle that surrounds the circles or orbits of all the other worlds or planets  the space therefore in the air or in the immensity of space that our solar system takes up for the several worlds to perform their revolutions in round the sun is of the extent in a strait line of the whole diameter of the orbit or circle in which saturn moves round the sun which being double his distance from the sun is fifteen hundred and twentysix million miles and its circular extent is nearly five thousand million and its globical content is almost three thousand five hundred million times three thousand five hundred million square miles if it should be asked how can man know these things i have one plain answer to give which is that man knows how to calculate an eclipse and also how to calculate to a minute of time when the planet venus in making her revolutions round the sun will come in a strait line between our earth and the sun and will appear to us about the size of a large pea passing across the face of the sun this happens but twice in about an hundred years at the distance of about eight years from each other and has happened twice in our time both of which were foreknown by calculation it can also be known when they will happen again for a thousand years to come or to any other portion of time as therefore man could not be able to do those things if he did not understand the solar system and the manner in which the revolutions of the several planets or worlds are performed the fact of calculating an eclipse or a transit of venus is a proof in point that the knowledge exists and as to a few thousand or even a few million miles more or less it makes scarcely any sensible difference in such immense distances   but this immense as it is is only one system of worlds beyond this at a vast distance into space far beyond all power of calculation are the stars called the fixed stars they are called fixed because they have no revolutionary motion as the six worlds or planets have that i have been describing those fixed stars continue always at the same distance from each other and always in the same place as the sun does in the center of our system the probability therefore is that each of those fixed stars is also a sun round which another system of worlds or planets though too remote for us to discover performs its revolutions as our system of worlds does round our central sun  by this easy progression of ideas the immensity of space will appear to us to be filled with systems of worlds and that no part of space lies at waste any more than any part of our globe of earth and water is left unoccupied  having thus endeavored to convey in a familiar and easy manner some idea of the structure of the universe i return to explain what i before alluded to namely the great benefits arising to man in consequence of the creator having made a plurality of worlds such as our system is consisting of a central sun and six worlds besides satellites in preference to that of creating one world only of a vast extent  it is an idea i have never lost sight of that all our knowledge of science is derived from the revolutions exhibited to our eye and from thence to our understanding which those several planets or worlds of which our system is composed make in their circuit round the sun  had then the quantity of matter which these six worlds contain been blended into one solitary globe the consequence to us would have been that either no revolutionary motion would have existed or not a sufficiency of it to give us the ideas and the knowledge of science we now have and it is from the sciences that all the mechanical arts that contribute so much to our earthly felicity and comfort are derived  as therefore the creator made nothing in vain so also must it be believed that he organized the structure of the universe in the most advantageous manner for the benefit of man and as we see and from experience feel the benefits we derive from the structure of the universe formed as it is which benefits we should not have had the opportunity of enjoying if the structure so far as relates to our system had been a solitary globe we can discover at least one reason why a plurality of worlds has been made and that reason calls forth the devotional gratitude of man as well as his admiration  but it is not to us the inhabitants of this globe only that the benefits arising from a plurality of worlds are limited the inhabitants of each of the worlds of which our system is composed enjoy the same opportunities of knowledge as we do they behold the revolutionary motions of our earth as we behold theirs all the planets revolve in sight of each other and therefore the same universal school of science presents itself to all  neither does the knowledge stop here the system of worlds next to us exhibits in its revolutions the same principles and school of science to the inhabitants of their system as our system does to us and in like manner throughout the immensity of space  our ideas not only of the almightiness of the creator but of his wisdom and his beneficence become enlarged in proportion as we contemplate the extent and the structure of the universe the solitary idea of a solitary world rolling or at rest in the immense ocean of space gives place to the cheerful idea of a society of worlds so happily contrived as to administer even by their motion instruction to man we see our own earth filled with abundance but we forget to consider how much of that abundance is owing to the scientific knowledge the vast machinery of the universe has unfolded  but in the midst of those reflections what are we to think of the christian system of faith that forms itself upon the idea of only one world and that of no greater extent as is before shown than twenty five thousand miles an extent which a man walking at the rate of three miles an hour for twelve hours in the day could he keep on in a circular direction would walk entirely round in less than two years alas what is this to the mighty ocean of space and the almighty power of the creator  from whence then could arise the solitary and strange conceit that the almighty who had millions of worlds equally dependent on his protection should quit the care of all the rest and come to die in our world because they say one man and one woman had eaten an apple and on the other hand are we to suppose that every world in the boundless creation had an eve an apple a serpent and a redeemer in this case the person who is irreverently called the son of god and sometimes god himself would have nothing else to do than to travel from world to world in an endless succession of death with scarcely a momentary interval of life  it has been by rejecting the evidence that the word or works of god in the creation affords to our senses and the action of our reason upon that evidence that so many wild and whimsical systems of faith and of religion have been fabricated and set up there may be many systems of religion that so far from being morally bad are in many respects morally good but there can be but one that is true and that one necessarily must as it ever will be in all things consistent with the ever existing word of god that we behold in his works but such is the strange construction of the christian system of faith that every evidence the heavens affords to man either directly contradicts it or renders it absurd  it is possible to believe and i always feel pleasure in encouraging myself to believe it that there have been men in the world who persuaded themselves that what is called a pious fraud might at least under particular circumstances be productive of some good but the fraud being once established could not afterward be explained for it is with a pious fraud as with a bad action it begets a calamitous necessity of going on  the persons who first preached the christian system of faith and in some measure combined with it the morality preached by jesus christ might persuade themselves that it was better than the heathen mythology that then prevailed from the first preachers the fraud went on to the second and to the third till the idea of its being a pious fraud became lost in the belief of its being true and that belief came again encouraged by the interest of those who made a livelihood by preaching it  but though such a belief might by such means be rendered almost general among the laity it is next to impossible to account for the continual persecution carried on by the church for several hundred years against the sciences and against the professors of science if the church had not some record or some tradition that it was originally no other than a pious fraud or did not foresee that it could not be maintained against the evidence that the structure of the universe afforded  having thus shown the irreconcilable inconsistencies between the real word of god existing in the universe and that which is called the word of god as shown to us in a printed book that any man might make i proceed to speak of the three principal means that have been employed in all ages and perhaps in all countries to impose upon mankind  those three means are mystery miracle and prophecy the two first are incompatible with true religion and the third ought always to be suspected  with respect to mystery every thing we behold is in one sense a mystery to us our own existence is a mystery the whole vegetable world is a mystery we cannot account how it is that an acorn when put into the ground is made to develop itself and become an oak we know not how it is that the seed we sow unfolds and multiplies itself and returns to us such an abundant interest for so small a capital  the fact however as distinct from the operating cause is not a mystery because we see it and we know also the means we are to use which is no other than putting the seed in the ground we know therefore as much as is necessary for us to know and that part of the operation that we do not know and which if we did we could not perform the creator takes upon himself and performs it for us we are therefore better off than if we had been let into the secret and left to do it for ourselves  but though every created thing is in this sense a mystery the word mystery cannot be applied to moral truth any more than obscurity can be applied to light the god in whom we believe is a god of moral truth and not a god of mystery or obscurity mystery is the antagonist of truth it is a fog of human invention that obscures truth and represents it in distortion truth never invelops itself in mystery and the mystery in which it is at any time enveloped is the work of its antagonist and never of itself  religion therefore being the belief of a god and the practice of moral truth cannot have connection with mystery the belief of a god so far from having any thing of mystery in it is of all beliefs the most easy because it arises to us as is before observed out of necessity and the practice of moral truth or in other words a practical imitation of the moral goodness of god is no other than our acting toward each other as he acts benignly toward all we cannot serve god in the manner we serve those who cannot do without such service and therefore the only idea we can have of serving god is that of contributing to the happiness of the living creation that god has made this cannot be done by retiring ourselves from the society of the world and spending a recluse life in selfish devotion  the very nature and design of religion if i may so express it prove even to demonstration that it must be free from every thing of mystery and unincumbered with every thing that is mysterious religion considered as a duty is incumbent upon every living soul alike and therefore must be on a level to the understanding and comprehension of all man does not learn religion as he learns the secrets and mysteries of a trade he learns the theory of religion by reflection it arises out of the action of his own mind upon the things which he sees or upon what he may happen to hear or to read and the practice joins itself thereto  when men whether from policy or pious fraud set up systems of religion incompatible with the word or works of god in the creation and not only above but repugnant to human comprehension they were under the necessity of inventing or adopting a word that should serve as a bar to all questions inquiries and speculations the word mystery answered this purpose and thus it has happened that religion which in itself is without mystery has been corrupted into a fog of mysteries  as mystery answered all general purposes miracle followed as an occasional auxiliary the former served to bewilder the mind the latter to puzzle the senses the one was the lingo the other the legerdemain  but before going further into this subject it will be proper to inquire what is to be understood by a miracle  in the same sense that every thing may be said to be a mystery so also may it be said that every thing is a miracle and that no one thing is a greater miracle than another the elephant though larger is not a greater miracle than a mite nor a mountain a greater miracle than an atom to an almighty power it is no more difficult to make the one than the other and no more difficult to make a million of worlds than to make one every thing therefore is a miracle in one sense whilst in the other sense there is no such thing as a miracle it is a miracle when compared to our power and to our comprehension it is not a miracle compared to the power that performs it but as nothing in this description conveys the idea that is affixed to the word miracle it is necessary to carry the inquiry further  mankind have conceived to themselves certain laws by which what they call nature is supposed to act and that a miracle is something contrary to the operation and effect of those laws but unless we know the whole extent of those laws and of what are commonly called the powers of nature we are not able to judge whether any thing that may appear to us wonderful or miraculous be within or be beyond or be contrary to her natural power of acting  the ascension of a man several miles high into the air would have every thing in it that constitutes the idea of a miracle if it were not known that a species of air can be generated several times lighter than the common atmospheric air and yet possess elasticity enough to prevent the balloon in which that light air is enclosed from being compressed into as many times less bulk by the common air that surrounds it in like manner extracting flashes or sparks of fire from the human body as visibly as from a steel struck with a flint and causing iron or steel to move without any visible agent would also give the idea of a miracle if we were not acquainted with electricity and magnetism so also would many other experiments in natural philosophy to those who are not acquainted with the subject the restoring persons to life who are to appearance dead as is practiced upon drowned persons would also be a miracle if it were not known that animation is capable of being suspended without being extinct  besides these there are performances by slight of hand and by persons acting in concert that have a miraculous appearance which when known are thought nothing of and besides these there are mechanical and optical deceptions there is now an exhibition in paris of ghosts or specter which though it is not imposed upon the spectators as a fact has an astonishing appearance as therefore we know not the extent to which either nature or art can go there is no positive criterion to determine what a miracle is and mankind in giving credit to appearances under the idea of their being miracles are subject to be continually imposed upon  since then appearances are so capable of deceiving and things not real have a strong resemblance to things that are nothing can be more inconsistent than to suppose that the almighty would make use of means such as are called miracles that would subject the person who performed them to the suspicion of being an impostor and the person who related them to be suspected of lying and the doctrine intended to be supported thereby to be suspected as a fabulous invention  of all the modes of evidence that ever were invented to obtain belief to any system or opinion to which the name of religion has been given that of miracle however successful the imposition may have been is the most inconsistent for in the first place whenever recourse is had to show for the purpose of procuring that belief for a miracle under any idea of the word is a show it implies a lameness or weakness in the doctrine that is preached and in the second place it is degrading the almighty into the character of a showman playing tricks to amuse and make the people stare and wonder it is also the most equivocal sort of evidence that can be set up for the belief is not to depend upon the thing called a miracle but upon the credit of the reporter who says that he saw it and therefore the thing were it true would have no better chance of being believed than if it were a lie  suppose i were to say that when i sat down to write this book a hand presented itself in the air took up the pen and wrote every word that is herein written would any body believe me certainly they would not would they believe me a whit the more if the thing had been a fact certainly they would not since then a real miracle were it to happen would be subject to the same fate as the falsehood the inconsistency becomes the greater of supposing the almighty would make use of means that would not answer the purpose for which they were intended even if they were real  if we are to suppose a miracle to be something so entirely out of the course of what is called nature that she must go out of that course to accomplish it and we see an account given of such miracle by the person who said he saw it it raises a question in the mind very easily decided which is is it more probable that nature should go out of her course or that a man should tell a lie we have never seen in our time nature go out of her course but we have good reason to believe that millions of lies have been told in the same time it is therefore at least millions to one that the reporter of a miracle tells a lie  the story of the whale swallowing jonah though a whale is large enough to do it borders greatly on the mavelous but it would have approached nearer to the idea of a miracle if jonah had swallowed the whale in this which may serve for all cases of miracles the matter would decide itself as before stated namely is it more probable that a man should have swallowed a whale or told a lie  but supposing that jonah had really swallowed the whale and gone with it in his belly to nineveh and to convince the people that it was true have cast it up in their sight of the full length and size of a whale would they not have believed him to have been the devil instead of a prophet or if the whale had carried jonah to nineveh and cast him up in the same public manner would they not have believed the whale to have been the devil and jonah one of his imps  the most extraordinary of all the things called miracles related in the new testament is that of the devil flying away with jesus christ and carrying him to the top of a high mountain and to the top of the highest pinnacle of the temple and showing him and promising to him all the kingdoms of the world how happened it that he did not discover america or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any interest  i have too much respect for the moral character of christ to believe that he told this whale of a miracle himself neither is it easy to account for what purpose it could have been fabricated unless it were to impose upon the connoisseurs of miracles as is sometimes practiced upon the connoisseurs of queen annes farthings and collectors of relics and antiquities or to render the belief of miracles ridiculous by outdoing miracle as don quixote outdid chivalry or to embarrass the belief of miracles by making it doubtful by what power whether of god or of the devil any thing called a miracle was performed it requires however a great deal of faith in the devil to believe this miracle  in every point of view in which those things called miracles can be placed and considered the reality of them is improbable and their existence unnecessary they would not as before observed answer any useful purpose even if they were true for it is more difficult to obtain belief to a miracle than to a principle evidently moral without any miracle moral principle speaks universally for itself miracle could be but a thing of the moment and seen but by a few after this it requires a transfer of faith from god to man to believe a miracle upon mans report instead therefore of admitting the recitals of miracles as evidence of any system of religion being true they ought to be considered as symptoms of its being fabulous it is necessary to the full and upright character of truth that it rejects the crutch and it is consistent with the character of fable to seek the aid that truth rejects thus much for mystery and miracle  as mystery and miracle took charge of the past and the present prophecy took charge of the future and rounded the tenses of faith it was not sufficient to know what had been done but what would be done the supposed prophet was the supposed historian of times to come and if he happened in shooting with a long bow of a thousand years to strike within a thousand miles of a mark the ingenuity of posterity could make it point blank and if he happened to be directly wrong it was only to suppose as in the case of jonah and nineveh that god had repented himself and changed his mind what a fool do fabulous systems make of man  it has been shown in a former part of this work that the original meaning of the words prophet and prophesying has been changed and that a prophet in the sense the word is now used is a creature of modern invention and it is owing to this change in the meaning of the words that the flights and metaphors of the jewish poets and phrases and expressions now rendered obscure by our not being acquainted with the local circumstances to which they applied at the time they were used have been erected into prophecies and made to bend to explanations at the will and whimsical conceits of sectaries expounders and commentators every thing unintelligible was prophetical and every thing insignificant was typical a blunder would have served for a prophecy and a dishclout for a type  if by a prophet we are to suppose a man to whom the almighty communicated some event that would take place in future either there were such men or there were not if there were it is consistent to believe that the event so communicated would be told in terms that could be understood and not related in such a loose and obscure manner as to be out of the comprehension of those that heard it and so equivocal as to fit almost any circumstance that might happen afterward it is conceiving very irreverently of the almighty to suppose he would deal in this jesting manner with mankind yet all the things called prophecies in the book called the bible come under this description  but it is with prophecy as it is with miracle it could not answer the purpose even if it were real those to whom a prophecy should be told could not tell whether the man prophesied or lied or whether it had been revealed to him or whether he conceited it and if the thing that he prophesied or pretended to prophesy should happen or something like it among the multitude of things that are daily happening nobody could again know whether he foreknew it or guessed at it or whether it was accidental a prophet therefore is a character useless and unnecessary and the safe side of the case is to guard against being imposed upon by not giving credit to such relations  upon the whole mystery miracle and prophecy are appendages that belong to fabulous and not to true religion they are the means by which so many lo here is and lo there is have been spread about the world and religion been made into a trade the success of one impostor gave encouragement to another and the quieting salvo of doing some good by keeping up a pious fraud protected them from remorse  having now extended the subject to a greater length than i first intended i shall bring it to a close by abstracting a summary from the whole  first that the idea or belief of a word of god existing in print or in writing or in speech is inconsistent in itself for the reasons already assigned these reasons among many others are the want of an universal language the mutability of language the errors to which translations are subject the possibility of totally suppressing such a word the probability of altering it or of fabricating the whole and imposing it upon the world  secondly that the creation we behold is the real and ever existing word of god in which we cannot be deceived it proclaims his power it demonstrates his wisdom it manifests his goodness and beneficence  thirdly that the moral duty of man consists in imitating the moral goodness and beneficence of god manifested in the creation toward all his creatures that seeing as we daily do the goodness of god to all men it is an example calling upon all men to practice the same toward each other and consequently that every thing of persecution and revenge between man and man and every thing of cruelty to animals is a violation of moral duty  i trouble not myself about the manner of future existence i content myself with believing even to positive conviction that the power that gave me existence is able to continue it in any form and manner he pleases either with or without this body and it appears more probable to me that i shall continue to exist hereafter than that i should have had existence as i now have before that existence began  it is certain that in one point all nations of the earth and all religions agree all believe in a god the things in which they disagree are the redundancies annexed to
