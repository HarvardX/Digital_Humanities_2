madam since i am allowed the honor and privilege of so easy access to your royal highness i dare say i shall not be the worse received for bringing ovid along with me he comes from banishment to the fautress of liberty from the barbarous to the polite and has this to recommend him which never fails with a clemency like yours he is unfortunate  your royal highness who feels for every one has lately been the mournful occasion of a like sensibility in many others scarce an eye that did not tell the danger you were in even parties thodifferent in principles united at that time in their grief and affectionate concern for an event of so much consequence to the interest of humanity and virtue whilst your self was the only person then unmoved  it was remarkable that she who with a manner most engaging taught the innocent pleasures to appear more desirable than the criminal who was every day the life of some new agreeable diversion should behave her self upon that cruel trial with a magnanimity so unshaken that those who were witnesses might have imagined she scarce ever had done any thing but study how to dye  it is the greatest happiness can attend an age under a long depravation of morals to be blessed with examples where virtue is set off by the advantage of birth such qualifications when united do not only persuade an imitation but command it humane nature is always more affected by what it sees than what it hears of and as those ideas which enter by the eye find the surest passage to the heart so the more the object whatever it be seems desirable to the one the longer it continues in the other  there are perfections so shining that one must be the very worst of mortals or the very best not to admire in all those who possess them to be blessed with a disposition to charity not confined by any other limits than the modesty of those who ask it to know and be ready to excuse faults yet so strict in life as not to want the like indulgence to have a superiority of genius capable of judging of the highest affairs and an application so observant as to penetrate into the most minute to be easy to lay down grandeur upon familiar occasions and discerning to take it up when dignity of station requires to know the politer languages of the present age as a native and the greater occurrences and periods of the past as an historian make up a character which is so obvious that every one will know where to apply it except the person whose it really is and if in this your royal highness be at a loss i think it is the only thing within the province of your sex you are ignorant of  i shall take up no more of your time in this dedication because to do every thing that may be most acceptable to you shall always be the endeavor of  madam your royal highnesss most humble and most obedient servant s garth  preface the method i propose in writing this preface is to take notice of some of the beauties of the metamorphoses and also of the faults and particular affectations after which i shall proceed to hint at some rules for translation in general and shall give a short account of the following version  i shall not pretend to impose my opinion on others with the magisterial authority of a critic but only take the liberty of discovering my own taste i shall endeavor to show our poets redundance of wit justness of comparisons elegance of descriptions and peculiar delicacy in touching every circumstance relating to the passions and affections and with the same impartiality and frankness i shall confess the too frequent puerilities of his luxuriant fancy and the too great negligence of his sometimes unlabored versification  i am not of an opinion too common to translators to think that one is under an obligation to extol every thing he finds in the author he undertakes i am sure one is no more obliged to do so than a painter is to make every face that sits to him handsome it is enough if he sets the best features he finds in their full and most advantageous light but if the poet has private deformities though goodbreeding will not allow to expose him naked yet surely there can be no reason to recommend him as the most finished model of harmony and proportion  whoever has this undistinguishing complaisance will not fail to vitiate the taste of the readers and misguide many of them in their judgment where to approve and where to censure  it must be granted that where there appears an infinite variety of inimitable excellencies it would be too harsh and disingenuous to be severe on such faults as have escaped rather through want of leisure and opportunity to correct than through the erroneous turn of a depraved judgment how sensible ovid himself was of the uncorrectness of the metamorphoses appears from these lines prefixed before some of the editions by the care of his commentators trist el vi orba parente suo quicunque volumina tangis his saltem veslra detur in urbe locus quoque magis saveas non sunt haec edita ab illo sed quasi de domini funere rapta sui quicquid in his igitur vilii rude carmen habebit emendaturus si licuisses erat   since therefore the readers are not solemnly invited to an entertainment but come accidentally they ought to be contented with what they find and pray what have they to complain of but too great variety where though some of the dishes be not served in the exactest order and politeness but hashd up in haste there are a great many accommodated to every particular palate  to like every thing shows too little delicacy and to like nothing too much difficulty so great is the variety of this poem that the reader who is never pleased will appear as monstrous as he that is always so here are the hurries of battles for the hero tender emotions of soul for the lover a search and penetration into nature for the philosopher fluency of numbers and most expressive figures for the poet morals for the serious and plaisantries for admirers of points of wit  it is certain a poet is more to be suspected for saying too much than too little to add is often hazardous but to retrench commonly judicious if our author instead of saying all he could had only said all he should daphne had done well to fly from the god of wit in order to crown his poet thus ovid had been more honored and adored in his exile than augustus in his triumphs  i shall now attempt to give some instances of the happiness and vast extent of our authors imagination i shall not proceed according to the order of the poem but rather transcribe some lines here and there as my reflection shall suggest  nec circumsuso pendebat in aere tellus ponderibus librata suis  thus was the state of nature before the creation and here it is obvious that ovid had a discerning notion of the gravitation of bodies it is now demonstrated that every part of matter tends to every part of matter with a force which is always in a direct simple proportion of the quantity of the matter and an inverse duplicate proportion of the distance which tendency or gravitating is constant and universal this power whatever it be acting always proportionably to the solid content of bodies and never in any proportion to their superficies cannot be explained by any material impulse for the laws of impulse are physically necessary there can be no  or arbitrary principle in mere matter its parts cannot move unless they be moved and cannot do otherwise when pressed on by other parts in motion and therefore it is evident from the following lines that ovid strictly adhered to the opinion of the most discerning philosophers who taught that all things were formed by a wise and intelligent mind  jussit and extendi campos subsidere valles fronde tegi sylvas  the fiat of the hebrew lawgiver is not more sublime than the jussit of the latin poet who goes on in the same elevated and philosophical style  his super imposuit liquidum and gravitate carentem aethera  here the author spreads a thin veil of ether over his infant creation and though his asserting the upper region to be void of gravitation may not in a mathematical rigor be true yet it is found from the natural enquities made since and especially from the learned dr hallys discourse on the barometer that if on the surface of the earth an inch of quicksilver in the tube be equal to a cylinder of air of  00 foot it will be at a miles height equal to a cylinder of air of   00000 and therefore the air at so great a distance from the earth must be rarified to so great a degree that the space it fills must bear a very small proportion to that which is entirely void of matter  i think we may be confident from what already appears as well as from what our author has writ on the roman feasts that he could not be totally ignorant of astronomy some of the critics would insinuate from the following lines that he mistook the annual motion of the sun for the diurnal  met b   sectus in obliquum  though the sun be always in one or other of the signs of the zodiac and never goes by either motion more northward or southward than is here described yet phaeton being designed to drive the chariot but one day ought to have been directed in the equator or a circle parallel to it and not round the other oblique one of the ecliptic a degree of which and that by a motion contrary to the diurnal he was obliged to go in that length of time  i am inclined to think that ovid had so great an attention to poetical embelishments that he voluntarily declined a strict observance of any astronomical system for though that science was far from being neglected in former ages yet the progress which was made in it by no means equaled that of our present time  lucretius though in other things most penetrating describes the sun scarce bigger than he appears to the eye  nec nimio solis major rota nec minor ardor esse potest nostris quam sensibus esse videtur and homer imagining the seats of the gods above the fixed stars represents the falling of vulcan from thence to the isle of lemnos to continue during a whole day   b     the greek poet aims here to give a surprising idea of the height of the celestial mansions but if the computation of a modern astronomer be true they are at so much a greater distance that vulcan would have been more years in falling than he was minutes  but least i should exceed the usual length of a preface i shall now give some instances of the propriety of our authors similes and epithets the perspicuity of his allegories the instructive excellence of the morals the peculiar happy turn of his fancy and shall begin with the elegance of his descriptions  met b    madidis notus evolat alis terribilem picea tectus caligine vultum barba gravis nimbis canis fluit unda capillis front sedent nebulae rorant pennaeque sinusque  sternuntur segetes and deplorata coloni vota jacent longique labor perit irritus anni these lines introduce those of the deluge which are also very poetical and worthy to be compared with the next concerning the golden age   sine militis usu mollia securae peragebant otia gentes ipsa quoque immunis rastroque intacta nec ullis saucia vomeribus per se dabat omnia tellus contentique cibis nullo cogente creatis arbuteos foetus montanaque sraga legebant et quae deciderant patula jovis arbore glandes ver erat aeternum placidique tepentibus auris mulcebant zephyri natos sine semine flores virgil has also touched upon the same subject in the end of the second georgick  aureus hanc vitam in terris saturnus agebat nec dum etiam audierant inflari classica nec dum impositos duris crepitare incudibus enses and again aen b s l     primus ab aetherio venit saturnus olympo  aurea quae perhibent illo sub rege suerunt saecula sic placida populos in pace regebat   some of the lines a little foreign to the present subject are omitted but i shall make the most admirable author amends by transcribing at length his next description it is of a stag which gave the first occasion to the war betwixt the trojans and the rutulians i choose this because my design is to have these two great poets seen together where the subject happens to be almost the same though the nature of the poems be very different  aen b   l     cervus erat sorma praestanti and cornibus ingens tyrreidae pueri quem matris ab ubere raptum nutribant tyrrheusque pater cui regia parent armenta and late custodia credita campi assuetum imperiis soror omni sylvia cura mollibus intexens ornabat cornua sertis pectebatque ferum puroque in font lavabat ille manum patiens mensaeque assuetus herili errabat sylvis  the image which ovid gives of the favorite stag slain accidentally by cyparissus seems not of less dignity  ingens cervus erat lateque patentibus altas ipse suo capiti praebebat cornibus umbras cornua fulgebant auro demissaque in armos pendebant tereti gemmata monilia collo bulla super frontem parvis argentea loris vincta movebatur parilique ex

cyparisse tibi tu pabula cervum ad nova tu liquidi ducebas fontis ad undam  tu modo texebas varios per cornua flores nunc eques in tergo residens huc latus and illuc mollia purpureis fraenabas ora capistris in the following lines ovid describes the watery court of the river peneus which the reader may compare with virgils subterranean grott of cyrene the naiad mother to aristaeus  met b r est nemus haemoniae praerupta quod undique claudit silva vocant tempe per quae peneus ab imo effusus pindo spumosis volvitur undis dejectuque gravi tenues agitantia sumos nubila conducit summasque

lucosque sonantes ibat and ingenti motu stupefactus aquarum omnia sub magna labentia flumina terra spectabat diversa locis phasimque lycumque et caput unde altus primum se erumpit enipeus unde pater tiberinus and unde aniena fluenta et gemina auratus taurino cornua vultu eridanus quo non alius per pinguia culta in mare purpureum violentior influit amnis the divine poet goes on in pomp of numbers and easy magnificence of words till he introduces the story of orpheus and euridice in the narration of which he is as much superior to ovid as the reeds of his own mantuan shepherds are less musical than the lyre of orpheus  that i may not be too long on this article i shall recommend to the reader ovids admirable description of sleep  est prope cimmerios  met b    that of hunger  est locus extremis scythiae  b   that of the plague  dira lues  b   that of fame  orb locus medio est  b       virgil has also touched on the two last in the one he had lucretius in view in the other homer and i think it will not be to the disadvantage of our author to appear at the same time  there are many other descriptions scattered in the metamorphoses which for just expression of nature and majestic modulation of words are only inferior to those already transcribed as they are shorter which makes the objection that his diction is commonly loytring into prose a great deal too severe  the metamorphoses must be considered as is observed before very uncorrect and virgils works as finished though his own modesty would not allow the aeneids to be so it seems it was harder for him to please himself than his readers his judgment was certainly great nor was his vivacity of imagination less for the first without the last is too heavy and like a dress without fancy and the last without the first is too gay and but all trimming  our authors similitudes are next to be considered which are always remarkably short and convey some pleasing idea to the imagination it is in this branch of the poem that he has discovered as just a judgment as any of the classicks whatever poets to give a loose to a warm fancy are generally too apt not only to expatiate in their similes but introduce them too frequently by doing the first they detain the attention too long from the principal narration and by the latter they make too frequent breaches in the unity of the poem  those two errors ovid has most discerningly avoided how short and significant are generally his comparisons he fails not in these to keep a stiff rein on a highmettled pegasus and takes care not to surfeit here as he has done on other heads by an erroneous abundance  his similes are thicker sown by much in the fable of salmacis and hermaphroditus than in any other book but always short  the nymph clasps the youth close to her breast and both insensibly grow one  met b    velut si quis conducto cortice ramos crescendo jungi pariterque adolescere cernat again as atlanta reddens in the race with hppomenes  met b  0 inque puellari corpus candore ruborem traxerat haud aliter quam cum super atria velum candida purpureum simulatas inficit umbras philomelas tongue seemed to move after it was cut out by tereus  b   utque salire solet mutilatae cauda colubrae palpitat  cadmus sows the dragons teeth and the sons of the earth rise gradually  b   inde fide majus glebae cepere moveri primaque de sulcis acies apparuit hastae tegmina mox capitum picto nutantia cono mox humeri pectusque  sic ubi tolluntur festis aulaea theatris surgere signa solent primumque ostendere vultum caetera paulatim placidoque educta tenore tota patent imoque pedes in margin ponunt the objection to ovid that he never knows when to give over is too manifest though he frequently expatiates on the same thought in different words yet in his similes that exuberance is avoided there is in them all a simplicity and a confinement to the present object always a fecundity of fancy but rarely an intemperance nor do i remember he has erred above once by an illjudgd superfluity after he has described the labyrinth built by daedalus he compares it thus b   non secus ac liquidus phrygiis maenandros in arvis ludit and ambiguo lapsu refluitque sluitque et nunc ad sontes nunc ad mare versus apertum incertas exercet aquas    he should have ended at the close of the second line as virgil should have done at the end of the fourth in his noble simile where dido proceeds to the temple with her court about her  aen b   qualis in eurotae ripis aut per juga cynthi exercet diana choros quam mill secutae hinc atque hinc glomerantur oreades illa pharetram fert humero gradiensque deas supereminet omnes latonae tacitum pertentant gaudia pectus i see no reason for the last line though the poet be justly celebrated for a most consummate judgment yet by an endeavor to imitate homers similes he is not only very long but by introducing several circumstances he fails of an applicable relation betwixt the principal subject and his new ideas he sometimes thinks fit to work into the piece some differing embroidery which though very rich yet makes at best but glorious patchwork i really believe his excellent poem had not been the less so if in this article he had thought fit to have walked on in his own regular and majestic grace rather than have been hurried forward through broken byways by his blind guide  i shall transcribe one of his similes which is not culled out but exactly of the same texture with all the rest in the four last books of the aeneids  turnus leaps in fury from his chariot aen b    l     ac veluti montis saxum de vertice praeceps cum ruit avulsum vento seu turbidus imber proluit aut annis solvit sublapsa vetustas fertur in abruptum magno mons improbus actu exultatque solo sylvas armenta virosque involvens secum    it does not seem to be at all material whether the rock was blown or washed down by wind or rain or undermined by time  but to return to ovid the reader may take notice how unforced his compliments and how natural his transitions generally are with how much ease does he slide into some new circumstance without any violation of the unity of the story the texture is so artful that it may be compared to the work of his own arachne where the shade dies so gradually and the light revives so imperceptibly that it is hard to tell where the one ceases and the other begins  when he is going off from the story of apollo and daphne how happily does he introduce a compliment to the roman conquerors  met b   et conjux quoniam mea non potes esse arbor eris certe  tu ducibus laetis aderis cum laeta triumphum vox canet and longae visent capitolia pompae postibus augustis eadem fidissima custos ante sores stabis mediamque tuebere quercum he compliments augustus upon the assassination of julius and by way of simile takes the opportunity from the horror that the barbarity of lycaon gave   sic cum manus impia saevit sanguine caesareo romanum extinguere nomen etc julius is deifyd and looks down on his adopted son  b     natique videns benesacta fatetur esse suis majora and vinci gaudet ab illo and immediately follows  hic sua praeferri quanquam vetat acta paternis libera fama tamen nullisque obnoxia jussis invitum praefert    the author in the two first lines shows the affectionate condescension of the father in the three last the pious gratitude of the son  the compliments to augustus are very frequent in the last book of the metamorphoses as those to the same emperor are in the georgicks of virgil which also strike the imagination by their agreeable flattery  g   haec super arvorum cultu pecorumque canebam et super arboribus caesar dum magnus ad altum fulminat euphratem bello victorque volentes per populos dat jura viamque affectat olympo again on julius aen b   imperium oceano famam qui terminet astris julius    the compliments have a great sublimity and worthy of the grandeur of the heroes and the wit of the poet  ovid as much deserves praise for saying a great deal in a little as censure for saying a little in a great deal none of the classick poets had the talent of expressing himself with more force and perspicuity  phaeton desires some pledge of his fathers tenderness and asks to be trusted with his chariot he answers b   pignora certa petis do pignora certa timendo   however the latter complies with his importunity the consequence is fatal the world is set on fire even the rivers feel the force of the conflagration the tagus boyls  fluit ignibus aurum   the nile retreats occuluit que caput quod adhuc latet    zanthus is parched up arsurusque iterum zanthus    the poets fancy is here full of energy as well as in the following lines apollo courts daphne and promises himself success but is disappointed quodque cupit sperat suaque illum oracula sallunt   and again  the river achelous combats hercules and assumes several shapes in vain then puts on at last that of a snake the hero smiles in contempt cunarum labor est angues superare mearum   ovid never excells himself so much as when he takes occasion to touch upon the passion of love all hearts are in a manner sensible of the same emotions and like instruments tuned unisons if a string of any one of them be struck the rest by consent vibrate  procris is jealous of cephalus she endeavors to be confirmed in her fears but hopes the contrary  speratque miserrima falli   the next is not less natural  sed cuncta timemus amantes   biblis is in love with caunus the struggle is betwixt her unlawful flame and her honor  she is all confusion at the thoughts of discovering her passion   miserere fatentis amorem   she attempts to write incipit and dubitat scribit damnatque tabellas et notat and delet mutat culpatque probatque   in the end inclination as it does always gets the better of discretion  this last fable shows how touchingly the poet argues in love affairs as well as those of medea and scylla the two last are left by their heroes and their reflections are very natural and affecting ovid seemed here to have had virgils passion of dido in his eye but with this difference the one had conversed much with ladies and knew they loved to talk a great deal the other considered no less what was natural for them to say than what became them to say  virgil has through the whole management of this rencounter discovered a most finished judgment aeneas like other men likes for convenience and leaves for greater dido like other ladies resents the neglect enumerates the obligations the lover is under upbraids him with ingratitude threatens him with revenge then by and by submits begs for compassion and has recourse to tears  it appears from this piece that virgil was a discerning master in the passion of love and they that consider the spirit and turn of that inimitable line  qui bavium non odit  cannot doubt but he had an equal talent for satyr  nor does the genius of ovid more exert on the subject of love than on all others in the contention of ajax ulysses his elocution is most nervous and persuading where he endeavors to dissuade mankind from indulging carnivorous appetites in his pythagorean philosophy how emphatical is his reasoning  b    quid meruere hoves animal sine srande dolisque innocuum simplex natum tolerare laborem immemor est demum nec srugum munere dignus qui potuit curvi dempto modo pondere aratri ruricolam mactare suum  i think agricolam had been stronger but the authority of manuscripts does not warrant that emendation  through the whole texture of this work ovid discovers the highest humanity and a most exceeding good nature the virtuous in distress are always his concern and his wit contrives to give them an immortality with himself  he seems to have taken the most pains in the first and second book of the metamorphoses though the thirteenth abounds with sentiments most moving and with calamitous incidents introduced with great art the poet had here in view the tragedy of hecuba in euripides and it is a wonder it has never been attempted in our own tongue the house of priam is destroyed his royal daughter a sacrifice to the manes of him that occasioned it she is forced from the arms of her unhappy friends and hurryd to the altar where she behaves herself with a decency becoming her sex and a magnanimity equal to her blood and so very affecting that even the priest wept   ipse etiam flens invitusque sacerdos etc she shows no concern at approaching death but on the account of her old unfortunate mother mors tantum vellem matrem mea fallere possit matter obest minuitque necis mea gaudia quamvis non mea mors illi verum sua vita gemenda est   then begs her body may be delivered to her without ransom  genetrici corpus inemptum reddite neve auro redimat jus triste sepulchri sed lacrymis tunc cum poterat redimebat and auro   the unhappy queen laments she is not able to give her daughter royal burial non haec est fortuna domus    then takes the body in her decrepid arms and halts to the sea to wash off the blood  ad littus passu processit anili albentes laniata comas    the animated thoughts and lively images of this poem are numerous none ever painted more to the life than our author though several grotesque figures are now and then seen in the same groupe the most plentiful season that gives birth to the finest flowers produces also the rankest weeds ovid has shown in one line the brightest fancy sometimes and in the next the poorest affectation  venus makes court to adonis b  0 l   0  et ecce opportuna sua blanditur populus umbra et requievit humo pressitque and gramen and ipsum   phoebus requests phaeton to desist from his request   consiliis non curribus utere nostris caeneus in the battle of the centaurs wounds latreus in several places   vulnusque in vulnere fecit these are some of our poets boyisms there is another affectation called by quintil  or a witty folly which would not have appeared quite so trifling had it been less frequent  medea persuades the daughters of pelias to kill their father in order to have his youth renewed she that loves him best gives the first wound b   et ne sit scelerata facit scelus    althea is enraged at her son meleager and to do justice to the manes of his brothers destroys him impietate pia est    envy enters athens and beholds the flourishing condition of the city vixque tenet lacrymas quia nil lacrymabile cernit   ovid was much too fond of such witticisms which are more to be wondered at because they were not the fashion of that age as punns and quibbles are of this virgil as i remember is not found trifling in this manner above once or twice   deucalion vacuum lapides jactavit in orbem unde homines nati durum genus  juno is in indignation at aeneas upon his arrival in italy   number capti potuere capi number incensa cremavit troja viros  the poet is so far from affecting this sort of wit that he rarely ventures on so spirited a turn of fancy as in these following instances  juno upbraids venus and cupid ironically that two deities could be able to get the better of one weak woman   memorabile nomen una dolo divum si saemina victa duorum est   euryalus going upon an enterprise expresses his concern for his surviving mother if he should fall and recommends her to the care of ascanius who answers  namque erit ista mihi genitrix nomenque creusae solum desuerit  venus is importunate in her solicitations to vulcan to make armor  her son he answers   absiste precando viribus indubitare tuis    at the first kindling of didos passion he has this most natural thought  illum absens absentem auditque videtque   but to return to ovid though i cannot vindicate him for his points i shall endeavor to mollify his critics when they give him no quarter for his diction and attack him so inflexibly for ending his lines with monosyllables as  si quis  si non etc and as i think he cannot be excused more advantagiously than by affirming that where he has done it once virgil has twenty times  et cum  si quis  nec dum   si quam  si quis   jam bos  nunc nunc  etc g   g   g   aen   aen   aen      there are a great many endings of lines in this manner and more indeed than seems consistent with the majesty of heroic verse when lines are designed to be sermoni propiores this liberty may be allowable but not so when the subject requires more sonorous numbers virgil seems to endeavor to keep up his versification to an harmonious dignity and therefore when fit words do not offer with some ase he will rather break off in an hemistick than that the line should be lazy and languid he well knew how essential it was in poetry to flatter the ear and at the same time was sensible that this organ grows tired by a constant attention to the same harmony and therefore he endeavored now and then to relieve it by a cadence of pauses and a variation of measures  ecl   amphion dircaeus in actaeo aracyntho this line seems not tuneful at the first hearing but by repetition it reconciles it self and has the same effect with some compositions of music which are at the first performance tiresome and afterward entertaining  the commentators and critics are of opinion that whenever virgil is less musical it is where he endeavors at an agreement of the sound with the sense as  procumbit humi bos   it would show as much singularity to deny this as it does a fanciful facility to affirm it because it is obvious in many places he had no such view aen   l   0  inventa sub ilicibus sus g   l

and depressas convalles g    sepe exiguus mus omnia sub magna labentia flumina terra   the last line is the only instance i remember except one in ecl   where the words terminate in the same vowel and seem to represent the constant and uniform sound of a sliding stream  those that are most conversant in classick poetry must be sensible that virgil has been much more solicitous than ovid to keep up his lines to an easy and a musical flow but though the critics charge the latter with breaking through prosody and grammar and allowing himself too often the license of graecisms i take this censure to be only an arrogant pedantry in the grammarians and groundless in it self but though it were true i dare be confident it is full as just upon virgil ec   l     curru subjungere tigres   for currui

there be several short vowels made long in homer yet there is no instance on the contrary of a long vowel such as the first syllable of   and the like made short except in such a case as that i have cited where the next word begins with a vowel which shows that there is no such thing as a poetica licentia properly so called  certainly no body can imagine but these two celebrated authors understood their own tongue better than the scrupulous grammarians of afterages who are too dogmatical and selfsufficient when they presume to censure either of them for not attending strictly enough to syntax and the measure of verse the latin tongue is a dead language and none can decide with confidence on the harmony or disonance of the numbers of these times unless they were thoroughly acquainted with their pauses and cadence they may indeed pronounce with much more assurance on their diction and distinguish where they have been negligent and where more finished there are certainly many lines in ovid where he has been downright lazy and where he might have avoided the appearance of being obviously so by a very little application in recording the succession of the alban kings thus epitus ex illo est post hunc capetusque capysque sed capys ante suit    there are also several lines in virgil which are not altogether tunable to a modern ear and which appear unfinished g   l    scilicet omnibus est labor impendendus and omnes cogendae in sulcum  g   l   0 praesertim si tempestas a vertice sylvis incubuit  aen    l  0  quasve refer parem sed nunc est omnia quando iste animus supra  aen    l  0  ista quidem quia nota mihi tua magne voluntas jupiter    but the sun has its spots and if amongst thousands of inimitable lines there should be some found of an unequal dignity with the rest nothing can be said for their vindication more than if they be faults they are the faults of virgil  as i ought to be on this occasion an advocate for ovid whom i think is too much run down at present by the critical spirit of this nation i dare say i cannot be more effectually so than by comparing him in many places with his admired contemporary virgil and though the last certainly deserves the palm i shall make use of ovids own lines in the trial of strength betwixt achelous and hercules to show how much he is honored by the contention  met b    non tam turpe fuit vinci quam contendisse decorum i shall finish my remarks on our author by taking notice of the justness and perspicuity of his allegories which are either physical or natural moral or historical of the first kind is the fable of apollo and python in the explanation of this all the mythologists agree exhalations and mists being the constant effects of inundations are here dissipated by the rays of the sun  of the second kind are acteon torn to pieces by his own pack of dogs and erisicthon starved by the disease of hunger these two allegories seem to signify that extravagance and luxury end in want  of the third is the story of the rape of europa history says she was daughter to agenor and carried by the candians in a gally bearing a bull in the stern in order to be married to one of their kings named jupiter  this explanation gives an occasion for a digression which is not altogether foreign to the present purpose because it will be of use to justify ovid on some other occasions where he is censured for being too free with the characters of the gods i was once representing the metamorphoses as an excellent system of morality but an illustrious lady whose least advantage above her sex is that of being one of the greatest princesses in europe objected that the loose and immodest sallys of jupiter did by no means confirm my assertion  one must consider that what appeared an absurdity in ovid is not so much his own fault as that of the times before him the characters of the gods of the old heroic age represented them unjust in their actions mutable in their designs partial in their favors ignorant of events scurrilous in their language some of the superior hierarchy treating one another with injurious brutalities and are often guilty of such indecencies and misbehaviour as the lowest of mortals would blush to own juno calls diana the goddess of chastity  brazenfaced bitch hom il   b    l     jupiter insults his daughter the goddess of wisdom for rashness and folly bids iris tell her he will maul her coachhorses for her like a surly bitch as she is  il b s from i  00 to i     then threatens in another place to beat his wife that divinc vixon the immortal partner of the empyreal throne  il b    l      the commentators may endeavor to hide those absurdities under the veil of allegories but the reader that considers the whole texture of the iliad will find that the authors meaning and their interpretation are often as unlike as the imaginary heroes of his time are to the real ones of ours  allegories should be obvious and not like meteors in the air which represent a different figure to every different eye now they are armies of soldiers now flocks of sheep and by and by nothing  perhaps the critics of a more exalted taste may discover such beauties in the ancient poetry as may escape the comprehension of us pigmies of a more limited genius they may be able to fathom the divine sense of the pagan theology whist we aim at no more than to judge of a little common sense  it is and ever will be a rule to a great many to applaud and condemn with the general vogue though never so ill grounded the most are afraid of being particular and rather than strive against the stream are proud of being in the wrong with the many rather than desirous of being in the right with the few and though they be convinced of the reasonableness of dissenting from the common cry yet out of a poor fear of censure they contribute to establish it and thus become an authority against others who in reality are but of their own opinion  ovid was so far from paying a blind deference to the venerable name of his grecian predecessor in the character of his gods that when jupiter punishes andromeda for the crimes of her mother he calls him injustus ammon met b   and takes commonly an honorable care of the decorum of the godhead when their actions are consistent with the divinity of their character his allegories include some religious or instructive moral wrapped up in a peculiar perspicuity the fable of proserpina being sometimes in hell and sometimes with ceres her mother can scarce mean any thing else than the sowing and coming up of corn the various dresses that vertumnus the god of seasons puts on in his courtship of pomona the garden goddess seem plainly to express the different and most proper times for digging planting pruning and gathering the increase i shall be shorter on this head because our countryman mr sands has by a laborious search amongst the mythologists been very full he has annexed his explanations to the end of each book which deserve to be recommended to those that are curious in this figurative learning  the reader cannot fail of observing how many excellent lessons of morality ovid has given us in the course of his fables  the story of deucalion and pyrrba teaches that piety and innocence cannot miss of the divine protection and that the only loss irreparable is that of our probity and justice  that of phaeton how the too great tenderness of the parent proves a cruelty to the child and that he who would climb to the seat of jupiter generally meets with his bolt by the way  the tale of baucis and philemon is most inimitably told he omits not the minutest circumstance of a cottage life and is much fuller than virgil where he brings in his contented old man corycius g   ovid represents a good old couple happy and satisfied in a cleanly poverty hospitable and free of the few things that fortune had given them moderate in desires affectionate in their conjugal relation so religious in life that when they observed their homely cabin rising to a temple all the bounty they asked of the gods they had entertained was that they might do the office of priesthood there and at their death not survive one another  the stories of lycaon and pentheus not only deter from infidelity and irreverence to the gods but the last also shows that too great zeal produces the same effects as none at all and that enthusiasm is often more cruel than atheism  the story of minos and scylla represents the infamy of selling our country and teaches that even they who love the crime abhor the criminal  in cippus we find a noble magnanimity and heavenly selfdenial he preferred the good of the republic to his own private grandeur and chose with an exemplary generosity rather to live a private freeman out of rome than to command numbers of slaves in it  from the story of hercules we learn that glory is a lady who like many others loves to have her admirers suffer a great deal for her the poet enumerates the labors of the hero shows how he conquered every thing for others but nothing for himself then does him the poetical justice of an apotheosis thinking it most fit that one who had born the celestial orbs on his shoulders should have a mansion amongst them  from the assumption of romulus that when war is at an end the chief business of peace should be the enacting good laws that after a people are preserved from the enemy the next care should be to preserve them from themselves and therefore the best legislators deserve a place amongst heroes and deities  from ariadne being inhumanly deserted by theseus and generously received by bacchus we find that as there is nothing we can be sure of so there is nothing we ought to despair of  from althea burning the brand that we should take care least under the notion of justice we should do a cruelty for they that are set upon revenge only endeavor to imitate the injury  from polyphemus making love to galatea one may observe that the most deformed can find something to like in their own person he examines his face in the stream combs his ruful locks with a rake grows more exact and studious of his dress and discovers the first sign of being in love by endeavoring at a more than usual care to please  the fable of cephalus and procrys confirms that every trifle contributes to heighten the disease of jealousy and that the most convincing proofs can scarce cure it  from that of hippomenes and atalanta we may discover that a generous present helps to persuade as well as an agreeable person  from medeas flying from peliass court that the offered favors of the impious should be always suspected and that they who design to make every one fear them are afraid of every one  from myrrha that shame is sometimes hard to be overcome but if the sex once gets the better of it it gives them afterward no more trouble  from cenis that effeminacy in youth may change to valor in manhood and that as fame perishes so does censure  from tereus that one crime lays the foundation of many and that the same person who begins with lust may conclude with murder  from midas that no body can punish a covetous man worse than he punishes himself that scarce any thing would sometimes prove more fatal to us than the completion of our own wishes and that he who has the most desires will certainly meet with the most disappointments  from the pythagorean philosophy it may be observed that man is the only animal who kills his fellow creature without being angry  from proteus we have this lesson that a statesman can put on any shape can be a spaniel to the lion and a lion to the spaniel and that he knows not to be an enemy who knows not how to seem a friend that if all crowns should change their ministry as often as they please though they may be called other ministers they are still the same men  the legend of aesculapius voyage to rome in form of a snake seems to express the necessary sagacity required in professors of that art for the readier insight into distempers this reptile being celebrated by the ancient naturalists for a quick sight  hor sat   l   cur in amicorum vitium tam cernis acutum quam aut aquilae aut serpens epidaurius  the venerable epidaurian assumed the figure of an animal without hands to take fees and therefore grateful posterity honored him with a temple in this manner should wealthy physicians upon proper occasions practice and thus their surviving patients reward  if the metamorphoses be attended to with a just application and without prepossession one will be the less surpised at the authors prophetic spirit relating to the duration and success of the work jamque opus exegi etc    this prediction has so far proved true that this poem has been ever since the magazine which has furnished the greatest poets of the following ages with fancy and allusions and the most celebrated painters with subjects and designs nor has his poetical predecessors and contemporaries paid less regard to their own performances  luer b   insignemque meo capiti petere inde coronam unde prius nulli velarint tempora musae enn frag nemo me lacrumeis decoret nec sunera sletu facsit quur

whole ode is in a manner a continued compliment to his own writings nor in imitation of this celebrated author want we poets of our present age who have been pleased to rank themselves amongst their own admirers  i have done with the original and shall make no excuse for the length of the preface because it is in the power of the reader to make is as short as he pleases i shall now conclude with a word or two about the version  translation is commonly either verbal or paraphrase or imitation of the first sort is mr sandss which i think the metamorphoses can by no means allow of it is agreed the author left it unfinished if it had undergone his last hand it is more than probable that many superfluities had been retrenched where a poem is perfectly finished the translation with regard to particular idioms cannot be too exact by doing this the sense of the author is more entirely his own and the cast of the periods more faithfully preserved but where a poem is tedious through exuberance or dark through a hasty brevity i think the translator may be excused for doing what the author upon revising would have done himself  if mr sands had been of this opinion perhaps other translations of the metamorphoses had not been attempted  a critic has observed that in his version of this book he has scrupulously confined the number of his lines to those of the original it is fit i should take the sum upon content and be better bred than to count after him  the manner that seems most suited for this present undertaking is neither to follow the author too close out of a critical timorousness nor abandon him too wantonly through a poetic boldness the original should always be kept in view without too apparent a deviation from the sense where it is otherwise it is not a version but an imitation the translator ought to be as intent to keep up the gracefulness of the poem as artful to hide its imperfections to copy its beauties and to throw a shade over its blemishes to be faithful to an idolatry where the author excells and to take the license of a little paraphrase where penury of fancy or dryness of expression seem to ask for it  the ingenious gentlemen concerned in this undertaking seem to be of this opinion and therefore they have not only consulted the reputation of the author but their own also there is one of them has no other share in this compliment than by being the occasion of engaging them that have in obliging the public he has also so just to the memory and reputation of mr dryden as to give his incomparable lines the advantage of appearing so near his own  i cannot pass by that admirable english poet without endeavoring to make his country sensible of the obligations they have to his muse whether they consider the flowing grace of his versification the vigorous sallies of his fancy or the peculiar delicacy of his periods they will discover excellencies never to be enough admired if they trace him from the first productions of his youth to the last performances of his age they will find that as the tyranny of rhyme never imposed on the perspicuity of the sense so a languid sense never wanted to be set off by the harmony of rhyme and as his earlier works wanted no maturity so his latter wanted no force or spirit the falling off of his hair had no other consequence than to make his laurels be seen the more  as a translator he was just as an inventer he was rich his versions of some parts of lucretius horace homer and virgil throughout gave him a just pretense to that compliment which was made to monsieur dablancourt a celebrated french translater it is uncertain who have the greatest obligations to him the dead or the living  with all these wondrous talents he was libelled in his lifetime by the very men who had no other excellencies but as they were his imitators where he was allowed to have sentiments superior to all others they charged him with theft but how did he steal no otherwise than like those that steal beggars children only to cloth them the better  it is to be lamented that gentlemen still continue this unfair behavior and treat one another every day with most injurious libels the muses should be ladies of a chaste and fair behavior when they are otherwise they are furies it is certain that parnassus is at best but a barren mountain and its inhabitants contrive to make it more so by their unneighbourly deportment the authors are the only corporation that endeavor at the ruin of their own society every day may convince them how much a rich fool is respected above a poor wit the only talents in esteem at present are those of exchangeally one tally is worth a grove of bays and it is of much more consequence to be well read in the tables of interest and the rise and fall of stocks than in the revolution of empires  mr dryden is still a sad and shameful instance of this truth the man that could make kings immortal and raise triumphant arches to heroes now wants a poor

my numbers with celestial heat till i my long laborious work complete and add perpetual tenor to my rhimes deduced from natures birth to caesars times before the seas and this terrestrial ball and heavens high canopy that covers all one was the face of nature if a face rather a rude and indigested mass a lifeless lump unfashiond and unframd of jarring seeds and justly chaos named no sun was lighted up the world to view no moon did yet her blunted horns renew nor yet was earth suspended in the sky nor poised did on her own foundations lie nor seas about the shoars their arms had thrown but earth and air and water were in one thus air was void of light and earth unstable and waters dark abyss unnavigable no certain form on any was impressed all were confused and each disturbed the rest for hot and cold were in one body fixed and soft with hard and light with heavy mixed but god or nature while they thus contend to these intestine discords put an end then earth from air and seas from earth were driven and grosser air sunk from aetherial heaven thus disembroild they take their proper place the next of kin contiguously embrace and foes are sunderd by a larger space the force of fire ascended first on high and took its dwelling in the vaulted sky then air succeeds in lightness next to fire whose atoms from unactive earth retire earth sinks beneath and draws a numerous throng of pondrous thick unwieldy seeds along about her coasts unruly waters roar and rising on a ridge insult the shore thus when the god whatever god was he had formed the whole and made the parts agree that no unequal portions might be found he molded earth into a spacious round then with a breath he gave the winds to blow and bad the congregated waters flow he adds the running springs and standing lakes and bounding banks for winding rivers makes some part in earth are swallowed up the most in ample oceans disembogud are lost he shades the woods the valleys he restrains with rocky mountains and extends the plains and as five zones the aetherial regions bind five correspondent are to earth assigned the sun with rays directly darting down fires all beneath and fries the middle zone the two beneath the distant poles complain of endless winter and perpetual rain betwixt the extremes two happier climates hold the temper that partakes of hot and cold the fields of liquid air enclosing all surround the compass of this earthly ball the lighter parts lie next the fires above the grosser near the watery surface move thick clouds are spread and storms engender there and thunders voice which wretched mortals fear and winds that on their wings cold winter bear nor were those blustering brethren left at large on seas and shoars their fury to discharge bound as they are and circumscribed in place they rend the world resistless where they pass and mighty marks of mischief leave behind such is the rage of their tempestuous kind first eurus to the rising morn is sent the regions of the balmy continent and eastern realms where early persians run to greet the blessed appearance of the sun westward the wanton zephyr wings his flight pleased with the remnants of departing light fierce borcas with his offspring issues forth to invade the frozen wagon of the north while frowning auster seeks the southern sphere and rots with endless rain the unwholsom year high over the clouds and empty realms of wind the god a clearer space for heaven designed where fields of light and liquid ether flow purged from the pondrous dregs of earth below scarce had the power distinguished these when straight the stars no longer overlaid with weight exert their heads from underneath the mass and upward shoot and kindle as they pass and with diffusive light adorn their heavenly place then every void of nature to supply with forms of gods he fills the vacant sky new herds of beasts he sends the plains to share new colonies of birds to people air and to their oozy beds the finny fish repair a creature of a more exalted kind was wanting yet and then was man designed conscious of thought of more capacious breast for empire formed and fit to rule the rest whether with particles of heavenly fire the god of nature did his soul inspire or earth but new divided from the sky and pliant still retained the aetherial energy which wise prometheus tempered into paste and mixed with living streams the godlike image cast thus while the mute creation downward bend their sight and to their earthy mother tend man looks aloft and with erected eyes beholds his own hereditary skies from such rude principles our form began and earth was metamorphosd into man the golden age the golden age was first when man yet new no rule but uncorrupted reason knew and with a native bent did good pursue unforced by punishment unawd by fear his words were simple and his soul sincere needless was written law where none oppressed the law of man was written in his breast no suppliant crowds before the judge appeared no court erected yet nor cause was heard but all was safe for conscience was their guard the mountaintrees in distant prospect please ever yet the pine descended to the seas ever sails were spread new oceans to explore and happy mortals unconcerned for more confined their wishes to their native shore no walls were yet nor fence nor mote nor mound nor drum was heard nor trumpets angry sound nor swords were forged but void of care and crime the soft creation slept away their time the teeming earth yet guiltless of the plough and unprovoked did fruitful stores allow content with food which nature freely bred on wildings and on strawberries they fed cornels and brambleberries gave the rest and falling acorns furnished out a feast the flowers unsown in fields and meadows reigned and western winds immortal spring maintained in following years the bearded corn ensued from earth unasked nor was that earth renewed from veins of valleys milk and nectar broke and honey sweating through the pores of oak the silver age but when good saturn banished from above was driven to hell the world was under jove succeeding times a silver age behold excelling brass but more excelled by gold then summer autumn winter did appear and spring was but a season of the year the sun his annual course obliquely made good days contracted and enlarged the bad then air with sultry heats began to glow the wings of winds were clogged with ice and snow and shivering mortals into houses driven sought shelter from the inclemency of heaven those houses then were caves or homely sheds with twining oziers fenced and moss their beds then ploughs for seed the fruitful furrows broke and oxen labored first beneath the yoke the brazen age to this came next in course the brazen age a warlike offspring prompt to bloody rage not impious yet  the iron age  hard steel succeeded then and stubborn as the metal were the men truth modesty and shame the world forsook fraud avarice and force their places took then sails were spread to every wind that blew raw were the sailors and the depths were new trees rudely hollowed did the waves sustain ever ships in triumph ploughd the watery plain then landmarks limited to each his right for all before was common as the light nor was the ground alone required to bear her annual income to the crooked share but greedy mortals rummaging her store dug from her entrails first the precious oar which next to hell the prudent gods had laid and that alluring ill to sight displaid thus cursed steel and more accursed gold gave mischief birth and made that mischief bold and double death did wretched man invade by steel assaulted and by gold betrayed now brandished weapons glittering in their hands mankind is broken loose from moral bands no

though not worthy yet in heaven to live let em at least enjoy that earth we give can these be thought securely lodged below when i my self who no superior know i who have heaven and earth at my command have been attempted by lycaons hand at this a murmur through the synod went and with one voice they vote his punishment thus when conspiring traitors dared to doom the fall of caesar and in him of rome the nations trembled with a pious fear all anxious for their earthly thunderer nor was their care o caesar less esteemed by thee than that of heaven for jove was deemed who with his hand and voice did first restrain their murmurs then resumed his speech again the gods to silence were composed and sat with reverence due to his superior state cancel your pious cares already he has paid his debt to justice and to me yet what his crimes and what my judgments were remains for me thus briefly to declare the clamours of this vile degenerate age the cries of orphans and the oppressors rage had reached the stars i will descend said i in hope to prove this loud complaint a lie disguised in humane shape i traveled round the world and more than what i heard i found over maenalus i took my steepy way by caverns infamous for beasts of prey then crossed cyllene and the piny shade more infamous by cursed lycaon made dark night had covered heaven and earth before i entered his unhospitable door just at my entrance i displayed the sign that somewhat was approaching of divine the prostrate people pray the tyrant grins and adding profanation to his sins i will try said he and if a god appear to prove his deity shall cost him dear it was late the graceless wretch my death prepares when i should soundly sleep oppressed with cares this dire experiment he chose to prove if i were mortal or undoubted jove but first he had resolved to taste my power not long before but in a luckless hour some legates sent from the molossian state were on a peaceful errand come to treat of these he murders one he boils the flesh and lays the mangled morsels in a dish some part he roasts then serves it up so dressed and bids me welcome to this humane feast moved with disdain the table i oerturnd and with avenging flames the palace burned the tyrant in a fright for shelter gains the neighboring fields and scours along the plains howling he fled and fain he would have spoke but humane voice his brutal tongue forsook about his lips the gathered foam he churns and breathing slaughters still with rage he burns but on the bleating flock his fury turns his mantle now his hide with rugged pairs cleaves to his back a famished face he bears his arms descend his shoulders sink away to multiply his legs for chase of prey he grows a wolf his hoariness remains and the same rage in other members reigns his eyes still sparkle in a narrwer space his jaws retain the grin and violence of his face this was a single ruin but not one deserves so just a punishment alone mankinds a monster and the ungodly times confedrate into guilt are sworn to crimes all are alike involved in ill and all must by the same relentless fury fall thus ended he the greater gods assent by clamours urging his severe intent the less fill up the cry for punishment yet still with pity they remember man and mourn as much as heavenly spirits can they ask when those were lost of humane birth what he would do with all this waste of earth if his dispeopld world he would resign to beasts a mute and more ignoble line neglected altars must no longer smoke if none were left to worship and invoke to whom the father of the gods replied lay that unnecessary fear aside mine be the care new people to provide i will from wondrous principles ordain a race unlike the first and try my skill again already had he tossed the flaming brand and rolled the thunder in his spacious hand preparing to discharge on seas and land but stopped for fear thus violently driven the sparks should catch his axletree of heaven remembering in the fates a time when fire should to the battlements of heaven aspire and all his blazing worlds above should burn and all the inferior globe to cinders turn his dire artillry thus dismissed he bent his thoughts to some securer punishment concludes to pour a watery deluge down and what he durst not burn resolves to drown the northern breath that freezes floods he binds with all the race of clouddispelling winds the south he loosed who night and horror brings and foggs are shaken from his flaggy wings from his divided beard two streams he pours his head and rhumy eyes distill in showers with rain his robe and heavy mantle flow and lazy mists are lowering on his brow still as he swept along with his clenchd fist he squeezed the clouds the imprisoned clouds resist the skies from pole to pole with peals resound and showers enlarged come pouring on the ground then clad in colors of a various dye junonian iris breeds a new supply to feed the clouds impetuous rain descends the bearded corn beneath the burden bends defrauded clowns deplore their perished grain and the long labors of the year are vain nor from his patrimonial heaven alone is jove content to pour his vengeance down aid from his brother of the seas he craves to help him with auxiliary waves the watery tyrant calls his brooks and floods who roll from mossie caves their moist abodes and with perpetual urns his palace fill to whom in brief he thus imparts his will small exhortation needs your pow rs employ and this bad world so jove requires destroy let loose the reins to all your watery store bear down the damms and open every door the floods by nature enemies to land and proudly swelling with their new command remove the living stones that stopped their way and gushing from their source augment the sea then with his mace their monarch struck the ground with inward trembling earth received the wound and rising streams a ready passage found the expanded waters gather on the plain they float the fields and overtop the grain then rushing onwards with a sweepy sway bear flocks and folds and laboring hinds away nor safe their dwellings were for sapd by floods their houses fell upon their household gods the solid piles too strongly built to fall high over their heads behold a watery wall now seas and earth were in confusion lost a world of waters and without a coast one climbs a cliff one in his boat is born and ploughs above where late he sowed his corn others over chimneytops and turrets row and drop their anchors on the meads below or downward driven they bruise the tender vine or tossed aloft are knocked against a pine and where of late the kids had cropped the grass the monsters of the deep now take their place insulting nereids on the cities ride and wondering dolphins over the palace glide on leaves and masts of mighty oaks they brouze and their broad finns entangle in the boughs the frighted wolf now swims amongst the sheep the yellow lion wanders in the deep his rapid force no longer helps the boar the stag swims faster than he ran before the fowls long beating on their wings in vain despair of land and drop into the main now hills and vales no more distinction know and levelled nature lies oppressed below the most of mortals perish in the flood the small remainder dies for want of food a mountain of stupendous height there stands betwixt the athenian and boeotian lands the bound of fruitful fields while fields they were but then a field of waters did appear parnassus is its name whose forky rise mounts through the clouds and mates the lofty skies high on the summet of this dubious cliff deucalion wafting moored his little skiff he with his wife were only left behind of perished man they two were human kind the mountain nymphs and themis they adore and from her oracles relief implore the most upright of mortal men was he the most sincere and holy woman she when jupiter surveying earth from high beheld it in a lake of water lie that where so many millions lately lived but two the best of either sex survived he loosed the northern wind fierce boreas flies to puff away the clouds and purge the skies serenely while he blows the vapors driven discover heavuto earth and earth to heaven the billows fall while neptune lays his mace on the rough sea and smooths its furrowed face already triton at his call appears above the waves a tyrian robe he wears and in his hand a crooked trumpet bears the sovereign bids him peaceful sounds inspire and give the waves the signal to retire his writhen shell he takes whose narrow vent grows by degrees into a large extent then gives it breath the blast with doubling sound runs the wide circuit of the world around the sun first heard it in his early east and met the rattling ecchos in the west the waters listening to the trumpets roar obey the summons and forsake the shore a thin circumference of land appears and earth but not at once her visage rears and peeps upon the seas from upper grounds the streams but just contained within their bounds by slow degrees into their channels crawl and earth increases as the waters fall in longer time the tops of trees appear which mud on their dishonored branches bear at length the world was all restored to view but desolate and of a sickly hue nature beheld her self and stood aghast a dismal desert and a silent waste which when deucalton with a piteous look beheld he wept and thus to pyrrha spoke oh wife oh sister oh of all thy kind the best and only creature left behind by kindred love and now by dangers joined of multitudes who breathed the common air we two remain a species in a pair the rest the seas have swallowed nor have we even of this wretched life a certainty the clouds are still above and while i speak a second deluge over our heads may break should i be snatched from hence and thou remain without relief or partner of thy pain how could thou such a wretched life sustain should i be left and thou be lost the sea that buried her i loved should bury me oh could our father his old arts inspire and make me heir of his informing fire that so i might abolisht man retrieve and perished people in new souls might live but heaven is pleased nor ought we to complain that we the examples of mankind remain he said the careful couple join their tears and then invoke the gods with pious prayers thus in devotion having eased their grief from sacred oracles they seek relief and to cephysus brook their way pursue the stream was troubled but the foord they knew with living waters in the fountain bred they sprinkle first their garments and their head then took the way which to the temple led the roofs were all defiled with moss and mire the desert altars void of solemn fire before the gradual prostrate they adored the pavement kissed and thus the saint implored o righteous themis if the powers above by prayers are bent to pity and to love if humane miseries can move their mind if yet they can forgive and yet be kind tell how we may restore by second birth mankind and people desolated earth then thus the gracious goddess nodding said depart and with your vestments veil your head and stooping lowly down with loosened zones throw each behind your backs your mighty mothers bones amazed the pair and mute with wonder stand till pyrrha first refused the dire command forbid it heaven said she that i should tear those holy relics from the sepulcher they pondered the mysterious words again for some new sense and long they sought in vain at length deucalion cleared his cloudy brow and said the dark aenigma will allow a meaning which if well i understand from sacrilege will free the gods command this earth our mighty mother is the stones in her capacious body are her bones these we must cast behind with hope and fear the woman did the new solution hear the man diffides in his own augury and doubts the gods yet both resolve to try descending from the mount they first unbind their vests and veiled they cast the stones behind the stones a miracle to mortal view but long tradition makes it pass for true did first the rigor of their kind expel and suppled into softness as they fell then swelled and swelling by degrees grew warm and took the rudiments of humane form imperfect shapes in marble such are seen when the rude chizzel does the man begin while yet the roughness of the stone remains without the rising muscles and the veins the sappy parts and next resembling juice were turned to moisture for the bodies use supplying humors blood and nourishment the rest too solid to receive a bent converts to bones and what was once a vein its former name and nature did retain by help of power divine in little space what the man threw assumed a manly face and what the wife renewed the female race hence we derive our nature born to bear laborious life and hardened into care the rest of animals from teeming earth produced in various forms received their birth the native moisture in its close retreat digested by the suns aetherial heat as in a kindly womb began to breed then swelled and quickened by the vital seed and some in less and some in longer space were ripened into form and took a several face thus when the nile from pharian fields is fled and seeks with ebbing tides his ancient bed the fat manure with heavenly fire is warmed and crusted creatures as in wombs are formed these when they turn the glebe the peasants find some rude and yet unfinished in their kind short of their limbs a lame imperfect birth one half alive and one of lifeless earth for heat and moisture when in bodies joined the temper that results from either kind conception makes and fighting till they mix their mingled atoms in each other fix thus natures hand the genial bed prepares with friendly discord and with fruitful wars from hence the surface of the ground with mud and slime besmeared the faeces of the flood received the rays of heaven and sucking in the seeds of heat new creatures did begin some were of several sorts produced before but of new monsters earth created more unwillingly but yet she brought to light thee python too the wondering world to fright and the new nations with so dire a sight so monstrous was his bulk so large a space did his vast body and long train embrace whom phoebus basking on a bank espied ever now the god his arrows had not tried but on the trembling deer or mountain goat at this new quarry he prepares to shoot though every shaft took place he spent the store of his full quiver and twas long before the expiring serpent wallowd in his gore then to preserve the fame of such a deed  python slain he pythian games decreed where noble youths for mastership should strive to quoit to run and steeds and chariots drive the prize was fame in witness of renown an oaken garland did the victor crown the laurel was not yet for triumphs born but every green alike by phoebus worn did with promiscuous grace his flowing locks adorn the transformation of daphne into a laurel the first and fairest of his loves was she whom not blind fortune but the dire decree of angry cupid forced him to desire daphne her name and peneus was her sire swelled with the pride that new success attends he sees the stripling while his bow he bends and thus insults him thou lascivious boy are arms like these for children to employ know such achievements are my proper claim due to my vigor and unerring aim resistless are my shafts and python late in such a feathered death has found his fate take up thy torch and lay my weapons by with that the feeble souls of lovers fry to whom the son of venus thus replied phoebus thy shafts are sure on all beside but mine on phoebus mine the fame shall be of all thy conquests when i conquer thee he said and soaring swiftly winged his flight nor stopped but on parnassus airy height two different shafts he from his quiver draws one to repel desire and one to cause one shaft is pointed with refulgent gold to bribe the love and make the lover bold one blunt and tipped with lead whose base allay provokes disdain and drives desire away the blunted bolt against the nymph he dressed but with the sharp transfixt apollos breast the enamored deity pursues the chase the scornful damsel shuns his loathed embrace in hunting beasts of prey her youth employs and phoebe rivals in her rural joys with naked neck she goes and shoulders bare and with a fillet binds her flowing hair by many suitors sought she mocks their pains and still her vowed virginity maintains impatient of a yoke the name of bride she shuns and hates the joys she never tried on wilds and woods she fixes her desire nor knows what youth and kindly love inspire her father chides her often thou owst says he a husband to thy self a son to me she like a crime abhors the nuptial bed she glows with blushes and she hangs her head then casting round his neck her tender arms sooths him with blandishments and filial charms give me my lord she said to live and die a spotless maid without the marriage tie it is but a small request i beg no more than what dianas father gave before the good old sire was softened to consent but said her wish would prove her punishment for so much youth and so much beauty joined opposed the state which her desires designed the god of light aspiring to her bed hopes what he seeks with flattering fancies fed and is by his own oracles misled and as in empty fields the stubble burns or nightly travelers when day returns their useless torches on dry hedges throw that catch the flames and kindle all the row so burns the god consuming in desire and feeding in his breast a fruitless fire her wellturnd neck he viewed her neck was bare and on her shoulders her disheveled hair oh were it combed said he with what a grace would every waving curl become her face he viewed her eyes like heavenly lamps that shone he viewed her lips too sweet to view alone her taper fingers and her panting breast he praises all he sees and for the rest believes the beauties yet unseen are best swift as the wind the damsel fled away nor did for these alluring speeches stay stay nymph he cried i follow not a foe thus from the lion trips the trembling do thus from the wolf the frightened lamb removes and from pursuing faulcons fearful doves thou shunnst a god and shunnst a god that loves ah lest some thorn should pierce thy tender foot or thou should fall in flying my pursuit to sharp uneven ways thy steps decline abate thy speed and i will bate of mine yet think from whom thou do so rashly fly nor basely born nor shepherds swain am i perhaps thou know not my superior state and from that ignorance proceeds thy hate me claros delphos tenedos obey these hands the patareian scepter sway the king of gods begot me what shall be or is or ever was in fate i see mine is the invention of the charming lyre sweet notes and heavenly numbers i inspire sure is my bow unerring is my dart but ah more deadly his who pierced my heart medicine is mine what herbs and simples grow in fields and forests all their powers i know and am the great physician called below alas that fields and forests can afford no remedies to heal their lovesick lord to cure the pains of love no plant avails and his own physic the physician fails she heard not half so furiously she flies and on her ear the imperfect accent dies fear gave her wings and as she fled the wind increasing spread her flowing hair behind and left her legs and thighs exposed to view which made the god more eager to pursue the god was young and was too hotly bent to lose his time in empty compliment but led by love and fired with such a sight impetuously pursued his near delight as when the impatient greyhound slipped from far bounds over the glebe to course the fearful hare she in her speed does all her safety lay and he with double speed pursues the prey oerruns her at the sitting turn and licks his chaps in vain and blows upon the flix she scapes and for the neighboring covert strives and gaining shelter doubts if yet she lives if little things with great we may compare such was the god and such the flying fair she urged by fear her feet did swiftly move but he more swiftly who was urged by love he gathers ground upon her in the chase now breaths upon her hair with nearer pace and just is fastning on the wished embrace the nymph grew pale and in a mortal fright spent with the labor of so long a flight and now despairing cast a mournful look upon the streams of her paternal brook oh help she cried in this extremest need if water gods are deities indeed gape earth and this unhappy wretch intomb or change my form whence all my sorrows come scarce had she finished when her feet she found benumbed with cold and fastened to the ground a filmy rind about her body grows her hair to leaves her arms extend to boughs the nymph is all into a laurel gone the smoothness of her skin remains alone yet phoebus loves her still and casting round her bole his arms some little warmth he found the tree still panted in the unfinished part not wholly vegetive and heaved her heart he fixed his lips upon the trembling rind it swerved aside and his embrace declined to whom the god because thou can not be my mistress i espouse thee for my tree be thou the prize of honor and renown the deathless poet and the poem crown thou shall the roman festivals adorn and after poets be by victors worn thou shall returning caesars triumph grace when pomps shall in a long procession pass wreathed on the posts before his palace wait and be the sacred guardian of the gate secure from thunder and unharmd by jove unfading as the immortal powers above and as the locks of phoebus are unshorn so shall perpetual green thy boughs adorn the grateful tree was pleased with what he said and shook the shady honors of her head the transformation of io into a heyfar an ancient forest in thessalia grows which tempes pleasing valley does enclose through this the rapid peneus takes his course from pindus rolling with impetuous force mists from the rivers mighty fall arise and deadly damps enclose the cloudy skies perpetual fogs are hanging over the wood and sounds of waters deaf the neighborhood deep in a rocky cave he makes abode a mansion proper for a mourning god here he gives audience issuing out decrees to rivers his dependant deities on this occasion hither they resort to pay their homage and to make their court all doubtful whether to congratulate his daughters honor or lament her fate sperchaeus crowned with poplar first appears then old apidanus came crowned with years enipeus turbulent amphrysos tame and aeas last with lagging waters came then of his kindred brooks a numerous throng condole his loss and bring their urns along not one was wanting of the watery train that filled his flood or mingled with the main but inachus who in his cave alone wept not anothers losses but his own for his dear io whether strayed or dead to him uncertain doubtful tears he shed he sought her through the world but sought in vain and no where finding rather feared her slain her just returning from her fathers brook jove had beheld with a desiring look and oh fair daughter of the flood he said worthy alone of joves imperial bed happy whoever shall those charms possess the king of gods nor is thy lover less invites thee to yon cooler shades to shun the scorching rays of the meridian sun nor shall thou tempt the dangers of the grove alone without a guide thy guide is jove no puny power but he whose high command is unconfined who rules the seas and land and tempers thunder in his awful hand oh fly not for she fled from his embrace over lernas pastures he pursued the chase along the shades of the lyrcaean plain at length the god who never asks in vain involved with vapors imitating night both air and earth and then suppressed her flight and mingling force with love enjoyed the full delight mean time the jealous juno from on high surveyed the fruitful fields of arcady and wondered that the mist should overrun the face of daylight and obscure the sun no natural cause she found from brooks or bogs or marshy lowlands to produce the fogs then round the skies she sought for jupiter her faithless husband but no jove was there suspecting now the worst or i she said am much mistaken or am much betrayed with fury she precipitates her flight dispels the shadows of dissembled night and to the day restores his native light the almighty leacher careful to prevent the consequence foreseeing her descent transforms his mistress in a trice and now in ios place appears a lovely cow so sleek her skin so faultless was her make even juno did unwilling pleasure take to see so fair a rival of her love and what she was and whence inquired of jove of what fair herd and from what pedigree the god half caught was forced upon a lie and said she sprung from earth she took the word and begged the beauteous heyfar of her lord what should he do twas equal shame to jove or to relinquish or betray his love yet to refuse so slight a gift would be but more to increase his consorts jealousy thus fear and love by turns his heart assailed and stronger love had sure at length prevailed but some faint hope remained his jealous queen had not the mistress through the heyfar seen the cautious goddess of her gift possessed yet harbored anxious thoughts within her breast as she who knew the falsehood of her jove and justly feared some new relapse of love which to prevent and to secure her care to trusty argus she commits the fair the head of argus as with stars the skies was compassed round and wore an hundred eyes but two by turns their lids in slumber steep the rest on duty still their station keep nor could the total constellation sleep thus ever present to his eyes and mind his charge was still before him though behind in fields he suffered her to feed by day but when the setting sun to night gave way the captive cow he summoned with a call and drove her back and tied her to the stall on leaves of trees and bitter herbs she fed heaven was her canopy bare earth her bed so hardly lodged and to digest her food she drank from troubled streams defiled with mud her woeful story fain she would have told with hands upheld but had no hands to hold her head to her ungentle keeper bowed she strove to speak she spoke not but she lowed affrighted with the noise she looked around and seemed to inquire the author of the sound once on the banks where often she had played her fathers banks she came and there surveyed her altered visage and her branching head and starting from her self she would have fled her fellow nymphs familiar to her eyes beheld but knew her not in this disguise even inachus himself was ignorant and in his daughter did his daughter want she followed where her fellows went as she were still a partner of the company they stroke her neck the gentle heyfar stands and her neck offers to their stroaking hands her father gave her grass the grass she took and licked his palms and cast a piteous look and in the language of her eyes she spoke she would have told her name and asked relief but wanting words in tears she tells her grief which with her foot she makes him understand and prints the name of io in the sand ah wretched me her mournful father cried she with a sigh to wretched me replied about her milkwhite neck his arms he threw and wept and then these tender words ensue and art thou she whom i have sought around the world and have at length so sadly found so found is worse than lost with mutual words thou answerst not no voice thy tongue affords but sighs are deeply drawn from out thy breast and speech denied by lowing is expressed unknowing i prepared thy bridal bed with empty hopes of happy issue fed but now the husband of a herd must be thy mate and bellwing sons thy progeny oh were i mortal death might bring relief but now my godhead but extends my grief prolongs my woes of which no end i see and makes me curse my immortality more had he said but fearful of her stay the starry guardian drove his charge away to some fresh pasture on a hilly height he sat himself and kept her still in sight the eyes of argus transformed into a peacocks train now jove no longer could her sufferings bear but called in haste his airy messenger the son of maia with severe decree to kill the keeper and to set her free with all his harness soon the god was sped his flying hat was fastened on his head wings on his heels were hung and in his hand he holds the virtue of the snaky wand the liquid air his moving pinions wound and in the moment shoot him on the ground before he came in sight the crafty god his wings dismissed but still retained his rod that sleepprocuring wand wise hermes took but made it seem to sight a shepherds hook with this he did a herd of goats control which by the way he met and slily stole clad like a country swain he pipd and sung and playing drove his jolly troop along with pleasure argus the musician heeds but wonders much at those new vocal reeds and whosoeer thou art my friend said he up hither drive thy goats and play by me this hill has browz for them and shade for thee the god who was with case induced to climb began discourse to pass away the time and still betwixt his tuneful pipe he plyes and watched his hour to close the keepers eyes with much ado he partly kept awake not suffering all his eyes repose to take and asked the stranger who did reeds invent and whence began so rare an instrument the transformation of syrinx into reeds then hermes thus a nymph of late there was whose heavenly form her follows did surpass the pride and joy of fair arcadias plains beloved by deities adored by swains syrinx her name by sylvans often pursued as often she did the lustful gods delude the rural and the woodland powers disdained with cynthia hunted and her rites maintained like phoebe clad even phoebes self she seems so tall so straight such wellproportiond limbs the nicest eye did no distinction know but that the goddess bore a golden bow distinguished thus the sight she cheated too descending from lycaeus pan admires the matchless nymph and burns with new desires a crown of pine upon his head he wore and thus began her pity to implore but ever he thus began she took her flight so swift she was already out of sight nor stayed to hear the courtship of the god but bent her course to ladons gentle flood there by the river stopped and tired before relief from water nymphs her prayers implore now while the lustful god with speedy pace just thought to strain her in a strict embrace he filled his arms with reeds new rising on the place and while he sighs his ill success to find the tender canes were shaken by the wind and breathed a mournful air unheard before that much surprising pan yet pleased him more admiring this new music thou he said who can not be the partner of my bed at least shall be the consort of my mind and often often to my lips be joined he formed the reeds proportioned as they are unequal in their length and waxed with care they still retain the name of his ungrateful fair while hermes pipd and sung and told his tale the keepers winking eyes began to fail and drowsy slumber on the lids to creep till all the watchman was at length asleep then soon the god his voice and song suppressed and with his powerful rod confirmed his rest without delay his crooked faulchion drew and at one fatal stroke the keeper slew down from the rock fell the disseverd head opening its eyes in death and falling bled and marked the passage with a crimson trail thus argus lies in pieces cold and pale and all his hundred eyes with all their light are closed at once in one perpetual night these juno takes that they no more may fail and spreads them in her peacocks gaudy tail impatient to revenge her injured bed she wreaks her anger on her rivals head with furies frights her from her native home and drives her gadding round the world to roam nor ceased her madness and her flight before she touched the limits of the pharian shore at length arriving on the banks of nile wearied with length of ways and worn with toil she laid her down and leaning on her knees invoked the cause of all her miseries and cast her languishing regards above for help from heaven and her ungrateful jove she sighed she wept she lowed twas all she could and with unkindness seemed to tax the god last with an humble prayer she begged repose or death at least to finish all her woes jove heard her vows and with a flattering look in her behalf to jealous juno spoke he cast his arms about her neck and said dame rest secure no more thy nuptial bed this nymph shall violate by styx i swear and every oath that binds the thunderer the goddess was appeased and at the word was io to her former shape restored the rugged hair began to fall away the sweetness of her eyes did only stay though not so large her crooked horns decrease the wideness of her jaws and nostrils cease her hoofs to hands return in little space the five long taper fingers take their place and nothing of the heyfar now is seen beside the native whiteness of the skin erected on her feet she walks again and two the duty of the four sustain she tries her tongue her silence softly breaks and fears her former lowings when she speaks a goddess now through all the egyptian state and served by priests who in white linen wait her son was epaphus at length believed the son of jove and as a god received with sacrifice adored and public prayers he common temples with his mother shares equal in years and rival in renown with epaphus the youthful phaeton like honor claims and boasts his sire the sun his haughty looks and his assuming air the son of isis could no longer bear thou take thy mothers word too far said he and have usurped thy boasted pedigree go base pretender to a borrowed name thus taxed he blushed with anger and with shame but shame repressed his rage the daunted youth soon seeks his mother and enquires the truth mother said he this infamy was thrown by epaphus on you and me your son he spoke in public told it to my face nor durst i vindicate the dire disgrace even i the bold the sensible of wrong restrained by shame was forced to hold my tongue to hear an open slander is a curse but not to find an answer is a worse if i am heavnbegot assert your son by some sure sign and make my father known to right my honor and redeem your own he said and saying cast his arms about her neck and begged her to resolve the doubt it is hard to judge if clymene were moved more by his prayer whom she so dearly loved or more with fury fired to find her name traduced and made the sport of common fame she stretched her arms to heaven and fixed her eyes on that fair planet that adorns the skies now by those beams said she whose holy fires consume my breast and kindle my desires by him who sees us both and chears our sight by him the public minister of light i swear that sun begot thee if i lie let him his cheerful influence deny let him no more this perjured creature see and shine on all the world but only me if still you doubt your mothers innocence his eastern mansion is not far from hence with little pains you to his leve go and from himself your parentage may know with joy the ambitious youth his mother heard and eager for the journey soon prepared he longs the world beneath him to survey to guide the chariot and to give the day from meroes burning sands he bends his course nor less in india feels his fathers force his travel urging till he came in sight and saw the palace by the purple light the end of the first book to her grace the duchess of roxbu  ovids metamorphoses book ii translated by mr addison the story of phaeton the suns bright palace on high columns raised with burnished gold and flaming jewels blazed the foldinggates diffused a silver light and with a milder gleam refreshed the sight of polished ivory was the covering wrought the matter vied not with the sculptors thought for in the portal was displayed on high the work of vulcan a fictitious sky a waving sea the inferior earth embraced and gods and goddesses the waters graced aegeon here a mighty whale bestrode triton and proteus the deceiving god with doris here were carved and all her train some loosely swimming in the figured main while some on rocks their dropping hair divide and some on fishes through the waters glide though various features did the sisters grace a sisters likeness was in every face on earth a different landscape courts the eyes men towns and beasts in distant prospects rise and nymphs and streams and woods and rural deities over all the heavens refulgent image shines on either gate were six engraven signs here phaeton still gaining on the ascent to his suspected fathers palace went till pressing forward through the bright abode he saw at distance the illustrious god he saw at distance or the dazzling light had flashed too strongly on his aching sight the god sits high exalted on a throne of blazing gems with purple garments on the hours in order ranged on either hand and days and months and years and ages stand here spring appears with flowery chaplets bound here summer in her wheaten garland crowned here autumn the rich trodden grapes besmear and hoary winter shivers in the rear phoebus beheld the youth from off his throne that eye which looks on all was fixed in one he saw the boys confusion in his face surpised at all the wonders of the place and cries aloud  what wants my son for know  my son thou art and i must call thee so  light of the world the trembling youth replies  illustrious parent since you dont despise  the parents name some certain token give  that i may clymenes proud boast believe  nor longer under false reproaches grieve the tender sire was touched with what he said and flung the blaze of glories from his head and bid the youth advance  my son said he  come to thy fathers arms for clymene  has told thee true a parents name i own  and deem thee worthy to be called my son  as a sure proof make some request and i  whatever it be with that request comply  by styx i swear whose waves are hid in night  and roll impervious to my piercing sight the youth transported asks without delay to guide the suns bright chariot for a day the god repented of the oath he took for anguish thrice his radiant head he shook  my son says he some other proof require  rash was my promise rash is thy desire  i would fain deny this wish which thou have made  or what i cannot deny would fain dissuade  too vast and hazardous the task appears  nor suited to thy strength nor to thy years  thy lot is mortal but thy wishes fly  beyond the province of mortality  there is not one of all the gods that dares  however skilled in other great affairs  to mount the burning axletree but i  not jove himself the ruler of the sky  that hurles the threeforkd thunder from above  dares try his strength yet who so strong as jove  the steeds climb up the first ascent with pain  and when the middle firmament they gain  if downward from the heavens my head i bow  and see the earth and ocean hang below even i am seized with horror and affright  and my own heart misgives me at the sight  a mighty downfall steeps the evening stage  and steady reins must curb the horses rage  tethys her self has feared to see me driven  down headlong from the precipice of heaven  besides consider what impetuous force  turns stars and planets in a different course  i steer against their motions nor am i  born back by all the current of the sky  but how could you resist the orbs that roll  in adverse whirls and stem the rapid pole  but you perhaps may hope for pleasing woods  and stately domes and cities filled with gods  while through a thousand snares your progress lies  where forms of starry monsters stock the skies  for should you hit the doubtful way aright  the bull with stooping horns stands opposite  next him the bright haemonian bow is strung  and next the lions grinning visage hung  the scorpions claws here clasp a wide extent  and here the crabs in lesser clasps are bent  nor would you find it easy to compose  the mettled steeds when from their nostrils flows  the scorching fire that in their entrails glows  even i their headstrong fury scarce restrain  when they grow warm and restif to the rein  let not my son a fatal gift require  but o in time recall your rash desire  you ask a gift that may your parent tell  let these my fears your parentage reveal and learn a father from a fathers care  look on my face or if my heart lay bare  could you but look you would read the father there  choose out a gift from seas or earth or skies  for open to your wish all nature lies  only decline this one unequal task  for it is a mischief not a gift you ask  you ask a real mischief phaeton  nay hang not thus about my neck my son  i grant your wish and styx has heard my voice  choose what you will but make a wiser choice thus did the god the unwary youth advise but he still longs to travel through the skies when the fond father for in vain he pleads at length to the vulcanian chariot leads a golden axle did the work uphold gold was the beam the wheels were orbd with gold the spokes in rows of silver pleased the sight the seat with partycolored gems was bright apollo shined amid the glare of light the youth with secret joy the work surveys when now the morn disclosed her purple rays the stars were fled for lucifer had chaset the stars away and fled himself at last soon as the father saw the rosy morn and the moon shining with a blunter horn he bid the nimble hours without delay bring forth the steeds the nimble hours obey from their full racks the generous steeds retire dropping ambrosial foams and snorting fire still anxious for his son the god of day to make him proof against the burning ray his temples with celestial ointment wet of sovereign virtue to repel the heat then fixed the beamy circle on his head and fetched a deep foreboding sigh and said  take this at least this last advice my son  keep a stiff rein and move but gently on  the coursers of themselves will run too fast  your art must be to moderate their haste  drive em not on directly through the skies  but where the zodiacs winding circle lies  along the midmost zone but sally forth  nor to the distant south nor stormy north  the horses hoofs a beaten track will show  but neither mount too high nor sink too low  that no new fires or heaven or earth infest  keep the mid way the middle way is best  nor where in radiant folds the serpent twines  direct your course nor where the altar shines  shun both extremes the rest let fortune guide  and better for thee than thy self provide  see while i speak the shades disperse away  aurora gives the promise of a day  i am called nor can i make a longer stay  snatch up the reins or still the attempt forsake  and not my chariot but my counsel take  while yet securely on the earth you stand  nor touch the horses with too rash a hand  let me alone to light the world while you  enjoy those beams which you may safely view he spoke in vain the youth with active heat and sprightly vigor vaults into the seat and joys to hold the reins and fondly gives those thanks his father with remorse receives mean while the restless horses neighd aloud breathing out fire and pawing where they stood tethys not knowing what had past gave way and all the waste of heaven before em lay they spring together out and swiftly bear the flying youth through clouds and yielding air with wingy speed outstrip the eastern wind and leave the breezes of the morn behind the youth was light nor could he fill the seat or poise the chariot with its wonted weight but as at sea the unballassd vessel rides cast to and fro the sport of winds and tides so in the bounding chariot tossed on high the youth is hurried headlong through the sky soon as the steeds perceive it they forsake their stated course and leave the beaten track the youth was in a maze nor did he know which way to turn the reins or where to go nor would the horses had he known obey then the sevn stars first felt apollos ray and wished to dip in the forbidden sea the folded serpent next the frozen pole stiff and benumbed before began to roll and raged with inward heat and threatened war and shot a redder light from every star nay and it is said boots too that fain thou woudst have fled though cumberd with thy wane the unhappy youth then bending down his head saw earth and ocean far beneath him spread his color changed he startled at the sight and his eyes darkened by too great a light now could he wish the fiery steeds untried his birth obscure and his request denied now would he merops for his father own and quit his boasted kindred to the sun so fares the pilot when his ship is tossed in troubled seas and all its steerage lost he gives her to the winds and in despair seeks his last refuge in the gods and prayer what could he do his eyes if backward cast find a long path he had already past if forward still a longer path they find both he compares and measures in his mind and sometimes casts an eye upon the east and sometimes looks on the forbidden west the horses names he knew not in the fright nor would he loose the reins nor could he hold em right now all the horrors of the heavens he spies and monstrous shadows of prodigious size that decked with stars lie scattered over the skies there is a place above where scorpio bent in tail and arms surrounds a vast extent in a wide circuit of the heavens he shines and fills the space of two celestial signs soon as the youth beheld him vexed with heat brandish his sting and in his poison sweat half dead with sudden fear he dropped the reins the horses felt em loose upon their mains and flying out through all the plains above ran uncontrolled wherever their fury drove rushed on the stars and through a pathless way of unknown regions hurried on the day and now above and now below they flew and near the earth the burning chariot drew the clouds disperse in fumes the wondering moon beholds her brothers steeds beneath her own the highlands smoke cleft by the piercing rays or clad with woods in their own fuel blaze next over the plains where ripened harvests grow the running conflagration spreads below but these are trivial ills whole cities burn and peopled kingdoms into ashes turn the mountains kindle as the car draws near athos and tmolus red with fires appear oeagrian haemus then a single name and virgin helicon increase the flame taurus and oete glare amid the sky and ida spite of all her fountains dry eryx and othrys and cithaeron glow and rhodope no longer clothed in snow high pindus mimas and parnassus sweat and aetna rages with redoubled heat even scythia through her hoary regions warmed in vain with all her native frost was armed covered with flames the towering appennine and caucasus and proud olympus shine and where the longextended alps aspire now stands a huge continued range of fire the astonished youth wherever his eyes could turn beheld the universe around him burn the world was in a blaze nor could he bear the sultry vapors and the scorching air which from below as from a furnace flowed and now the axletree beneath him glowed lost in the whirling clouds that round him broke and white with ashes hovering in the smoke he flew wherever the horses drove nor knew whither the horses drove or where he flew twas then they say the swarthy moor begun to change his hue and blacken in the sun then libya first of all her moisture drained became a barren waste a wild of sand the waternymphs lament their empty urns baeotia robbed of silver dirce mourns corinth pyrenes wasted spring bewails and argos grieves whilst amymone fails the floods are drained from every distant coast even tanais though fixed in ice was lost enraged caicus and lycormas roar and xanthus fated to be burnt once more the famed maeander that unwearied strays through mazy windings smoaks in every maze from his loved babylon euphrates flies the bigswoln ganges and the danube rise in thickning fumes and darken half the skies in flames ismenos and the phasis rould and tagus floating in his melted gold the swans that on cayster often tried their tuneful songs now sung their last and died the frighted nile ran off and under ground concealed his head nor can it yet be found his sevn divided currents all are dry and where they rould sevn gaping trenches lie no more the rhine or rhone their course maintain nor tiber of his promised empire vain the ground deepcleft admits the dazzling ray and startles pluto with the flash of day the seas shrink in and to the sight disclose wide naked plains where once their billows rose their rocks are all discovered and increase the number of the scattered cyclades the fish in sholes about the bottom creep nor longer dares the crooked dolphin leap gasping for breath the unshapen phocae die and on the boiling wave extended lie nereus and doris with her virgin train seek out the last recesses of the main beneath unfathomable depths they faint and secret in their gloomy caverns pant stern neptune thrice above the waves upheld his face and thrice was by the flames repelled the earth at length on every side embraced with scalding seas that floated round her waste when now she felt the springs and rivers come and crowd within the hollow of her womb uplifted to the heavens her blasted head and clapped her hand upon her brows and said but first impatient of the sultry heat sunk deeper down and sought a cooler seat  if you great king of gods my death approve  and i deserve it let me die by jove  if i must perish by the force of fire  let me transfixed with thunderbolts expire  see whilst i speak my breath the vapors choke for now her face lay wrapped in clouds of smoke  see my singed hair behold my faded eye  and withered face where heaps of cinders lie  and does the plow for this my body tear  this the reward for all the fruits i bear  tortured with rakes and harrassd all the year  that herbs for cattle daily i renew  and food for man and frankincense for you but grant me guilty what has neptune done  why are his waters boiling in the sun  the wavy empire which by lot was given  why does it waste and further shrink from heaven  if i nor he your pity can provoke  see your own heavens the heavens begin to smoke  should once the sparkles catch those bright abodes  destruction seizes on the heavens and gods  atlas becomes unequal to his freight  and almost faints beneath the glowing weight  if heavnn and earth and sea together burn  all must again into their chaos turn  apply some speedy cure prevent our fate  and succor nature ever it be too late she ceased for choked with vapors round her spread down to the deepest shades she sunk her head jove called to witness every power above and even the god whose son the chariot drove that what he acts he is compelled to do or universal ruin must ensue strait he ascends the high ethereal throne from whence he used to dart his thunder down from whence his showers and storms he used to pour but now could meet with neither storm nor shower then aiming at the youth with lifted hand full at his head he hurled the forky brand in dreadful thundrings thus the almighty sire suppressed the raging of the fires with fire at once from life and from the chariot driven the ambitious boy fell thunderstruck from heaven the horses started with a sudden bound and flung the reins and chariot to the ground the studded harness from their necks they broke here fell a wheel and here a silver spoke here were the beam and axle torn away and scattered over the earth the shining fragments lay the breathless phaeton with flaming hair shot from the chariot like a falling star that in a summers evening from the top of heaven drops down or seems at least to drop till on the po his blasted corpse was hurled far from his country in the western world phaetons sisters transformed into trees the latian nymphs came round him and amazed on the dead youth transfixed with thunder gazed and whilst yet smoking from the bolt he lay his shattered body to a tomb convey and over the tomb an epitaph devise  here he who drove the suns bright chariot lies  his fathers fiery steeds he could not guide  but in the glorious enterprise he died apollo hid his face and pined for grief and if the story may deserve belief the space of one whole day is said to run from morn to wonted even without a sun the burning ruins with a fainter ray supply the sun and counterfeit a day a day that still did natures face disclose this comfort from the mighty mischief rose but clymene enraged with grief laments and as her grief inspires her passion vents wild for her son and frantic in her woes with hair disheveled round the world she goes to seek wherever his body might be cast till on the borders of the po at last the name inscribed on the new tomb appears the dear dear name she bathes in flowing tears hangs over the tomb unable to depart and hugs the marble to her throbbing heart her daughters too lament and sigh and mourn a fruitless tribute to their brothers urn and beat their naked bosoms and complain and call aloud for phaeton in vain all the long night their mournful watch they keep and all the day stand round the tomb and weep four times revolving the full moon returned so long the mother and the daughters mourned when now the eldest phaethusa strove to rest her weary limbs but could not move lampetia would have helped her but she found her self withheld and rooted to the ground a third in wild affliction as she grieves would rend her hair but fills her hand with leaves one sees her thighs transformed another views her arms shot out and branching into boughs and now their legs and breasts and bodies stood crusted with bark and hardning into wood but still above were female heads displayed and mouths that called the mother to their aid what could alas the weeping mother do from this to that with eager haste she flew and kissed her sprouting daughters as they grew she tears the bark that to each body cleaves and from their verdant fingers strips the leaves the blood came trickling where she tore away the leaves and bark the maids were heard to say  forbear mistaken parent oh forbear  a wounded daughter in each tree you tear  farewell for ever here the bark increased closed on their faces and their words suppressed the newmade trees in tears of amber run which hardened into value by the sun distill for ever on the streams below the limpid streams their radiant treasure show mixed in the sand whence the rich drops conveyed shine in the dress of the bright latian maid the transformation of cycnus into a swan cycnus beheld the nymphs transformed allied to their dead brother on the mortal side in friendship and affection nearer bound he left the cities and the realms he owned through pathless fields and lonely shores to range and woods made thicker by the sisters change whilst here within the dismal gloom alone the melancholy monarch made his moan his voice was lessened as he tried to speak and issued through a long extended neck his hair transforms to down his fingers meet in skinny films and shape his oary feet from both his sides the wings and feathers break and from his mouth proceeds a blunted beak all cycnus now into a swan was turned who still remembering how his kinsman burned to solitary pools and lakes retires and loves the waters as opposed to fires meanwhile apollo in a gloomy shade the native luster of his brows decayed indulging sorrow sickens at the sight of his own sunshine and abhors the light the hidden griefs that in his bosom rise sadden his looks and overcast his eyes as when some dusky orb obstructs his ray and sullies in a dim eclipse the day now secretly with inward griefs he pined now warm resentments to his griefs he joined and now renounced his office to mankind  ever since the birth of time said he i have born  a long ungrateful toil without return  let now some other manage if he dare  the fiery steeds and mount the burning carr  of if none else let jove his fortune try  and learn to lay his murdering thunder by  then will he own perhaps but own too late  my son deserved not so severe a fate the gods stand round him as he mourns and pray he would resume the conduct of the day nor let the world be lost in endless night jove too himself descending from his height excuses what had happened and entreats majestically mixing prayers and threats prevailed upon at length again he took the harnessed steeds that still with horror shook and plies em with the lash and whips em on and as he whips upbraids em with his son the story of calisto the day was settled in its course and jove walked the wide circuit of the heavens above to search if any cracks or flaws were made but all was safe the earth he then surveyed and cast an eye on every different coast and every land but on arcadia most her fields he clothed and cheered her blasted face with running fountains and with springing grass no tracks of heavens destructive fire remain the fields and woods revive and nature smiles again but as the god walked to and fro the earth and raised the plants and gave the spring its birth by chance a fair arcadian nymph he viewed and felt the lovely charmer in his blood the nymph nor spun nor dressed with artful pride her vest was gathered up her hair was tied now in her hand a slender spear she bore now a light quiver on her shoulders wore to chaste diana from her youth inclined the sprightly warriors of the wood she joined diana too the gentle huntress loved nor was there one of all the nymphs that roved over maenalus amid the maiden throng more favored once but favor lasts not long the sun now shone in all its strength and drove the heated virgin panting to a grove the grove around a grateful shadow cast she dropped her arrows and her bow unbracd she flung her self on the cool grassy bed and on the painted quiver raised her head jove saw the charming huntress unprepared stretched on the verdant turf without a guard  here i am safe he cries from junos eye  or should my jealous queen the theft descry  yet would i venture on a theft like this  and stand her rage for such for such a bliss dianas shape and habit strait he took softened his brows and smoothed his awful look and mildly in a female accent spoke  how fares my girl how went the morning chase to whom the virgin starting from the grass  allhail bright deity whom i prefer  to jove himself though jove himself were here the god was nearer than she thought and heard wellpleased himself before himself preferred he then salutes her with a warm embrace and ere she half had told the morning chase with love enflamed and eager on his bliss smothered her words and stopped her with a kiss his kisses with unwonted ardour glowed nor could dianas shape conceal the god the virgin did whatever a virgin could sure juno must have pardoned had she viewed with all her might against his force she strove but how can mortal maids contend with jove possessed at length of what his heart desired back to his heavens the exulting god retired the lovely huntress rising from the grass with downcast eyes and with a blushing face by shame confounded and by fear dismayed flew from the covert of the guilty shade and almost in the tumult of her mind lest her forgotten bow and shafts behind but now diana with a sprightly train of quiverd virgins bounding over the plain called to the nymph the nymph began to fear a second fraud a jove disguised in her but when she saw the sister nymphs suppressed her rising fears and mingled with the rest how in the look does conscious guilt appear slowly she moved and loiterd in the rear nor lightly trippd nor by the goddess ran as once she used the foremost of the train her looks were flushed and sullen was her mien that sure the virgin goddess had she been aught but a virgin must the guilt have seen it is said the nymphs saw all and guessed aright and now the moon had nine times lost her light when dian fainting in the midday beams found a cool covert and refreshing streams that in soft murmurs through the forest flowed and a smooth bed of shining gravel showed a covert so obscure and streams so clear the goddess praised  and now no spies are near  let us strip my gentle maids and wash she cries pleased with the motion every maid complies only the blushing huntress stood confused and formed delays and her delays excused in vain excused her fellows round her pressed and the reluctant nymph by force undressed the naked huntress all her shame revealed in vain her hands the pregnant womb concealed  begone the goddess cries with stern disdain  begone nor dare the hallowed stream to stain she fled forever banished from the train this juno heard who long had watched her time to punish the detested rivals crime the time was come for to enrage her more a lovely boy the teeming rival bore the goddess cast a furious look and cried  it is enough i am fully satisfied  this boy shall stand a living mark to prove  my husbands baseness and the strumpets love  but vengeance shall awake those guilty charms  that drew the thunderer from junos arms  no longer shall their wonted force retain  nor please the god nor make the mortal vain this said her hand within her hair she wound swung her to earth and dragged her on the ground the prostrate wretch lifts up her arms in prayer her arms grow shaggy and deformed with hair her nails are sharpened into pointed claws her hands bear half her weight and turn to paws her lips that once could tempt a god begin to grow distorted in an ugly grin and lest the supplicating brute might reach the ears of jove she was deprived of speech her surly voice through a hoarse passage came in savage sounds her mind was still the same the furry monster fixed her eyes above and heaved her new unwieldy paws to jove and begged his aid with inward groans and though she could not call him false she thought him so how did she fear to lodge in woods alone and haunt the fields and meadows once her own how often would the deepmouthed dogs pursue whilst from her hounds the frighted huntress flew how did she fear her fellowbrutes and shun the shaggy bear though now her self was one how from the sight of rugged wolves retire although the grim lycaon was her sire but now her son had fifteen summers told fierce at the chase and in the forest bold when as he beat the woods in quest of prey he chanced to rouse his mother where she lay she knew her son and kept him in her sight and fondly gazed the boy was in a fright and aimed a pointed arrow at her breast and would have slain his mother in the beast but jove forbad and snatched em through the air in whirlwinds up to heaven and fixed em there where the new constellations nightly rise and add a luster to the northern skies when juno saw the rival in her height spangled with stars and circled round with light she sought old ocean in his deep abodes and tethys both revered among the gods they ask what brings her there  never ask says she  what brings me here heaven is no place for me  you will see when night has covered all things over  joves starry bastard and triumphant whore  usurp the heavens you will see em proudly roll  in their new orbs and brighten all the pole  and who shall now on junos altars wait  when those she hates grow greater by her hate  i on the nymph a brutal form impressed  jove to a goddess has transformed the beast  this this was all my weak revenge could do  but let the god his chaste amors pursue and as he acted after ios rape  restore the adultress to her former shape  then may he cast his juno off and lead  the great lycaons offspring to his bed  but you ye venerable powers be kind  and if my wrongs a due resentment find  receive not in your waves their setting beams  nor let the glaring strumpet taint your streams the goddess ended and her wish was given back she returned in triumph up to heaven her gaudy peacocks drew her through the skies their tails were spotted with a thousand eyes the eyes of argus on their tails were ranged at the same time the ravens color changed the story of coronis and birth of aesculapius the raven once in snowy plumes was dressed white as the whitest doves unsullied breast fair as the guardian of the capitol soft as the swan a large and lovely fowl his tongue his prating tongue had changed him quite to sooty blackness from the purest white the story of his change shall here be told in thessaly there lived a nymph of old coronis named a peerless maid she hinsd confessed the fairest of the fairer kind apollo loved her till her guilt he knew while true she was or whilst he thought her true but his own bird the raven chanced to find the false one with a secret rival joined coronis begged him to suppress the tale but could not with repeated prayers prevail his milkwhite pinions to the god he plied the busy daw flew with him side by side and by a thousand teizing questions drew the important secret from him as they flew the daw gave honest counsel though despised and tedious in her tattle thus advised  stay silly bird thillnaturd task refuse  nor be the bearer of unwelcome news  be warned by my example you discern  what now i am and what i was shall learn  my foolish honesty was all my crime  then hear my story once upon a time  the twoshapd ericthonius had his birth  without a mother from the teeming earth  minerva nursed him and the infant laid  within a chest of twining osiers made  the daughters of king cecrops undertook  to guard the chest commanded not to look  on what was hid within i stood to see  the charge obeyed perched on a neighboring tree  the sisters pandrosos and hearse keep  this strict command aglauros needs would peep  and saw the monstrous infant in a fright  and called her sisters to the hideous sight  a boys soft shape did to the waste prevail  but the boy ended in a dragons tail  i told the stern minerva all that passed  but for my pains discarded and disgraced  the frowning goddess drove me from her sight  and for her favorite chose the bird of night  be then no telltale for i think my wrong  enough to teach a bird to hold her tongue but you perhaps may think i was removed  as never by the heavenly maid beloved  but i was loved ask pallas if i lie  though pallas hate me now she will not deny  for i whom in a feathered shape you view  was once a maid by heaven the storys true  a blooming maid and a kings daughter too  a crowd of lovers owned my beautys charms  my beauty was the cause of all my harms  neptune as on his shores i wont to rove  observed me in my walks and fell in love  he made his courtship he confessed his pain  and offered force when all his arts were vain  swift he pursued i ran along the strand  till spent and wearied on the sinking sand  i shrieked aloud with cries i filled the air  to gods and men nor god nor man was there  a virgin goddess heard a virgins prayer  for as my arms i lifted to the skies  i saw black feathers from my fingers rise  i strove to fling my garment on the ground  my garment turned to plumes and girt me round  my hands to beat my naked bosom try  nor naked bosom now nor hands had i  lightly i tript nor weary as before  sunk in the sand but skimd along the shore  till rising on my wings i was preferred  to be the chaste minervas virgin bird  preferred in vain i now am in disgrace  nyctimene the owl enjoys my place  on her incestuous life i need not dwell  in lesbos still the horrid tale they tell and of her dire amors you must have heard  for which she now does penance in a bird  that conscious of her shame avoids the light  and loves the gloomy covering of the night  the birds wherever she flutters scare away  the hooting wretch and drive her from the day the raven urged by such impertinence grew passionate it seems and took offense and cursed the harmless daw the daw withdrew the raven to her injured patron flew and found him out and told the fatal truth of false coronis and the favored youth the god was wroth the color left his look the wreath his head the harp his hand forsook his silver bow and feathered shafts he took and lodged an arrow in the tender breast that had so often to his own been pressed down fell the wounded nymph and sadly groaned and pulled his arrow reeking from the wound and weltring in her blood thus faintly cried  ah cruel god though i have justly died  what has alas my unborn infant done  that he should fall and two expire in one this said in agonies she fetched her breath the god dissolves in pity at her death he hates the bird that made her falsehood known and hates himself for what himself had done the feathered shaft that sent her to the fates and his own hand that sent the shaft he hates fain would he heal the wound and case her pain and tries the compass of his art in vain soon as he saw the lovely nymph expire the pile made ready and the kindling fire with sighs and groans her obsequies he kept and if a god could weep the god had wept her corpse he kissed and heavenly incense brought and solemnized the death himself had wrought but lest his offspring should her fate partake spite of the immortal mixture in his make he ripped her womb and set the child at large and gave him to the centaur chirons charge then in his fury blackd the raven over and bid him prate in his white plumes no more ocyrrhoe transformed to a mare old chiron took the babe with secret joy proud of the charge of the celestial boy his daughter too whom on the sandy shore the nymph chariclo to the centaur bore with hair disheveled on her shoulders came to see the child ocyrrhoe was her name she knew her fathers arts and could rehearse the depths of prophecy in sounding verse once as the sacred infant she surveyed the god was kindled in the raving maid and thus she uttered her prophetic tale  hail great physician of the world allhail  hail mighty infant who in years to come  shall heal the nations and defraud the tomb  swift be thy growth thy triumphs unconfined  make kingdoms thicker and increase mankind  thy daring art shall animate the dead  and draw the thunder on thy guilty head then shall thou dye but from the dark abode  rise up victorious and be twice a god  and thou my sire not destined by thy birth  to turn to dust and mix with common earth  how will thou toss and rave and long to dye  and quit thy claim to immortality  when thou shall feel enraged with inward pains  the hydras venom rankling in thy veins  the gods in pity shall contract thy date  and give thee over to the power of fate thus entering into destiny the maid the secrets of offended jove betrayed more had she still to say but now appears oppressed with sobs and sighs and drowned in tears  my voice says she is gone my language fails  through every limb my kindred shape prevails  why did the god this fatal gift impart  and with prophetic raptures swell my heart  what new desires are these i long to pace  over flowery meadows and to feed on grass  i hasten to a brute a maid no more  but why alas am i transformed all over  my sire does half a human shape retain  and in his upper parts preserves the man her tongue no more distinct complaints affords but in shrill accents and misshapen words pours forth such hideous wailings as declare the human form confounded in the mare till by degrees accomplished in the beast she neighd outright and all the steed expressed her stooping body on her hands is born her hands are turned to hoofs and shod in horn her yellow tresses ruffle in a mane and in a flowing tail she frisks her train the mare was finished in her voice and look and a new name from the new figure took the transformation of battus to a touchstone sore wept the centaur and to phoebus prayed but how could phoebus give the centaur aid degraded of his power by angry jove in elis then a herd of beeves he drove and wielded in his hand a staff of oak and over his shoulders threw the shepherds cloak on sevn compacted reeds he used to play and on his rural pipe to waste the day as once attentive to his pipe he played the crafty hermes from the god conveyed a drove that separate from their fellows strayed the theft an old insidious peasant viewed they called him battus in the neighborhood hired by a wealthy pylian prince to feed his favorite mares and watch the generous breed the thievish god suspected him and took the hind aside and thus in whispers spoke  discover not the theft whoever thou be  and take that milkwhite heifer for thy fee  go stranger cries the clown securely on  that stone shall sooner tell and showed a stone the god withdrew but strait returned again in speech and habit like a country swain and cries out  neighbor have thou seen a stray  of bullocks and of heifers pass this way in the recovry of my cattle join  a bullock and a heifer shall be thine the peasant quick replies  you will find em there  in yon dark vale and in the vale they were the double bribe had his false heart beguiled the god successful in the trial smiled  and do thou thus betray my self to me  me to my self do thou betray says he then to a touchstone turns the faithless spy and in his name records his infamy the story of aglauros transformed into a statue this done the god flew up on high and passed over lofty athens by minerva graced and wide munichia whilst his eyes survey all the vast region that beneath him lay twas now the feast when each athenian maid her yearly homage to minerva paid in canisters with garlands covered over high on their heads their mystic gifts they bore and now returning in a solemn train the troop of shining virgins filled the plain the god wellpleased beheld the pompous show and saw the bright procession pass below then veerd about and took a wheeling flight and hovered over them as the spreading kite that smells the slaughtered victim from on high flies at a distance if the priests are nigh and sails around and keeps it in her eye so kept the god the virgin quire in view and in slow winding circles round them flew as lucifer excells the meanest star or as the fullorbd phoebe lucifer so much did hearse all the rest outvy and gave a grace to the solemnity hermes was fired as in the clouds he hung so the cold bullet that with fury slung from balearick engines mounts on high glows in the whirl and burns along the sky at length he pitched upon the ground and showed the form divine the features of a god he knew their virtue over a female heart and yet he strives to better them by art he hangs his mantle loose and sets to show the golden edging on the seam below adjusts his flowing curls and in his hand waves with an air the sleepprocuring wand the glittering sandals to his feet applies and to each heel the well trimmed pinion ties his ornaments with nicest art displayed he seeks the apartment of the royal maid the roof was all with polished ivory lined that richly mixed in clouds of tortoise shined three rooms contiguous in a range were placed the midmost by the beauteous hearse graced her virgin sisters lodged on either side aglauros first the approaching god descried and as he crossed her chamber asked his name and what his business was and whence he came  i come replied the god from heaven to woo  your sister and to make an aunt of you  i am the son and messenger of jove  my name is mercury my business love do you kind damsel take a lovers part  and gain admittance to your sisters heart she stard him in the face with looks amazed as when she on minervas secret gazed and asks a mighty treasure for her hire and till he brings it makes the god retire minerva grieved to see the nymph succeed and now remembering the late impious deed when disobedient to her strict command she touched the chest with an unhallowed hand in bigswoln sighs her inward rage expressed that heaved the rising aegis on her breast then sought out envy in her dark abode defiled with ropy gore and clots of blood shut from the winds and from the wholesome skies in a deep vale the gloomy dungeon lies dismal and cold where not a beam of light invades the winter or disturbs the night directly to the cave her course she steered against the gates her martial lance she reared the gates flew open and the fiend appeared a poisonous morsel in her teeth she chewed and gorged the flesh of vipers for her food minerva loathing turned away her eye the hideous monster rising heavily came stalking forward with a sullen pace and left her mangled offals on the place soon as she saw the goddess gay and bright she fetched a groan at such a cheerful sight livid and meagre were her looks her eye in foul distorted glances turned awry a hoard of gall her inward parts possessed and spread a greenness over her cankered breast her teeth were brown with rust and from her tongue in dangling drops the stringy poison hung she never smiles but when the wretched weep nor lulls her malice with a moments sleep restless in spite while watchful to destroy she pines and sickens at anothers joy foe to her self distressing and distressed she bears her own tormenter in her breast the goddess gave for she abhorred her sight a short command  to athens speed thy flight  on cursed aglauros try thy utmost art  and fix thy rankest venoms in her heart this said her spear she pushed against the ground and mounting from it with an active bound flew off to heaven the hag with eyes askew looked up and muttered curses as she flew for sore she fretted and began to grieve at the success which she her self must give then takes her staff hung round with wreaths of thorn and sails along in a black whirlwind born over fields and flowery meadows where she steers her banesul course a mighty blast appears mildews and blights the meadows are defaced the fields the flowers and the whole year laid waste on mortals next and peopled towns she falls and breathes a burning plague among their walls when athens she beheld for arts renowned with peace made happy and with plenty crowned scarce could the hideous fiend from tears forbear to find out nothing that deserved a tear the apartment now she entered where at rest aglauros lay with gentle sleep oppressed to execute minervas dire command she stroakd the virgin with her cankered hand then prickly thorns into her breast conveyed that stung to madness the devoted maid her subtle venom still improves the smart frets in the blood and festers in the heart to make the work more sure a scene she drew and placed before the dreaming virgins view her sisters marriage and her glorious fate the imaginary bride appears in state the bridegroom with unwonted beauty glows for envy magnifies whateer she shows full of the dream aglauros pined away in tears all night in darkness all the day consumed like ice that just begins to run when feebly smitten by the distant sun or like unwholesome weeds that set on fire are slowly wasted and in smoke expire given up to envy for in every thought the thorns the venom and the vision wrought often did she call on death as often decreed rather than see her sisters wish succeed to tell her awful father what had past at length before the door her self she cast and sitting on the ground with sullen pride a passage to the lovesick god denied the god caressed and for admission prayed and soothed in softest words the envenomed maid in vain he soothed  begone the maid replies  or here i keep my seat and never rise  then keep thy seat for ever cries the god and touched the door wideopning to his rod fain would she rise and stop him but she found her trunk too heavy to forsake the ground her joints are all benumbed her hands are pale and marble now appears in every nail as when a cancer in the body feeds and gradual death from limb to limb proceeds so does the chilness to each vital part spread by degrees and creeps into her heart till hardning every where and speechless grown she sits unmoved and freezes to a stone but still her envious hue and sullen mien are in the sedentary figure seen europas rape when now the god his fury had allayed and taken vengeance of the stubborn maid from where the bright athenian turrets rise he mounts aloft and reascends the skies jove saw him enter the sublime abodes and as he mixed among the crowd of gods beckoned him out and drew him from the rest and in soft whispers thus his will expressed  my trusty hermes by who is ready aid  thy sires commands are through the world conveyed  resume thy wings exert their utmost force  and to the walls of sidon speed thy course  there find a herd of heifers wandering over  the neighboring hill and drive em to the shore thus spoke the god concealing his intent the trusty hermes on his message went and found the herd of heifers wandering over a neighboring hill and drove em to the shore where the kings daughter with a lovely train of fellownymphs was sporting on the plain the dignity of empire laid aside for love but ill agrees with kingly pride the ruler of the skies the thundering god who shakes the worlds foundations with a nod among a herd of lowing heifers ran friskd in a bull and bellowed over the plain large rolls of fat about his shoulders clung and from his neck the double dewlap hung his skin was whiter than the snow that lies unfullyd by the breath of southern skies small shining horns on his curled forehead stand as turned and polished by the workmans hand his eye balls rolled not formidably bright but gazed and languishd with a gentle light his every look was peaceful and expressed the softness of the lover in the beast agenors royal daughter as she played among the fields the milkwhite bull surveyed and viewed his spotless body with delight and at a distance kept him in her sight at length she plucked the rising flowers and fed the gentle beast and fondly stroakd his head he stood wellpleased to touch the charming fair but hardly could confine his pleasure there and now he wantons over the neighboring strand now rowls his body on the yellow sand and now perceiving all her fears decayed comes tossing forward to the royal maid gives her his breast to stroke and downward turns his grisly brow and gently stoops his horns in flowery wreaths the royal virgin dressed his bending horns and kindly clapped his breast till now grown wanton and devoid of fear not knowing that she pressed the thunderer she placed her self upon his back and rode over fields and meadows seated on the god he gently marched along and by degrees left the dry meadow and approached the seas where now he dips his hoofs and wets his thighs now plunges in and carries off the prize the frighted nymph looks backward on the shore and hears the tumbling billows round her roar but still she holds him fast one hand is born upon his back the other grasps a horn her train of ruffling garments flies behind swells in the air and hovers in the wind through storms and tempests he the virgin bore and lands her safe on the dictean shore where now in his divinest form arrayed in his true shape he captivates the maid who gazes on him and with wondering eyes beholds the new majestic figure rise his glowing features and celestial light and all the god discovered to her sight the end of the second book to her grace the duchess of newca  ovids metamorphoses book iii translated by mr addison the story of cadmus when now agenor had his daughter lost he sent his son to search on every coast and sternly bid him to his arms restore the darling maid or see his face no more but live an exile in a foreign clime thus was the father pious to a crime the restless youth searched all the world around but how can jove in his amors be found when tired at length with unsuccessful toil to shun his angry sire and native soil he goes a suppliant to the delphick dome there asks the god what newappointed home should end his wanderings and his toils relieve the delphick oracles this answer give  behold among the fields a lonely cow  unworn with yokes unbroken to the plow mark well the place where first she lays her down  there measure out thy walls and build thy town  and from thy guide baeotia call the land  in which the destined walls and town shall stand no sooner had he left the dark abode big with the promise of the delphick god when in the fields the fatal cow he viewed nor galled with yokes nor worn with servitude her gently at a distance he pursued and as he walked aloof in silence prayed to the great power whose counsels he obeyed her way through flowery panope she took and now cephisus crossed thy silver brook when to the heavens her spacious front she raised and bellowed thrice then backward turning gazed on those behind till on the destined place she stooped and couched amid the rising grass cadmus salutes the soil and gladly hails the newfound mountains and the nameless vales and thanks the gods and turns about his eye to see his new dominions round him lie then sends his servants to a neighboring grove for living streams a sacrifice to jove over the wide plain there rose a shady wood of aged trees in its dark bosom stood a bushy thicket pathless and unworn oerrun with brambles and perplexed with thorn amidst the brake a hollow den was found with rocks and shelving arches vaulted round deep in the dreary den concealed from day sacred to mars a mighty dragon lay bloated with poison to a monstrous size fire broke in flashes when he glanced his eyes his towering crest was glorious to behold his shoulders and his sides were scaled with gold three tongues he brandished when he charged his foes his teeth stood jaggy in three dreadful rows the tyrians in the den for water sought and with their urns explored the hollow vault from side to side their empty urns rebound and rowse the sleeping serpent with the sound strait he bestirs him and is seen to rise and now with dreadful hissings fills the skies and darts his forky tongues and rouls his glareing eyes the tyrians drop their vessels in the fright all pale and trembling at the hideous sight spire above spire upreard in air he stood and gazing round him overlooked the wood then floating on the ground in circles rolled then leaped upon them in a mighty fold of such a bulk and such a monstrous size the serpent in the polar circle lies that stretches over half the northern skies in vain the tyrians on their arms rely in vain attempt to fight in vain to fly all their endeavors and their hopes are vain some die entangld in the winding train some are devoured or feel a loathsome death swollen up with blasts of pestilential breath and now the scorching sun was mounted high in all its luster to the noonday sky when anxious for his friends and filled with cares to search the woods the impatient chief prepares a lions hide around his loins he wore the wellpoizd javelin to the field he bore inured to blood the fardestroying dart and the best weapon an undaunted heart soon as the youth approached the fatal place he saw his servants breathless on the grass the scaly foe amid their corpse he viewed basking at ease and feasting in their blood  such friends he cries deserved a longer date  but cadmus will revenge or share their fate then heaved a stone and rising to the throw he sent it in a whirlwind at the foe a tower assaulted by so rude a stroke with all its lofty battlements had shook but nothing here the unweildy rock avails rebounding harmless from the plaited scales that firmly joined preserved him from a wound with native armor crusted all around the pointed javelin more successful flew which at his back the raging warrior threw amid the plaited scales it took its course and in the spinal marrow spent its force the monster hissed aloud and raged in vain and writhed his body to and fro with pain and bit the spear and wrenchd the wood away the point still buried in the marrow lay and now his rage increasing with his pain reddens his eyes and beats in every vein churnd in his teeth the foamy venom rose whilst from his mouth a blast of vapors flows such as the infernal stygian waters cast the plants around him wither in the blast now in a maze of rings he lies enrowld now all unraveld and without a fold now like a torrent with a mighty force bears down the forest in his boisterous course cadmus gave back and on the lions spoil sustained the shock then forced him to recoil the pointed javelin warded off his rage mad with his pains and furious to engage the serpent champs the steel and bites the spear till blood and venom all the point besmear but still the hurt he yet received was slight for whilst the champion with redoubled might strikes home the javelin his retiring foe shrinks from the wound and disappoints the blow the dauntless hero still pursues his stroke and presses forward till a knotty oak retards his foe and stops him in the rear full in his throat he plunged the fatal spear that in the extended neck a passage found and pierced the solid timber through the wound fixed to the reeling trunk with many a stroke of his huge tail he lashed the sturdy oak till spent with toil and laboring hard for breath he now lay twisting in the pangs of death cadmus beheld him wallow in a flood of swimming poison intermixed with blood when suddenly a speech was heard from high the speech was heard nor was the speaker nigh  why do thou thus with secret pleasure see  insulting man what thou thy self shall be astonished at the voice he stood amazed and all around with inward horror gazed when pallas swift descending from the skies pallas the guardian of the bold and wise bids him plow up the field and scatter round the dragons teeth over all the furrowed ground then tells the youth how to his wondering eyes embattled armies from the field should rise he sows the teeth at pallass command and flings the future people from his hand the clods grow warm and crumble where he sows and now the pointed spears advance in rows now nodding plumes appear and shining crests now the broad shoulders and the rising breasts over all the field the breathing harvest swarms a growing host a crop of men and arms so through the parting stage a figure rears its body up and limb by limb appears by just degrees till all the man arise and in his full proportion strikes the eyes cadmus surpised and startled at the sight of his new foes prepared himself for fight when one cried out  forbear fond man forbear  to mingle in a blind promiscuous war this said he struck his brother to the ground himself expiring by anothers wound nor did the third his conquest long survive dying ever scarce he had begun to live the dire example ran through all the field till heaps of brothers were by brothers killed the furrows swam in blood and only five of all the vast increase were left alive echion one at pallass command let fall the guiltless weapon from his hand and with the rest a peaceful treaty makes whom cadmus as his friends and partners takes so founds a city on the promised earth and gives his new baeotian empire birth here cadmus reigned and now one would have guesst the royal founder in his exile blessed long did he live within his new abodes allied by marriage to the deathless gods and in a fruitful wifes embraces old a long increase of childrens children told but no frail man however great or high can be concluded blessed before he die actaeon was the first of all his race who grieved his grandsire in his borrowed face condemned by stern diana to bemoan the branching horns and visage not his own to shun his oncelovd dogs to bound away and from their huntsman to become their prey and yet consider why the change was wrought you will find it his misfortune not his fault or if a fault it was the fault of chance for how can guilt proceed from ignorance the transformation of actaeon into a stag in a fair chase a shady mountain stood well stored with game and marked with trails of blood here did the huntsmen till the heat of day pursue the stag and load themselves with prey when thus actaeon calling to the rest  my friends says he our sport is at the best  the sun is high advanced and downward sheds  his burning beams directly on our heads  then by consent abstain from further spoils  call off the dogs and gather up the toiles and ever to morrows sun begins his race  take the cool morning to renew the chase they all consent and in a cheerful train the jolly huntsmen laden with the slain return in triumph from the sultry plain down in a vale with pine and cypress clad refreshed with gentle winds and brown with shade the chaste dianas private haunt there stood full in the center of the darksome wood a spacious grotto all around oergrown with hoary moss and arched with pumicestone from out its rocky clefts the waters flow and trickling swell into a lake below nature had every where so played her part that every where she seemed to vie with art here the bright goddess toiled and chafed with heat was wont to bathe her in the cool retreat here did she now with all her train resort panting with heat and breathless from the sport her armorbearer laid her bow aside some loosed her sandals some her veil untied each busy nymph her proper part undrest while crocale more handy than the rest gathered her flowing hair and in a noose bound it together whilst her own hung loose five of the more ignoble sort by turns fetch up the water and unlade their urns now all undrest the shining goddess stood when young actaeon wilderd in the wood to the cool grott by his hard fate betrayed the fountains filled with naked nymphs surveyed the frighted virgins shrickd at the surprise the forest echoed with their piercing cries then in a huddle round their goddess pressed she proudly eminent above the rest with blushes glowed such blushes as adorn the ruddy welkin or the purple morn and though the crowding nymphs her body hide half backward shrunk and viewed him from aside surpised at first she would have snatched her bow but sees the circling waters round her flow these in the hollow of her hand she took and dashed em in his face while thus she spoke  tell if thou can the wondrous sight disclosed  a goddess naked to thy view exposed this said the man begun to disappear by slow degrees and ended in a deer a rising horn on either brow he wears and stretches out his neck and pricks his ears rough is his skin with sudden hairs oergrown his bosom pants with fears before unknown transformed at length he flies away in haste and wonders why he flies away so fast but as by chance within a neighboring brook he saw his branching horns and altered look wretched actaeon in a doleful tone he tried to speak but only gave a groan and as he wept within the watery glass he saw the big round drops with silent pace run trickling down a savage hairy face what should he do or seek his old abodes or herd among the deer and sculk in woods here shame dissuades him there his fear prevails and each by turns his aching heart assails as he thus ponders he behind him spies his opening hounds and now he hears their cries a generous pack or to maintain the chase or snuff the vapor from the scented grass he bounded off with fear and swiftly ran over craggy mountains and the flowery plain through brakes and thickets forced his way and flew through many a ring where once he did pursue in vain he often endeavored to proclaim his new misfortune and to tell his name nor voice nor words the brutal tongue supplies from shouting men and horns and dogs he flies deafend and stunned with their promiscuous cries when now the fleetest of the pack that pressed close at his heels and sprung before the rest had fastened on him straight another pair hung on his wounded haunch and held him there till all the pack came up and every hound tore the sad huntsman groveling on the ground who now appeared but one continued wound with dropping tears his bitter fate he moans and fills the mountain with his dying groans his servants with a piteous look he spies and turns about his supplicating eyes his servants ignorant of what had chanced with eager haste and joyful shouts advanced and called their lord actaeon to the game he shook his head in answer to the name he heard but wished he had indeed been gone or only to have stood a looker on but to his grief he finds himself too near and feels his ravenous dogs with fury tear their wretched master panting in a deer the birth of bacchus actaens sufferings and dianas rage did all the thoughts of men and gods engage some called the evils which diana wrought too great and disproportioned to the fault others again esteemed actaeons woes fit for a virgin goddess to impose the hearers into different parts divide and reasons are produced on either side juno alone of all that heard the news nor would condemn the goddess nor excuse she heeded not the justice of the deed but joyd to see the race of cadmus bleed for still she kept europa in her mind and for her sake detested all her kind besides to aggravate her hate she heard how semele to joves embrace preferred was now grown big with an immortal load and carried in her womb a future god thus terribly incensed the goddess broke to sudden fury and abruptly spoke  are my reproaches of so small a force  it is time i then pursue another course  it is decreed the guilty wretch shall die  if i am indeed the mistress of the sky  if rightly styled among the powers above  the wife and sister of the thundering jove  and none can sure a sisters right deny  it is decreed the guilty wretch shall die  she boasts an honor i can hardly claim  pregnant she rises to a mothers name while proud and vain she triumphs in her jove  and shows the glorious tokens of his love  but if i am still the mistress of the skies  by her own lover the fond beauty dies this said descending in a yellow cloud before the gates of semele she stood old beroes decrepit shape she wears her wrinkled visage and her hoary hairs whilst in her trembling gait she totters on and learns to tattle in the nurses tone the goddess thus disguised in age beguiled with pleasing stories her false fosterchild much did she talk of love and when she came to mention to the nymph her lovers name fetching a sigh and holding down her head  it is well says she if all be true that is said  but trust me child i am much inclined to fear  some counterfeit in this your jupiter  many an honest welldesigning maid  has been by these pretended gods betrayed  but if he be indeed the thundering jove  bid him when next he court the rites of love  descend triumphant from the etherial sky  in all the pomp of his divinity  encompasd round by those celestial charms  with which he fills the immortal junos arms the unwary nymph ensnared with what she said desired of jove when next he sought her bed to grant a certain gift which she would choose  fear not replied the god that i will refuse  whatever you ask may styx confirm my voice  choose what you will and you shall have your choice then says the nymph when next you seek my arms  may you descend in those celestial charms  with which your junos bosom you inflame  and fill with transport heavens immortal dame the god surpised would fain have stopped her voice but he had sworn and she had made her choice to keep his promise he ascends and shrowds his awful brow in whirlwinds and in clouds whilst all around in terrible array his thunders rattle and his lightenings play and yet the dazzling luster to abate he set not out in all his pomp and state clad in the mildest lightning of the skies and armed with thunder of the smallest size not those huge bolts by which the giants slain lay overthrown on the phlegrean plain twas of a lesser mould and lighter weight they call it thunder of a secondrate for the rough cyclops who by joves command tempered the bolt and turned it to his hand worked up less flame and fury in its make and quenched it sooner in the standing lake thus dreadfully adorned with horror bright the illustrious god descending from his height came rushing on her in a storm of light the mortal dame too feeble to engage the lightnings flashes and the thunders rage consumed amidst the glories she desired and in the terrible embrace expired but to preserve his offspring from the tomb jove took him smoking from the blasted womb and if on ancient tales we may rely enclosed the abortive infant in his thigh here when the babe had all his time fulfilled ino first took him for her fosterchild then the niseans in their dark abode nursed secretly with milk the thriving god the transformation of tiresias twas now while these transactions past on earth and bacchus thus procured a second birth when jove disposed to lay aside the weight of public empire and the cares of state as to his queen in nectar bowls he quaffd  in troth says he and as he spoke he laughed  the sense of pleasure in the male is far  more dull and dead than what you females share juno the truth of what was said denied tiresias therefore must the cause decide for he the pleasure of each sex had tried it happened once within a shady wood two twisted snakes he in conjunction viewed when with his staff their slimy folds he broke and lost his manhood at the fatal stroke but after sevn revolving years he viewed the selfsame serpents in the selfsame wood  and if says he such virtue in you lie  that he who dares your slimy folds untie  must change his kind a second stroke i will try again he struck the snakes and stood again newsexd and strait recovered into man him therefore both the deities create the sovereign umpire in their grand debate and he declared for jove when juno fired more than so trivial an affair required deprived him in her fury of his sight and left him groping round in sudden night but jove for so it is in heaven decreed that no one god repeal anothers deed irradiates all his soul with inward light and with the prophets art relieves the want of sight the transformation of echo famed far and near for knowing things to come from him the enquiring nations sought their doom the fair liriope his answers tried and first the unerring prophet justified this nymph the god cephisus had abused with all his winding waters circumfusd and on the nereid got a lovely boy whom the soft maids even then beheld with joy the tender dame sollicitous to know whether her child should reach old age or no consults the sage tiresias who replies  if ever he knows himself he surely dies long lived the dubious mother in suspense till time unriddled all the prophets sense narcissus now his sixteenth year began just turned of boy and on the verge of man many a friend the blooming youth caressed many a lovesick maid her flame confessed such was his pride in vain the friend caressed the lovesick maid in vain her flame confessed once in the woods as he pursued the chase the babbling echo had descried his face she who in others words her silence breaks nor speaks her self but when another speaks echo was then a maid of speech bereft of wonted speech for though her voice was left juno a curse did on her tongue impose to sport with every sentence in the close full often when the goddess might have caught jove and her rivals in the very fault this nymph with subtle stories would delay her coming till the lovers slipped away the goddess found out the deceit in time and then she cried  that tongue for this thy crime  which could so many subtle tales produce  shall be hereafter but of little use hence it is she prattles in a fainter tone with mimick sounds and accents not her own this lovesick virgin overjoyed to find the boy alone still followed him behind when glowing warmly at her near approach as sulphur blazes at the tapers touch she longed her hidden passion to reveal and tell her pains but had not words to tell she cannot begin but waits for the rebound to catch his voice and to return the sound the nymph when nothing could narcissus move still dashed with blushes for her slighted love lived in the shady covert of the woods in solitary caves and dark abodes where pining wandered the rejected fair till harrassd out and worn away with care the sounding skeleton of blood bereft besides her bones and voice had nothing left her bones are petrified her voice is found in vaults where still it doubles every sound the story of narcissus thus did the nymphs in vain caress the boy he still was lovely but he still was coy when one fair virgin of the slighted train thus prayed the gods provoked by his disdain  oh may he love like me and love like me in vain rhamnusia pitied the neglected fair and with just vengeance answered to her prayer there stands a fountain in a darksom wood nor stained with falling leaves nor rising mud untroubled by the breath of winds it rests unsullied by the touch of men or beasts high bowers of shady trees above it grow and rising grass and cheerful greens below pleased with the form and coolness of the place and overheated by the morning chase narcissus on the grassie verdure lies but whilst within the crystal fount he tries to quench his heat he feels new heats arise for as his own bright image he surveyed he fell in love with the fantastic shade and over the fair resemblance hung unmoved nor knew fond youth it was himself he loved the wellturnd neck and shoulders he descries the spacious forehead and the sparkling eyes the hands that bacchus might not scorn to show and hair that round apollos head might flow with all the purple youthfulness of face that gently blushes in the watery glass by his own flames consumed the lover lies and gives himself the wound by which he dies to the cold water often he joins his lips often catching at the beauteous shade he dips his arms as often from himself he slips nor knows he who it is his arms pursue with eager clasps but loves he knows not who what could fond youth this helpless passion move what kindle in thee this unpitied love thy own warm blush within the water glows with thee the colored shadow comes and goes its empty being on thy self relies step thou aside and the frail charmer dies still over the fountains watery gleam he stood mindless of sleep and negligent of food still viewed his face and languishd as he viewed at length he raised his head and thus began to vent his griefs and tell the woods his pain  you trees says he and thou surrounding grove  who often have been the kindly scenes of love  tell me if ever within your shades did lie  a youth so tortured so perplexed as i  i who before me see the charming   whilst there he stands and yet he   in such a maze of love my   and yet no bulwarkd town nor  coast  preserves the beauteous youth from being seen  no mountains rise nor oceans flow between  a shallow water hinders my embrace  and yet the lovely mimick wears a face  that kindly smiles and when i bend to join  my lips to his he fondly bends to mine  hear gentle youth and  my complaint  come from thy well  inhabitant my charms an easy conquest have obtained  over other hearts by thee alone disdained  but why should i despair i am sure he burns  with equal flames and languishes by turns  wheneer i stoop he offers at a kiss  and when my arms i stretch he stretches his  his eye with pleasure on my face he keeps  he smiles my smiles and when i weep he weeps  wheneer i speak his moving lips appear  to utter something which i cannot hear  ah wretched me i now begin too late  to find out all the longperplexd deceit  it is my self i love my self i see  the gay delusion is a part of me  i kindle up the fires by which i burn  and my own beauties from the well return  whom should i court how utter my complaint  enjoyment but produces my restraint  and too much plenty makes me die for want  how gladly would i from my self remove  and at a distance set the thing i love  my breast is warmed with such unusual fire  i wish him absent whom i most desire  and now i faint with grief my fate draws nigh  in all the pride of blooming youth i die  death will the sorrows of my heart relieve  oh might the visionary youth survive  i should with joy my latest breath resign  but oh i see his fate involved in mine this said the weeping youth again returned to the clear fountain where again he burned his tears defaced the surface of the well with circle after circle as they fell and now the lovely face but half appears oerrun with wrinkles and deformed with tears  ah whither cries narcissus do thou fly  let me still feed the flame by which i die  let me still see though i am no further blessed then rends his garment off and beats his breast his naked bosom reddend with the blow in such a blush as purple clusters show ere yet the suns autumnal heats refine their sprightly juice and mellow it to wine the glowing beauties of his breast he spies and with a new redoubled passion dies as wax dissolves as ice begins to run and trickle into drops before the sun so melts the youth and languishes away his beauty withers and his limbs decay and none of those attractive charms remain to which the slighted echo sud in vain she saw him in his present misery whom spite of all her wrongs she grieved to see she answered sadly to the lovers moan sighed back his sighs and groaned to every groan  ah youth beloved in vain narcissus cries  ah youth beloved in vain the nymph replies  farewell says he the parting sound scarce fell from his faint lips but she replied  farewell then on the unwholesome earth he gasping lies till death shuts up those selfadmiring eyes to the cold shades his flitting ghost retires and in the stygian waves it self admires for him the naiads and the dryads mourn whom the sad echo answers in her turn and now the sisternymphs prepare his urn when looking for his corpse they only found a rising stalk with yellow blossoms crowned the story of pentheus this sad event gave blind tiresias fame through greece established in a prophets name the unhallowd pentheus only durst deride the cheated people and their eyeless guide to whom the prophet in his fury said shaking the hoary honors of his head  twere well presumptuous man twere well for thee  if thou were eyeless too and blind like me  for the time comes nay it is already here  when the young gods solemnities appear  which if thou do not with just rites adorn  thy impious carcass into pieces torn  shall strew the woods and hang on every thorn  then then remember what i now foretell  and own the blind tiresias saw too well still pentheus scorns him and derides his skill but time did all the prophets threats fulfill for now through prostrate greece young bacchus rode whilst howling matrons celebrate the god all ranks and sexes to his orgies ran to mingle in the pomps and fill the train when pentheus thus his wicked rage expressed  what madness thebans has your souls possessed  can hollow timbrels can a drunken shout  and the lewd clamours of a beastly rout  thus quell your courage can the weak alarm  of womens yells those stubborn souls disarm  whom nor the sword nor trumpet ever could fright  nor the loud din and horror of a fight and you our sires who left your old abodes  and fixed in foreign earth your country gods  will you without a stroke your city yield  and poorly quit an undisputed field  but you whose youth and vigor should inspire  heroic warmth and kindle martial fire  whom burnished arms and crested helmets grace  not flowery garlands and a painted face  remember him to whom you stand allied  the serpent for his well of waters died  he fought the strong do you his courage show  and gain a conquest over a feeble foe  if thebes must fall oh might the fates afford  a nobler doom from famine fire or sword  then might the thebans perish with renown  but now a beardless victor sacks the town  whom nor the prancing steed nor ponderous shield  nor the hacked helmet nor the dusty field  but the soft joys of luxury and ease  the purple vests and flowery garlands please  stand then aside i will make the counterfeit  renounce his godhead and confess the cheat  acrisius from the grecian walls repelled  this boasted power why then should pentheus yield  go quickly drag the audacious boy to me  i will try the force of his divinity thus did the audacious wretch those rites profane his friends dissuade the audacious wretch in vain in vain his grandsire urged him to give over his impious threats the wretch but raves the more so have i seen a river gently glide in a smooth course and inoffensive tide but if with dams its current we restrain it bears down all and foams along the plain but now his servants came besmeared with blood sent by their haughty prince to seize the god the god they found not in the frantic throng but dragged a zealous votary along the mariners transformed to dolphins him pentheus viewed with fury in his look and scarce withheld his hands whilst thus he spoke  vile slave whom speedy vengeance shall pursue  and terrify thy base seditious crew  thy country and thy parentage reveal  and why thou joinst in these mad orgies tell the captive views him with undaunted eyes and armed with inward innocence replies  from high meonias rocky shores i came  of poor descent acoetes is my name  my sire was meanly born no oxen plowed  his fruitful fields nor in his pastures lowed  his whole estate within the waters lay  with lines and hooks he caught the finny prey  his art was all his livelihood which he  thus with his dying lips bequeathed to me  in streams my boy and rivers take thy chance  there swims said he thy whole inheritance  long did i live on this poor legacy  till tired with rocks and my old native sky  to arts of navigation i inclined  observed the turns and changes of the wind  learned the fit havens and began to note  the stormy hyades the rainy goat  the bright taygete and the shining bears with all the sailors catalogue of stars  once as by chance for delos i designed  my vessel driven by a strong gust of wind moored in a chian creek ashore i went  and all the following night in chios spent  when morning rose i sent my mates to bring  supplies of water from a neighboring spring  whilst i the motion of the winds explored  then summoned in my crew and went aboard  opheltes heard my summons and with joy  brought to the shore a soft and lovely boy  with more than female sweetness in his look  whom straggling in the neighboring fields he took  with fumes of wine the little captive glows  and nods with sleep and staggers as he goes  i viewed him nicely and began to trace  each heavenly feature each immortal grace  and saw divinity in all his face  i know not who said i this god should be  but that he is a god i plainly see  and thou whoeer thou art excuse the force  these men have used and oh befriend our course  pray not for us the nimble dictys cried  dictys that could the maintopmast bestride  and down the ropes with active vigor slide  to the same purpose old epopeus spoke  who overlooked the oars and timed the stroke  the same the pilot and the same the rest  such impious avarice their souls possessed  nay heaven forbid that i should bear away  within my vessel so divine a prey  said i and stood to hinder their intent  when lycabas a wretch for murder sent  from tuscany to suffer banishment  with his clenchd fist had struck me overboard  had not my hands in falling grasped a cord his base confederates the fact approve  when bacchus for twas he begun to move  waked by the noise and clamours which they raised  and shook his drowsy limbs and round him gazed  what means this noise he cries am i betrayed  ah whither whither must i be conveyed  fear not said proreus child but tell us where  you wish to land and trust our friendly care  to naxos then direct your course said he  naxos a hospitable port shall be  to each of you a joyful home to me  by every god that rules the sea or sky  the perjured villains promise to comply  and bid me hasten to unmoor the ship  with eager joy i launch into the deep  and heedless of the fraud for naxos stand  they whisper often and beckon with the hand  and give me signs all anxious for their prey  to tack about and fsteer another way  then let some other to my post succeed  said i i am guiltless of so foul a deed  what says ethalion must the ships whole crew  follow your humor and depend on you  and strait himself he seated at the prore  and tacked about and sought another shore  the beauteous youth now found himself betrayed  and from the deck the rising waves surveyed  and seemed to weep and as he wept he said  and do you thus my easy faith beguile  thus do you bear me to my native isle  will such a multitude of men employ  their strength against a weak defenseless boy in vain did i the godlike youth deplore  the more i begged they thwarted me the more  and now by all the gods in heaven that hear  this solemn oath by bacchus self i swear  the mighty miracle that did ensue  although it seems beyond belief is true  the vessel fixed and rooted in the flood  unmoved by all the beating billows stood  in vain the mariners would plow the main  with sails unfurled and strike their oars in vain  around their oars a twining ivy cleaves  and climbs the mast and hides the cords in leaves  the sails are covered with a cheerful green  and berries in the fruitful canvase seen  amidst the waves a sudden forest rears  its verdant head and a new spring appears  the god we now behold with opened eyes  a herd of spotted panthers round him lies  in glaring forms the grapy clusters spread  on his fair brows and dangle on his head  and whilst he frowns and brandishes his spear  my mates surpised with madness or with fear  leaped overboard first perjured madon found  rough scales and fins his stiffning sides surround  ah what cries one has thus transformed thy look  strait his own mouth grew wider as he spoke  and now himself he views with like surprise  still at his oar the industrious libys plies  but as he plies each busy arm shrinks in  and by degrees is fashioned to a fin  another as he catches at a cord  misses his arms and tumbling overboard with his broad fins and forky tail he laves  the rising surge and flounces in the waves  thus all my crew transformed around the ship  or dive below or on the surface leap  and spout the waves and wanton in the deep  full nineteen sailors did the ship convey  a shole of nineteen dolphins round her play  i only in my proper shape appear  speechless with wonder and half dead with fear  till bacchus kindly bid me fear no more  with him i landed on the chian shore  and him shall ever gratefully adore  this forging slave says pentheus would prevail  over our just fury by a farfetched tale  go let him feel the whips the swords the fire  and in the tortures of the rack expire the officious servants hurry him away and the poor captive in a dungeon lay but whilst the whips and tortures are prepared the gates fly open of themselves unbarrd at liberty the unfettered captive stands and flings the loosened shackles from his hands the death of pentheus but pentheus grown more furious than before resolved to send his messengers no more but went himself to the distracted throng where high cithaeron echoed with their song and as the fiery warhorse paws the ground and snorts and trembles at the trumpets sound transported thus he heard the frantic rout and raved and maddend at the distant shout a spacious circuit on the hill there stood level and wide and skirted round with wood here the rash pentheus with unhallowed eyes the howling dames and mystic orgies spies his mother sternly viewed him where he stood and kindled into madness as she viewed her leafy javelin at her son she cast and cries  the boar that lays our country waste  the boar my sisters aim the fatal dart  and strike the brindled monster to the heart pentheus astonished heard the dismal sound and sees the yelling matrons gathering round he sees and weeps at his approaching fate and begs for mercy and repents too late  help help my aunt autonoe he cried  remember how your own actaeon died deaf to his cries the frantic matron crops one stretchdout arm the other ino lops in vain does pentheus to his mother sue and the raw bleeding stumps presents to view his mother howled and heedless of his prayer her trembling hand she twisted in his hair  and this she cried shall be agaves share when from the neck his struggling head she tore and in her hands the ghastly visage bore with pleasure all the hideous trunk survey then pulled and tore the mangled limbs away as starting in the pangs of death it lay soon as the wood its leafy honors casts blown off and scattered by autumnal blasts with such a sudden death lay pentheus slain and in a thousand pieces strowd the plain by so distinguishing a

were paid at home impertinently busy stayed their wicked tasks they ply with various art and through the loom the sliding shuttle dart or at the fire to comb the wool they stand or twirl the spindle with a dextrous hand guilty themselves they force the guiltless in their maids who share the labor share the sin at last one sister cries who nimbly knew to draw nice threads and wind the finest clue while others idly rove and gods revere their fancied gods they know not who or where let us whom pallas taught her better arts still working cheer with mirthful chat our hearts and to deceive the time let me prevail with each by turns to tell some antique tale she said her sisters liked the humor well and smiling bad her the first story tell but she awhile profoundly seemed to muse perplexed amid variety to choose and knew not whether she should first relate the poor dircetis and her wondrous fate the palestines believe it to a man and show the lake in which her scales began or if she rather should the daughter sing who in the hoary verge of life took wing who soared from earth and dwelt in towers on high and now a dove she flits along the sky or how lewd nais when her lust was cloyed to fishes turned the youths she had enjoyed by powerful verse and herbs effect most strange at last the changer shared herself the change or how the tree which once white berries bore still crimson bears since stained with crimson gore the tree was new she likes it and begins to tell the tale and as she tells she spins the story of pyramus and thisbe in babylon where first her queen for state raised walls of brick magnificently great lived pyramus and thisbe lovely pair he found no eastern youth his equal there and she beyond the fairest nymph was fair a closer neighborhood was never known though two the houses yet the roof was one acquaintance grew the acquaintance they improve to friendship friendship ripened into love love had been crowned but impotently mad what parents could not hinder they forbad for with fierce flames young pyramus still burned and grateful thisbe flames as fierce returned aloud in words their thoughts they dare not break but silent stand and silent looks can speak the fire of love the more it is suppressed the more it glows and rages in the breast when the divisionwall was built a chink was left the cement unobserved to shrink so slight the cranny that it still had been for centuries unclosd because unseen but oh what thing so small so secret lies which scapes if formed for love a lovers eyes even in this narrow chink they quickly found a friendly passage for a trackless sound safely they told their sorrows and their joys in whispered murmurs and a dying noise by turns to catch each others breath they strove and sucked in all the balmy breeze of love often as on different sides they stood they cried malicious wall thus lovers to divide suppose thou should awhile to us give place to lock and fasten in a close embrace but if too much to grant so sweet a bliss indulge at least the pleasure of a kiss we scorn ingratitude to thee we know this safe conveyance of our minds we owe thus they their vain petition did renew till night and then they softly sighed adieu but first they strove to kiss and that was all their kisses died untasted on the wall soon as the morn had over the stars prevailed and warned by phoebus flowers their dews exhaled the lovers to their wellknown place return alike they suffer and alike they mourn at last their parents they resolve to cheat if to deceive in love be called deceit to steal by night from home and thence unknown to seek the fields and quit the unfaithful town but to prevent their wandering in the dark they both agree to fix upon a mark a mark that could not their designs expose the tomb of ninus was the mark they chose there they might rest secure beneath the shade which boughs with snowy fruit encumbered made a widespread mulberry its rise had took just on the margin of a gurgling brook impatient for the friendly dusk they stay and chide the slowness of departing day in western seas down sunk at last the light from western seas uprose the shades of night the loving thisbe even prevents the hour with cautious silence she unlocks the door and veils her face and marching through the gloom swiftly arrives at the assignationtomb for still the fearful sex can fearless prove boldly they act if spirited by love when lo a lioness rushed over the plain grimly besmeared with blood of oxen slain and what to the dire sight new horrors brought to slake her thirst the neighboring spring she sought which by the moon when trembling thisbe spies winged with her fear swift as the wind she flies and in a cave recovers from her fright but dropped her veil confounded in her flight when sated with repeated draughts again the queen of beasts scoured back along the plain she found the veil and mouthing it all over with bloody jaws the lifeless prey she tore the youth who could not cheat his guards so soon late came and noted by the glimmering moon some savage feet new printed on the ground his cheeks turned pale his limbs no vigor found but when advancing on the veil he spied distained with blood and ghastly torn he cried one night shall death to two young lovers give but she deserved unnumberd years to live it is i am guilty i have thee betrayed who came not early as my charming maid whatever slew thee i the cause remain i named and fixed the place where thou wast slain ye lions from your neighboring dens repair pity the wretch this impious body tear but cowards thus for death can idly cry the brave still have it in their power to die then to the appointed tree he hastes away the veil first gathered though all rent it lay the veil all rent yet still itself endears he kissed and kissing washed it with his tears though rich he cried with many a precious stain still from my blood a deeper tincture gain then in his breast his shining sword he drowned and fell supine extended on the ground as out again the blade he dying drew out spun the blood and streaming upwards flew so if a conduitpipe ever burst you saw swift spring the gushing waters through the flaw then spouting in a bow they rise on high and a new fountain plays amid the sky the berries stained with blood began to show a dark complexion and forgot their snow while fattend with the flowing gore the root was doomed for ever to a purple fruit mean time poor thisbe feared so long she stayed her lover might suspect a perjured maid her fright scarce over she strove the youth to find with ardent eyes which spoke an ardent mind already in his arms she hears him sigh at her destruction which was once so nigh the tomb the tree but not the fruit she knew the fruit she doubted for its altered hue still as she doubts her eyes a body found quivering in death and gasping on the ground she started back the red her cheeks forsook and every nerve with thrilling horrors shook so trembles the smooth surface of the seas if brushed over gently with a rising breeze but when her view her bleeding love confessed she shrieked she tore her hair she beat her breast she raised the body and embraced it round and bathed with tears unfeigned the gaping wound then her warm lips to the cold face applied and is it thus ah thus we meet she cried my pyramus whence sprung thy cruel fate my pyramus  ah speak ever it is too late i thy own thisbe but one word implore one word thy thisbe never asked before at thisbes name awaked he opened wide his dying eyes with dying eyes he tried on her to dwell but closed them slow and died the fatal cause was now at last explored her veil she knew and saw his sheathless sword from thy own hand thy ruin thou have found she said but love first taught that hand to wound even i for thee as bold a hand can show and love which shall as true direct the blow i will against the womans weakness strive and never thee lamented youth survive the world may say i caused alas thy death but saw thee breathless and resigned my breath fate though it conquers shall no triumph gain fate that divides us still divides in vain now both our cruel parents hear my prayer my prayer to offer for us both i dare oh see our ashes in one urn confined whom love at first and fate at last has joined the bliss you envied is not our request lovers when dead may sure together rest thou tree where now one lifeless lump is laid ever long over two shall cast a friendly shade still let our loves from thee be understood still witness in thy purple fruit our blood she spoke and in her bosom plunged the sword all warm and reeking from it is slaughtered lord the prayer which dying thisbe had preferred both gods and parents with compassion heard the whiteness of the mulberry soon fled and ripening saddend in a dusky red while both their parents their lost children mourn and mix their ashes in one golden urn thus did the melancholy tale conclude and a short silent interval ensued the next in birth unloosd her artful tongue and drew attentive all the sisterthrong the story of leucothoe and the sun the sun the source of light by beautys power once amorous grew then hear the suns amor venus and mars with his farpiercing eyes this god first spied this god first all things spies stung at the sight and swift on mischief bent to haughty junos shapeless son he went the goddess and her godgallant betrayed and told the cuckold where their pranks were played poor vulcan soon desired to hear no more he dropped his hammer and he shook all over then courage takes and full of vengeful ire he heaves the bellows and blows fierce the fire from liquid brass though sure yet subtle snares he forms and next a wondrous net prepares drawn with such curious art so nicely sly unseen the mashes cheat the searching eye not half so thin their webs the spiders weave which the most wary buzzing prey deceive these chains obedient to the touch he spread in secret foldings over the conscious bed the conscious bed again was quickly pressed by the fond pair in lawless raptures blessed mars wondered at his cythereas charms more fast than ever locked within her arms while vulcan the ivory doors unbarrd with care then called the gods to view the sportive pair the gods thronged in and saw in open day where mars and beautys queen all naked lay o shameful sight if shameful that we name which gods with envy viewed and could not blame but for the pleasure wished to bear the shame each deity with laughter tired departs yet all still laughed at vulcan in their hearts through heaven the news of this surprizal run but venus did not thus forget the sun he who stolen transports idly had betrayed by a betrayer was in kind repaid what now avails great god thy piercing blaze that youth and beauty and those golden rays thou who can warm this universe alone feelst now a warmth more powerful than thy own and those bright eyes which all things should survey know not from fair leucothoe to stray the lamp of light for human good designed is to one virgin niggardly confined sometimes too early rise thy eastern beams sometimes too late they set in western streams it is then her beauty thy swift course delays and gives to winter skies long summer days now in thy face thy lovesick mind appears and spreads through impious nations empty fears for when thy beamless head is wrapped in night poor mortals tremble in despair of light it is not the moon that over thee casts a veil it is love alone which makes thy looks so pale leucothoe is grown thy only care not phaetons fair mother now is fair the youthful rhodos moves no tender thought and beauteous persa is at last forgot fond clytie scorned yet loved and sought thy bed even then thy heart for other virgins bled leucothoe has all thy soul possessed and chased each rival passion from thy breast to this bright nymph eurynome gave birth in the blessed confines of the spicy earth excelling others she herself beheld by her own blooming daughter far excelled the sire was orchamus whose vast command the seventh from belus ruled the persian land deep in cool vales beneath the hesperian sky for the suns fiery steeds the pastures lie ambrosia there they eat and thence they gain new vigor and their daily toils sustain while thus on heavenly food the coursers fed and night around her gloomy empire spread the god assumed the mothers shape and air and passed unheeded to his darling fair close by a lamp with maids encompassed round the royal spinster fullemployd he found then cried awhile from work my daughter rest and like a mother scarce her lips he pressed servants retire  nor secrets dare to hear entrusted only to a daughters ear they swift obeyed not one suspicious thought the secret which their mistress would be taught then he since now no witnesses are near behold the god who guides the various year the worlds vast eye of light the source serene who all things sees by whom are all things seen believe me nymph for i the truth have showed thy charms have power to charm so great a god confused she heard him his soft passion tell and on the floor untwirld the spindle fell still from the sweet confusion some new grace blushed out by stealth and languishd in her face the lover now inflamed himself put on and out at once the god allradiant shone the virgin startled at his altered form too weak to bear a gods impetuous storm no more against the dazzling youth she strove but silent yielded and indulged his love this clytie knew and knew she was undone whose soul was fixed and doated on the sun she raged to think on her neglected charms and phoebus panting in anothers arms with envious madness fired she flies in haste and tells the king his daughter was unchaste the king incensed to hear his honor stained no more the father nor the man retained in vain she stretched her arms and turned her eyes to her loved god the enlightner of the skies in vain she owned it was a crime yet still it was a crime not acted by her will the brutal sire stood deaf to every prayer and deep in earth entombed alive the fair what phoebus could do was by phoebus done full on her grave with pointed beams he shone to pointed beams the gaping earth gave way had the nymph eyes her eyes had seen the day but lifeless now yet lovely still she lay not more the god wept when the world was fired and in the wreck his blooming boy expired the vital flame he strives to light again and warm the frozen blood in every vein but since resistless fates denied that power on the cold nymph he rained a nectarshowr ah undeserving thus he said to die yet still in odours thou shall reach the sky the body soon dissolved and all around perfumed with heavenly fragrancies the ground a sacrifice for gods uprose from thence a sweet delightful tree of frankincense the transformation of clytie though guilty clytie thus the sun betrayed by too much passion she was guilty made excess of love begot excess of grief grief fondly bad her hence to hope relief but angry phoebus hears unmoved her sighs and scornful from her loathed embraces flies all day all night in trackless wilds alone she pined and taught the listening rocks her moan on the bare earth she lies her bosom bare loose her attire disheveled is her hair nine times the morn unbarrd the gates of light as often were spread the alternate shades of night so long no sustenance the mourner knew unless she drunk her tears or sucked the dew she turned about but rose not from the ground turned to the sun still as he rould his round on his bright face hung her desiring eyes till fixed to earth she strove in vain to rise her looks their paleness in a flower retained but here and there some purple streaks they gained still the loved object the fond leafs pursue still move their root the moving sun to view and in the heliotrope the nymph is true the sisters heard these wonders with surprise but part received them as romantic lies and pertly rallied that they could not see in powers divine so vast an energy part owned true gods such miracles might do but owned not bacchus one among the true at last a common just request they make and beg alcithoe her turn to take i will she said and please you if i can then shot her shuttle swift and thus began the fate of daphnis is a fate too known whom an enamored nymph transformed to stone because she feared another nymph might see the lovely youth and love as much as she so strange the madness is of jealousy nor shall i tell what changes scython made and how he walked a man or trippd a maid you too would peevish frown and patience want to hear how celmis grew an adamant he once was dear to jove and saw of old jove when a child but what he saw he told crocus and smilax may be turned to flowers and the curetes spring from bounteous showers i pass a hundred legends stale as these and with sweet novelty your taste will please the story of salmacis and hermaphroditus by mr addison how salmacis with weak enfeebling streams softens the body and unnerves the limbs and what the secret cause shall here be shown the cause is secret but the effect is known the naids nursed an infant heretofore that cytherea once to hermes bore from both the illustrious authors of his race the child was named nor was it hard to trace both the bright parents through the infants face when fifteen years in idas cool retreat the boy had told he left his native seat and sought fresh fountains in a foreign soil the pleasure lessened the attending toil with eager steps the lycian fields he crossed and fields that border on the lycian coast a river here he viewed so lovely bright it showed the bottom in a fairer light nor kept a sand concealed from human sight the stream produced nor slimy ooze nor weeds nor miry rushes nor the spiky reeds but dealt enriching moisture all around the fruitful banks with cheerful verdure crowned and kept the spring eternal on the ground a nymph presides nor practiced in the chase nor skilful at the bow nor at the race of all the blueeyd daughters of the main the only stranger to dianas train her sisters often as it is said would cry  fie salmacis what always idle fie  or take thy quiver or thy arrows seize  and mix the toils of hunting with thy ease nor quiver she nor arrows ever would seize nor mix the toils of hunting with her ease but often would bathe her in the crystal tide often with a comb her dewy locks divide now in the limpid streams she views her face and dressed her image in the floating glass on beds of leaves she now reposed her limbs now gathered flowers that grew about her stream and then by chance was gathering as she stood to view the boy and longed for what she viewed fain would she meet the youth with hasty feet she fain would meet him but refused to meet before her looks were set with nicest care and well deserved to be reputed fair  bright youth she cries whom all thy features prove  a god and if a god the god of love  but if a mortal blessed thy nurses breast  blessed are thy parents and thy sisters blessed  but oh how blessed how more than blessed thy bride  allied in bliss if any yet allied  if so let mine the stolen enjoyments be  if not behold a willing bride in me the boy knew naught of love and touched with shame he strove and blushed but still the blush became in rising blushes still fresh beauties rose the sunny side of fruit such blushes shows and such the moon when all her silver white turns in eclipses to a ruddy light the nymph still begs if not a nobler bliss a cold salute at least a sisters kiss and now prepares to take the lovely boy between her arms he innocently coy replies  or leave me to my self alone  you rude uncivil nymph or i will be gone  fair stranger then says she it shall be so and for she feared his threats she feigned to go but hid within a coverts neighboring green she kept him still in sight herself unseen the boy now fancies all the danger over and innocently sports about the shore playsul and wanton to the stream he trips and dips his foot and shivers as he dips the coolness pleased him and with eager haste his airy garments on the banks he cast his godlike features and his heavenly hue and all his beauties were exposed to view his naked limbs the nymph with rapture spies while hotter passions in her bosom rise flush in her cheeks and sparkle in her eyes she longs she burns to clasp him in her arms and looks and sighs and kindles at his charms now all undrest upon the banks he stood and clapped his sides and leapt into the flood his lovely limbs the silver waves divide his limbs appear more lovely through the tide as lilies shut within a crystal case receive a glossy luster from the glass he is mine he is all my own the naid cries and flings off all and after him she flies and now she fastens on him as he swims and holds him close and wraps about his limbs the more the boy resisted and was coy the more she clipped and kissed the struggling boy so when the wrigling snake is snacht on high in eagles claws and hisses in the sky around the foe his twirling tail he flings and twists her legs and wriths about her wings the restless boy still obstinately strove to free himself and still refused her love amidst his limbs she kept her limbs intwind  and why coy youth she cries why thus unkind  oh may the gods thus keep us ever joined  oh may we never never part again so prayed the nymph nor did she pray in vain for now she finds him as his limbs she pressed grow nearer still and nearer to her breast till piercing each the others flesh they run together and incorporate in one last in one face are both their faces joined as when the stock and grafted twig combined shoot up the same and wear a common rind both bodies in a single body mix a single body with a double sex the boy thus lost in woman now surveyed the rivers guilty stream and thus he prayed he prayed but wondered at his softer tone surpised to hear a voice but half his own you parentgods whose heavenly names i bear hear your hermaphrodite and grant my prayer oh grant that whomsoeer these streams contain if man he entered he may rise again supple unsinewd and but half a man the heavenly parents answered from on high their twoshapd son the double votary then gave a secret virtue to the flood and tinged it is source to make his wishes good continued by mr eusden alcithoe and her sisters transformed to bats but mineus daughters still their tasks pursue to wickedness most obstinately true at bacchus still they laugh when all around unseen the timbrels hoarse were heard to sound saffron and myrrh their fragrant odours shed and now the present deity they dread strange to relate here ivy first was seen along the distaff crept the wondrous green then suddenspringing vines began to bloom and the soft tendrils curled around the loom while purple clusters dangling from on high tinged the wrought purple with a second die now from the skies was shot a doubtful light the day declining to the bounds of night the fabricks firm foundations shake all over false tigers rage and figured lions roar torches aloft seem blazing in the air and angry flashes of red lightenings glare to dark recesses the dire sight to shun swift the pale sisters in confusion run their arms were lost in pinions as they fled and subtle films each slender limb oerspread their altered forms their senses soon revealed their forms how altered darkness still concealed close to the roof each wondering upwards springs born on unknown transparent plumeless wings they strove for words their little bodies found no words but murmured in a fainting sound in towns not woods the sooty batts delight and never till the dusk begin their flight till vesper rises with his evening flame from whom the romans have derived their name the transformation of ino and melicerta to seagods the power of bacchus now over thebes had flown with awful reverence soon the god they own proud ino all around the wonder tells and on her nephewdeity still dwells of numerous sisters she alone yet knew no grief but grief which she from sisters drew imperial juno saw her with disdain vain in her offspring in her consort vain who ruled the trembling thebans with a nod but saw her vainest in her fostergod could then she cried a bastardboy have power to make a mother her own son devour could he the tuscan crew to fishes change and now three sisters damn to forms so strange yet shall the wife of jove find no relief shall she still unrevenged disclose her grief have i the mighty freedom to complain is that my power is that to ease my pain a foe has taught me vengeance and who ought to scorn that vengeance which a foe has taught what sure destruction frantic rage can throw the gaping wounds of slaughtered pentheus show why should not ino fired with madness stray like her mad sisters her own kindred slay why she not follow where they lead the way down a steep yawning cave where yews displayed in arches meet and lend a baleful shade through silent labyrinths a passage lies to mournful regions and infernal skies here styx exhales its noisome clouds and here the funeral rites once paid all souls appear stiff cold and horror with a ghastly face and staring eyes infest the dreary place ghosts newarrivd and strangers to these plains know not the palace where grim pluto reigns they journey doubtful nor the road can tell which leads to the metropolis of hell a thousand avenues those towers command a thousand gates for ever open stand as all the rivers disembogud find room for all their waters in old oceans womb so this vast city worlds of shades receives and space for millions still of worlds she leaves the unbodyd specter freely rove and show whatever they loved on earth they love below the lawyers still or right or wrong support the courtiers smoothly glide to plutos court still airy heroes thoughts of glory fire still the dead poet strings his deathless lyre and lovers still with fancied darts expire the queen of heaven to gratify her hate and sooth immortal wrath forgets her state down from the realms of day to realms of night the goddess swift precipitates her flight at hell arrived the noise hells porter heard the enormous dog his triple head upreard thrice from three grizly throats he howled profound then suppliant couched and stretched along the ground the trembling threshold which saturnia pressed the weight of such divinity confessed before a lofty adamantine gate which closed a tower of brass the furies sat misshapen forms tremendous to the sight the implacable foul daughters of the night a sounding whip each bloody sister shakes or from her tresses combs the curling snakes but now great junos majesty was known through the thick gloom allheavnly bright she shone the hideous monsters their obedience showed and rising from their seats submissive bowed this is the place of woe here groan the dead huge tityus over nine acres here is spread fruitful for pain the immortal liver bleeds still grows and still the insatiate vulture feeds poor tantalus to taste the water tries but from his lips the faithless water flies then thinks the bending tree he can command the tree starts backwards and eludes his hand the labor too of sisyphus is vain up the steep mount he heaves the stone with pain down from the summit rouls the stone again the belides their leaky vessels still are ever filling and yet never fill doomed to this punishment for blood they shed for bridegrooms slaughtered in the bridal bed stretched on the rouling wheel ixion lies himself he follows and himself he flies ixion tortured juno sternly cyd then turned and toiling sisyphus espied and why she said so wretched is the fate of him whose brother proudly reigns in state yet still my altars unadord have been by athamas and his presumptuous queen what caused her hate the goddess thus confessed what caused her journey now was more than guest that hate relentless its revenge did want and that revenge the furies soon could grant they could the glory of proud thebes efface and hide in ruin the cadmean race for this she largely promises entreats and to entreaties adds imperial threats then fell tisiphone with rage was stung and from her mouth the untwisted serpents flung to gain this trifling boon there is no need she cried in formal speeches to proceed whatever thou commandst to do is done believe it finished though not yet begun but from these melancholy seats repair to happier mansions and to purer air she spoke the goddess darting upwards flies and joyous reascends her native skies nor entered there till round her iris threw ambrosial sweets and poured celestial dew the faithful fury guiltless of delays with cruel haste the dire command obeys girt in a bloody gown a torch she shakes and round her neck twines speckled wreaths of snakes fear and dismay and agonizing pain with frantic rage complete her loveless train to thebes her flight she sped and hell forsook at her approach the theban turrets shook the sun shrunk back thick clouds the day oercast and springing greens were withered as she past now dismal yellings heard strange specter seen confound as much the monarch as the queen in vain to quit the palace they prepared tisiphone was there and kept the ward she wideextended her unfriendly arms and all the fury lavished all her harms part of her tresses loudly hiss and part spread poison as their forky tongues they dart then from her middle locks two snakes she drew whose merit from superior mischief grew the envenomed ruin thrown with spiteful care clung to the bosoms of the hapless pair the hapless pair soon with wild thoughts were fired and madness by a thousand ways inspired it is true the unwounded body still was sound but twas the soul which felt the deadly wound nor did the unsated monster here give over but dealt of plagues a fresh unnumberd store each baneful juice too well she understood foam churnd by cerberus and hydras blood hot hemlock and cold aconite she chose delighted in variety of woes whatever can untune the harmonious soul and its mild reasoning faculties control give false ideas raise desires profane and whirl in eddies the tumultuous brain mixed with cursed art she direfully around through all their nerves diffused the sad compound then tossed her torch in circles still the same improved their rage and added flame to flame the grinning fury her own conquest spied and to her rueful shades returned with pride and threw the exhausted useless snakes aside now athamas cries out his reason fled here fellowhunters let the toils be spread i saw a lioness in quest of food with her two young run roaring in this wood again the fancied savages were seen as through his palace still he chased his queen then tore learchus from her breast the child stretched little arms and on its father smiled a father now no more who now begun around his head to whirl his giddy son and quite insensible to natures call the helpless infant slung against the wall the same mad poison in the mother wrought young melicerta in her arms she

wreakd her hate on the cadmean race this juno heard and shall such elfs she cried dispute my justice or my power deride you too shall feel my wrath not idly spent a goddess never for insults was meant she who loved most and who most loved had been said not the waves shall part me from my queen she strove to plunge into the roaring flood fixed to the stone a stone herself she stood this on her

and all the man forsakes his breast strange prodigies confound his frighted eyes from the fair city which he raised he flies as if misfortune not pursued his race but only hung over that devoted place resolved by sea to seek some distant land at last he safely gained the illyrian strand chearless himself his consort still he chears hoary and loadend both with woes and years then to recount past sorrows they begin and trace them to the gloomy origin that serpent sure was hallowed cadmus cried which once my spear transfixed with foolish pride when the big teeth a seed before unknown by me along the wondering glebe were sown and sprouting armies by themselves overthrown if thence the wrath of heaven on me is bent may heaven conclude it with one sad event to an extended serpent change the man and while he spoke the wished for change began his skin with seagreen spots was varied round and on his belly prone he pressed the ground he glittered soon with many a golden scale and his shrunk legs closed in a spiry tail arms yet remained remaining arms he spread to his loved wife and human tears yet shed come my harmonia come thy face recline down to my face still touch what still is mine o let these hands while hands be gently pressed while yet the serpent has not all possessed more he had spoke but strove to speak in vain the forky tongue refused to tell his pain and learned

thought with wonted fondness an embrace he sought played round her neck in many a harmless twist and licked that bosom which a man he kissed the lookers on for lookers on there were shocked at the sight halfdyd away with fear the transformation was again renewed and like the husband changed the wife they viewed both serpents now with fold involved in fold to the next covert amicably rould there curled they lie or wave along the green fearless see men by men are fearless seen still mild and conscious what they once have been the story of perseus yet though this harsh inglorious fate they found each in the deathless grandson lived renowned through conquered india bacchus nobly rode and greece with temples hailed the conquering god in argos only proud acrisius reigned who all the consecrated rites profaned audacious wretch thus bacchus to deny and the great thunderers great son defy nor him alone thy daughter vainly strove brave perseus of celestial stem to prove and herself pregnant by a golden jove yet this was true and truth in time prevails acrisius now his unbelief bewails his former thought an impious thought he found and both the hero and the god were owned he saw already one in heaven was placed and one with more than mortal triumphs graced the victor perseus with the gorgonhead over libyan sands his airy journey sped the gory drops distilled as swift he flew and from each drop envenomed serpents grew the mischiefs brooded on the barren plains and still the unhappy fruitfulness remains atlas transformed to a mountain thence perseus like a cloud by storms was driven through all the expanse beneath the cope of heaven the jarring winds unable to control he saw the southern and the northern pole and eastward thrice and westward thrice was whirled and from the skies surveyed the nether world but when gray evening showed the verge of night he feared in darkness to pursue his flight he poised his pinions and forgot to soar and sinking closed them on the hesperian shore then begged to rest till lucifer begun to wake the morn the morn to wake the sun here atlas reigned of more than human size and in his kingdom the worlds limit lies here titan bids his wearied coursers sleep and cools the burning axle in the deep the mighty monarch uncontrolled alone his scepter sways no neighboring states are known a thousand flocks on shady mountains fed a thousand herds over grassy plains were spread here wondrous trees their shining stores unfold their shining stores too wondrous to be told their leafs their branches and their apples gold then perseus the gigantick prince addressed humbly implored a hospitable rest if bold exploits thy admiration fire he said i fancy mine thou will admire or if the glory of a race can move not mean my glory for i spring from jove at this confession atlas ghastly stard mindful of what an oracle declared that the dark womb of time concealed a day which should disclosed the bloomy gold betray all should at once be ravished from his eyes and joves own progeny enjoy the prize for this the fruit he loftily immured and a fierce dragon the strait pass secured for this all strangers he forbad to land and drove them from the inhospitable strand to perseus then fly quickly fly this coast nor falsely dare thy acts and race to boast in vain the hero for one night entreats threatening he storms and next adds force to threats by strength not perseus could himself defend for who in strength with atlas could contend but since short rest to me thou will not give a gift of endless rest from me receive he said and backward turned no more concealed the present and medusas head revealed soon the high atlas a high mountain stood his locks and beard became a leafy wood his hands and shoulders into ridges went the summithead still crowned the steep ascent his bones a solid rocky hardness gained he thus immensely grown as fate ordained the stars the heavens and all the gods sustained andromeda rescued from the sea monster now aeolus had with strong chains confined and deep imprisoned every blustering wind the rising phospher with a purple light did sluggish mortals to new toils invite his feet again the valiant perseus plumes and his keen sabre in his hand resumes then nobly spurns the ground and upwards springs and cuts the liquid air with sounding wings over various seas and various lands he past till aethiopias shore appeared at last andromeda was there doomed to atone by her own ruin follies not her own and if injustice in a god can be such was the libyan gods unjust decree chained to a rock she stood young perseus stayed his rapid flight to view the beauteous maid so sweet her frame so exquisitely fine she seemed a statue by a hand divine had not the wind her waving tresses showed and down her cheeks the melting sorrows flowed her faultless form the heros bosom fires the more he looks the more he still admires the admirer almost had forgot to fly and swift descended fluttering from on high o virgin worthy no such chains to prove but pleasing chains in the soft folds of love thy country and thy name he said disclose and give a true rehearsal of thy woes a quick reply her bashfulness refused to the free converse of a man unused her rising blushes had concealment found from her spread hands but that her hands were bound she acted to her full extent of power and bathed her face with a fresh silent shower but by degrees in innocence grown bold her name her country and her birth she told and how she suffered for her mothers pride who with the nercids once in beauty vyd part yet untold the seas began to roar and mounting billows tumbled to the shore above the waves a monster raised his head his body over the deep was widely spread onward he flouncd aloud the virgin cries each parent to her shrieks in shrieks replies but she had deepest cause to rend the skies weeping to her they cling no sign appears of help they only lend their helpless tears too long you vent your sorrows perseus said short is the hour and swift the time of aid in me the son of thundering jove behold got in a kindly shower of fruitful gold medusas snaky head is now my prey and through the clouds i boldly wing my way if such desert be worthy of esteem add if your daughter i from death redeem shall she be mine shall it not then be thought a bride so lovely was too cheaply bought for her my arms i willingly employ if i may beauties which i save enjoy the parents eagerly the terms embrace for who would slight such terms in such a case nor her alone they promise but beside the dowry of a kingdom with the bride as wellriggd galleys which slaves sweating row with their sharp beaks the whitened ocean plough so when the monster moved still at his back the furrowed waters left a foamy track now to the rock he was advanced so nigh whirled from a sling a stone the space would fly then bounding upwards the brave perseus sprung and in mid air on hovering pinions hung his shadow quickly floated on the main the monster could not his wild rage restrain but at the floating shadow leaped in vain as when joves bird a speckled serpent spies which in the shine of phoebus basking lies unseen he souses down and bears away trussed from behind the vainly hissing prey to writh his neck the labor naught avails too deep the imperial talons pierce his scales thus the winged hero now descends now soars and at his pleasure the vast monster gores full in his back swiftstooping from above the crooked sabre to its hilt he drove the monster raged impatient of the pain first bounded high and then sunk low again now like a savage boar when chafed with wounds and bayd with opening mouths of hungry hounds he on the foe turns with collected might who still eludes him with an airy flight and wheeling round the scaly armor tries of his thick sides his thinner tail now plies till from repeated strokes outgushd a flood and the waves reddend with the streaming blood at last the dropping wings befoamd all over with flaggy heaviness their master bore a rock he spied whose humble head was low bare at an ebb but covered at a flow a ridgy hold he thither flying gained and with one hand his bending weight sustained with the other vigorous blows he dealt around and the homethrusts the expiring monster owned in deafning shouts the glad applauses rise and peal on peal runs rattling through the skies the saviouryouth the royal pair confess and with heaved hands their daughters bridegroom bless the beauteous bride moves on now loosed from chains the cause and sweet reward of all the heros pains mean time on shore triumphant perseus stood and purged his hands smeared with the monsters blood then in the windings of a sandy bed composed medusas execrable head but to prevent the roughness leafs he threw and young green twigs which soft in waters grew there soft and full of sap but here when laid touched by the head that softness soon decayed the wonted flexibility quite gone the tender scyons hardened into stone fresh juicy twigs surprised the nereids brought fresh juicy twigs the same contagion caught the nymphs the petrifying seeds still keep and propagate the wonder through the deep the pliant sprays of coral yet declare their stiffning nature when exposed to air those sprays which did like bending osiers move snatched from their element obdurate prove and shrubs beneath the waves grow stones above the great immortals grateful perseus praised and to three powers three turfy altars raised to hermes this and that he did assign to pallas the mid honors jove were thine he hastes for pallas a white cow to cull a calf for hermes but for jove a bull then seized the prize of his victorious fight andromeda and claimed the nuptial rite andromeda alone he greatly sought the dowrykingdom was not worth his thought pleased hymen now his golden torch displays with rich oblations fragrant altars blaze sweet wreaths of choicest flowers are hung on high and cloudless pleasure smiles in every eye the melting music melting thoughts inspires and warbling songsters aid the warbling lyres the palace opens wide in pompous state and by his peers surrounded cepheus sat a feast was served fit for a king to give and fit for godlike heroes to receive the banquet ended the gay cheerful bowl moved round and brightened and enlarged each soul then perseus asked what customs there obtained and by what laws the people were restrained which told the teller a like freedom takes and to the warrior his petition makes to know what arts had won medusas snakes the story of medusas head the hero with his just request complies shows how a vale beneath cold atlas lies where with aspiring mountains fenced around he the two daughters of old phorcus found fate had one common eye to both assigned each saw by turns and each by turns was blind but while our strove to lend her sister sight he stretched his hand and stole their mutual light and left both eyeless both involved in night through devious wilds and trackless woods he past and at the gorgonseats arrived at last but as he journeyd pensive he surveyed what wasteful havoc dire medusa made here stood still breathing statues men before there rampant lions seemed in stone to roar nor did he yet affrighted quit the field but in the mirror of his polished shield reflected saw medusa slumbers take and not one serpent by good chance awake then backward an unerring blow he sped and from her body lopd at once her head the gore prolifick proved with sudden force sprung pegasus and winged his airy course the heavenborn warrior faithfully went on and told the numerous dangers which he run what subject seas what lands he had in view and nigh what stars the adventurous hero flew at last he silent sat the listening throng sighed at the pause of his delightful tongue some begged to know why this alone should wear of all the sisters such destructive hair great perseus then with me you shall prevail worth the relation to relate a tale medusa once had charms to gain her love a rival crowd of envious lovers strove they who have seen her own they never did trace more moving features in a sweeter face yet above all her length of hair they own in golden ringlets waved and graceful shone her neptune saw and with such beauties fired resolved to compass what his soul desired in chaste minervas fane he lustful stayed and seized and rifled the young blushing maid the bashful goddess turned her eyes away nor durst such bold impurity survey but on the ravished virgin vengeance takes her shining hair is changed to hissing snakes these in her aegis pallas joys to bear the hissing snakes her foes more sure ensnare than they did lovers once when shining hair the end of the fourth book to the right honorable the countess of warwick e kirkall  ovids metamorphoses book v translated by arthur maynwaring esquire the story of perseus continued while perseus entertained with this report his father cepheus and the listening court within the palace walls was heard aloud the roaring noise of some unruly crowd not like the songs which cheerful friends prepare for nuptial days but sounds that threatened war and all the pleasures of this happy feast to tumult turned in wild disorder ceased so when the sea is calm we often find a storm raised sudden by some furious wind chief in the riot phineus first appeared the rash ringleader of this boisterous herd and brandishing his brazenpointed lance behold he said an injured man advance stung with resentment for his ravished wife nor shall thy wings o perseus save thy life nor jove himself though we have been often told who got thee in the form of tempting gold his lance was aimed when cepheus ran and said hold brother hold what brutal rage has made your frantic mind so black a crime conceive are these the thanks that you to perseus give this the reward that to his worth you pay whose timely valor saved andromeda nor was it he if you would reason right that forced her from you but the jealous spite of envious nereids and joves high decree and that devouring monster of the sea that ready with his jaws widegaping stood to eat my child the fairest of my blood you lost her then when she seemed past relief and wished perhaps her death to ease your grief with my afflictions not content to view andromeda in chains unhelpd by you her spouse and uncle will you grieve that he exposed his life the dying maid to free and shall you claim his merit had you thought her charms so great you should have bravely sought that blessing on the rocks where fixed she lay but now let perseus bear his prize away by service gained by promised faith possessed to him i owe it that my age is blessed still with a child nor think that i prefer perseus to thee but to the loss of her phineus on him and perseus rould about his eyes in silent rage and seemed to doubt which to destroy till resolute at length he threw his spear with the redoubled strength his fury gave him and at perseus struck but missing perseus in his seat it stuck who springing nimbly up returned the dart and almost plunged it in his rivals heart but he for safety to the altar ran unfit protection for so vile a man yet was the stroke not vain as rhaetus found who in his brow received a mortal wound headlong he tumbled when his skull was broke from which his friends the fatal weapon took while he lay trembling and his gushing blood in crimson streams around the table flowed but this provoked the unruly rabble worse they flung their darts and some in loud discourse to death young perseus and the monarch doom but cepheus left before the guilty room with grief appealing to the gods above who laws of hospitality approve who faith protect and succor injured right that he was guiltless of this barbarous fight pallas her brother perseus close attends and with her ample shield from harm defends raising a sprightly courage in his heart but indian athis took the weaker part born in the crystal grottoes of the sea limnates son a fenny nymph and she daughter of ganges graceful was his mein his person lovely and his age sixteen his habit made his native beauty more a purple mantle fringed with gold he wore his neck wellturnd with golden chains was graced his hair with myrrh perfumed was nicely dressed though with just aim he could the javelin throw yet with more skill he drew the bending bow and now was drawing it with artful hand when perseus snatching up a flaming brand whirled sudden at his face the burning wood crushed his eyes in and quenched the fire with blood through the soft skin the splinterd bones appear and spoiled the face that lately was so fair when lycabas his athis thus beheld how was his heart with friendly horror filled a youth so noble to his soul so dear to see his shapeless look his dying groans to hear he snatched the bow the boy was used to bend and cried with me false traitor dare contend boast not a conquest over a child but try thy strength with me who all thy powers defy nor think so mean an act a victory while yet he spoke he flung the whizzing dart which pierced the plaited robe but missed his heart perseus defied upon him fiercely pressed with sword unsheathed and plunged it in his breast his eyes overwhelmed with night he stumbling falls and with his latest breath on athis calls pleased that so near the lovely youth he lies he sinks his head upon his friend and dies next eager phorbas old methions son came rushing forward with amphimedon when the smooth pavement slippery made with gore tripd up their feet and flung em on the floor the sword of perseus who by chance was nigh prevents their rise and where they fall they lie full in his ribs amphimedon he smote and then stuck fiery phorbas in the throat eurythus lifting up his ax the blow was thus prevented by his nimble foe a golden cup he seizes high embost and at his head the massy goblet tossed it hits and from his forehead bruised rebounds and blood and brains he vomits from his wounds with his slain fellows on the floor he lies and death for ever shuts his swimming eyes then polydaemon fell a goddessborn phlegias and elycen with locks unshorn next followed next the stroke of death he gave to clytus abanis and lycetus brave while over unnumberd heaps of ghastly dead the argive heros feet triumphant tread but phineus stands aloof and dreads to feel his rivals force and flies his pointed steel yet threw a dart from far by chance it lights on idas who for neither party fights but wounded sternly thus to phineus said since of a neuter thou a foe have made this i return thee drawing from his side the dart which as he strove to fling he died odites fell by clymenuss sword the cephen court had not a greater lord hypseus his blade does in protenor sheath but brave lyncides soon revenged his death here too was old emathion one that feared the gods and in the cause of heaven appeared who only wishing the success of right and by his age exempted from the fight both sides alike condemns this impious war cease cease he cries these bloody broils forbear this scarce the sage with high concern had said when chromis at a blow struck off his head which dropping on the royal altar rould still staring on the crowd with aspect bold and still it seemed their horrid strife to blame in life and death his pious zeal the same while clinging to the horns the trunk expires the severed head consumes amidst the fires then phineus who from far his javelin threw broteas and ammon twins and brothers slew for knotted gauntlets matchless in the field but gauntlets must to swords and javelins yield ampycus next with hallowed fillets bound as ceres priest and with a mitre crowned his spear transfixed and struck him to the ground o lapetides with pain i tell how you sweet lyrist in the riot fell what worse than brutal rage his breast could fill who did thy blood o bard celestial spill kindly you pressed amid the princely throng to crown the feast and give the nuptial song discord abhorred the music of thy lyre whose notes did gentle peace so well inspire thee when fierce pettalus far off espied defenseless with thy harp he scoffing cried go to the ghosts thy soothing lessons play we loath thy lyre and scorn thy peaceful lay and as again he fiercely bid him go he pierced his temples with a mortal blow his harp he held though sinking on the ground whose strings in death his trembling fingers found by chance and tuned by chance a dying sound with grief lycormas saw him fall from far and wresting from the door a massy bar full in his poll lays on a load of knocks which stun him and he falls like a devoted ox another bar pelates would have snatched but corythus his motions slily watched he darts his weapon from a private stand and rivets to the post his veiny hand when strait a missive spear transfixed his side by abas thrown and as he hung he died melaneus on the princes side was slain and dorylas who owned a fertile plain of nasamonias fields the wealthy lord whose crowded barns could scarce contain their hoard a whizzing spear obliquely gave a blow stuck in his groin and pierced the nerves below his foe beheld his eyes convulsive roll his ebbing veins and his departing soul then taunting said of all thy spacious plains this spot thy only property remains he left him thus but had no sooner left than perseus in revenge his nostrils cleft from his friends breast the murdering dart he drew and the same weapon at the murderer threw his head in halves the darted javelin cut and on each side the brain came issuing out fortune his friend his deaths around he deals and this his lance and that his faulchion feels now clytius dies and by a different wound the twin his brother clanis bites the ground in his rent jaw the bearded weapon sticks and the steeled dart does clytius thigh transfix with these mendesian celadon he slew and astreus next whose mother was a jew his sire uncertain then by perseus fell aethion who could things to come foretell but now he knows not whence the javelin flies that wounds his breast nor by whose arm he dies the squire to phineus next his valor tried and fierce agyrtes stained with parricide as these are slain fresh numbers still appear and wage with perseus an unequal war to rob him of his right the maid he won by honor promise and desert his own with him the father of the beauteous bride the mother and the frighted virgin side with shrieks and doleful cries they rend the air their shrieks confounded with the din of war with clashing arms and groanings of the slain they grieve unpitied and unheard complain the floor with ruddy streams bellona stains and phineus a new war with double rage maintains perseus begirt from all around they pour their lances on him a tempestuous shower aimed all at him a cloud of darts and spears or blind his eyes or whistle round his ears their numbers to resist against the wall he guards his back secure and dares them all here from the left molpeus renews the fight and bold ethemon presses on the right as when a hungry tiger near him hears two lowing herds awhile he both forbears nor can his hopes of this or that renounce so strong he lusts to prey on both at once thus perseus now with that or this is loath to war distinct but fain would fall on both and first chaonian molpeus felt his blow and fled and never after faced his foe then fierce ethemon as he turned his back hurried with fury aiming at his neck his brandished sword against the marble struck with all his might the brittle weapon broke and in his throat the point rebounding stuck too slight the wound for life to issue thence and yet too great for battle or defense his arms extended in this piteous state for mercy he would sue but sues too late perseus has in his bosom plunged the sword and ere he speaks the wound prevents the word the crowds increasing and his friends distressed himself by warring multitudes oppressed since thus unequally you fight it is time he cried to punish your presumptuous crime beware my friends his friends were soon prepared their sight averting high the head he reared and gorgon on his foes severely stard vain shift says thescelus with aspect bold thee and thy bugbear monster i behold with scorn he lifts his arm but ere he threw the dart the hero to a statue grew in the same posture still the marble stands and holds the warriors weapons in its hands amphyx whom yet this wonder cannot alarm heaves at lyncides breast his impious arm but while thus daringly he presses on his weapon and his arm are turned to stone next nileus he who vainly said he owed his origin to niles prolifick flood who on his shield seven silver rivers bore his birth to witness by the arms he wore full of his sevnfold father thus expressed his boast to perseus and his pride confessed see whence we sprung let this thy comfort be in thy sure death that thou did die by me while yet he spoke the dying accents hung in sounds imperfect on his marble tongue though changed to stone his lips he seemed to stretch and through thinsensate rock would force a speech this eryx saw but seeing would not own the mischief by your selves he cries is done it is your cold courage turns your hearts to stone come follow me fall on the stripling boy kill him and you his magic arms destroy then rushing on his arm to strike he reared and marbled over his varied frame appeared these for affronting pallas were chastisd and justly met the death they had despised but brave aconteus perseus friend by chance looked back and met the gorgons fatal glance a statue now become he ghastly stares and still the foe to mortal combat dares astyages the living likeness knew on the dead stone with vengeful fury flew but impotent his rage the jarring blade no print upon the solid marble made again as with redoubled might he struck himself astonished in the quarry stuck the vulgar deaths twere tedious to rehearse and fates below the dignity of verse their safety in their flight two hundred found two hundred by medusas head were stoned fierce phineus now repents the wrongful fight and views his varied friends a dreadful sight he knows their faces for their help he sues and thinks not hearing him that they refuse by name he begs their succor one by one then doubts their life and feels the friendly stone struck with remorse and conscious of his pride convict of sin he turned his eyes aside with suppliant mein to perseus thus he prays hence with the head as far as winds and seas can bear thee hence o quit the cephen shore and never curse us with medusa more that horrid head which stiffens into stone those impious men who daring death look on i warred not with thee out of hate or strife my honest cause was to defend my wife first pledged to me what crime could i suppose to arm my friends and vindicate my spouse but vain too late i so was our design mine was the title but the merit thine contending made me guilty i confess but penitence should make that guilt the less twas thine to conquer by minervas power favored of heaven thy mercy i implore for life i sue the rest to thee i yield in pity from my sight remove the shield he suing said nor durst revert his eyes on the grim head and perseus thus replies coward what is in me to grant i will nor blood unworthy of my valor spill fear not to perish by my vengeful sword from that secure it is all the fates afford where i now see thee thou shall still be seen a lasting monument to please our queen there still shall thy betrothed behold her spouse and find his image in her fathers house this said where phineus turned to shun the shield full in his face the staring head he held as here and there he strove to turn aside the wonder wrought the man was petrified all marble was his frame his humid eyes dropped tears which hung upon the stone like ice in suppliant posture with uplifted hands and fearful look the guilty statue stands hence perseus to his native city hies victorious and rewarded with his prize conquest over praetus the usurper won he reinstates his grandsire in the throne praetus his brother dispossessed by might his realm enjoyed and still detained his right but perseus pulled the haughty tyrant down and to the rightful king restored the throne weak was the usurper as his cause was wrong where gorgons head appears what arms are strong when perseus to his host the monster held they soon were statues and their king expelled thence to seriphus with the head he sails whose prince his story treats as idle tales lord of a little isle he scorns to seem too credulous but laughs at that and him yet did he not so much suspect the truth as out of pride or envy hate the youth the argive prince at his contempt enraged to force his faith by fatal proof engaged friends shut your eyes he cries his shield he takes and to the king exposed medusas snakes the monarch felt the power he would not own and stood convict of folly in the stone minervas interview with the muses thus far minerva was content to rove with perseus offspring of her father jove now hid in clouds seriphos she forsook and to the theban towers her journey took cythnos and gyaros lying to the right she passed unheeded in her eager flight and choosing first on helicon to rest the virgin muses in these words addressed me the strange tidings of a newfound spring ye learned sisters to this mountain bring if all be true that fames wide rumors tell twas pegasus discovered first your well whose piercing hoof gave the soft earth a blow which broke the surface where these waters flow i saw that horse by miracle obtain life from the blood of dire medusa slain and now this equal prodigy to view from distant isles to famed boeotia flew the muse urania said whatever cause so great a goddess to this mansion draws our shades are happy with so bright a guest you queen are welcome and we muses blessed what fame has published of our spring is true thanks for our spring to pegasus are due then with becoming courtesy she led the curious stranger to their fountains head who long surveyed with wonder and delight their sacred water charming to the sight their ancient groves dark grottos shady bowers and smiling plains adorned with various flowers o happy muses she with rapture cried who safe from cares on this fair hill reside blessed in your seat and free your selves to please with joys of study and with glorious ease the fate of pyreneus then one replies o goddess fit to guide our humble works and in our choir preside who sure would wisely to these fields repair to taste our pleasures and our labors share were not your virtue and superior mind to higher arts and nobler deeds inclined justly you praise our works and pleasing seat which all might envy in this soft retreat were we secured from dangers and from harms but maids are frightened with the least alarms and none are safe in this licentious time still fierce pyreneus and his daring crime with lashing horror strikes my feeble sight nor is my mind recovered from the fright with thracian arms this bold usurper gained daulis and phocis where he proudly reigned it happened once as through his lands we went for the bright temple of parnassus bent he met us there and in his artful mind hiding the faithless action he designed conferred on us whom oh too well he knew all honors that to goddesses are due stop stop ye muses it is your friend who calls the tyrant said behold the rain that falls on every side and that illboding sky whose lowering face portends more storms are nigh pray make my house your own and void of fear while this bad weather lasts take shelter here gods have made meaner places their resort and for a cottage left their shining court obliged to stop by the united force of pouring rains and complaisant discourse his courteous invitation we obey and in his hall resolve awhile to stay soon it cleared up the clouds began to fly the driving north refined the showry sky then to pursue our journey we began but the false traitor to his portal ran stopped our escape the door securely barred and to our honor violence prepared but we transformed to birds avoid his snare on pinions rising in the yielding air but he by lust and indignation fired up to his highest tower with speed retired and cries in vain you from my arms withdrew the way you go your lover will pursue then in a flying posture wildly placed and daring from that height himself to cast the wretch fell headlong and the ground bestrewd with broken bones and stains of guilty blood the story of the pierides the muse yet spoke when they began to hear a noise of wings that fluttered in the air and strait a voice from some high spreading bough seemed to salute the company below the goddess wondered and inquired from whence that tongue was heard that spoke so plainly sense it seemed to her a human voice to be but proved a birds for in a shady tree nine magpies perched lament their altered state and what they hear are skilful to repeat the sister to the wondering goddess said these foiled by us by us were thus repaid these did evippe of paeonia bring with nine hard labourpangs to pellas king the foolish virgins of their number proud and puffed with praises of the senseless crowd through all achaia and the aemonian plains defied us thus to match their artless strains no more ye thespian girls your notes repeat nor with false harmony the vulgar cheat in voice or skill if you with us will vye as many we in voice or skill will try surrender you to us if we excel famed aganippe and medusas well the conquest yours your prize from us shall be the aemathian plains to snowy paeone the nymphs our judges to dispute the field we thought a shame but greater shame to yield on seats of living stone the sisters sit and by the rivers swear to judge aright the song of the pierides then rises one of the presumptuous throng steps rudely forth and first begins the song with vain address describes the giants wars and to the gods their fabled acts prefers she sings from earths dark womb how typhon rose and struck with mortal fear his heavenly foes how the gods fled to egypts slimy soil and hid their heads beneath the banks of nile how typhon from the conquered skies pursued their routed godheads to the sevnmouthd flood forced every god his fury to escape some beastly form to take or earthly shape jove so she sung was changed into a ram from whence the horns of libyan ammon came bacchus a goat apollo was a crow phaebe a cat the wife of jove a cow whose hue was whiter than the falling snow mercury to a nasty ibis turned the change obscene afraid of typhon mourned while venus from a fish protection craves and once more plunges in her native waves she sung and to her harp her voice applied then us again to match her they defied but our poor song perhaps for you to hear nor leisure serves nor is it worth your ear that causeless doubt remove o muse rehearse the goddess cried your evergrateful verse beneath a checkered shade she takes her seat and bids the sister her whole song repeat the sister thus calliope we chose for the performance the sweet virgin rose with ivy crowned she tunes her golden strings and to her harp this composition sings the song of the muses first ceres taught the laboring hind to plow the pregnant earth and quickening seed to sow she first for man did wholesome food provide and with just laws the wicked world supplied all good from her derived to her belong the grateful tributes of the muses song her more than worthy of our verse we deem oh were our verse more worthy of the theme jove on the giant fair trinacria hurled and with one bolt revenged his starry world beneath her burning hills typhaeus lies and struggling always strives in vain to rise down does pelorus his right hand suppress toward latium on the left pachyne weighs his legs are under lilybaecum spread and aetna presses hard his horrid head on his broad back he there extended lies and vomits clouds of ashes to the skies often laboring with his load at last he tires and spews out in revenge a flood of fires mountains he struggles to overwhelm and towns earths inmost bowels quake and nature groans his terrors reach the direful king of hell he fears his throws will to the day reveal the realms of night and fright his trembling ghosts this to prevent he quits the stygian coasts in his black carr by sooty horses drawn fair sicily he seeks and dreads the dawn around her plains he casts his eager eyes and every mountain to the bottom tries but when in all the careful search he saw no cause of fear no ill suspected flaw secure from harm and wandering on at will venus beheld him from her flowery hill when strait the dame her little cupid pressed with secret rapture to her snowy breast and in these words the fluttering boy addressed o thou my arms my glory and my power my son whom men and deathless gods adore bend thy sure bow whose arrows never missed no longer let hells king thy sway resist take him while straggling from his dark abodes he coasts the kingdoms of superior gods if sovereign jove if gods who rule the waves and neptune who rules them have been thy slaves shall hell be free the tyrant strike my son enlarge thy mothers empire and thy own let not our heaven be made the mock of hell but pluto to confess thy power compel our rule is slighted in our native skies see pallas see diana too defies thy darts which ceres daughter would despise she too our empire treats with awkward scorn such insolence no longers to be born revenge our slighted reign and with thy dart transfix the virgins to the uncles heart she said and from his quiver strait he drew a dart that surely would the business do she guides his hand she makes her touch the test and of a thousand arrows chose the best no feather better poised a sharper head none had and sooner none and surer sped he bends his bow he draws it to his ear through plutos heart it drives and fixes there the rape of proserpine near ennas walls a spacious lake is spread famed for the sweetlysinging swans it bred pergusa is its name and never more were heard or sweeter on caysters shore woods crown the lake and phoebus never invades the tufted fences or offends the shades fresh fragrant breezes fan the verdant bowers and the moist ground smiles with enameled flowers the cheerful birds their airy carols sing and the whole year is one eternal spring here while young proserpine among the maids diverts herself in these delicious shades while like a child with busy speed and care she gathers lillies here and vilets there while first to fill her little lap she strives hells grizly monarch at the shade arrives sees her thus sporting on the flowery green and loves the blooming maid as soon as seen his urgent flame impatient of delay swift as his thought he seized the beauteous prey and bore her in his sooty carr away the frighted goddess to her mother cries but all in vain for now far off she flies far she behind her leaves her virgin train to them too cries and cries to them in vain and while with passion she repeats her call the vilets from her lap and lillies fall she misses em poor heart and makes new moan her lillies ah are lost her vilets gone over hills the ravisher and valleys speeds by name encouraging his foamy steeds he rattles over their necks the rusty reins and ruffles with the stroke their shaggy manes over lakes he whirls his flying wheels and comes to the palici breathing sulfurous fumes and thence to where the bacchiads of renown between unequal havens built their town where arethusa round the imprisoned sea extends her crooked coast to cyane the nymph who gave the neighboring lake a name of all sicilian nymphs the first in fame she from the waves advanced her beauteous head the goddess knew and thus to pluto said farther thou shall not with the virgin run ceres unwilling can thou be her son the maid should be by sweet persuasion won force suits not with the softness of the fair for if great things with small i may compare me anapis once loved a milder course he took and won me by his words not force then stretching out her arms she stopped his way but he impatient of the shortest stay throws to his dreadful steeds the slackened rein and strikes his iron scepter through the main the depths profound through yielding waves he cleaves and to hells center a free passage leaves down sinks his chariot and his realms of night the god soon reaches with a rapid flight cyane dissolves to a fountain but still does cyane the rape bemoan and with the goddess wrongs laments her own for the stolen maid and for her injured spring time to her trouble no relief can bring in her sad heart a heavy load she bears till the dumb sorrow turns her all to tears her mingling waters with that fountain pass of which she late immortal goddess was her varied members to a fluid melt a pliant softness in her bones is felt her wavy locks first drop away in dew and liquid next her slender fingers grew the bodys change soon seizes its extreme her legs dissolve and feet flow off in stream her arms her back her shoulders and her side her swelling breasts in little currents glide a silver liquor only now remains within the channel of her purple veins nothing to fill loves grasp her husband chaste bathes in that bosom he before embraced a boy transformed to an eft thus while through all the earth and all the main her daughter mournful ceres sought in vain aurora when with dewy looks she rose nor burnished vesper found her in repose at aetnas flaming mouth two pitchy pines to light her in her search at length she tines restless with these through frosty night she goes nor fears the cutting winds nor heeds the snows and when the morning star the day renews from east to west her absent child pursues thirsty at last by long fatigue she grows but meets no spring no rivlet near her flows then looking round a lowly cottage spies smoking among the trees and thither hies the goddess knocking at the little door twas opened by a woman old and poor who when she begged for water gave her ale brewed long but well preserved from being stale the goddess drank a chuffy lad was by who saw the liquor with a grutching eye and grinning cries she is greedy more than dry ceres offended at his foul grimace flung what she had not drunk into his face the sprinklings speckle where they hit the skin and a long tail does from his body spin his arms are turned to legs and lest his size should make him mischievous and he might rise against mankind diminutives his frame less than a lizzard but in shape the same amazed the dame the wondrous sight beheld and weeps and fain would touch her quondam child yet her approach the affrighted vermin shuns and fast into the greatest crevice runs a name they gave him which the spots expressed that rose like stellio stars and varied all his breast what lands what seas the goddess wandered over were long to tell for there remained no more searching all round her fruitless toil she mourns and with regret to sicily returns at length where cyane now flows she came who could have told her were she still the same as when she saw her daughter sink to hell but what she knows she wants a tongue to tell yet this plain signal manifestly gave the virgins girdle floating on a wave as late she dropped it from her slender waste when with her uncle through the deep she past ceres the token by her grief confessed and tore her golden hair and beat her breast she knows not on what land her curse should fall but as ingrate alike upbraids em all unworthy of her gifts trinacria most where the last steps she found of what she lost the plough for this the vengeful goddess broke and with one death the ox and owner struck in vain the fallow fields the peasant tills the seed corrupted ere it is sown she kills the fruitful soil that once such harvests bore now mocks the farmers care and teems no more and the rich grain which fills the furrowed glade rots in the seed or shrivels in the blade or too much sun burns up or too much rain drowns or black blights destroy the blasted plain or greedy birds the newsown seed devour or darnel thistles and a crop impure of knotted grass along the acres stand and spread their thriving roots through all the land then from the waves soft arethusa rears her head and back she flings her dropping hairs o mother of the maid whom thou so far have sought of whom thou can no tidings hear o thou she cried who art to life a friend cease here thy search and let thy labor end thy faithful sicilys a guiltless clime and should not suffer for anothers crime she neither knew nor could prevent the deed nor think that for my country thus i plead my countrys pisa i am an alien here yet these abodes to elis i prefer no clime to me so sweet no place so dear these springs i arethusa now possess and this my seat o gracious goddess bless this island why i love and why i crossed such spacious seas to reach ortygias coast to you i shall impart when void of care your hearts at ease and youre more fit to hear when on your brow no pressing sorrow sits for gay content alone such tales admits when through earths caverns i awhile have rould my waves i rise and here again behold the long lost stars and as i late did glide near styx proserpina there i espied fear still with grief might in her face be seen she still her rape laments yet made a queen beneath those gloomy shades her scepter sways and even the infernal king her will obeys this heard the goddess like a statute stood stupid with grief and in that musing mood continued long new cares awhile suppressed the reigning powers of her immortal breast at last to jove her daughters sire she flies and with her chariot cuts the crystal skies she comes in clouds and with disheveled hair standing before his throne prefers her prayer king of the gods defend my blood and thine and use it not the worse for being mine if i no more am gracious in thy sight be just o jove and do thy daughter right in vain i sought her the wide world around and when i most despaired to find her found but how can i the fatal finding boast by which i know she is for ever lost without her fathers aid what other power can to my arms the ravished maid restore let him restore her i will the crime forgive my child though ravished i would with joy receive pity your daughter with a thief should wed though mine you think deserves no better bed jove thus replies it equally belongs to both to guard our common pledge from wrongs but if to things we proper names apply this hardly can be called an injury the theft is love nor need we blush to own the thief if i can judge to be our son had you of his desert no other proof to be joves brother is methinks enough nor was my throne by worth superior got heaven fell to me as hell to him by lot if you are still resolved her loss to mourn and nothing less will serve than her return upon these terms she may again be yours thirrevocable terms of fate not ours of stygian food if she did never taste hells bounds may then and only then be past the transformation of ascalaphus into an owl the goddess now resolving to succeed down to the gloomy shades descends with speed but adverse fate had otherwise decreed for long before her giddy thoughtless child had broke her fast and all her projects spoiled as in the gardens shady walks she strayed a fair pomegranate charmed the simple maid hung in her way and tempting her to taste she plucked the fruit and took a short repast seven times a seed at once she eat the food the fact ascalaphus had only viewed whom acheron begot in stygian shades on orphne famed among avernal maids he saw what past and by discovring all detained the ravished nymph in cruel thrall but now a queen she with resentment heard and changed the vile informer to a bird in phlegetons black stream her hand she dips sprinkles his head and wets his babbling lips soon on his face bedropt with magic dew a change appeared and gaudy feathers grew a crooked beak the place of nose supplies rounder his head and larger are his eyes his arms and body waste but are supplied with yellow pinions flagging on each side his nails grow crooked and are turned to claws and lazily along his heavy wings he draws illomend in his form the unlucky fowl abhorred by men and called a scrieching owl the daughters of achelous transformed to sirens justly this punishment was due to him and less had been too little for his crime but o ye nymphs that from the flood descend what fault of yours the gods could so offend with wings and claws your beauteous forms to spoil yet save your maiden face and winning smile were you not with her in pergusas bowers when proserpine went forth to gather flowers since pluto in his carr the goddess caught have you not for her in each climate sought and when on land you long had searched in vain you wished for wings to cross the pathless main that earth and sea might witness to your care the gods were easy and returned your prayer with golden wing over foamy waves you fled and to the sun your plumy glories spread but lest the soft enchantment of your songs and the sweet music of your flattering tongues should quite be lost as courteous fates ordain your voice and virgin beauty still remain jove some amends for ceres loss to make yet willing pluto should the joy partake gives em of proserpine an equal share who claimed by both with both divides the year the goddess now in either empire sways six moons in hell and six with ceres stays her peevish tempers changed that sullen mind which made even hell uneasy now is kind her voice refines her mein more sweet appears her forehead free from frowns her eyes from tears as when with golden light the conquering day through dusky exhalations clears a way ceres her daughters rape no longer mourned but back to arethusas spring returned and sitting on the margin bid her tell from whence she came and why a sacred well the story of arethusa still were the purling waters and the maid from the smooth surface raised her beauteous head wipes off the drops that from her tresses ran and thus to tell alpheus loves began in elis first i breathed the living air the chase was all my pleasure all my care none loved like me the forest to explore to pitch the toils and drive the bristled boar of fair though masculine i had the name but gladly would to that have quitted claim it less my pride than indignation raised to hear the beauty i neglected praised such compliments i loathed such charms as these i scorned and thought it infamy to please once i remember in the summers heat tired with the chase i sought a cool retreat and walking on a silent current found which gently glided over the gravly ground the crystal water was so smooth so clear my eye distinguished every pebble there so soft its motion that i scarce perceived the running stream or what i saw believed the hoary willow and the poplar made along the shelving bank a grateful shade in the cool rivulet my feet i dipped then waded to the knee and then i stripped my robe i careless on an osier threw that near the place commodiously grew nor long upon the border naked stood but plunged with speed into the silver flood my arms a thousand ways i moved and tried to quicken if i could the lazy tide where while i played my swimming gambols over i heard a murmuring voice and frighted sprung to shore oh whither arethusa do thou fly from the brooks bottom did alpheus cry again i heard him in a hollow tone oh whither arethusa do thou run naked i flew nor could i stay to hide my limbs my robe was on the other side alpheus followed fast the inflaming sight quickened his speed and made his labor light he sees me ready for his eager arms and with a greedy glance devours my charms as trembling doves from pressing danger fly when the fierce hawk comes sousing from the sky and as fierce hawks the trembling doves pursue from him i fled and after me he flew first by orchomenus i took my flight and soon had psophis and cyllene in sight behind me then high maenalus i lost and craggy erimanthus scaled with frost elis was next thus far the ground i trod with nimble feet before the distancd god but here i laggd unable to sustain the labor longer and my flight maintain while he more strong more patient of the toil and fired with hopes of beautys speedy spoil gained my lost ground and by redoubled pace now left between us but a narrow space unwearied i till now over hills and plains over rocks and rivers ran and felt no pains the sun behind me and the god i kept but when i fastest should have run i stepped before my feet his shadow now appeared as what i saw or rather what i feared yet there i could not be deceived by fear who felt his breath pant on my braided hair and heard his sounding tread and knew him to be near tired and despairing o celestial maid i am caught i cried without thy heavenly aid help me diana help a nymph forlorn devoted to the woods who long has worn thy livery and long thy quiver born the goddess heard my pious prayer prevailed in muffling clouds my virgin head was veiled the amorous god deluded of his hopes searches the gloom and through the darkness gropes twice where diana did her servant hide he came and twice o arethusa cried how shaken was my soul how sunk my heart the terror seized on every trembling part thus when the wolf about the mountain prowls for prey the lambkin hears his horrid howls the timorous hare the pack approaching nigh thus hearkens to the hounds and trembles at the cry nor dares she stir for fear her scented breath direct the dogs and guide the threatened death alpheus in the cloud no traces found to mark my way yet stays to guard the ground the god so near a chilly sweat possessed my fainting limbs at every pore expressed my strength distilled in drops my hair in dew my form was changed and all my substance new each motion was a stream and my whole frame turned to a fount which still preserves my name resolved i should not his embrace escape again the god resumes his fluid shape to mix his streams with mine he fondly tries but still diana his attempt denies she cleaves the ground through caverns dark i run a different current while he keeps his own to dear ortygia she conducts my way and here i first review the welcome day here arethusa stopped then ceres takes her golden carr and yokes her fiery snakes with a just rein along midheaven she flies over earth and seas and cuts the yielding skies she halts at athens dropping like a star and to triptolemus resigns her carr parent of seed she gave him fruitful grain and bad him teach to till and plough the plain the seed to sow as well in fallow fields as where the soil manured a richer harvest yields the transformation of lyncus the youth over europe and over asia drives till at the court of lyncus he arrives the tyrant scythias barbarous empire swayed and when he saw triptolemus he said how came thou stranger to our court and why thy country and thy name the youth did thus reply triptolemus my name my countrys known over all the world minervas favorite town athens the first of cities in renown by land i neither walked nor sailed by sea but hither through the ether made my way by me the goddess who the fields befriends these gifts the greatest of all blessings sends the grain she gives if in your soil you sow thence wholesome food in golden crops shall grow soon as the secret to the king was known he grudged the glory of the service done and wickedly resolved to make it all his own to hide his purpose he invites his guest the friend of ceres to a royal feast and when sweet sleep his heavy eyes had seized the tyrant with his steel attempts his breast him strait a lynxs shape the goddess gives and home the youth her sacred dragons drives the pierides transformed to magpies the chosen muse here ends her sacred lays the nymphs unanimous decree the bays and give the heliconian goddesses the praise then far from vain that we should thus prevail but much provoked to hear the vanquished rail calliope resumes too long we have born your daring taunts and your affronting scorn your challenge justly merited a curse and this unmannerd railing makes it worse since you refuse us calmly to enjoy our patience next our passions well employ the dictates of a mind enraged pursue and what our just resentment bids us do the railers laugh our threats and wrath despise and clap their hands and make a scolding noise but in the fact they are seized beneath their nails feathers they feel and on their faces scales their horny beaks at once each other scare their arms are plumed and on their backs they bear pyd wings and flutter in the fleeting air chattring the scandal of the woods they fly and there continue still their clamorous cry the same their eloquence as maids or birds now only noise and nothing then but words the end of the fifth book to her highness the princess anne eldest daughter of their royal highnesses ye prince and princess of wales  ovids metamorphoses book vi translated by mr croxall the transformation of arachne into a spider pallas attending to the muses song approved the just resentment of their wrong and thus reflects while tamely i commend those who their injured deities defend my own divinity affronted stands and calls aloud for justice at my hands then takes the hint ashamed to lag behind and on arachne bends her vengeful mind one at the loom so excellently skilled that to the goddess she refused to yield low was her birth and small her native town she from her art alone obtained renown idmon her father made it his employ to give the spungy fleece a purple dye of vulgar strain her mother lately dead with her own rank had been content to wed yet she their daughter though her time was spent in a small hamlet and of mean descent through the great towns of lydia gained a name and filled the neighboring countries with her fame often to admire the niceness of her skill the nymphs would quit their fountain shade or hill thither from green tymolus they repair and leave the vineyards their peculiar care thither from famed pactolus golden stream drawn by her art the curious naiads came nor would the work when finished please so much as while she wrought to view each graceful touch whether the shapeless wool in balls she wound or with quick motion turned the spindle round or with her pencil drew the neat design pallas her mistress shone in every line this the proud maid with scornful air denies and even the goddess at her work defies disowns her heavenly mistress every hour nor asks her aid nor deprecates her power let us she cries but to a trial come and if she conquers let her fix my doom the goddess then a beldames form put on with silver hairs her hoary temples shone propd by a staff she hobbles in her walk and tottering thus begins her old wives talk young maid attend nor stubbornly despise the admonitions of the old and wise for age though scorned a ripe experience bears that golden fruit unknown to blooming years still may remotest fame your labors crown and mortals your superior genius own but to the goddess yield and humbly meek a pardon for your bold presumption seek the goddess will forgive at this the maid with passion fired her gliding shuttle stayed and darting vengeance with an angry look to pallas in disguise thus fiercely spoke thou doting thing whose idle babbling tongue but too well shows the plague of living long hence and reprove with this your sage advice your giddy daughter or your awkward neice know i despise your counsel and am still a woman ever wedded to my will and if your skillful goddess better knows let her accept the trial i propose she does impatient pallas strait replies and clothed with heavenly light sprung from her odd disguise the nymphs and virgins of the plain adore the awful goddess and confess her power the maid alone stood unappalld yet showed a transient blush that for a moment glowed then disappeared as purple streaks adorn the opening beauties of the rosy morn till phoebus rising prevalently bright allays the tincture with his silver light yet she persists and obstinately great in hopes of conquest hurries on her fate the goddess now the challenge waves no more nor kindly good advises as before strait to their posts appointed both repair and fix their threaded looms with equal care around the solid beam the web is tied while hollow canes the parting warp divide through which with nimble flight the shuttles play and for the woof prepare a ready way the woof and warp unite pressed by the toothy slay thus both their mantles buttoned to their breast their skilful fingers ply with willing haste and work with pleasure while they cheer the eye with glowing purple of the tyrian dye or justly intermixing shades with light their colorings insensibly unite as when a shower transpiercd with sunny rays it is mighty arch along the heaven displays from whence a thousand different colors rise whose fine transition cheats the clearest eyes so like the intermingled shading seems and only differs in the last extremes then threads of gold both artfully dispose and as each part in just proportion rose some antique fable in their work disclose pallas in figures wrought the heavenly powers and marss hill among the athenian towers on lofty thrones twice six celestials sat jove in the midst and held their warm debate the subject weighty and wellknown to fame from whom the city should receive its name each god by proper features was expressed jove with majestic mein excelled the rest his threeforkd mace the dewy seagod shook and looking sternly smote the ragged rock when from the stone leapt forth a spritely steed and neptune claims the city for the deed herself she blazons with a glittering spear and crested helm that veiled her braided hair with shield and scaly breast plate implements of war struck with her pointed lance the teeming earth seemed to produce a new surprising birth when from the glebe the pledge of conquest sprung a tree palegreen with fairest olives hung and then to let her giddy rival learn what just rewards such boldness was to earn four trials at each corner had their part designed in miniature and touched with art haemus in one and rhodope of thrace transformed to mountains filled the foremost place who claimed the titles of the gods above and vainly used the epithets of jove another showed where the pigmaean dame profaning junos venerable name turned to an airy crane descends from far and with her pigmy subjects wages war in a third part the rage of heavens great queen displayed on proud antigone was seen who with presumptuous boldness dared to vye for beauty with the empress of the sky ah what avails her ancient princely race her sire a king and troy her native place now to a noisy stork transformed she flies and with her whitened pinions cleaves the skies and in the last remaining part was drawn poor cinyras that seemed to weep in stone clasping the temple steps he sadly mourned his lovely daughters now to marble turned with her own tree the finished piece is crowned and wreaths of peaceful olive all the work surround arachne drew the famed intreagues of jove changed to a bull to gratify his love how through the briny tide all foaming hoar lovely europa on his back he bore the sea seemed waving and the trembling maid shrunk up her tender feet as if afraid and looking back on the forsaken strand to her companions wafts her distant hand next she designed asterias fabled rape when jove assumed a soaring eagles shape and showed how leda lay supinely pressed whilst the soft snowy swan sat hovering over her breast how in a satyrs form the god beguiled when fair antiope with twins he filled then like amphitryon but a real jove in fair alcmenas arms he cooled his love in fluid gold to danaes heart he came aegina felt him in a lambent flame he took mnemosyne in shepherds make and for deois was a speckled snake she made thee neptune like a wanton steer pacing the meads for love of arne dear next like a stream thy burning flame to slake and like a ram for fair bisaltis sake then ceres in a steed your vigor tried nor could the mare the yellow goddess hide next to a fowl transformed you won by force the snakehaird mother of the winged horse and in a dolphins fishy form subdued melantho sweet beneath the oozy flood all these the maid with lively features drew and opened proper landskips to the view there phoebus roving like a country swain attunes his jolly pipe along the plain for lovely isses sake in shepherds weeds over pastures green his bleating flock he feeds there bacchus imagd like the clustring grape melting bedrops erigones fair lap and there old saturn stung with youthful heat formed like a stallion rushes to the feat fresh flowers which twists of ivy intertwine mingling a running foliage close the neat design this the bright goddess passionately moved with envy saw yet inwardly approved the scene of heavenly guilt with haste she tore nor longer the affront with patience bore a boxen shuttle in her hand she took and more than once arachnes forehead struck the unhappy maid impatient of the wrong down from a beam her injured person hung when pallas pitying her wretched state at once prevented and pronounced her fate live but depend vile wretch the goddess cried doomed in suspense for ever to be tied that all your race to utmost date of time may feel the vengeance and detest the crime then going off she sprinkled her with juice which leaves of baleful aconite produce touched with the poisonous drug her flowing hair fell to the ground and left her temples bare her usual features vanished from their place her body lessened all but most her face her slender fingers hanging on each side with many joints the use of legs supplied a spiders bag the rest from which she gives a thread and still by constant weaving lives the story of niobe swift through the phrygian towns the rumor flies and the strange news each female tongue employs niobe who before she married knew the famous nymph now found the story true yet unreclaimd by poor arachnes fate vainly above the gods assumed a state her husbands fame their familys descent their power and rich dominions wide extent might well have justified a decent pride but not on these alone the dame relied her lovely progeny that far excelled the mothers heart with vain ambition swelled the happiest mother not unjustly styled had no conceited thoughts her towering fancy filled for once a prophetess with zeal inspired their slow neglect to warm devotion fired through every street of thebes who ran possessed and thus in accents wild her charge expressed haste haste ye theban matrons and adore with hallowed rites latonas mighty power and to the heavenly twins that from her spring with laurel crowned your smoking incense bring strait the great summons every dame obeyed and due submission to the goddess paid graceful with laurel chaplets dressed they came and offered incense in the sacred flame mean while surrounded with a courtly guard the royal niobe in state appeared attired in robes embroidered over with gold and mad with rage yet lovely to behold her comely tresses trembling as she stood down her fine neck with easy motion flowed then darting round a proud disdainful look in haughty tone her hasty passion broke and thus began what madness this to court a goddess founded merely on report dare ye a poor pretended power invoke while yet no altars to my godhead smoke mine whose immediate lineage stands confessed from tantalus the only mortal guest that ever the gods admitted to their feast a sister of the pleiads gave me birth and atlas mightiest mountain upon earth who bears the globe of all the stars above my grandsire was and atlas sprung from jove the theban towns my majesty adore and neighboring phrygia trembles at my power raised by my husbands lute with turrets crowned our lofty city stands secured around within my court wherever i turn my eyes unbounded treasures to my prospect rise with these my face i modestly may name as not unworthy of so high a claim seven are my daughters of a form divine with seven fair sons an indefective line go fools consider this and ask the cause from which my pride its strong presumption draws consider this and then prefer to me caeus the titans vagrant progeny to whom in travel the whole spacious earth no room afforded for her spurious birth not the least part in earth in heaven or seas would grant your outlawed goddess any ease till pitying here is from his own wandering case delos the floating island gave a place there she a mother was of two at most only the seventh part of what i boast my joys all are beyond suspicion fixed with no pollutions of misfortune mix d safe on the basis of my power i stand above the reach of fortunes fickle hand lessen she may my inexhausted store and much destroy yet still must leave me more suppose it possible that some may dye of this my numerous lovely progeny still with latona i might safely vye who by her scanty breed scarce fit to name but just escapes the childless womans shame go then with speed your laureled heads uncrown and leave the silly farce you have begun the timorous throng their sacred rites forbore and from their heads the verdant laurel tore their haughty queen they with regret obeyed and still in gentle murmurs softly prayed high on the top of cynthus shady mount with grief the goddess saw the base affront and the abuse revolving in her breast the mother her twinoffspring thus addressed lo i my children who with comfort knew your godlike birth and thence my glory drew and thence have claimed precedence of place from all but juno of the heavenly race must now despair and languish in disgrace my godhead questioned and all rites divine unless you succor banished from my shrine nay more the imp of tantalus has flung reflections with her vile paternal tongue has dared prefer her mortal breed to mine and called me childless which just fate may she repine when to urge more the goddess was prepared phoebus in haste replies too much we have heard and every moments lost while vengeance is deferred diana spoke the same then both enshroud their heavenly bodies in a sable cloud and to the theban towers descending light through the soft yielding air direct their flight without the wall there lies a champian ground with even surface far extending round beaten and levelled while it daily feels the trampling horse and chariots grinding wheels part of proud niobes young rival breed practicing there to ride the managed steed their bridles bossd with gold were mounted high on stately furniture of tyrian dye of these ismenos who by birth had been the first fair issue of the fruitful queen just as he drew the rein to guide his horse around the compass of the circling course sighed deeply and the pangs of smart expressed while the shaft stuck engord within his breast and the reins dropping from his dying hand he sunk quite down and tumbled on the sand sipylus next the rattling quiver heard and with full speed for his escape prepared as when the pilot from the blackning skies a gathering storm of wintry rain descries his sails unfurled and crowded all with wind he strives to leave the threatening cloud behind so fled the youth but an unerring dart oertook him quick discharged and sped with art fixed in his neck behind it trembling stood and at his throat displayed the point besmeared with blood prone as his posture was he tumbled over and bathed his coursers mane with steaming gore next at young phaedimus they took their aim and tantalus who bore his grandsires name these when their other exercise was done to try the wrestlers oily sport begun and straining every nerve their skill expressed in closest grapple joining breast to breast when from the bending bow an arrow sent joined as they were through both their bodies went both groaned and writhing both their limbs with pain they fell together bleeding on the plain then both their languid eye balls faintly roll and thus together breath away their soul with grief alphenor saw their doleful plight and smote his breast and sickend at the sight then to their succor ran with eager haste and fondly grieved their stiffning limbs embraced but in the action falls a thrilling dart by phoebus guided pierced him to the heart this as they drew it forth his midriff tore it is barbed point the fleshy fragments bore and let the soul gush out in streams of purple gore but damasiethon by a double wound beardless and young lay gasping on the ground fixed in his sinewy ham the steely point stuck through his knee and pierced the nervous joint and as he stooped to tug the painful dart another struck him in a vital part shot through his wezon by the wing it hung the lifeblood forced it out and darting upward sprung ilioneus the last with terror stands lifting in prayer his unavailing hands and ignorant from whom his griefs arise spare me o all ye heavenly powers he cries phoebus was touched too late the sounding bow had sent the shaft and struck the fatal blow which yet but gently gored his tender side so by a slight and easy wound he died swift to the mothers ears the rumor came and doleful sighs the heavy news proclaim with anger and surprise inflamed by turns in furious rage her haughty stomach burns first she disputes the effects of heavenly power then at their daring boldness wonders more for poor amphion with sore grief distressed hoping to sooth his cares by endless rest had sheathed a dagger in his wretched breast and she who tossed her high disdainful head when through the streets in solemn pomp she led the throng that from latonas altar fled assuming state beyond the proudest queen was now the miserablest object seen prostrate among the claycold dead she fell and kissed an undistinguished last farewell then her pale arms advancing to the skies cruel latona triumph now she cries my grieving soul in bitter anguish drench and with my woes your thirsty passion quench feast your black malice at a price thus dear while the sore pangs of sevn such deaths i bear triumph too cruel rival and display your conquering standard for you have won the day yet i will excel for yet though sevn are slain superior still in number i remain scarce had she spoke the bowstrings twanging sound was heard and dealt fresh terrors all around which all but niobe alone confound stunned and obdurate by her load of grief insensible she sits nor hopes relief before the funeral biers all weeping sad her daughters stood in vests of sable clad when one surpised and stung with sudden smart in vain attempts to draw the sticking dart but to grim death her blooming youth resigns and over her brothers corpse her dying head reclines this to assuage her mothers anguish tries and silenced in the pious action dies shot by a secret arrow winged with death her faultring lips but only gaspd for breath one on her dying sister breathes her last vainly in flight anothers hopes are placed this hiding from her fate a shelter seeks that trembling stands and fills the air with shrieks and all in vain for now all six had found their way to death each by a different wound the last with eager care the mother veiled behind her spreading mantle close concealed and with her body guarded as a shield only for this this youngest i implore grant me this one request i ask no more o grant me this she passionately cries but while she speaks the destined virgin dies the transformation of niobe widowed and childless lamentable state a doleful sight among the dead she sat hardened with woes a statue of despair to every breath of wind unmoved her hair her cheek still redning but its color dead faded her eyes and set within her head no more her pliant tongue its motion keeps but stands congealed within her frozen lips stagnate and dull within her purple veins its current stopped the lifeless blood remains her feet their usual offices refuse her arms and neck their graceful gestures lose action and life from every part are gone and even her entrails turn to solid stone yet still she weeps and whirled by stormy winds born through the air her native country finds there fixed she stands upon a bleaky hill there yet her marble cheeks eternal tears distill the peasants of lycia transformed to frogs then all reclaimed by this example showed a due regard for each peculiar god both men and women their devoirs expressed and great latonas awful power confessed then tracing instances of older time to suit the nature of the present crime thus one begins his tale  where lycia yields a golden harvest from its fertile fields some churlish peasants in the days of yore provoked the goddess to exert her power the thing indeed the meanness of the place has made obscure surprising as it was but i my self once happened to behold this famous lake of which the storys told my father then worn out by length of days nor able to sustain the tedious ways me with a guide had sent the plains to roam and drive his wellfed straggling heifers home here as we saunterd through the verdant meads we spied a lake oergrown with trembling reeds whose wavy tops an opening scene disclose from which an antique smoaky altar rose i as my superstitious guide had done stopped short and blessed my self and then went on yet i inquired to whom the altar stood faunus the naiads or some native god no silvan deity my friend replies enshrined within this hallowed altar lies for this o youth to that famed goddess stands whom at the imperial junos rough commands of every quarter of the earth bereaved delos the floating isle at length received who there in spite of enemies brought forth beneath an olives shade her great twinbirth hence too she fled the furious stepdames power and in her arms a double godhead bore and now the borders of fair lycia gained just when the summer solstice parched the land with thirst the goddess languishing no more her emptied breast would yield its milky store when from below the smiling valley showed a silver lake that in its bottom flowed a sort of clowns were reaping near the bank the bending osier and the bullrush dank the cresse and waterlilly fragrant weed whose juicy stalk the liquid fountains feed the goddess came and kneeling on the brink stooped at the fresh repast prepared to drink then thus being hindered by the rabble race in accents mild expostulates the case water i only ask and sure it is hard from natures common rights to be debarred this as the genial sun and vital air should flow alike to every creatures share yet still i ask and as a favor crave that which a public bounty nature gave nor do i seek my weary limbs to drench only with one cool draught my thirst i would quench now from my throat the usual moisture dries and even my voice in broken accents dies one draught as dear as life i should esteem and water now i thirst would nectar seem oh let my little babes your pity move and melt your hearts to charitable love they as by chance they did extend to you their little hands and my request pursue whom would these soft persuasions not subdue though the most rustic and unmannerd crew yet they the goddesss request refuse and with rude words reproachfully abuse nay more with spiteful feet the villains trod over the soft bottom of the marshy flood and blackened all the lake with clouds of rising mud her thirst by indignation was suppressed bent on revenge the goddess stood confessed her suppliant hands uplifting to the skies for a redress to heaven she now applies and may you live she passionately cried doomed in that pool for ever to abide the goddess has her wish for now they choose to plunge and dive among the watery ooze sometimes they show their head above the brim and on the glassy surface spread to swim often upon the bank their station take then spring and leap into the cooly lake still void of shame they lead a clamorous life and croaking still scold on in endless strife compelled to live beneath the liquid stream where still they quarrel and attempt to skream now from their bloated throat their voice puts on imperfect murmurs in a hoarser tone their noisy jaws with bawling now grown wide an ugly sight extend on either side their motly back streaked with a list of green joined to their head without a neck is seen and with a belly broad and white they look mere frogs and still frequent the muddy brook the fate of marsyas scarce had the man this famous story told of vengeance on the lycians shown of old when strait another pictures to their view the satyrs fate whom angry phoebus slew who raised with high conceit and puffed with pride at his own pipe the skilful god defied why do you tear me from my self he cries ah cruel must my skin be made the prize this for a silly pipe he roaring said mean while the skin from off his limbs was flayed all bare and raw one large continued wound with streams of blood his body bathed the ground the blueish veins their trembling pulse disclosed the stringy nerves lay naked and exposed his guts appeared distinctly each expressed with every shining fiber of his breast the fauns and silvans with the nymphs that rove among the satyrs in the shady grove olympus known of old and every swain that fed or flock or herd upon the plain bewailed the loss and with their tears that flowed a kindly moisture on the earth bestowed that soon conjoined and in a body ranged sprung from the ground to limpid water changed which down through phrygias rocks a mighty stream comes tumbling to the sea and marsya is its name the story of pelops from these relations strait the people turn to present truths and lost amphion mourn the mother most was blamed yet some relate that pelops pitied and bewailed her fate and stripped his clothes and laid his shoulder bare and made the ivory miracle appear this shoulder from the first was formed of flesh as lively as the other and as fresh but when the youth was by his father slain the gods restored his mangled limbs again only that place which joins the neck and arm the rest untouched was found to suffer harm the loss of which an ivory piece sustained and thus the youth his limbs and life regained the story of tereus procne and philomela to thebes the neighboring princes all repair and with condolance the misfortune share each bordring state in solemn form addressed and each betimes a friendly grief expressed argos with spartas and mycenaes towns and calydon yet free from fierce dianas frowns corinth for finest brass well famed of old orchomenos for men of courage bold cleonae lying in the lowly dale and rich messene with its fertile vale pylos for nestors city after famed and troezen not as yet from pittheus named and those fair cities which are hemmed around by double seas within the isthmian ground and those which farther from the seacoast stand lodged in the bosom of the spacious land who can believe it athens was the last though for politeness famed for ages past for a strait siege which then their walls enclosed such acts of kind humanity opposed and thick with ships from foreign nations bound seaward their city lay invested round these with auxiliar forces led from far tereus of thrace brave and inured to war had quite defeated and obtained a name the warriors due among the sons of fame this with his wealth and power and ancient line from mars derived pandions thoughts incline his daughter procne with the prince to join nor hymen nor the graces here preside nor juno to befriend the blooming bride but fiends with funeral brands the process led and furies waited at the genial bed and all night long the scrieching owl aloof with baleful notes sat brooding over the roof with such ill omens was the match begun that made them parents of a hopeful son now thrace congratulates their seeming joy and they in thankful rites their minds employ if the fair queens espousals pleased before itys the newborn prince now pleases more and each bright day the birth and bridal feast were kept with hallowed pomp above the rest so far true happiness may lie concealed when by false lights we fancy it is revealed now since their nuptials had the golden sun five courses round his ample zodiac run when gentle procne thus her lord addressed and spoke the secret wishes of her breast if i she said have ever favor found let my petition with success be crowned let me at athens my dear sister see or let her come to thrace and visit me and lest my father should her absence mourn promise that she shall make a quick return with thanks i would own the obligation due only o tereus to the gods and you now plied with oar and sail at his command the nimble galleys reached the athenian land and anchored in the famed piraean bay while tereus to the palace takes his way the king salutes and ceremonies past begins the fatal embassy at last the occasion of his voyage he declares and with his own his wifes request prefers asks leave that only for a little space their lovely sister might embark for thrace thus while he spoke appeared the royal maid bright philomela splendidly arrayed but most attractive in her charming face and comely person turned with every grace like those fair nymphs that are described to rove across the glades and opnings of the grove only that these are dressed for silvan sports and less become the finery of courts tereus beheld the virgin and admired and with the coals of burning lust was fired like crackling stubble or the summer hay when forked lightnings over the meadows play such charms in any breast might kindle love but him the heats of inbred lewdness move to which though thrace is naturally prone yet his is still superior and his own strait her attendants he designs to buy and with large bribes her governess would try herself with ample gifts resolves to bend and his whole kingdom in the attempt expend or snatched away by force of arms to bear and justify the rape with open war the boundless passion boils within his breast and his projecting soul admits no rest and now impatient of the least delay by pleading procnes cause he speeds his way the eloquence of love his tongue inspires and in his wifes he speaks his own desires hence all his importunities arise and tears unmanly trickle from his eyes ye gods what thick involving darkness blinds the stupid faculties of mortal minds tereus the credit of goodnature gains from these his crimes so well the villain feigns and unsuspecting of his base designs in the request fair philomela joins her snowy arms her aged sire embrace and clasp his neck with an endearing grace only to see her sister she entreats a seeming blessing which a curse compleats tereus surveys her with a luscious eye and in his mind forestalls the blissful joy her circling arms a scene of lust inspire and every kiss foments the raging fire fondly he wishes for the fathers place to feel and to return the warm embrace since not the nearest ties of filial blood would damp his flame and force him to be good at length for both their sakes the king agrees and philomela on her bended knees thanks him for what her fancy calls success when cruel fate intends her nothing less now phoebus hasting to ambrosial rest his fiery steeds drove sloping down the west the sculptured gold with sparkling wines was filled and with rich meats each cheerful table smiled plenty and mirth the royal banquet close then all retire to sleep and sweet repose but the lewd monarch though withdrawn apart still feels loves poison rankling in his heart her face divine is stamped within his breast fancy imagines and improves the rest and thus kept waking by intense desire he nourishes his own prevailing fire next day the good old king for tereus sends and to his charge the virgin recommends his hand with tears the indulgent father pressed then spoke and thus with tenderness addressed since the kind instances of pious love do all pretense of obstacle remove since procnes and her own with your request oerrule the fears of a paternal breast with you dear son my daughter i entrust and by the gods adjure you to be just by truth and every consanguineal tie to watch and guard her with a fathers eye and since the least delay will tedious prove in keeping from my sight the child i love with speed return her kindly to assuage the tedious troubles of my lingering age and you my philomel let it suffice to know your sisters banished from my eyes if any sense of duty sways your mind let me from you the shortest absence find he wept then kissed his child and while he speaks the tears fall gently down his aged cheeks next as a pledge of fealty he demands and with a solemn charge conjoyns their hands then to his daughter and his grandson sends and by their mouth a blessing recommends while in a voice with dire forebodings broke sobbing and faint the last farewell was spoke now philomela scarce received on board and in the royal gilded bark secured beheld the dashes of the bending oar the ruffled sea and the receding shore when strait his joy impatient of disguise we have gained our point the rough barbarian cries now i possess the dear the blissful hour and every wish subjected to my power transports of lust his vicious thoughts employ and he forbears with pain the expected joy his gloting eyes incessantly surveyed the virgin beauties of the lovely maid as when the bold rapacious bird of jove with crooked talons stooping from above has snatched and carried to his lofty nest a captive hare with cruel gripes oppressed secure with fixed and unrelenting eyes he sits and views the helpless trembling prize their vessels now had made the intended land and all with joy descend upon the strand when the false tyrant seized the princely maid and to a lodge in distant woods conveyed pale sinking and distressed with jealous fears and asking for her sister all in tears the letcher for enjoyment fully bent no longer now concealed his base intent but with rude haste the bloomy girl deflowered tender defenseless and with ease oerpowrd her piercing accents to her sire complain and to her absent sister but in vain in vain she importunes with doleful cries each unattentive godhead of the skies she pants and trembles like the bleating prey from some closehunted wolf just snatched away that still with fearful horror looks around and on its flank regards the bleeding wound or as the timorous dove the danger over beholds her shining plumes besmeared with gore and though delivered from the faulcons claw yet shivers and retains a secret awe but when her mind a calm reflection shared and all her scattered spirits were repaired torn and disordered while her tresses hung her livid hands like one that mourned she wrung then thus with grief overwhelmed her languid eyes savage inhumane cruel wretch she cries whom nor a parents strict commands could move though charged and uttered with the tears of love nor virgin innocence nor all that is due to the strong contract of the nuptial vow virtue by this in wild confusions laid and i compelled to wrong my sisters bed whilst you regardless of your marriage oath with stains of incest have defiled us both though i deserved some punishment to find this was ye gods too cruel and unkind yet villain to complete your horrid guilt stab here and let my tainted blood be spilt oh happy had it come before i knew the cursed embrace of vile perfidious you then my pale ghost pure from incestuous love had wandered spotless through the elysian grove but if the gods above have power to know and judge those actions that are done below unless the dreaded thunders of the sky like me subdued and violated lie still my revenge shall take its proper time and suit the baseness of your hellish crime my self abandoned and devoid of shame through the wide world your actions will proclaim or though i am imprisoned in this lonely den obscured and buried from the sight of men my mournful voice the pitying rocks shall move and my complainings echo through the grove hear me o heaven and if a god be there let him regard me and accept my prayer struck with these words the tyrants guilty breast with fear and anger was by turns possessed now with remorse his conscience deeply stung he drew the faulchion that beside him hung and first her tender arms behind her bound then dragged her by the hair along the ground the princess willingly her throat reclined and viewed the steel with a contented mind but soon her tongue the girding pinchers strain with anguish soon she feels the piercing pain oh father father she would fain have spoke but the sharp torture her intention broke in vain she tries for now the blade has cut her tongue sheer off close to the trembling root the mangled part still quiverd on the ground murmuring with a faint imperfect sound and as a serpent writhes his wounded train uneasy panting and possessed with pain the piece while life remained still trembled fast and to its mistress pointed to the last yet after this so damned and black a deed fame which i scarce can credit has agreed that on her rifled charms still void of shame he frequently indulged his lustful flame at last he ventures to his procnes sight loaded with guilt and cloyed with long delight there with feigned grief and false dissembled sighs begins a formal narrative of lies her sisters death he artfully declares then weeps and raises credit from his tears her vest with flowers of gold embroidered over with grief distressed the mournful matron tore and a beseeming suit of gloomy sable wore with cost an honorary tomb she raised and thus the imaginary ghost appeased deluded queen the fate of her you love nor grief nor pity but revenge should move through the twelve signs had passed the circling sun and round the compass of the zodiac run what must unhappy philomela do for ever subject to her keepers view huge walls of massy stone the lodge surround from her own mouth no way of speakings found but all our wants by wit may be supplied and art makes up what fortune has denied with skill exact a phrygian web she strung fixed to a loom that in her chamber hung where inwrought letters upon white displayed in purple notes her wretched case betrayed the piece when finished secretly she gave into the charge of one poor menial slave and then with gestures made him understand it must be safe conveyed to procnes hand the slave with speed the queens apartment sought and rendered up his charge unknowing what he brought but when the ciphers figured in each fold her sisters melancholy story told strange that she could with silence she surveyed the tragic piece and without weeping read in such tumultuous haste her passions sprung they choked her voice and quite disarmed her tongue no room for female tears the furies rise darting vindictive glances from her eyes and stung with rage she bounds from place to place while stern revenge sits lowering in her face now the triennial celebration came observed to bacchus by each thracian dame when in the privacies of night retired they act his rites with sacred rapture fired by night the twinkling cymbals ring around while the shrill notes from rhodope resound by night the queen disguised forsakes the court to mingle in the festival resort leafs of the curling vine her temples shade and with a circling wreath adorn her head adown her back the stags rough spoils appear light on her shoulder leans a cornel spear thus in the fury of the god concealed procne her own mad headstrong passion veiled now with her gang to the thick wood she flies and with religious yellings fills the skies the fatal lodge as twere by chance she seeks and through the bolted doors an entrance breaks from thence her sister snatching by the hand masked like the ranting bacchanalian band within the limits of the court she drew shading with ivy green her outward hue but philomela conscious of the place felt new reviving pangs of her disgrace a shivering cold prevailed in every part and the chilled blood ran trembling to her heart soon as the queen a fit retirement found stripped of the garlands that her temples crowned she strait unveiled her blushing sisters face and fondly clasped her with a close embrace but in confusion lost the unhappy maid with shame dejected hung her drooping head as guilty of a crime that stained her sisters bed that speech that should her injured virtue clear and make her spotless innocence appear is now no more only her hands and eyes appeal in signals to the conscious skies in procnes breast the rising passions boil and burst in anger with a mad recoil her sisters illtimed grief with scorn she blames then in these furious words her rage proclaims tears unavailing but defer our time the stabbing sword must expiate the crime or worse if wit on bloody vengeance bent a weapon more tormenting can invent o sister i have prepared my stubborn heart to act some hellish and unheard of part either the palace to surround with fire and see the villain in the flames expire or with a knife dig out his cursed eyes or his false tongue with racking engines seize or cut away the part that injured you and through a thousand wounds his guilty soul pursue tortures enough my passion has designed but the variety distracts my mind a while thus wavering stood the furious dame when itys fondling to his mother came from him the cruel fatal hint she took she viewed him with a stern remorseless look ah but too like thy wicked sire she said forming the direful purpose in her head at this a sullen grief her voice suppressed while silent passions struggle in her breast now at her lap arrived the flattering boy salutes his parent with a smiling joy about her neck his little arms are thrown and he accosts her in a prattling tone then her tempestuous anger was allayed and in its full career her vengeance stayed while tender thoughts in spite of passion rise and melting tears disarm her threatening eyes but when she found the mothers easy heart too fondly swerving from the intended part her injured sisters face again she viewed and as by turns surveying both she stood while this fond boy she said can thus express the moving accents of his fond address why stands my sister of her tongue bereft forlorn and sad in speechless silence left o procne see the fortune of your house such is your fate when matched to such a spouse conjugal duty if observed to him would change from virtue and become a crime for all respect to tereus must debase the noble blood of great pandions race strait at these words with big resentment filled furious her look she flew and seized her child like a fell tigress of the savage kind that drags the tender suckling of the hind through indias gloomy groves where ganges laves the shady scene and rouls his streamy waves now to a close apartment they were come far off retired within the spacious dome when procne on revengeful mischief bent home to his heart a piercing poinyard sent itys with rueful cries but all too late holds out his hands and deprecates his fate still at his mothers neck he fondly aims and strives to melt her with endearing names yet still the cruel mother perseveres nor with concern his bitter anguish hears this might suffice but philomela too across his throat a shining curtlass drew then both with knives dissect each quivering part and carve the butchered limbs with cruel art which whelmed in boiling cauldrons over the fire or turned on spits in steamy smoke aspire while the long entries with their slippery floor run down in purple streams of clotted gore asked by his wife to this inhuman feast tereus unknowingly is made a guest whilst she her plot the better to disguise styles it some unknown mystic sacrifice and such the nature of the hallowed rite the wife her husband only could invite the slaves must all withdraw and be debarred the sight tereus upon a throne of antique state loftily raised before the banquet sat and glutton like luxuriously pleased with his own flesh his hungry maw appeased nay such a blindness over his senses falls that he for itys to the table calls when procne now impatient to disclose the joy that from her full revenge arose cries out in transports of a cruel mind within your self your itys you may find still at this puzzling answer with surprise around the room he sends his curious eyes and as he still inquired and called aloud fierce philomela all besmeared with blood her hands with murder stained her spreading hair hanging disheveled with a ghastly air stepped forth and flung full in the tyrants face the head of itys goary as it was nor ever longed so much to use her tongue and with a just reproach to vindicate her wrong the thracian monarch from the table flings while with his cries the vaulted parlour rings his imprecations echo down to hell and rouse the snaky furies from their stygian cell one while he labors to disgorge his breast and free his stomach from the cursed feast then weeping over his lamentable doom he styles himself his sons sepulchral tomb now with drawn sabre and impetuous speed in close pursuit he drives pandions breed whose nimble feet spring with so swift a force across the fields they seem to wing their course and now on real wings themselves they raise and steer their airy flight by different ways one to the woodlands shady covert hies around the smoaky roof the other flies whose feathers yet the marks of murder stain where stamped upon her breast the crimson spots remain tereus through grief and haste to be revenged shares the like fate and to a bird is changed fixed on his head the crested plumes appear long is his beak and sharpened like a spear thus armed his looks his inward mind display and to a lapwing turned he fans his way exceeding trouble for his childrens fate shortened pandions days and changed his date down to the shades below with sorrow spent an earlier unexpected ghost he went boreas in love erechtheus next the athenian scepter swayed whose rule the state with joint consent obeyed so mixed his justice with his valor flowed his reign one scene of princely goodness showed four hopeful youths as many females bright sprung from his loins and soothed him with delight two of these sisters of a lovelier air excelled the rest though all the rest were fair procris to cephalus in wedlock tied blessed the young silvan with a blooming bride for orithyia boreas suffered pain for the coy maid sued long but sued in vain tereus his neighbor and his thracian blood against the match a main objection stood which made his vows and all his suppliant love empty as air and ineffectual prove but when he found his soothing flattries fail nor saw his soft addresses could avail blustering with ire he quickly has recourse to rougher arts and his own native force it is well he said such usage is my due when thus disguised by foreign ways i sue when my stern airs and fierceness i disclaim and sigh for love ridiculously tame when soft addresses foolishly i try nor my own stronger remedies apply by force and violence i chiefly live by them the lowering stormy tempests drive in foaming billows raise the hoary deep writhe knotted oaks and sandy deserts sweep congeal the falling flakes of fleecy snow and bruise with rattling hail the plains below i and my brotherwinds when joined above through the waste champian of the skies we rove with such a boisterous full career engage that heavens whole concave thunders at our rage while struck from nitrous clouds fierce lightnings play dart through the storm and gild the gloomy day or when in subterraneous caverns pent my breath against the hollow earth is bent the quaking world above and ghosts below my mighty power by dear experience know tremble with fear and dread the fatal blow this is the only cure to be applied thus to erechtheus i should be allied and thus the scornful virgin should be wooed not by entreaty but by force subdued boreas in passion spoke these huffing things and as he spoke he shook his dreadful wings at which afar the shivering sea was fand and the wide surface of the distant land his dusty mantle over the hills he drew and swept the lowly valleys as he flew then with his yellow wings embraced the maid and wrapped in dusky clouds far off conveyed the sparkling blaze of loves prevailing fire shone brighter as he flew and flamed the higher and now the god possessed of his delight to northern thrace pursued his airy flight where the young ravished nymph became his bride and soon the luscious sweets of wedlock tried two lovely twins the effect of this embrace crown their soft labors and their nuptials grace who like their mother beautiful and fair their fathers strength and feathered pinions share yet these at first were wanting as it is said and after as they grew their shoulders spread zethes and calais the pretty twins remained unfledged while smooth their beardless chins but when in time the budding silver down shaded their face and on their cheeks was grown two sprouting wings upon their shoulders sprung like those in birds that veil the callow young then as their age advanced and they began from greener youth to ripen into man with jasons argonauts they crossed the seas embarked in quest of the famed golden fleece there with the rest the first frail vessel tried and boldly ventured on the swelling tide the end of the sixth book to the rt honble the lady comp e kirkall  ovids metamorphoses book vii translated by mr tate and mr stonestreet the story of medea and jason the argonauts now stemmed the foaming tide and to arcadias shore their course applied where sightless phineus spent his age in grief but boreas sons engage in his relief and those unwelcome guests the odious race of harpyes from the monarchs table chase with jason then they greater toils sustain and phasis slimy banks at last they gain here boldly they demand the golden prize of scythias king who sternly thus replies that mighty labors they must first overcome or sail their argo thence unfreighted home mean while medea seized with fierce desire by reason strives to quench the raging fire but strives in vain  some god she said withstands and reasons baffled council countermands what unseen power does this disorder move it is love  at least it is like what men call love else wherefore should the kings commands appear to me too hard  but so indeed they are why should i for a stranger fear lest he should perish whom i did but lately see his death or safety what are they to me wretch from thy virginbreast this flame expel and soon  oh could i all would then be well but love resistless love my soul invades discretion this affection that persuades i see the right and i approve it too condemn the wrong  and yet the wrong pursue why royal maid should thou desire to wed a wanderer and court a foreign bed thy native land though barbarous can present a bridegroom worth a royal brides consent and whether this adventrer lives or dies in fate and fortunes fickle pleasure lies yet may he live for to the powers above a virgin led by no impulse of love so just a suit may for the guiltless move whom would not jasons valor youth and blood invite or could these merits be withstood at least his charming person must incline the hardest heart  i am sure it is so with mine yet if i help him not the flaming breath of bulls and earthborn foes must be his death or should he through these dangers force his way at last he must be made the dragons prey if no remorse for such distress i feel i am a tigress and my breast is steel why do i scruple then to see him slain and with the tragic scene my eyes profane my magicks art employ not to assuage the salvages but to inflame their rage his earthborn foes to fiercer fury move and accessory to his murder prove the gods forbid  but prayers are idle breath when action only can prevent his death shall i betray my father and the state to intercept a rambling heros fate who may sail off next hour and saved from harms by my assistance bless anothers arms whilst i not only of my hopes bereft but to unpitied punishment am left if he is false let the ungrateful bleed but no such symptom in his looks i read nature would never have lavished so much grace upon his person if his soul were base besides he first shall plight his faith and swear by all the gods what therefore can thou fear medea haste from danger set him free jason shall thy eternal debtor be and thou his queen with sovereign state enstalld by grecian dames the kind preserver called hence idle dreams by lovesick fancy bred will thou medea by vain wishes led to sister brother father bid adieu forsake thy countrys gods and country too my fathers harsh my brother but a child my sister rivals me my countrys wild and for it is gods the greatest of em all inspires my breast and i obey his call that great endearments i forsake is true but greater far the hopes that i pursue the pride of having saved the youths of greece each life more precious than our golden fleece a nobler soil by me shall be possessed i shall see towns with arts and manners blessed and what i prize above the world beside enjoy my jason  and when once his bride be more than mortal and to gods allied they talk of hazards i must first sustain of floating islands justling in the main our tender barque exposed to dreadful shocks of fierce charybdis gulf and scyllas rocks where breaking waves in whirling eddies roll and ravenous dogs that in deep caverns howl amidst these terrors while i lie possessed of him i love and lean on jasons breast in tempests unconcerned i will appear or only for my husbands safety fear did thou say husband  can thou so deceive thy self fond maid and thy own cheat believe in vain thou strivst to varnish over thy shame and grace thy guilt with wedlocks sacred name pull off the cozning masque and oh in time discover and avoid the fatal crime she ceased  the graces now with kind surprise and virtues lovely train before her eyes present themselves and vanquished cupid flies she then retires to hecates shrine that stood far in the covert of a shady wood she finds the fury of her flames asswagd but seeing jason there again they raged blushes and paleness did by turns invade her tender cheeks and secret grief betrayed as fire that sleeping under ashes lies freshblown and roused does up in blazes rise so flamed the virgins breast  new kindled by her lovers sparkling eyes for chance that day had with uncommon grace adorned the lovely youth and through his face displayed an air so pleasing as might charm a goddess and a vestals bosom warm her ravished eyes survey him over and over as some gay wonder never seen before transported to the skies she seems to be and thinks she gazes on a deity but when he spoke and pressed her trembling hand and did with tender words her aid demand with vows and oaths to make her soon his bride she wept a flood of tears and thus replied i see my error yet to ruin move nor owe my fate to ignorance but love your life i will guard and only crave of you to swear once more  and to your oath be true he swears by hecate he would all fulfill and by her grandfathers prophetic skill by every thing that doubting love could press his present danger and desired success she credits him and kindly does produce enchanted herbs and teaches him their use their mystic names and virtues he admires and with his booty joyfully retires the dragons teeth transformed to men impatient for the wonders of the day aurora drives the loytring stars away now marss mount the pressing people fill the crowd below the nobles crown the hill the king himself highthrond above the rest with ivory scepter and in purple dressed forthwith the brasshoofd bulls are set at large whose furious nostrils sulfurous flame discharge the blasted herbage by their breath expires as forges rumble with excessive fires and furnaces with fiercer fury glow when water on the panting mass ye throw with such a noise from their convulsive breast through bellowing throats the struggling vapor pressed yet jason marches up without concern while on the adventurous youth the monsters turn their glaring eyes and eager to engage brandish their steeltipt horns in threatening rage with brazen hoofs they beat the ground and choke the ambient air with clouds of dust and smoke each gazing grecian for his champion shakes while bold advances he securely makes through sindging blasts such wonders magic art can work when love conspires and plays his part the passive savages like statutes stand while he their dewlaps strokes with soothing hand to unknown yoaks their brawny necks they yield and like tame oxen plow the wondering field the colchians stare the graecians shout and raise their champions courage with inspiring praise emboldened now on fresh attempts he goes with serpents teeth the fertile furrows sows the glebe fermenting with enchanted juice makes the snakes teeth a human crop produce for as an infant prisoner to the womb contented sleeps till to perfection come then does his cells obscure confinement scorn he tosses throbs and presses to be born so from the laboring earth no single birth but a whole troop of lusty youths rush forth and what is more strange with martial fury warmed and for encounter all completely armed in rank and file as they were sowed they stand impatient for the signal of command no foe but the aemonian youth appears at him they level their steelpointed spears his frighted friends who triumphed just before with peals of sighs his desperate case deplore and where such hardy warriors are afraid what must the tender and enamored maid her spirits sink the blood her check forsook she fears who for his safety undertook she knew the virtue of the spells she gave she knew their force and knew her lover brave but what is a single champion to an host yet scorning thus to see him tamely lost her strong reserve of secret arts she brings and last her neverfailing song she sings wonders ensue among his gazing foes the massy fragment of a rock he throws this charm in civil war engaged em all by mutual wounds those earthborn brothers fall the greeks transported with the strange success leap from their seats the conquror to caress commend and kiss and clasp him in their arms so would the kind contriver of the charms but her who felt the tenderest concern honor condemns in secret flames to burn committed to a double guard of fame awed by a virgins and a princess name but thoughts are free and fancy unconfined she kisses courts and hugs him in her mind to favoring powers her silent thanks she gives by whose indulgence her loved hero lives one labor more remains and though the last in danger far surmounting all the past that enterprise by fates in store was kept to make the dragon sleep that never slept whose crest shoots dreadful luster from his jaws a tripple tire of forked stings he draws with fangs and wings of a prodigious size such was the guardian of the golden prize yet him besprinkled with lethaean dew the fair inchantress into slumber threw and then to fix him thrice she did repeat the rhyme that makes the raging winds retreat in stormy seas can halcyon seasons make turn rapid streams into a standing lake while the soft guest his drowzy eyelids seals thunguarded golden fleece the stranger steals proud to possess the purchase of his toil proud of his royal bride the richer spoil to sea both prize and patroness he bore and lands triumphant on his native shore old aeson restored to youth aemonian matrons who their absence mourned rejoice to see their prosperous sons returned rich curling fumes of incense feast the skies an hecatomb of voted victims dies with gilded horns and garlands on their head and all the pomp of death to the altar led congratulating bowls go briskly round triumphant shouts in louder music drowned amidst these revels why that cloud of care on jasons brow to whom the largest share of mirth was due  his father was not there aeson was absent once the young and brave now crushed with years and bending to the grave at last withdrawn and by the crowd unseen pressing her hand with starting sighs between he supplicates his kind and skilful queen o patroness preserver of my life dear when my mistress and much dearer wife your favors to so vast a sum amount it is past the power of numbers to recount or could they be to computation brought the history would a romance be thought and yet unless you add one favor more greater than all that you conferred before but not too hard for love and magic skill your past are thrown away and jasons wretched still the morning of my life is just begun but my declining fathers race is run from my large stock retrench the long arrears and add em to expiring aesons years thus spoke the generous youth and wept the rest moved with the piety of his request to his aged sire such filial duty shown so different from her treatment of her own but still endeavring her remorse to hide she checked her rising sighs and thus replied how could the thought of such inhuman wrong escape said she from pious jasons tongue does the whole world another jason bear whose life medea can to yours prefer or could i with so dire a change dispense hecat will never join in that offense unjust is the request you make and i in kindness your petition shall deny yet she that grants not what you do implore shall yet essay to give her jason more find means tencrease the stock of aesons years without retrenchment of your lifes arrears provided that the tripple goddess join a strong confedrate in my bold design thus was her enterprise resolved but still three tedious nights are wanting to fulfill the circling crescents of the increasing moon then in the height of her nocturnal noon medea steals from court her ankles bare her garments closely girt but loose her hair thus sallied like a solitary sprite she traverses the terrors of the night men beasts and birds in soft repose lay charmed no boistrous wind the mountainwoods alarmed nor did those walks of love the myrtle trees of amorous zephyr hear the whispering breeze all elements chained in unactive rest no sense but what the twinkling stars expressed to them that only waked she rears her arms and thus commences her mysterious charms she turned her thrice about as often she threw on her pale tresses the nocturnal dew then yelling thrice a most enormous sound her bare knee bended on the flinty ground o night said she thou confident and guide of secrets such as darkness ought to hide ye stars and moon that when the sun retires support his empire with succeeding fires and thou great hecat friend to my design songs muttring spells your magic forces join and thou o earth the magazine that yields the midnight sorcerer drugs skies mountains fields ye watry powers of fountain stream and lake ye sylvan gods and gods of night awake and genrously your parts in my adventure take often by your aid swift currents i have led through wandering banks back to their fountain head transformed the prospect of the briny deep made sleeping billows rave and raving billows sleep made clouds or sunshine tempests rise or fall and stubborn lawless winds obey my call with muttered words disarmed the vipers jaw up by the roots vast oaks and rocks could draw make forests dance and trembling mountains come like malefactors to receive their doom earth groan and frighted ghosts forsake their tomb thee cynthia my resistless rhymes drew down when tinkling cymbals strove my voice to drown nor stronger titan could their force sustain in full career compelled to stop his wain nor could auroras virgin blush avail with poisonous herbs i turned her roses pale the fury of the fiery bulls i broke their stubborn necks submitting to my yoke and when the sons of earth with fury burned their hostile rage upon themselves i turned the brothers made with mutual wounds to bleed and by their fatal strife my lover freed and while the dragon slept to distant greece through cheated guards conveyed the golden fleece but now to bolder action i proceed of such prevailing juices now have need that withered years back to their bloom can bring and in dead winter raise a second spring and you will performt  you will for lo the stars with sparkling fires presage as bright success to my desires and now another happy omen see a chariot drawn by dragons waits for me with these last words she leaps into the wain strokes the snakes necks and shakes the golden rein that signal given they mount her to the skies and now beneath her fruitful tempe lies whose stores she ransacks then to crete she flies there ossa pelion othrys pindus all to the fair ravisher a booty fall the tribute of their verdure she collects nor proud olympus height his plants protects some by the roots she plucks the tender tops of others with her culling sickle crops nor could the plunder of the hills suffice down to the humble vales and meads she flies apidanus amphrysus the next rape sustain nor could enipeus banks escape through beebes marsh and through the border ranged whose pasture glaucus to a triton changed now the ninth day and ninth successive night had wondered at the restless rovers flight mean while her dragons fed with no repast but her exhaling simples odorous blast their tarnishd scales and wrinkled skins had cast at last returned before her palace gate quitting her chariot on the ground she sat the sky her only canopy of state all conversation with her sex she fled shunned the caresses of the nuptial bed two altars next of grassy turf she rears this hecats name that youths inscription bears with forestboughs and vervain these she crowned then delves a double trench in lower ground and sticks a blackfleecd ram that ready stood and drenched the ditches with devoted blood new wine she pours and milk from the udder warm with mystic murmurs to complete the charm and subterranean deities alarm to the stern king of ghosts she next applied and gentle proserpine his ravished bride that for old aeson with the laws of fate they would dispense and lengthen his short date thus with repeated prayers she long assails the infernal tyrant and at last prevails then calls to have decrepit aeson brought and stupifies him with a sleeping draught on earth his body like a corpse extends then charges jason and his waiting friends to quit the place that no unhallowed eye into her arts forbidden secrets pry this done the inchantress with her locks unbound about her altars trips a frantic round piecemeal the consecrated wood she splits and dips the splinters in the bloody pits then hurls em on the piles the sleeping sire she lustrates thrice with sulphur water fire in a large cauldron now the medicine boils compounded of her late collected spoils blending into the mesh the various powers of wonderworking juices roots and flowers with gems in the eastern oceans cell refined and such as ebbing tides had left behind to them the midnights pearly dew she flings a screetchowls carcass and ill boding wings nor could the wizard wolfs warm entrails escape that wolf who counterfeits a human shape then from the bottom of her conjring bag snakes skins and liver of a longlived stag last a crows head to such an age arrived that he had now nine centuries survived these and with these a thousand more that grew in sundry soils into her pot she threw then with a withered olivebough she rakes the bubling broth the bough fresh verdure takes green leaves at first the perished plant surround which the next minute with ripe fruit were crowned the foaming juices now the brink oerswell the barren heath wherever the liquor fell sprang out with vernal grass and all the pride of blooming may  when this medea spied she cuts her patients throat thexhausted blood recruiting with her new enchanted flood while at his mouth and through his opening wound a double inlet her infusion found his feeble frame resumes a youthful air a glossy brown his hoary beard and hair the meager paleness from his aspect fled and in its room sprang up a florid red through all his limbs a youthful vigor flies his emptied artries swell with fresh supplies gazing spectators scarce believe their eyes but aeson is the most surpised to find a happy change in body and in mind in sense and constitution the same man as when his fortieth active year began bacchus who from the clouds this wonder viewed medeas method instantly pursued and his indulgent nurses youth renewed the death of pelias thus far obliging love employed her art but now revenge must act a tragic part medea feigns a mortal quarrel bred betwixt her and the partner of her bed on this pretense to pelias court she flies who languishing with age and sickness lies his innocent daughters with inveigling wiles and welldissembled friendship she beguiles the strange achievements of her art she tells with aesons cure and long on that she dwells till them to firm persuasion she has won the same for their old father may be done for him they court her to employ her skill and put upon the cure what price she will at first she is mute and with a grave pretense of difficulty holds em in suspense then promises and bids em from the fold choose out a ram the most infirm and old that so by fact their doubts may be removed and first on him the operation proved a wreathhornd ram is brought so far oergrown with years his age was to that age unknown of sense too dull the piercing point to feel and scarce sufficient blood to stain the steel his carcass she into a cauldron threw with drugs whose vital qualities she knew his limbs grow less he casts his horns and years and tender bleatings strike their wondering ears then instantly leaps forth a frisking lamb that seeks too young to graze a suckling dam the sisters thus confirmed with the success her promise with renewed entreaty press to countenance the cheat three nights and days before experiment the inchantress stays then into limpid water from the springs weeds and ingredients of no force she flings with antique ceremonies for pretense and rambling rhymes without a word of sense mean while the king with all his guards lay bound in magic sleep scarce that of death so sound the daughters now are by the sorcress led into his chamber and surround his bed your fathers healths concerned and can ye stay unnatral nymphs why this unkind delay unsheath your swords dismiss his lifeless blood and i will recruit it with a vital flood your fathers life and health is in your hand and can ye thus like idle gazers stand unless you are of common sense bereft if yet one spark of piety is left dispatch a fathers cure and disengage the monarch from his toilsome load of age come  drench your weapons in his putrid gore it is charity to wound when wounding will restore thus urged the poor deluded maids proceed betrayed by zeal to an inhumane deed and in compassion make a father bleed yes she who had the kindest tenderest heart is foremost to perform the bloody part yet though to act the butchery betrayed they could not bear to see the wounds they made with looks averted backward they advance then strike and stab and leave the blows to chance waking in consternation he essays weltring in blood his feeble arms to raise environed with so many swords  from whence this barbarous usage what is my offense what fatal fury what infernal charm against a kind father does his daughters arm hearing his voice as thunderstruck they stopped their resolution and their weapons dropped medea then the mortal blow bestows and that performed the tragic scene to close his corpse into the boiling cauldron throws then dreading the revenge that must ensue high mounted on her dragoncoach she flew and in her stately progress through the skies beneath her shady pelion first she spies with othrys that above the clouds did rise with skilful chirons cave and neighboring ground for old cerambus strange escape renowned by nymphs delivered when the world was drowned who him with unexpected wings supplied when deluged hills a safe retreat denied aeolian pitane on her left hand she saw and there the statud dragon stand with idas grove where bacchus to disguise his sons bold theft and to secure the prize made the stolen steer a stag to represent cocytus fathers sandy monument and fields that held the murdered sires remains where howling moera frights the startled plains euryphilus high town with towers defaced by hercules and matrons more disgraced with sprouting horns in signal punishment from juno or resenting venus sent then rhodes which phoebus did so dearly prize and jove no less severely did chastize for he the wizzard natives poisning sight that used the farmers hopeful crops to blight in rage overwhelmed with everlasting night cartheias ancient walls come next in view where once the sire almost a statue grew with wonder which a strange event did move his daughter turned into a turtledove then hyries lake and tempes field oerran famed for the boy who there became a swan for there enamored phyllius like a slave performed what tasks his paramour would crave for presents he had mountainvultures caught and from the desert a tame lion brought then a wild bull commanded to subdue the conquered savage by the horns he drew but mocked so often the treatment he disdains and from the craving boy this prize detains then thus in choler the resenting lad will not you deliver him  you will wish you had nor sooner said but in a peevish mood leapt from the precipice on which he stood the standersby were struck with fresh surprise instead of falling to behold him rise a snowy swan and soaring to the skies but dearly the rash prank his mother cost who ignorantly gave her son for lost for his misfortune wept till she became a lake and still renowned with hyries name thence to latonas isle where once were seen transformed to birds a monarch and his queen far off she saw how old cephisus mourned his son into a seele by phoebus turned and where astonished at a stranger sight eumelus gazed on his winged daughters flight aetolian pleuron she did next survey where sons a mothers murder did essay but sudden plumes the matron bore away on her right hand cyllene a fair soil fair till menephron there the beauteous hill attempted with fowl incest to defile her harnessed dragons now direct she drives for corinth and at corinth she arrives where if what old tradition tells be true in former ages men from mushrooms grew but here medea finds her bed supplied during her absence by another bride and hopeless to recover her lost game she sets both bride and palace in a flame nor could a rivals death her wrath assuage nor stopped at creons family her rage she murders her own infants in despite to faithless jason and in jasons sight yet ever his sword could reach her up she springs securely mounted on her dragons wings the story of aegeus from hence to athens she directs her flight where phineus so renowned for doing right where periphas and polyphemons niece soaring with sudden plumes amazed the towns of greece here aegeus so engaging she addressed that first he treats her like a royal guest then takes the sorcress for his wedded wife the only blemish of his prudent life mean while his son from actions of renown arrives at court but to his sire unknown medea to dispatch a dangerous heir she knew him did a poisonous draught prepare drawn from a drug was long reserved in store for desperate uses from the scythian shore that from the echydnaean monsters jaws derived it is origin and this the cause through a dark cave a craggy passage lies to ours ascending from the nether skies through which by strength of hand alcides drew chained cerberus who laggd and restive grew with his bleard eyes our brighter day to view thrice he repeated his enormous yell with which he scares the ghosts and startles hell at last outrageous though compelled to yield he sheds his foam in fury on the field which with its own and rankness of the ground produced a weed by sorcerers renowned the strongest constitution to confound called aconite because it can unlock all bars and force its passage through a rock the pious father by her wheedles won presents this deadly potion to his son who with the same assurance takes the cup and to the monarchs health had drank it up but in the very instant he applied the goblet to his lips old aegeus spied the ivryhilted sword that graced his side that certain signal of his son he knew and snacht the bowl away the sword he drew resolved for such a sons endangered life to sacrifice the most perfidious wife revenge is swift but her more active charms a whirlwind raised that snatched her from his arms while conjured clouds their baffled sense surprise she vanishes from their deluded eyes and through the hurricane triumphant flies the generous king although oerjoyd to find his son was safe yet bearing still in mind the mischief by his treacherous queen designed the horror of the deed and then how near the danger drew he stands congealed with fear but soon that fear into devotion turns with grateful incense every altar burns proud victims and unconscious of their fate stalk to the temple there to die in state in athens never had a day been found for mirth like that grand festival renowned promiscuously the peers and people dine promiscuously their thankful voices join in songs of wit sublimed by spritely wine to listening spheres their joint applause they raise and thus resound their matchless theseus praise great theseus thee the marathonian plain admires and wears with pride the noble stain of the dire monsters blood by valiant theseus slain that now cromyons swains in safety sow and reap their fertile field to thee they owe by thee the infested epidaurian coast was cleared and now can a free commerce boast the traveller his journey can pursue with pleasure the late dreaded valley view and cry here theseus the grand robber slew cephysus flood cries to his rescued shore the merciless procrustes is no more in peace eleusis cenes rites renew since theseus sword the fierce cercyon slew by him the tortrer sinis was destroyed of strength but strength to barbarous use employed that tops of tallest pines to earth could bend and thus in pieces wretched captives rend inhuman scyron now has breathed his last and now alcathoes roads securely past by theseus slain and thrown into the deep but earth nor sea his scattered bones would keep which after floating long a rock became still infamous with scyrons hated name when fame to count thy acts and years proceeds thy years appear but ciphers to thy deeds for thee brave youth as for our commonwealth we pray and drink in yours the public health your praise the senate and plebeians sing with your loved name the court and cottage ring you make our shepherds and our sailors glad and not a house in this vast citys sad but mortal bliss will never come sincere pleasure may lead but grief brings up the rear while for his sons arrival revling joy aegeus and all his subjects does employ while they for only costly feasts prepare his neighboring monarch minos threatens war weak in landforces nor by sea more strong but powerful in a deep resented wrong for a sons murder armed with pious rage yet prudently before he would engage to raise auxiliaries resolved to sail and with the powerful princes to prevail first anaphe then proud astypalaea gains by presents that and this by threats obtains low mycone cymolus chalky soil tall cythnos scyros flat seriphos isle paros with marble cliffs afar displayed impregnable sithonia yet betrayed to a weak foe by a goldadmiring maid who changed into a daw of sable hue still hoards up gold and hides it from the view but as these islands cheerfully combine others refuse to embark in his design now leftward with an easy sail he bore and prosperous passage to o enopias shore o enopia once but now aegina called and with his royal mothers name installed by aeacus under whose reign did spring the myrmidons and now their reigning king down to the port amidst the rabble run the princes of the blood with telamon peleus the next and phocus the third son then aeacus although oppressed with years to ask the cause of their approach appears that question does the gnossians grief renew and sighs from his afflicted bosom drew yet after a short solemn respite made the ruler of the hundred cities said assist our arms raised for a murdered son in this religious war no risque you will run revenge the dead  for who refuse to give rest to their urns unworthy are to live what you request thus aeacus replies not i but truth and common faith denies athens and we have long been sworn allies our leagues are fixed confedrate are our powers and who declare themselves their foes are ours minos rejoins your league shall dearly cost yet mindful how much safer twas to boast than there to waste his forces and his fame before in field with his grand foe he came parts without blows  nor long had left the shore ever int port another navy bore with cephalus and all his jolly crew the aeacides their old acquaintance knew the princes bid him welcome and in state conduct the hero to their palace gate who entering seemed the charming mein to wear as when in youth he paid his visit there in his right hand an olive branch he holds and salutation past the chief unfolds his embassy from the athenian state their mutual friendship leagues of ancient date their common danger every thing could wake concern and his address successful make strengthening his plea with all the charms of sense and those with all the charms of eloquence then thus the king like suitors do you stand for that assistance which you may command athenians all our listed forces use they are such as no bold service will refuse and when you have drawn them off the gods be praised fresh legions can within our isle be raised so stocked with people that we can prepare both for domestic and for distant war ours or our friends insulters to chastize long may ye flourish thus the prince replies strange transport seized me as i passed along to meet so many troops and all so young as if your army did of twins consist yet amongst them my late acquaintance missed even all that to your palace did resort when first you entertained me at your court and cannot guess the cause from whence could spring so vast a change  then thus the sighing king illustrious guest to my strange tale attend of sad beginning but a joyful end the whole to a vast history would swell i shall but half and that confusedly tell that race whom so deservdly you admired are all into their silent tombs retired they fell and falling how they shook my state thought may conceive but words can never relate the story of ants changed to men by mr stonestreet a dreadful plague from angry juno came to scourge the land that bore her rivals name before her fatal anger was revealed and teeming malice lay as yet concealed all remedies we try all medicines use which nature could supply or art produce the unconquered foe derides the vain design and art and nature foiled declare the cause divine at first we only felt the oppressive weight of gloomy clouds then teeming with our fate and laboring to discharge unactive heat but ere four moons alternate changes knew with deadly blasts the fatal south wind blew infected all the air and poisoned as it flew our fountains too a dire infection yield for crowds of vipers creep along the field and with polluted gore and baneful steams taint all the lakes and venom all the streams the young disease with milder force began and raged on birds and beasts excusing man the laboring oxen fall before the plow the unhappy plowmen stare and wonder how the tabid sheep with sickly bleatings pines its wool decreasing as its strength declines the warlike steed by inward foes compelled neglects his honors and deserts the field unnervd and languid seeks a base retreat and at the manger groans but wished a nobler fate the stags forget their speed the boars their rage nor can the bears the stronger herds engage a general faintness does invade em all and in the woods and fields promiscuously they fall the air receives the stench and strange to say the ravenous birds and beasts avoid the prey the offensive bodies rot upon the ground and spread the dire contagion all around but now the plague grown to a larger size riots on man and scorns a meaner prize intestine heats begin the civil war and flushings first the latent flame declare and breath inspired which seemed like fiery air their black dry tongues are swelled and scarce can move and short thick sighs from panting lungs are drove they gape for air with flattering hopes tabate their raging flames but that augments their heat no bed no covering can the wretches bear but on the ground exposed to open air they lie and hope to find a pleasing coolness there the suffering earth with that oppression cursed returns the heat which they imparted first in vain physicians would bestow their aid vain all their art and useless all their trade and they even they who fleeting life recall feel the same powers and undistinguished fall if any proves so daring to attend his sick companion or his darling friend the officious wretch sucks in contagious breath and with his friend does sympathize in death and now the care and hopes of life are past they please their fancies and indulge their taste at brooks and streams regardless of their shame each sex promiscuous strives to quench their flame nor do they strive in vain to quench it there for thirst and life at once extinguished are thus in the brooks the dying bodies sink but heedless still the rash survivors drink so much uneasy down the wretches hate they fly their beds to struggle with their fate but if decaying strength forbids to rise the victim crawls and rouls till on the ground he lies each shuns his bed as each would shun his tomb and thinks the infection only lodged at home here one with fainting steps does slowly creep over heaps of dead and straight augments a heap another while his strength and tongue prevailed bewails his friend and falls himself bewailed this with imploring looks surveys the skies the last dear office of his closing eyes but finds the heavens implacable and dies what now ah what employed my troubled mind but only hopes my subjects fate to find what place soever my weeping eyes survey there in lamented heaps the vulgar lay as acorns scatter when the winds prevail or mellow fruit from shaken branches fall you see that dome which rears its front so high it is sacred to the monarch of the sky how many there with unregarded tears and fruitless vows sent up successless prayers there fathers for expiring sons implored and there the wife bewailed her gasping lord with pious offerings they would appease the skies but they ere yet the attoning vapors rise before the altars fall themselves a sacrifice they fall while yet their hands the gums contain the gums surviving but their offrers slain the destined ox with holy garlands crowned prevents the blow and feels an unexpected wound when i my self invoked the powers divine to drive the fatal pest from me and mine when now the priest with hands uplifted stood prepared to strike and shed the sacred blood the gods themselves the mortal stroke bestow the victim falls but they impart the blow scarce was the knife with the pale purple stained and no presages could be then obtained from putrid entrails where the infection reigned death stalked around with such resistless sway the temples of the gods his force obey and suppliants feel his stroke while yet they pray go now said he your deities implore for fruitless aid for i defy their power then with a cursed malicious joy surveyed the very altars stained with trophies of the dead the rest grown mad and frantic with despair urge their own fate and so prevent the fear strange madness that when death pursued so fast to anticipate the blow with impious haste no decent honor to their urns are paid nor could the graves receive the numerous dead for or they lay unburyd on the ground or unadorned a needy funeral found all reverence past the fainting wretches fight for funeral piles which were anothers right unmournd they fall for who survived to mourn and sires and mothers unlamented burn parents and sons sustain an equal fate and wandering ghosts their kindred shadows meet the dead a larger space of ground require nor are the trees sufficient for the fire despairing under griefs oppressive weight and sunk by these tempestuous blasts of fate o jove said i if common fame says true if ever aegina gave those joys to you if ever you lay enclosed in her embrace fond of her charms and eager to possess o father if you do not yet disclaim paternal care nor yet disown the name grant my petitions and with speed restore my subjects numerous as they were before or make me partner of the fate they bore i spoke and glorious lightning shone around and rattling thunder gave a prosperous sound so let it be and may these omens prove a pledge said i of your returning love by chance a reverend oak was near the place sacred to jove and of dodonas race where frugal ants laid up their winter meat whose little bodies bear a mighty weight we saw them march along and hide their store and much admired their number and their power admired at first but after envied more full of amazement thus to jove i prayed o grant since thus my subjects are decayed as many subjects to supply the dead i prayed and strange convulsions moved the oak which murmured though by ambient winds unshook my trembling hands and stiff erected hair expressed all tokens of uncommon fear yet both the earth and sacred oak i kissed and scarce could hope yet still i hoped the best for wretches whatsoever the fates divine expound all omens to their own design but now twas night when even distraction wears a pleasing look and dreams beguile our cares lo the same oak appears before my eyes nor altered in its shape nor former size as many ants the numerous branches bear the same their labor and their frugal care the branches too a like commotion found and shook the industrious creatures on the ground who by degrees what is scarce to be believed a nobler form and larger bulk received and on the earth walked an unusual pace with manly strides and an erected face their numerous legs and former color lost the insects could a human figure boast i wake and waking find my cares again and to the unperforming gods complain and call their promise and pretenses vain yet in my court i heard the murmuring voice of strangers and a mixed uncommon noise but i suspected all was still a dream till telamon to my apartment came opening the door with an impetuous haste o come said he and see your faith and hopes surpast i follow and confused with wonder view those shapes which my presaging slumbers drew i saw and owned and called them subjects they confessed my power submissive to my sway to jove restorer of my race decayed my vows were first with due oblations paid i then divide with an impartial hand my empty city and my ruined land to give the newborn youth an equal share and call them myrmidons from what they were you saw their persons and they still retain the thrift of ants though now transformed to men a frugal people and inured to sweat laboring to gain and keeping what they get these equal both in strength and years shall join their willing aid and follow your design with the first southern gale that shall present to fill your sails and favor your intent continued by mr tate with such discourse they entertain the day the evening past in banquets sport and play then having crowned the night with sweet repose aurora with the wind at east arose now pallas sons to cephalus resort and cephalus with pallas sons to court to the kings levee him sleeps silken chain and pleasing dreams beyond his hour detain but then the princes of the blood in state expect and meet em at the palace gate the story of cephalus and procris to thinmost courts the grecian youths were led and placed by phocus on a tyrian bed who soon observing cephalus to hold a dart of unknown wood but armed with gold none better loves said he the huntsmans sport or does more often to the woods resort yet i that javlins stem with wonder view too brown for box too smooth a grain for yew i cannot guess the tree but never art did form or eyes behold so fair a dart the guest then interrupts him  twoud produce still greater wonder if you knew its use it never fails to strike the game and then comes bloody back into your hand again then ph each particular desires and the author of the wondrous gift enquires to which the owner thus with weeping eyes and sorrow for his wifes sad fate replies this weapon here o prince can you believe this dart the cause for which so much i grieve and shall continue to grieve on till fate afford such wretched life no longer date would i this fatal gift had never enjoyed this fatal gift my tender wife destroyed procris her name allied in charms and blood to fair orythia courted by a god her father sealed my hopes with rites divine but firmer love before had made her mine men called me blessed and blessed i was indeed the second month our nuptials did succeed when as upon hymettus dewy head for mountain stags my net betimes i spread aurora spied and ravished me away with reverence to the goddess i must say against my will for procris had my heart nor would her image from my thoughts depart at last in rage she cried ungrateful boy go to your procris take your fatal joy and so dismissed me musing as i went what those expressions of the goddess meant a thousand jealous fears possess me now lest procris had profaned her nuptial vow her youth and charms did to my fancy paint a lewd adultress but her life a saint yet i was absent long the goddess too taught me how far a woman could be true auroras treatment much suspicion bred besides who truly love even shadows dread i strait impatient for the trial grew what courtship backed with richest gifts could do auroras envy aided my design and lent me features far unlike to mine in this disguise to my own house i came but all was chaste no conscious sign of blame with thousand arts i scarce admittance found and then beheld her weeping on the ground for her lost husband hardly i retained my purpose scarce the wished embrace refrained how charming was her grief then phocus guess what killing beauties waited on her dress her constant answer when my suit i pressed forbear my lords dear image guards this breast wherever he is whatever cause detains whoeer has his my heart unmoved remains what greater proofs of truth than these could be yet i persist and urge my destiny at length she found when my own form returned her jealous lover there whose loss she mourned enraged with my suspicion swift as wind she fled at once from me and all mankind and so became her purpose to retain a nymph and huntress in dianas train forsaken thus i found my flames increase i owned my folly and i sud for peace it was a fault but not of guilt to move such punishment a fault of too much love thus i retrieved her to my longing arms and many happy days possessed her charms but with herself she kindly did confer what gifts the goddess had bestowed on her the fleetest greyhound with this lovely dart and i of both have wonders to impart near thebes a savage beast of race unknown laid waste the field and bore the vineyards down the swains fled from him and with one consent our grecian youth to chase the monster went more swift than lightning he the toils surpast and in his course spears men and trees oercast we slipped our dogs and last my lelaps too when none of all the mortal race would do he long before was struggling from my hands and ere we could unloose him broke his bands that minute where he was we could not find and only saw the dust he left behind i climbed a neighboring hill to view the chase while in the plain they held an equal race the savage now seems caught and now by force to quit himself nor holds the same strait course but running counter from the foe withdraws and with short turning cheats his gaping jaws which he retrieves and still so closely pressed you would fear at every stretch he were possessed yet for the gripe his fangs in vain prepare the game shoots from him and he chops the air to cast my javelin then i took my stand but as the thongs were fitting to my hand while to the valley i oerlookd the wood before my eyes two marble statues stood that as pursued appearing at full stretch this barking after and at point to catch some god their course did with this wonder grace that neither might be conquered in the chase a sudden silence here his tongue suppressed he here stops short and fain would wave the rest the eager prince then urged him to impart the fortune that attended on the dart first then said he past joys let me relate for bliss was the foundation of my fate no language can those happy hours express did from our nuptials me and procris bless the kindest pair what more could heaven confer for she was all to me and i to her had jove made love great jove had been despised and i my procris more than venus prized thus while no other joy we did aspire we grew at last one soul and one desire forth to the woods i went at break of day the constant practice of my youth for prey nor yet for servant horse or dog did call i found this single dart to serve for all with slaughter tired i sought the cooler shade and winds that from the mountains pierced the glade come gentle air so was i wont to say come gentle air sweet aura come away this always was the burden of my song come swage my flames sweet aura come along thou always art most welcome to my breast i faint approach thou dearest kindest guest these blandishments and more than these i said by fate to unsuspected ruin led thou art my joy for thy dear sake i love each desert hill and solitary grove when faint with labor i refreshment need for cordials on thy fragrant breath i feed at last a wandering swain in hearing came and cheated with the sound of auras name he thought i had some assignation made and to my procris ear the news conveyed great love is soonest with suspicion fired she swoond and with the tale almost expired ah wretched heart she cried ah faithless man and then to curse the imagined nymph began yet often she doubts often hopes she is deceived and chides herself that ever she believed her lord to such injustice could proceed till she herself were witness of the deed next morn i to the woods again repair and weary with the chase invoke the air approach dear aura and my bosom cheer at which a mournful sound did strike my ear yet i proceeded till the thicket by with rustling noise and motion drew my eye i thought some beast of prey was sheltered there and to the covert threw my certain spear from whence a tender sigh my soul did wound ah me it cried and did like procris sound procris was there too well the voice i knew and to the place with headlong horror flew where i beheld her gasping on the ground in vain attempting from the deadly wound to draw the dart her loves dear fatal gift my guilty arms had scarce the strength to lift the beauteous load my silks and hair i tore if possible to stanch the pressing gore for pity begged her keep her flitting breath and not to leave me guilty of her death while i entreat she fainted fast away and these few words had only strength to say by all the sacred bonds of plighted love by all your reverence to the powers above by all that made me charming once appear by all the truth for which you held me dear and last by love the cause through which i bleed let aura never to my bed succeed i then perceived the error of our fate and told it her but found and told too late i felt her lower to my bosom fall and while her eyes had any sight at all on mine she fixed them in her pangs still pressed my hand and sighed her soul into my breast yet being undeceived resigned her breath methought more cheerfully and smiled in death with such concern the weeping hero told this tale that none who heard him could withold from melting into sympathizing tears till aeacus with his two sons appears whom he commits with their newlevyd bands to fortunes and so brave a genrals hands the end of the seventh book to her grace the duchess of rutla  du guernier  ovids metamorphoses book

inclined the impartial maid between em both her equal wings displayed high on the walls by phoebus vocal made a turret of the palace raised its head and where the god his tuneful harp resigned the sound within the stones still lay enshrined hither the daughter of the purple king ascended often to hear its music ring and striking with a pebble would release the enchanted notes in times of happy peace now too from thence the curious maid beheld rough feats of arms and combats of the field and since the siege was long had learnt the name of every chief his character and fame their arms their horse and quiver she descried nor could the dress of war the warrior hide europas son she knew above the rest and more than well became a virgin breast in vain the crested morion veils his face she thinks it adds a more peculiar grace his ample shield embost with burnished gold still makes the bearer lovelier to behold when the tough javelin with a whirl he sends his strength and skill the sighing maid commends or when he strains to draw the circling bow and his fine limbs a manly posture show compared with phoebus he performs so well let her be judge and minos shall excel but when the helm put off displayed to sight and set his features in an open light when vaulting to his seat his steed he pressed caparisond in gold and richly dressed himself in scarlet sumptuously arrayed new

troops without dismay or throw her body to the distant ground and in the cretans happy camp be found would minos but desire it she would expose her native country to her countrys foes unbar the gates

aloft her hair where runst thou thus she vents her deep distress why shunst thou her that crowned thee with success her whose fond love to thee could sacrifice her country and her parent sacred ties can nor my love nor proffered presents find a passage to thy heart and make thee kind can nothing move thy pity o ingrate can thou behold my lost forlorn estate and not be softened can thou throw off one who has no refuge left but thee alone where shall i seek for comfort whither fly my native country does in ashes lie or were it not so my treason bars me there and bids me wander shall i next repair to a wronged father by my guilt undone  me all mankind deservedly will shun i out of all the world my self have thrown to purchase an access to crete alone which since refused ungenrous man give over to boast thy race europa never bore a thing so savage thee some tygress bred on the bleak syrts inhospitable bed or where charybdis pours its rapid tide tempestuous thou art not to jove

now my death behold exult o city by my baseness sold minos obdurate has avenged ye all but twere more just by those i wronged to fall for why should thou who only did subdue by my offending my offense pursue well art thou matched to one whose amorous flame too fiercely raged for humankind to tame one who within a wooden heifer thrust courted a lowering bulls mistaken lust and from whose monsterteeming womb the earth received what much it mourned a biform birth but what avail my plaints the whistling wind which bears him far away leaves them behind well weighed pasiphae when she preferred a bull to thee more brutish than the herd but ah time presses and the labored oars to distance drive the fleet and lose the lessening shores think not ungrateful man the liquid way and threatening billows shall enforce my stay i will follow thee in spite my arms i will throw around thy oars or grasp thy crooked prow and drag through drenching seas her eager tongue had hardly closed the speech when forth she sprung and proved the deep cupid with added force recruits each nerve and aids her watery course soon she the ship attains unwelcome guest and as with close embrace its sides she pressed a hawk from upper air came pouring down it was nisus cleft the sky with wings newgrown at scyllas head his horny bill he aims she fearful of the blow the ship disclaims quitting her hold and yet she fell not far but wondering finds herself sustained in air changed to a lark she mottled pinions shook and from the ravished lock the name of ciris took the labyrinth now minos landed on the cretan shore performs his vows to joves protecting power a hundred bullocks of the largest breed with flowrets crowned before his altar bleed while trophies of the vanquished brought from far adorn the palace with the spoils of war mean while the monster of a humanbeast his familys reproach and stain increased his double kind the rumor swiftly spread and evidenced the mothers beastly deed when minos willing to conceal the shame that sprung from the reports of tattling fame resolves a dark enclosure to provide and far from sight the twoformd creature hide great daedalus of athens was the man that made the draught and formed the wondrous plan where rooms within themselves encircled lie with various windings to deceive the eye as soft maeanders wanton current plays when through the phrygian fields it loosely strays backward and forward rouls the dimpld tide seeming at once two different ways to glide while circling streams their former banks survey and waters past succeeding waters see now floating to the sea with downward course now pointing upward to its ancient source such was the work so intricate the place that scarce the workman all its turns could trace and daedalus was puzzled how to find the secret ways of what himself designed these private walls the minotaure include who twice was glutted with athenian blood but the third tribute more successful proved slew the foul monster and the plague removed when theseus aided by the virgins art had traced the guiding thread through every part he took the gentle maid that set him free and bound for dias cut the briny sea there quickly cloyed ungrateful and unkind left his fair consort in the isle behind whom bacchus saw and straining in his arms her rifld bloom and violated charms resolves for this the dear engaging dame should shine for ever in the rolls of fame and bids her crown among the stars be placed with an eternal constellation graced the golden circlet mounts and as it flies its diamonds twinkle in the distant skies there in their pristin form the gemmy rays between alcides and the dragon blaze the story of daedalus and icarus in tedious exile now too long detained daedalus languishd for his native land the sea foreclosd his flight yet thus he said though earth and water in subjection laid o cruel minos thy dominion be well go through air for sure the air is free then to new arts his cunning thought applies and to improve the work of nature tries a row of quills in gradual order placed rise by degrees in length from first to last as on a cliff the ascending thicket grows or different reeds the rural pipe compose along the middle runs a twine of flax the bottom stems are joined by pliant wax thus well compact a hollow bending brings the fine composure into real wings his boy young icarus that near him stood unthinking of his fate with smiles pursued the floating feathers which the moving air bore loosely from the ground and wafted here and there or with the wax impertinently played and with his childish tricks the great design delayed the final masterstroke at last imposed and now the neat machine completely closed fitting his pinions on a flight he tries and hung selfballancd in the beaten skies then thus instructs his child my boy take care to wing your course along the middle air if low the surges wet your flagging plumes if high the sun the melting wax consumes steer between both nor to the northern skies nor south orion turn your giddy eyes but follow me let me before you lay rules for the flight and mark the pathless way then teaching with a fond concern his son he took the untried wings and fixed em on but fixed with trembling hands and as he speaks the tears roll gently down his aged cheeks then kissed and in his arms embraced him fast but knew not this embrace must be the last and mounting upward as he wings his flight back on his charge he turns his aching sight as parent birds when first their callow care leave the high nest to tempt the liquid air then chears him on and often with fatal art reminds the stripling to perform his part these as the angler at the silent brook or mountainshepherd leaning on his crook or gaping plowman from the vale descries they stare and view em with religious eyes and strait conclude em gods since none but they through their own azure skies could find a way now delos paros on the left are seen and samos favored by joves haughty queen upon the right the isle lebynthos named and fair calymne for its honey famed when now the boy whose childish thoughts aspire to loftier aims and make him ramble higher grown wild and wanton more emboldened flies far from his guide and soars among the skies the softening wax that felt a nearer sun dissolved apace and soon began to run the youth in vain his melting pinions shakes his feathers gone no longer air he takes oh father father as he strove to cry down to the sea he tumbled from on high and found his fate yet still subsists by fame among those waters that retain his name the father now no more a father cries ho icarus where are you as he flies where shall i seek my boy he cries again and saw his feathers scattered on the main then cursed his art and funeral rites conferred naming the country from the youth interred a partridge from a neighboring stump beheld the sire his monumental marble build who with peculiar call and fluttering wing chirpt joyful and malicious seemed to sing the only bird of all its kind and late transformed in pity to a feathered state from whence o daedalus thy guilt we date his sisters son when now twelve years were past was with his uncle as a scholar placed the unsuspecting mother saw his parts and genius fitted for the finest arts this soon appeared for when the spiny bone in fishes backs was by the stripling known a rare invention thence he learnt to draw filled teeth in iron and made the grating saw he was the first that from a knob of brass made two strait arms with widening stretch to pass that while one stood upon the centers place the other round it drew a circling space daedalus envied this and from the top of fair minervas temple let him drop feigning that as he leaned upon the tower careless he stooped too much and tumbled over the goddess who the ingenious still befriends on this occasion her assistance lends his arms with feathers as he fell she veils and in the air a newmade bird he sails the quickness of his genius once so fleet still in his wings remains and in his feet still though transformed his ancient name he keeps and with low flight the newshorn stubble sweeps declines the lofty trees and thinks it best to brood in hedgerows over it is humble nest and in remembrance of the former ill avoids the heights and precipices still at length fatigued with long laborious flights on fair sicilias plains the artist lights where cocalus the king that gave him aid was for his kindness with esteem repaid athens no more her doleful tribute sent that hardship

bait of love her sounding quiver on her shoulder tied one hand a dart and one a bow supplied such was her face as in a nymph displayed a fair fierce boy or in a boy betrayed the blushing beauties of a modest maid the caledonian chief at once the dame beheld at once his heart received the flame with heavens averse o happy youth he cried for whom thy fates reserve so fair a bride he sighed and had no leisure more to say his honor called his eyes another way and forced him to pursue the now neglected prey there stood a forest on a mountains brow which overlooked the shaded plains below no sounding ax presumed those trees to bite coeval with the world a venerable sight the heroes there arrived some spread around the toils some search the footsteps on the ground some from the chains the faithful dogs unbound of action eager and intent in thought the chiefs their honorable danger sought a valley stood below the common drain of waters from above and falling rain the bottom was a moist and marshy ground whose edges were with bending oziers crowned the knotty bulrush next in order stood and all within of reeds a trembling wood from hence the boar was roused and sprung amain like lightning sudden on the warriortrain beats down the trees before him shakes the ground the forest echoes to the crackling sound shout the fierce youth and clamours ring around all stood with their

bulk unpropd falls headlong on the plain nestor had failed the fall of troy to see but leaning on his lance he vaulted on a tree then gathering up his feet looked down with fear and thought his monstrous foe was still too near against a stump his tusk the monster grinds and in the sharpened edge new vigor finds then trusting to his arms young othrys sound and ranchd his hips with one continued wound now ledas twins the future stars appear white were their habits white their horses were conspicuous both and both in act to throw their trembling lances brandished at the foe nor had they missed but he to thickets fled concealed from aiming spears not pervious to the steed but telamon rushed in and happd to meet a rising root that held his fastened feet so down he fell whom sprawling on the ground his brother from the wooden gyves unbound mean time the virginhuntress was not slow to expel the shaft from her contracted bow beneath his ear the fastened arrow stood and from the wound appeared the trickling blood she blushed for joy but meleagros raised his voice with loud applause and the fair archer praised he was the first to see and first to show his friends the marks of the successful blow nor shall thy valor want the praises due he said a virtuous envy seized the crew they shout the shouting animates their hearts and all at once employ their thronging darts but out of order thrown in air they join and multitude makes frustrate the design with both his hands the proud ancaeus takes and flourishes his doublebiting ax then forward to his fate he took a stride before the rest and to his fellows cried give place and mark the difference if you can between a woman warrior and a man the boar is doomed nor though diana lend her aid diana can her beast defend thus boasted he then stretched on tiptoe stood secure to make his empty promise good but the more wary beast prevents the blow and upward rips the groin of his audacious foe ancaeus falls his bowels from the wound rush out and clotterd blood distains the ground perithous no small portion of the war pressed on and shook his lance to whom from far thus theseus cried o stay my better part my more than mistress of my heart the heart the strong may fight aloof ancaeus tried his force too near and by presuming died he said and while he spoke his javelin threw hissing in air the unerring weapon flew but on an arm of oak that stood betwixt the marksman and the mark his lance he fixed once more bold jason threw but failed to wound the boar and slew an undeserving hound and through the dog the dart was nailed to ground two spears from meleagers hand were sent with equal force but various in the event the first was fixed in earth the second stood on the boars bristled back and deeply drank his blood now while the tortured savage turns around and flings about his foam impatient of the wound the wounds great author close at hand provokes his rage and plies him with redoubled strokes wheels as he wheels and with his pointed dart explores the nearest passage to his heart quick and more quick he spins in giddy gires then falls and in much foam his soul expires this act with shouts heavnhigh the friendly band applaud and strain in theirs the victors hand then all approach the slain with vast surprise admire on what a breadth of earth he lies and scarce secure reach out their spears afar and blood their points to prove their partnership of war but he the conquering chief his foot impressed on the strong neck of that destructive beast and gazing on the nymph with ardent eyes accept said he fair nonacrine my prize and though inferior suffer me to join my labors and my part of praise with thine at this presents her with the tusky head and chine with rising bristles roughly spread glad she received the gift and seemed to take with double pleasure for the givers sake the rest were seized with sullen discontent and a deaf murmur through the squadron went all envied but the theslyan brethren showed the least respect and thus they vent their spleen aloud lay down those honored spoils nor think to share weak woman as thou art the prize of war ours is the title thine a foreign claim since meleagros from our lineage came trust not thy beauty but restore the prize which he besotted on that face and eyes would rend from us at this enflamed with spite from her they snatch the gift from him the givers right but soon the impatient prince his fauchion drew and cried ye robbers of anothers due now learn the difference at your proper cost betwixt true valor and an empty boast at this advanced and sudden as the word in proud plexippus bosom plunged the sword toxeus amazed and with amazement slow or to revenge or ward the coming blow stood doubting and while doubting thus he stood received the steel bathed in his brothers blood pleased with the first unknown the second news althaea to the temples pays their dues for her sons conquest when at length appear her grisly brethren stretched upon the bier pale at the sudden sight she changed her cheer and with her cheer her robes but hearing tell the cause the manner and by whom they fell twas grief no more or grief and rage were one within her soul at last twas rage alone which burning upwards in succession dries the tears that stood considring in her eyes there lay a log unlighted on the hearth when she was laboring in the throws of birth for the unborn chief the fatal sisters came and raised it up and tossed it on the flame then on the rock a scanty measure place of vital flax and turned the wheel apace and turning sung to this red brand and thee o newborn babe we give an equal destiny so vanished out of view the frighted dame sprung hasty from her bed and quenched the flame the log in secret locked she kept with care and that while thus preserved preserved her heir this brand she now produced and first she strows the hearth with heaps of chips and after blows thrice heaved her hand and heaved she thrice repressed the sister and the mother long contest two doubtful titles in one tender breast and now her eyes and cheeks with fury glow now pale her cheeks her eyes with pity flow now lowering looks presage approaching storms and now prevailing love her face reforms resolved she doubts again the tears she dried with burning rage are by new tears supplied and as a ship which winds and waves assail now with the current drives now with the gale both opposite and neither long prevail she feels a double force by turns obeys the imperious tempest and the impetuous seas so fares althaeas mind she first relents with pity of that pity then repents sister and mother long the scales divide but the beam nodded on the sisters side sometimes she softly sighed then roared aloud but sighs were stifled in the cries of blood the pious impious wretch at length decreed to please her brothers ghost her son should bleed and when the funeral flames began to rise receive she said a sisters sacrifice a mothers bowels burn high in her hand thus while she spoke she held the fatal brand then thrice before the kindled pile she bowed and the three furies thrice invoked aloud come come revenging sisters come and view a sister paying her dead brothers due a crime i punish and a crime commit but blood for blood and death for death is fit great crimes must be with greater crimes repaid

brand amid the flaming fuel thrown or drew or seemed to draw a dying groan the fires themselves but faintly licked their pr then loathed their impious food and would have shrunk away just then the hero cast a doleful cry and in those absent flames began to fry the blind contagion raged within his veins but he with manly patience bore his pains he feared not fate but only grieved to die without an honest wound and by a death so dry happy ancaeus thrice aloud he cried with what becoming fate in arms he died then called his brothers sisters sire around and her to whom his nuptial vows were bound perhaps his mother a long sigh he drew and his voice failing took his last adieu for as the flames augment and as they stay at their full height then languish to decay they rise and sink by fits at last they soar in one bright blaze and then descend no more just so his inward heats at height impair till the last burning breath shoots out the soul in air now lofty calidon in ruins lies all ages all degrees unsluice their eyes and heaven and earth resound with murmurs groans and cries matrons and maidens beat their breasts and tear their habits and root up their scattered hair the wretched father father now no more with sorrow sunk lies prostrate on the floor deforms his hoary locks with dust obscene and curses age and loathes a life prolonged with pain by steel her stubborn soul his mother freed and punished on her self her impious deed had i a hundred tongues a wit so large as could their hundred offices discharge had phoebus all his helicon bestowed in all the streams inspiring all the god those tongues that wit those streams that god in vain would offer to describe his sisters pain they beat their breasts with many a bruizing blow till they turn livid and corrupt the snow the corpse they cherish while the corpse remains and exercise and rub with fruitless pains and when to funeral flames it is born away they kiss the bed on which the body lay and when those funeral flames no longer burn the dust composed within a pious urn even in that urn their brother they confess and hug it in their arms and to their bosoms press his tomb is raised then stretched along the ground those living monuments his tomb surround even to his name inscribed their tears they pay till tears and kisses wear his name away but cynthia now had all her fury spent not with less ruin than a race content excepting gorge perished all the seed and dejanira her whom heaven for hercules decreed satiate at last no longer she pursued the weeping sisters but with wings endud and horny beaks and sent to flit in air who yearly round the tomb in feathered flocks repair the transformation of the naiads by mr vernon theseus mean while acquitting well his share in the bold chase confedrate like a war to athens lofty towers his march ordained by pallas loved and where erectheus reigned but achelous stopped him on the way by rains a deluge and constrained his stay o famed for glorious deeds and great by blood rest here says he nor trust the rapid flood it solid oaks has from its margin tore and rocky fragments down its current bore the murmur hoarse and terrible the roar often have i seen herds with their sheltering fold forced from the banks and in the torrent rould nor strength the bulky steer from ruin freed nor matchless swiftness saved the racing steed in cataracts when the dissolving snow falls from the hills and floods the plains below tossed by the eddies with a giddy round strong youths are in the sucking whirlpools drowned it is best with me in safety to abide till usual bounds restrain the cbbing tide and the low waters in their channel glide theseus persuaded in compliance bowed so kind an offer and advice so good o achelous cannot be refused i will use them both said he and both he used the grot he entered pumice built the hall and tophi made the rustic of the wall the floor soft moss an humid carpet spread and various shells the checkered roof inlaid twas now the hour when the declining sun two thirds had of his daily journey run at the spread table theseus took his place next his companions in the daring chase perithous here there elder lelex lay his locks betraying age with sprinkled gray acharnias rivergod disposed the rest graced with the equal honor of the feast elate with joy and proud of such a guest the nymphs were waiters and with naked feet in order served the courses of the meat the banquet done delicious wine they brought of one transparent gem the cup was wrought then the great hero of this gallant train surveying far the prospect of the main what is that land says he the waves embrace and with his finger pointed at the place is it one parted isle which stands alone how named and yet methinks it seems not one to whom the watery god made this reply it is not one isle but five distinct they lie it is distance which deceives the cheated eye but that dianas act may seem less strange these once proud naiads were before their change t was on a day more solemn than the rest then bullocks slain a sacrificial feast the rural gods of all the region near they bid to dance and taste the hallowed cheer me they forgot affronted with the slight my rage and stream swelled to the greatest height and with the torrent of my flooding store large woods from woods and fields from fields i tore the guilty nymphs oh then remembering me i with their country washed into the sea and joining waters with the social main rent the gross land and split the firm champagne since the echinades remote from shore are viewed as many isles as nymphs before perimele turned into an island but yonder far lo yonder does appear an isle a part to me for ever dear from that it sailors perimele name i doting forced by rape a virgins fame hippodamass passion grew so strong galled with the abuse and fretted at the wrong he cast his pregnant daughter from a rock i spread my waves beneath and broke the shock and as her swimming weight my stream conveyed i sud for help divine and thus i prayed o powerful thou whose trident does command the realm of waters which surround the land we sacred rivers wheresoeer begun end

grant her some place or change her to a place which i may ever clasp with my embrace his nodding head the seas great ruler bent and all his waters shook with his assent the nymph still swam though with the fright distressed i felt her heart leap trembling in her breast but hardening soon whilst i her pulse explore a crusting earth cased her stiff body over and as accretions of new cleaving soil enlarged the mass the nymph became an isle the story of baucis and philemon by mr dryden thus achelous ends his audience hear with admiration and admiring fear the powers of heaven except ixions son who laughed at all the gods believed in none he shook his impious head and thus replies these legends are no more than pious lies you attribute too much to heavenly sway to think they give us forms and take away the rest of better minds their sense declared against this doctrine and with horror heard then lelex rose an old experienced man and thus with sober gravity began heavens power is infinite earth air and sea the manufacture mass the making power obey by proof to clear your doubt in phrygian ground two neighboring trees with walls encompassed round stand on a moderate rise with wonder shown one a hard oak a softer linden one i saw the place and them by pittheus sent to phrygian realms my grandsires government not far from thence is seen a lake the haunt of coots and of the fishing cormorant here jove with hermes came but in disguise of mortal men concealed their deities one laid aside his thunder one his rod and many toilsome steps together trod for harbor at a thousand doors they knocked not one of all the thousand but was locked at last an hospitable house they found a homely shed the roof not far from ground was thatched with reeds and straw together bound there baucis and philemon lived and there had lived long married and a happy pair now old in love though little was their store inured to want their poverty they bore nor aimed at wealth professing to be poor for master or for servant here to call was all alike where only two were all command was none where equal love was paid or rather both commanded both obeyed from lofty roofs the gods repulsed before now stooping entered through the little door the man their hearty welcome first expressed a common settle drew for either guest inviting each his weary limbs to rest but ere they sat officious baucis lays two cushions stuffed with straw the seat to raise course but the best she had then rakes the load of ashes from the hearth and spreads abroad the living coals and lest they should expire with leaves and bark she feeds her infant fire it smoaks and then with trembling breath she blows till in a cheerful blaze the flames arose with brushwood and with chips she strengthens these and adds at last the boughs of rotten trees the fire thus formed she sets the kettle on like burnished gold the little seether shone next took the coleworts which her husband got from his own ground a small wellwaterd spot she stripped the stalks of all their leaves the best she culled and them with handy care she dressed high over the hearth a chine of bacon hung good old philemon seized it with a prong and from the sooty rafter drew it down then cut a slice but scarce enough for one yet a large portion of a little store which for their sakes alone he wished were more this in the pot he plunged without delay to tame the flesh and drain the salt away the time between before the fire they sat and shortened the delay by pleasing chat a beam there was on which a beechen pail hung by the handle on a driven nail this filled with water gently warmed they set before their guests in this they bathed their feet and after with clean towels dried their sweat this done the host produced the genial bed sallow the feet the borders and the sted which with no costly coverlet they spread but course old garments yet such robes as these they laid alone at feasts on holydays the good old houswife tucking up her gown the table sets thinvited gods lie down the trivettable of a foot was lame a blot which prudent baucis overcame who thrusts beneath the limping leg a sherd so was the mended board exactly reared then rubbed it over with newlygatherd mint a wholesome herb that breathed a grateful scent pallas began the feast where first was seen the partycolored olive black and green autumnal cornels next in order served in lees of wine well pickled and preserved a gardensallad was the third supply of endive radishes and succory then curds and cream the flower of country fare and newlaid eggs which baucis busy care turned by a gentle fire and roasted rare all these in earthen ware were served to board and next in place an earthen pitcher stored with liquor of the best the cottage could afford this was the tables ornament and pride with figures wrought like pages at his side stood beechen bowls and these were shining clean varnished with wax without and lined within by this the boiling kettle had prepared and to the table sent the smoking lard on which with eager appetite they dine a savry bit that served to relish wine the wine itself was suiting to the rest still working in the must and lately pressed the second course succeeds like that before plums apples nuts and of their wintry store dry figs and grapes and wrinkled dates were set in canisters tenlarge the little treat all these a milkwhite honeycomb surround which in the midst the countrybanquet crowned but the kind hosts their entertainment grace with hearty welcome and an open face in all they did you might discern with ease a willing mind and a desire to please mean time the beechen bowls went round and still though often emptied were observed to fill filled without hands and of their own accord ran without feet and danced about the board devotion seized the pair to see the feast with wine and of no common grape increased and up they held their hands and fell to prayer excusing as they could their country fare one goose they had it was all they could allow a wakeful centry and on duty now whom to the gods for sacrifice they vow her with malicious zeal the couple viewed she ran for life and limping they pursued full well the fowl perceived their bad intent and would not make her masters compliment but persecuted to the powers she flies and close between the legs of jove she lies he with a gracious ear the suppliant heard and saved her life then what he was declared and owned the god the neighborhood said he shall justly perish for impiety you stand alone exempted but obey with speed and follow where we lead the way leave these accursed and to the mountains height ascend nor once look backward in your flight they haste and what their tardy feet denied the trusty staff their better leg supplied an arrows flight they wanted to the top and there secure but spent with travel stop then turn their now no more forbidden eyes lost in a lake the floated level lies a watery desert covers all the plains their cot alone as in an isle remains wondering with weeping eyes while they deplore their neighbors fate and country now no more their little shed scarce large enough for two seems from the ground increased in height and bulk to grow a stately temple shoots within the skies the crotches of their cot in columns rise the pavement polished marble they behold the gates with sculpture graced the spires and tiles of gold then thus the sire of gods with looks serene speak thy desire thou only just of men and thou o woman only worthy found to be with such a man in marriage bound awhile they whisper then to jove addressed philemon thus prefers their joint request we crave to serve before your sacred shrine and offer at your altars rites divine and since not any action of our life has been polluted with domestic strife we beg one hour of death that neither she with widows tears may live to bury me nor weeping i with withered arms may bear my breathless baucis to the sepulcher the godheads sign their suit they run their race in the same tenor all the appointed space then when their hour was come while they relate these past adventures at the temple gate old baucis is by old philemon seen sprouting with sudden leaves of spritely green old baucis looked where old philemon stood and saw his lengthened arms a sprouting wood new roots their fastened feet begin to bind their bodies stiffen in a rising rind then ere the bark above their shoulders grew they give and take at once their last adieu at once farewell o faithful spouse they said at once the incroaching rinds their closing lips invade even yet an ancient tyanaean shows a spreading oak that near a linden grows the neighborhood confirm the prodigy grave men not vain of tongue or like to lie i saw my self the garlands on their boughs and tablets hung for gifts of granted vows and offering fresher up with pious prayer the good said i are gods peculiar care and such as honor heaven shall heavenly honor share continued by mr vernon the changes of proteus he ceased in his relation to proceed whilst all admired the author and the deed but theseus most inquisitive to know from gods what wondrous alterations grow whom thus the calydonian stream addressed raised high to speak the couch his elbow pressed some when transformed fix in the lasting change some with more right through various figures range proteus thus large thy privilege was found thou inmate of the seas which earth surround sometimes a blooming youth you graced the shore often a fierce lion or a furious boar with glistring spires now seemed an hissing snake the bold would tremble in his hands to take with horns assumed a bull sometimes you proved a tree by roots a stone by weight unmoved sometimes two wavering contraries became flowed down in water or aspired in flame the story of erisichthon in various shapes thus to deceive the eyes without a settled stint of her disguise rash erisichthons daughter had the power and brought it to autolicus in dower her atheist sire the slighted gods defied and ritual honors to their shrines denied as fame reports his hand an ax sustained which ceres consecrated grove profaned which durst the venerable gloom invade and violate with light the awful shade an ancient oak in the dark center stood the coverts glory and itself a wood garlands embraced its shaft and from the boughs hung tablets monuments of prosperous vows in the cool dusk its unpiercd verdure spread the dryads often their hallowed dances led and often when round their gaging arms they cast full fifteen else it measured in the waste its height all under standards did surpass as they aspired above the humbler grass these motives which would gentler minds restrain could not make triopes bold son abstain he sternly charged his slaves with strict decree to fell with gashing steel the sacred tree but whilst they lingering his commands delayed he snatched an ax and thus blaspheming said was this no oak nor ceres favorite care but ceres self this arm unawed should dare its leafy honors in the dust to spread and level with the earth its airy head he spoke and as he poised a slanting stroke sighs heaved and tremblings shook the frighted oak its leaves looked sickly pale its acorns grew and its long branches sweat a chilly dew but when his impious hand a wound bestowed blood from the mangled bark in currents flowed when a devoted bull of mighty size a sinning nations grand atonement dies with such a plenty from the spouting veins a crimson stream the turfy altar stains the wonder all amazed yet one more bold the fact dissuading strove his ax to hold but the thessalian obstinately bent too proud to change too hardened to repent on his kind monitor his eyes which burned with rage and with his eyes his weapon turned take the reward says he of pious dread then with a blow lopd off his parted head no longer checked the wretch his crime pursued doubled his strokes and sacrilege renewed when from the groaning trunk a voice was heard a dryad i by ceres love preferred within the circle of this clasping rind coeval grew and now in ruin joined but instant vengeance shall thy sin pursue and death is cheered with this prophetic view at last the oak with cords enforced to bow strained from the top and sapd with wounds below the humbler wood partaker of its fate crushed with its fall and shivered with its weight the grove destroyed the sister dryads moan grieved at its loss and frighted at their own strait suppliants for revenge to ceres go in sable weeds expressive of their woe the beauteous goddess with a graceful air bowed in consent and nodded to their prayer the awful motion shook the fruitful ground and waved the fields with golden harvests crowned soon she contrived in her projecting mind a plague severe and piteous in its kind if plagues for crimes of such presumptuous height could pity in the softest breast create with pinching want and hungers keenest smart to tear his vitals and corrode his heart but since her near approach by fates denied to famine and broad climes their powers divide a nymph the mountains ranger she addressed and thus resolved her high commands expressed the description of famine where frozen scythias utmost bound is placed a desert lies a melancholy waste in yellow crops there nature never smiled no fruitful tree to shade the barren wild there sluggish cold its icy station makes there paleness frights and aguish trembling shakes of pining famine this the fated seat to whom my orders in these words repeat bid her this miscreant with her sharpest pains chastise and sheath herself into his veins be unsubdud by plentys baffled store reject my empire and defeat my power and lest the distance and the tedious way should with the toil and long fatigue dismay ascend my chariot and conveyed on high guide the reind dragons through the parting sky the nymph accepting of the granted carr sprung to the seat and posted through the air nor stopped till she to a bleak mountain came of wondrous height and caucasus its name there in a stony field the fiend she found herbs gnawing and roots scratching from the ground her elfelock hair in matted tresses grew sunk were her eyes and pale her ghastly hue wan were her lips and foul with clammy glue her throat was furred her guts appeared within with snaky crawlings through her parchment skin her jutting hips seemed starting from their place and for a belly was a bellys space her dugs hung dangling from her craggy spine loose to her breast and fastened to her chine her joints protuberant by leanness grown consumption sunk the flesh and raised the bone her knees large orbits bunchd to monstrous size and ancles to undue proportion rise this plague the nymph not daring to draw near at distance hailed and greeted from afar and though she told her charge without delay though her arrival late and short her stay she felt keen famine or she seemed to feel invade her blood and on her vitals steal she turned from the infection to remove and back to thessaly the serpents drove the fiend obeyed the goddesss command though their effects in opposition stand she cut her way supported by the wind and reached the mansion by the nymph assigned twas night when entering erisichthons room dissolved in sleep and thoughtless of his doom she clasped his limbs by impious labor tired with battish wings but her whole self inspired breathed on his throat and chest a tainting blast and in his veins infused an endless fast the task dispatched away the fury flies from plenteous regions and from ripening skies to her old barren north she wings her speed and cottages distressed with pinching need still slumbers erisichthons senses drown and sooth his fancy with their softest down he dreams of viands delicate to eat and revels on imaginary meat chaws with his working mouth but chaws in vain and tires his grinding teeth with fruitless pain deludes his throat with visionary fare feasts on the wind and banquets on the air the morning came the night and slumbers past but still the furious pangs of hunger last the cankrous rage still gnaws with griping pains stings in his throat and in his bowels reigns strait he requires impatient in demand provisions from the air the seas the land but though the land air seas provisions grant starves at full tables and complains of want what to a people might in dole be paid or victual cities for a long blockade could not one wolfish appetite assuage for glutting nourishment increased its rage as rivers poured from every distant shore the sea insatiate drinks and thirsts for more or as the fire which all materials burns and wasted forests into ashes turns grows more voracious as the more it preys recruits dilate the flame and spread the blaze so impious erisichthons hunger raves receives refreshments and refreshments craves food raises a desire for food and meat is but a new provocative to eat he grows more empty as the more supplied and endless cramming but extends the void the transformations of erisichthons daughter now riches hoarded by paternal care were sunk the glutton swallowing up the heir yet the devouring flame no stores abate nor less his hunger grew with his estate one daughter left as left his keen desire a daughter worthy of a better sire her too he sold spent nature to sustain she scorned a lord with generous disdain and flying spread her hands upon the main then prayed grant thou i bondage may escape and with my liberty reward thy rape repay my virgin treasure with thy aid it was neptune who deflowered the beauteous maid the god was moved at what the fair had sud when she so lately by her master viewed in her known figure on a sudden took a fishers habit and a manly look to whom her owner hasted to enquire o thou said he whose baits hide treacherous wire whose art can manage and experienced skill the taper angle and the bobbing quill so may the sea be ruffled with no storm but smooth with calms as you the truth inform so your deceit may no shy fishes feel till struck and fastened on the bearded steel did not you standing view upon the strand a wandering maid i am sure i saw her stand her hair disordered and her homely dress betrayed her want and witnessed her distress me heedless she replied whoever you are excuse attentive to another care i settled on the deep my steady eye fixed on my float and bent on my employ and that you may not doubt what i impart so may the oceans god assist my art if on the beach since i my sport pursued or man or woman but my self i viewed back over the sands deluded he withdrew whilst she for her old form put off her new her sire her shifting power to change perceived and various chapmen by her sale deceived a fowl with spangled plumes a brinded steer sometimes a crested mare or antlerd deer sold for a price she parted to maintain her starving parent with dishonest gain at last all means as all provisions failed for the disease by remedies prevailed his muscles with a furious bite he tore gorged his own tattered flesh and gulphd his gore wounds were his feast his life to life a prey supporting nature by its own decay but foreign stories why should i relate i too my self can to new forms translate though the varietys not unconfined but fixed in number and restrained in kind for often i this present shape retain often curl a snake the volumes of my train sometimes my strength into my horns transferred a bull i march the captain of the herd but whilst i once those goring weapons wore vast wresting force one from my forehead tore lo my maimed brows the injury still own he ceased his words concluding with a groan the end of the eighth book to the rt honbl the countess of linc e kirkall  ovids metamorphoses book ix translated by mr dryden and others the story of achelous and hercules by mr gay theseus requests the god to tell his woes whence his maimed brow and whence his groans arose when thus the calydonian stream replied with twining reeds his careless tresses tied ungrateful is the tale for who can bear when conquered to rehearse the shameful war yet i will the melancholy story trace so great a conquror softens the disgrace nor was it still so mean the prize to yield as great and glorious to dispute the field perhaps you have heard of deianiras name for all the country spoke her beautys fame long was the nymph by numerous suitors wooed each with address his envied hopes pursued i joined the loving band to gain the fair revealed my passion to her fathers ear their vain pretensions all the rest resign alcides only strove to equal mine he boasts his birth from jove recounts his spoils his stepdames hate subdued and finished toils can mortals then said i with gods compare behold a god mine is the watery care through your wide realms i take my mazy way branch into streams and over the region stray no foreign guest your daughters charms adores but one who rises in your native shores let not his punishment your pity move is junos hate an argument for love though you your life from fair alomena drew joves a feigned father or by fraud a true choose then confess thy mothers honor lost or thy descent from jove no longer boast while thus i spoke he looked with stern disdain nor could the sallies of his wrath restrain which thus break forth this arm decides our right vanquish in words be mine the prize in fight bold he rushed on my honor to maintain i fling my verdant garments on the plain my arms stretch forth my pliant limbs prepare and with bent hands expect the furious war over my sleek skin now gathered dust he throws and yellow sand his mighty muscles strows often he my neck and nimble legs assails he seems to grasp me but as often fails each part he now invades with eager hand safe in my bulk immovable i stand so when loud storms break high and foam and roar against some mole that stretches from the shore the firm foundation lasting tempests braves defies the warring winds and driving waves awhile we breathe then forward rush amain renew the combat and our ground maintain foot strove with foot i prone extend my breast hands war with hands and forehead forehead pressed thus have i seen two furious bulls engage inflamed with equal love and equal rage each claims the fairest heifer of the grove and conquest only can decide their love the trembling herds survey the fight from far till victory decides the important war three times in vain he strove my joints to wrest to force my hold and throw me from his breast the fourth he broke my gripe that clasped him round then with new force he stretched me on the ground close to my back the mighty burden clung as if a mountain over my limbs were flung believe my tale nor do i boastful aim by feigned narration to extol my fame no sooner from his grasp i freedom get unlock my arms that flowed with trickling sweat but quick he seized me and renewed the strife as my exhausted bosom pants for life my neck he gripes my knee to earth he strains i fall and bite the sand with shame and pains oermatchd in strength to wiles and arts i take and slip his hold in form of speckled snake who when i wreathed in spires my body round or showed my forky tongue with hissing sound smiles at my threats such foes my cradle knew he cries dire snakes my infant hand oerthrew a dragons form might other conquests gain to war with me you take that shape in vain art thou proportioned to the hydras length who by his wounds received augmented strength he raised a hundred hissing heads in air when one i lopt upsprung a dreadful pair by his wounds fertile and with slaughter strong singly i quelled him and stretched dead along what can thou do a form precarious prone to rouse my rage with terrors not thy own he said and round my neck his hands he cast and with his straining fingers wrung me fast my throat he tortured close as pincers clasp in vain i strove to loose the forceful grasp thus vanquished too a third form still remains changed to a bull my lowing fills the plains strait on the left his nervous arms were thrown upon my brindled neck and tugged it down then deep he struck my horn into the sand and felled my bulk along the dusty land nor yet his fury cooled twixt rage and scorn from my maimed front he tore the stubborn horn this heaped with flowers and fruits the naiads bear sacred to plenty and the bounteous year he spoke when lo a beauteous nymph appears girt like dianas train with flowing hairs the horn she brings in which all autumns stored and ruddy apples for the second board now morn begins to dawn the suns bright fire gilds the high mountains and the youths retire nor stayed they till the troubled stream subsides and in its bounds with peaceful current glides but achelous in his oozy bed deep hides his brow deformed and rustic head no real wound the victors triumph showed but his lost honors grieved the watery god yet even that loss the willows leaves overspread and verdant reeds in garlands bind his head the death of nessus the centaur this virgin too thy love o nessus found to her alone you owe the fatal wound as the strong son of jove his bride conveys where his paternal lands their bulwarks raise where from her slopy urn evenus pours her rapid current swelled by wintry showers he came the frequent eddies whirled the tide and the deep rolling waves all pass denied as for himself he stood unmoved by fears for now his bridal charge employed his cares the stronglimbd nessus thus officious cried for he the shallows of the stream had tried swim thou alcides all thy strength prepare on yonder bank i will lodge thy nuptial care the aonian chief to nessus trusts his wife all pale and trembling for her heros life clothed as he stood in the fierce lions hide the laden quiver over his shoulder tied for cross the stream his bow and club were cast swift he plunged in these billows shall be past he said nor sought where smoother waters glide but stemd the rapid dangers of the tide the bank he reached again the bow he bears when hark his brides known voice alarms his ears nessus to thee i call aloud he cries vain is thy trust in flight be timely wise thou monster doubleshapd my right set free if thou no reverence owe my fame and me yet kindred should thy lawless lust deny think not perfidious wretch from me to fly though winged with horses speed wounds shall pursue swift as his words the fatal arrow flew the centaurs back admits the feathered wood and through his breast the barbed weapon stood which when in anguish through the flesh he tore from both the wounds gushed forth the spumy gore mixed with lernaean venom this he took nor dire revenge his dying breast forsook his garment in the reeking purple died to rouse loves passion he presents the bride the death of hercules now a long interval of time succeeds when the great son of joves immortal deeds and stepdames hate had filled earths utmost round he from o echalia with new laurels crowned in triumph was returned he rites prepares and to the king of gods directs his prayers when fame who falsehood clothes in truths disguise and swells her little bulk with growing lies thy tender ear o deianira moved that hercules the fair iole loved her love believes the tale the truth she fears of his new passion and gives way to tears the flowing tears diffused her wretched grief why seek i thus from streaming eyes relief she cries indulge not thus these fruitless cares the harlot will but triumph in thy tears let something be resolved while yet there is time my bed not conscious of a rivals crime in silence shall i mourn or loud complain shall i seek calydon or here remain what though allied to meleagers fame i boast the honors of a sisters name my wrongs perhaps now urge me to pursue some desperate deed by which the world shall view how far revenge and womans rage can rise when weltring in her blood the harlot dies thus various passions ruled by turns her breast she now resolves to send the fatal vest died with lernaean gore whose power might move his soul anew and rouse declining love nor knew she what her sudden rage bestows when she to lychas trusts her future woes with soft endearments she the boy commands to bear the garment to her husbands hands the unwitting hero takes the gift in haste and over his shoulders lernas poison cast as first the fire with frankincense he strows and utters to the gods his holy vows and on the marble altars polished frame pours forth the grapy stream the rising flame sudden dissolves the subtle poisonous juice which taints his blood and all his nerves bedews with wonted fortitude he bore the smart and not a groan confessed his burning heart at length his patience was subdued by pain he rends the sacred altar from the plain oetes wide forests echo with his cries now to rip off the deathful robe he tries wherever he plucks the vest the skin he tears the mangled muscles and huge bones he bares a ghastful sight or raging with his pain to rend the sticking plague he tugs in vain as the red iron hisses in the flood so boils the venom in his curdling blood now with the greedy flame his entrails glow and livid sweats down all his body flow the cracking nerves burnt up are burst in twain the lurking venom melts his swimming brain then lifting both his hands aloft he cries glut thy revenge dread empress of the skies sat with my death the rancour of thy heart look down with pleasure and enjoy my smart or if ever pity moved an hostile breast for here i stand thy enemy professed take hence this hateful life with tortures torn inured to trouble and to labors born death is the gift most welcome to my woe and such a gift a stepdame may bestow was it for this busiris was subdued whose barbarous temples reekd with strangers blood pressed in these arms his fate antaeus found nor gained recruited vigor from the ground did i not tripleformd geryon fell or did i fear the triple dog of hell did not these hands the bulls armed forehead hold are not our mighty toils in elis told do not stymphalian lakes proclaim thy fame and fair parthenian woods resound thy name who seized the golden belt of thermodon and who the dragonguarded apples won could the fierce centaurs strength my force withstand or the fell boar that spoiled the arcadian land did not these arms the hydras rage subdue who from his wounds to double fury grew what if the thracian horses fat with gore who human bodies in their mangers tore i saw and with their barbarous lord oerthrew what if these hands nemaeas lion slew did not this neck the heavenly globe sustain the female partner of the thundrers reign fatigued at length suspends her harsh commands yet no fatigue has slackd these valiant hands but now new plagues pursue me neither force nor arms nor darts can stop their raging course devouring flame through my racked entrails strays and on my lungs and shrivelled muscles preys yet still eurystheus breathes the vital air what mortal now shall seek the gods with prayer the transformation of lychas into a rock the hero said and with the torture stung furious over oetes lofty hills he sprung stuck with the shaft thus scours the tiger round and seeks the flying author of his wound now might you see him trembling now he vents his anguishd soul in groans and loud laments he strives to tear the clinging vest in vain and with uprooted forests strows the plain now kindling into rage his hands he rears and to his kindred gods directs his prayers when lychas lo he spies who trembling flew and in a hollow rock concealed from view had shunned his wrath now grief renewed his pain his madness chaffd and thus he raves again lychas to thee alone my fate i owe who bore the gift the cause of all my woe the youth all pale with shivering fear was stung and vain excuses faulterd on his tongue alcides snatched him as with suppliant face he strove to clasp his knees and beg for grace he tossed him over his head with airy course and hurled with more than with an engines force far over the eubaean main aloof he flies and hardens by degrees amid the skies so showry drops when chilly tempests blow thicken at first then whiten into snow in balls congealed the rolling fleeces bound in solid hail result upon the ground thus whirled with nervous force through distant air the purple tide forsook his veins with fear all moisture left his limbs transformed to stone in ancient days the craggy flint was known still in the eubaean waves his front he rears still the small rock in human form appears and still the name of hapless lychas bears the apotheosis of hercules but now the hero of immortal birth fells oetes forests on the groaning earth a pile he builds to philoctetes care he leaves his deathful instruments of war to him commits those arrows which again shall see the bulwarks of the trojan reign the son of paean lights the lofty pyre high round the structure climbs the greedy fire placed on the top thy nervous shoulders spread with the nemaean spoils thy careless head raised on the knotty club with look divine here thou dread hero of celestial line were stretched at ease as when a cheerful guest wine crowned thy bowls and flowers thy temples dressed now on all sides the potent flames aspire and crackle round those limbs that mock the fire a sudden terror seized the immortal host who thought the worlds professed defender lost this when the thundrer saw with smiles he cries it is from your fears ye gods my pleasures rise joy swells my breast that my allruling hand over such a grateful people boasts command that you my suffering progeny would aid though to his deeds this just respect be paid me you have obliged be all your fears forborne the oetean fires do thou great hero scorn who vanquished all things shall subdue the flame that part alone of gross maternal frame fire shall devour while what from me he drew shall live immortal and its force subdue that when he is dead i will raise to realms above may all the powers the righteous act approve if any god dissent and judge too great the sacred honors of the heavenly seat even he shall own his deeds deserve the sky even he reluctant shall at length comply thassembled powers assent no frown till now had marked with passion vengeful junos brow mean while whatever was in the power of flame was all consumed his bodys nervous frame no more was known of human form bereft the eternal part of jove alone was left as an old serpent casts his scaly vest wreathes in the sun in youthful glory dressed so when alcides mortal mold resigned his better part enlarged and grew refined august his visage shone almighty jove in his swift carr his honored offspring drove high over the hollow clouds the coursers fly and lodge the hero in the starry sky the transformation of galanthis atlas perceived the load of heavens new guest revenge still rancourd in eurystheus breast against alcides race alcmena goes to iole to vent maternal woes here she pours forth her grief recounts the spoils her son had bravely reaped in glorious toils this iole by hercules commands hyllus had loved and joined in nuptial bands her swelling womb the teeming birth confessed to whom alcmena thus her speech addressed o may the gods protect thee in that hour when midst thy throws thou callst the ilithyian power may no delays prolong thy racking pain as when i sud for junos aid in vain when now alcides mighty birth drew nigh and the tenth sign rolled forward on the sky my womb extends with such a mighty load as jove the parent of the burden showed i could no more the increasing smart sustain my horror kindles to recount the pain cold chills my limbs while i the tale pursue and now methinks i feel my pangs anew seven days and nights amidst incessant throws fatigued with ills i lay nor knew repose when lifting high my hands in shrieks i prayed implored the gods and called lucinas aid she came but prejudiced to give my fate a sacrifice to vengeful junos hate she hears the groaning anguish of my fits and on the altar at my door she sits over her left knee her crossing leg she cast then knits her fingers close and wrings them fast this stayed the birth in muttring verse she prayed the muttring verse the unfinished birth delayed now with fierce struggles raging with my pain at joves ingratitude i rave in vain how did i wish for death such groans i sent as might have made the flinty heart relent now the cadmeian matrons round me press offer their vows and seek to bring redress among the theban dames galanthis stands strong limbed red haird and just to my commands she first perceived that all these racking woes from the persisting hate of juno rose as here and there she passed by chance she sees the scated goddess on her closepressd knees her fastknit hands she leans with cheerful voice galanthis cries whoever thou art rejoice congratulate the dame she lies at rest at length the gods alcmenas womb have blessed swift from her seat the startled goddess springs no more concealed her hands abroad she flings the charm unloosd the birth my pangs relieved galanthis laughter vexed the power deceived fame says the goddess dragged the laughing maid fast by the hair in vain her force essayed her groveling body from the ground to rear changed to forefeet her shrinking arms appear her hairy back her former hue retains the form alone is lost her strength remains who since the lie did from her mouth proceed shall from her pregnant mouth bring forth her breed nor shall she quit her long frequented home but haunt those houses where she loved to roam the fable of dryope by mr pope she said and for her lost galanthis sighs when the fair consort of her son replies since you a servants ravished form bemoan and kindly sigh for sorrows not your own let me if tears and grief permit relate a nearer woe a sisters stranger fate no nymph of all oechalia could compare for beauteous form with dryope the fair her tender mothers only hope and pride my self the offspring of a second bride this nymph compressed by him who rules the day whom delphi and the delian isle obey andraemon loved and blessed in all those charms that pleased a god succeeded to her arms a lake there was with shelving banks around whose verdant summit fragrant myrtles crowned those shades unknowing of the fates she sought and to the naiads flowery garlands brought her smiling babe a pleasing charge she pressed between her arms and nourished at her breast not distant far a watery lotos grows the spring was new and all the verdant boughs adorned with blossoms promised fruits that vye in glowing colors with the tyrian dye of these she cropped to please her infant son and i my self the same rash act had done but lo i saw as near her side i stood the violated blossoms drop with blood upon the tree i cast a frightful look the trembling tree with sudden horror shook lotis the nymph if rural tales be true as from priapus lawless lust she flew forsook her form and fixing here became a flowery plant which still preserves her name this change unknown astonished at the sight my trembling sister strove to urge her flight yet first the pardon of the nymphs implored and those offended sylvan powers adored but when she backward would have fled she found her stiffning feet were rooted to the ground in vain to free her fastened feet she strove and as she struggles only moves above she feels the incroaching bark around her grow by slow degrees and cover all below surprised at this her trembling hand she heaves to rend her hair her hand is filled with leaves where late was hair the shooting leaves are seen to rise and shade her with a sudden green the child amphisus to her bosom pressed perceived a colder and a harder breast and found the springs that never till then denied their milky moisture on a sudden dried i saw unhappy what i now relate and stood the helpless witness of thy fate embraced thy boughs the rising bark delayed there wished to grow and mingle shade with shade behold andraemon and the unhappy sire appear and for their dryope enquire a springing tree for dryope they find and print warm kisses on the panting rind prostrate with tears their kindred plant bedew and close embraced as to the roots they grew the face was all that now remained of thee no more a woman nor yet quite a tree thy branches hung with humid pearls appear from every leaf distills a trickling tear and strait a voice while yet a voice remains thus through the trembling boughs in sighs complains if to the wretched any faith be given i swear by all the unpitying powers of heaven no wilful crime this heavy vengeance bred in mutual innocence our lives we led if this be false let these new greens decay let sounding axes lop my limbs away and crackling flames on all my honors prey now from my branching arms this infant bear let some kind nurse supply a mothers care yet to his mother let him often be led sport in her shades and in her shades be fed teach him when first his infant voice shall frame imperfect words and lisp his mothers name to hail this tree and say with weeping eyes within this plant my hapless parent lies and when in youth he seeks the shady woods oh let him fly the crystal lakes and floods nor touch the fatal flowers but warned by me believe a goddess shrind in every tree my sire my sister and my spouse farewell if in your breasts or love or pity dwell protect your plant nor let my branches feel the browzing cattle or the piercing steel farewell and since i cannot bend to join my lips to yours advance at least to mine my son thy mothers parting kiss receive while yet thy mother has a kiss to give i can no more the creeping rind invades my closing lips and hides my head in shades remove your hands the bark shall soon suffice without their aid to seal these dying eyes she ceased at once to speak and ceased to be and all the nymph was lost within the tree yet latent life through her new branches reigned and long the plant a human heat retained continued by mr gay iolaus restored to youth while iole the fatal change declares alcmenas pitying hand often wiped her tears grief too streamed down her cheeks soon sorrow flies and rising joy the trickling moisture dries lo iolaus stands before their eyes a youth he stood and the soft down began over his smooth chin to spread and promise man hebe submitted to her husbands prayers instilled new vigor and restored his years the prophecy of themis now from her lips a solemn oath had past that iolaus this gift alone should taste had not just themis thus maturely said which checked her vow and awed the blooming maid thebes is embroiled in war capaneus stands invincible but by the thundrers hands ambition shall the guilty eteocles and polynices brothers fire both rush to mutual wounds and both expire the reeling earth shall open her gloomy womb where the amphiaraus yet breathing bard shall find his tomb the alemaeon son shall bathe his hands in parents blood and in one act be both unjust and good of home and sense deprived wherever he flies the furies and his mothers ghost he spies his wife the fatal bracelet shall implore and phegeus stain his sword in kindred gore callirhoe shall then with suppliant prayer prevail on jupiters relenting ear jove shall with youth her infant sons inspire and bid their bosoms glow with manly fire the debate of the gods when themis thus with prescient voice had spoke among the gods a various murmur broke dissension rose in each immortal breast that one should grant what was denied the rest aurora for her aged spouse complains and ceres grieves for jasons freezing veins vulcan would erichthonius years renew her future race the care of venus drew she would anchises blooming age restore a different care employed each heavenly power thus various interests did their jars increase till jove arose he spoke their tumults cease is any reverence to our presence given then why this discord among the powers of heaven who can the settled will of fate subdue twas by the fates that iolaus knew a second youth the fates determined doom shall give callirhoes race a youthful bloom arms nor ambition can this power obtain quell your desires even me the fates restrain could i their will control no rolling years had aeacus bent down with silver hairs then rhadamanthus still had youth possessed and minos with eternal bloom been blessed joves words the synod moved the powers give over and urge in vain unjust complaint no more since rhadamanthus veins now slowly flowed and aeacus and minos bore the load minos who in the flower of youth and fame made mighty nations tremble at his name infirm with age the proud miletus fears vain of his birth and in the strength of years and now regarding all his realms as lost he durst not force him from his native coast but you by choice miletus fled his reign and thy swift vessel plowed the aegean main on asiatick shores a town you frame which still is honored with the founders name here you cyanee knew the beauteous maid as on her maeander fathers winding banks she strayed caunus and byblis hence their lineage trace the double offspring of your warm embrace the passion of byblis by stephen harvey esquire let the sad fate of wretched byblis prove a dismal warning to unlawful love one birth gave being to the hapless pair but more was caunus than a sisters care unknown she loved for yet the gentle fire rose not in flames nor kindled to desire twas thought no sin to wonder at his charms hang on his neck and languish in his arms thus winged with joy fled the soft hours away and all the fatal guilt on harmless nature lay but love too soon from piety declined insensibly depraved her yielding mind dressed she appears with nicest art adorned and every youth but her loved brother scorned for him alone she labored to be fair and cursed all charms that might with hers compare twas she and only she must caunus please sick at her heart yet knew not her disease she called him lord for brother was a name too cold and dull for her aspiring flame and when he spoke if sister he replied for byblis change that frozen word she cried yet waking still she watched her struggling breast and loves approaches were in vain addressed till gentle sleep an easy conquest made and in her soft embrace the conqueror was laid but oh too soon the pleasing vision fled and left her blushing on the conscious bed ah me she cried how monstrous do i seem why these wild thoughts and this incestuous dream envy herself it is true must own his charms but what is beauty in a sisters arms oh were i not that despicable she how blessed how pleased how happy should i be but unregarded now must bear my pain and but in dreams my wishes can obtain o seaborn goddess with thy wanton boy was ever such a charming scene of joy such perfect bliss such ravishing delight never hid before in the kind shades of night how pleased my heart in what sweet raptures tossed even life itself in the soft combat lost while breathless he on my heaved bosom lay and snatched the treasures of my soul away if the bare fancy so affects my mind how should i rave if to the substance joined oh gentle caunus quit thy hated line or let thy parents be no longer mine oh that in common all things were enjoyed but those alone who have our hopes destroyed were i a princess thou an humble swain the proudest kings should rival thee in vain it cannot be alas the dreadful ill is fixed by fate and he is my brother still hear me ye gods i must have friends in heaven for jove himself was to a sister given but what are their prerogatives above to the short liberties of humane love fantastic thoughts down down forbidden fires or instant death extinguish my desires strict virtue then with thy malicious leave without a crime i may a kiss receive but say should i in spite of laws comply yet cruel caunus might himself deny no pity take of an afflicted maid for loves sweet game must be by couples played yet why should youth and charms like mine despair such fears never startled the aeolian pair no ties of blood could their full hopes destroy they broke through all for the prevailing joy and who can tell but caunus too may be racked and tormented in his breast for me like me to the extremest anguish drove like me just waking from a dream of love but stay oh whither would my fury run what arguments i urge to be undone away fond byblis quench these guilty flames caunus thy love but as a brother claims yet had he first been touched with love of me the charming youth could i despairing see oppressed with grief and dying by disdain ah no too sure i should have eased his pain since then if caunus asked me it were done asking my self what dangers can i run but can thou ask and see that right betrayed from pyrrha down to thy whole sex conveyed that selfdenying gift we all enjoy of wishing to be won yet seeming to be coy well then for once let a fond mistress woe the force of love no custom can subdue this frantic passion he by words shall know soft as the melting heart from whence they flow the pencil then in her fair hand she held by fear discouraged but by love compelled she writes then blots writes on and blots again likes it as fit then razes it as vain shame and assurance in her face appear and a faint hope just yielding to despair sister was wrote and blotted as a word which she and caunus too she hoped abhorred but now resolved to be no more controlled by scruplous virtue thus her grief she told thy lover gentle caunus wishes thee that health which thou alone can give to me o charming youth the gift i ask bestow ere thou the name of the fond writer know to thee without a name i would be known since knowing that my frailty i must own yet why should i my wretched name conceal when thousand instances my flames reveal wan looks and weeping eyes have spoke my pain and sighs discharged from my heaved heart in vain had i not wished my passion might be seen what could such fondness and embraces mean such kisses too oh heedless lovely boy without a crime no sister could enjoy yet though extremest rage has racked my soul and raging fires in my parched bosom roll be witness gods how piously i strove to rid my thoughts of this enchanting love but who could escape so fierce and sure a dart aimed at a tender and defenseless heart alas what maid could suffer i have born ere the dire secret from my breast was torn to thee a helpless vanquished wretch i come it is you alone can save or give my doom my life or death this moment you may choose yet think oh think no hated stranger sues no foe but one alas too near allied and wishing still much nearer to be tied the forms of decency let age debate and virtues rules by their cold morals state their ebbing joys give leisure to enquire and blame those noble flights our youth inspire where nature kindly summons let us go our sprightly years no bounds in love should know should feel no check of guilt and fear no ill lovers and gods act all things at their will we gain one blessing from our hated kin since our paternal freedom hides the sin uncensurd in each others arms we lie think then how easy to complete our joy oh pardon and oblige a blushing maid whose rage the pride of her vain sex betrayed nor let my tomb thus mournfully complain here byblis lies by her loved caunus slain forced here to end she with a falling tear tempered the pliant wax which did the signet bear the curious cipher was impressed by art but love had stamped one deeper in her heart her page a youth of confidence and skill secret as night stood waiting on her will sighing she cried bear this thou faithful boy to my sweet partner in eternal joy here a long pause her secret guilt confessed and when at length she would have spoke the rest half the dear name lay buried in her breast thus as he listened to her vain command down fell the letter from her trembling hand the omen shocked her soul yet go she cried can a request from byblis be denied to the maeandrian youths this message born the halfread lines by his fierce rage were torn hence hence he cried thou pandar to her lust bear hence the triumph of thy impious trust thy instant death will but divulge her shame or thy lifes blood should quench the guilty flame frighted from threatening caunus he withdrew and with the dreadful news to his lost mistress flew the sad repulse so struck the wounded fair her sense was buried in her wild despair pale was her visage as the ghastly dead and her scared soul from the sweet mansion fled yet with her life renewed her love returns and faintly thus her cruel fate she mourns it is just ye gods was my false reason blind to write a secret of this tender kind with female craft i should at first have strove by dubious hints to sound his distant love and tried those useful though dissembled arts which women practice on disdainful hearts i should have watched whence the black storm might rise ere i had trusted the unfaithful skies now on the rouling billows i am tossed and with extended sails on the blind shelves am lost did not indulgent heaven my doom foretell when from my hand the fatal letter fell what madness seized my soul and urged me on to take the only course to be undone i could my self have told the moving tale with such alluring grace as must prevail then had his eyes beheld my blushing fears my rising sighs and my descending tears round his dear neck these arms i then had spread and if rejected at his feet been dead if singly these had not his thoughts inclined yet all united would have shocked his mind perhaps my careless page might be in fault and in a luckless hour the fatal message brought business and worldly thoughts might fill his breast sometimes even love itself may be an irksome guest he could not else have treated me with scorn for caunus was not of a tygress born nor steel nor adamant has fenced his heart like mine it is naked to the burning dart away false fears he must he shall be mine in death alone i will my claim resign it is vain to wish my written crime unknown and for my guilt much vainer to atone repulsed and baffled fiercer still she burns and caunus with disdain her impious love returns he saw no end of her injurious flame and fled his country to avoid the shame forsaken byblis who had hopes no more burst out in rage and her loose robes she tore with her fair hands she smote her tender breast and to the wondering world her love confessed over hills and dales over rocks and streams she flew but still in vain did her wild lust pursue wearied at length on the cold earth she fell and now in tears alone could her sad story tell relenting gods in pity fixed her there and to a fountain turned the weeping fair the fable of iphis and ianthe by mr dryden the fame of this perhaps through crete had flown but crete had newer wonders of her own in iphis changed for near the gnossian bounds as loud report the miracle resounds at phoestus dwelt a man of honest blood but meanly born and not so rich as good esteemed and loved by all the neighborhood who to his wife before the time assigned for childbirth came thus bluntly spoke his mind if heaven said lygdus will vouchsafe to hear i have but two petitions to prefer short pains for thee for me a son and heir girls cost as many throws in bringing forth besides when born the titts are little worth weak puling things unable to sustain their share of labor and their bread to gain if therefore thou a creature shall produce of so great charges and so little use bear witness heaven with what reluctance her hapless innocence i doom to dye he said and tears the common grief display of him who bad and her who must obey yet telethusa still persists to find fit arguments to move a fathers mind to extend his wishes to a larger scope and in one vessel not confine his hope lygdus continues hard her time drew near and she her heavy load could scarcely bear when slumbering in the latter shades of night before the approaches of returning light she saw or thought she saw before her bed a glorious train and isis at their head her moony horns were on her forehead placed and yellow sheaves her shining temples graced a mitre for a crown she wore on high the dog and dappld bull were waiting by osyris sought along the banks of nile the silent god the sacred crocodile and last a long procession moving on with timbrels that assist the laboring moon her slumbers seemed dispelled and broad awake she heard a voice that thus distinctly spoke my votary thy babe from death defend nor fear to save whatever the gods will send delude with art thy husbands dire decree when danger calls repose thy trust on me and know thou have not served a thankless deity this promise made with night the goddess fled with joy the woman wakes and leaves her bed devoutly lifts her spotless hands on high and prays the powers their gift to ratify now grinding pains proceed to bearing throws till its own weight the burden did disclose twas of the beauteous kind and brought to light with secrecy to shun the fathers sight the indulgent mother did her care employ and passed it on her husband for a boy the nurse was conscious of the fact alone the father paid his vows as for a son and called him iphis by a common name which either sex with equal right may claim iphis his grandsire was the wife was pleased of half the fraud by fortunes favor eased the doubtful name was used without deceit and truth was covered with a pious cheat the habit showed a boy the beauteous face with manly fierceness mingled female grace now thirteen years of age were swiftly run when the fond father thought the time drew on of settling in the world his only son ianthe was his choice so wondrous fair her form alone with iphis could compare a neighbors daughter of his own degree and not more blessed with fortunes goods than he they soon espoused for they with ease were joined who were before contracted in the mind their age the same their inclinations too and bred together in one school they grew thus fatally disposed to mutual fires they felt before they knew the same desires equal their flame unequal was their care one loved with hope one languishd in despair the maid accused the lingering days alone for whom she thought a man she thought her own but iphis bends beneath a greater grief as fiercely burns but hopes for no relief even her despair adds fuel to her fire a maid with madness does a maid desire and scarce refraining tears alas said she what issue of my love remains for me how wild a passion works within my breast with what prodigious flames am i possessed could i the care of providence deserve heaven must destroy me if it would preserve and that is my fate or sure it would have sent some usual evil for my punishment not this unkindly curse to rage and burn where nature shows no prospect of return nor cows for cows consume with fruitless fire nor mares when hot their fellowmares desire the father of the fold supplies his ewes the stag through secret woods his hind pursues and birds for mates the males of their own species choose her females nature guards from female flame and joins two sexes to preserve the game would i were nothing or not what i am crete famed for monsters wanted of her store till my new love produced one monster more the daughter of the sun a bull desired and yet even then a male a female fired her passion was extravagantly new but mine is much the madder of the two to things impossible she was not bent but found the means to compass her intent to cheat his eyes she took a different shape yet still she gained a lover and a leap should all the wit of all the world conspire should daedalus assist my wild desire what art can make me able to enjoy or what can change ianthe to a boy extinguish then thy passion hopeless maid and recollect thy reason for thy aid know what thou art and love as maidens ought and drive these golden wishes from thy thought thou can not hope thy fond desires to gain where hope is wanting wishes are in vain and yet no guards against our joys conspire no jealous husband hinders our desire my parents are propitious to my wish and she herself consenting to the bliss all things concur to prosper our design all things to prosper any love but mine and yet i never can enjoy the fair it is past the power of heaven to grant my prayer heaven has been kind as far as heaven can be our parents with our own desires agree but nature stronger than the gods above refuses her assistance to my love she sets the bar that causes all my pain one gift refused makes all their bounty vain and now the happy day is just at hand to bind our hearts in hymens holy band our hearts but not our bodies thus accursed in midst of water i complain of thirst why come thou juno to these barren rites to bless a bed defrauded of delights but why should hymen lift his torch on high to see two brides in cold embraces lie thus lovesick iphis her vain passion mourns with equal ardour fair ianthe burns invoking hymens name and junos power to speed the work and haste the happy hour she hopes while telethusa fears the day and strives to interpose some new delay now feigns a sickness now is in a fright for this bad omen or that boding sight but having done whatever she could devise and emptied all her magazine of lies the time approached the next ensuing day the fatal secret must to light betray then telethusa had recourse to prayer she and her daughter with dishevelled hair trembling with fear great isis they adored embraced her altar and her aid implored fair queen who do on fruitful egypt smile who swayst the scepter of the pharian isle and sevnfold falls of disemboguing nile relieve in this our last distress she said a suppliant mother and a mournful maid thou goddess thou were present to my sight revealed i saw thee by thy own fair light i saw thee in my dream as now i see with all thy marks of awful majesty the glorious train that compassed thee around and heard the hollow timbrels holy sound thy words i noted which i still retain let not thy sacred oracles be vain that iphis lives that i my self am free from shame and punishment i owe to thee on thy protection all our hopes depend thy counsel saved us let thy power defend her tears pursued her words and while she spoke the goddess nodded and her altar shook the temple doors as with a blast of wind were heard to clap the lunar horns that bind the brows of isis cast a blaze around the trembling timbrel made a murmuring sound some hopes these happy omens did impart forth went the mother with a beating heart not much in fear nor fully satisfied but iphis followed with a larger stride the whiteness of her skin forsook her face her looks emboldened with an awful grace her features and her strength together grew and her long hair to curling locks withdrew her sparkling eyes with manly vigor shone big was her voice audacious was her tone the latent parts at length revealed began to shoot and spread and burnish into man the maid becomes a youth no more delay your vows but look and confidently pay their gifts the parents to the temple bear the votive tables this inscription wear iphis the man has to the goddess paid the vows that iphis offered when a maid now when the star of day had shown his face venus and juno with their presence grace the nuptial rites and hymen from above descending to complete their happy love the gods of marriage lend their mutual aid and the warm youth enjoys the lovely maid the end of the ninth book to the rt honble ye lady viscountess scudamo  ovids metamorphoses book x translated by mr dryden mr congreve and others the story of orpheus and eurydice by mr congreve thence in his saffron robe for distant thrace hymen departs through airs unmeasured space by orpheus called the nuptial power attends but with illomend augury descends nor cheerful looked the god nor prosperous spoke nor blazed his torch but wept in hissing smoke in vain they whirl it round in vain they shake no rapid motion can its flames awake with dread these inauspicious signs were viewed and soon a more disastrous end ensued for as the bride amid the naiad train ran joyful sporting over the flowery plain a venomed viper bit her as she passed instant she fell and sudden breathed her last when long his loss the thracian had deplored not by superior powers to be restored inflamed by love and urged by deep despair he leaves the realms of light and upper air daring to tread the dark tenarian road and tempt the shades in their obscure abode through gliding specter of thinterrd to go and phantom people of the world below persephone he seeks and him who reigns over ghosts and hells uncomfortable plains arrived he tuning to his voice his strings thus to the king and queen of shadows sings ye powers who under earth your realms extend to whom all mortals must one day descend if here it is granted sacred truth to tell i come not curious to explore your hell nor come to boast by vain ambition fired how cerberus at my approach retired my wife alone i seek for her loved sake these terrors i support this journey take she luckless wandering or by fate misled chanced on a lurking vipers crest to tread the vengeful beast enflamed with fury starts and through her heel his deathful venom darts thus was she snatched untimely to her tomb her growing years cut short and springing bloom long i my loss endeavored to sustain and strongly strove but strove alas in vain at length i yielded won by mighty love well known is that omnipotence above but here i doubt his unfelt influence fails and yet a hope within my heart prevails that here even here he has been known of old at least if truth be by tradition told if fame of former rapes belief may find you both by love and love alone were joined now by the horrors which these realms surround by the vast chaos of these depths profound by the sad silence which eternal reigns over all the waste of these widestretching plains let me again eurydice receive let fate her quickspun thread of life reweave all our possessions are but loans from you and soon or late you must be paid your due hither we haste to humankinds last seat your endless empire and our sure retreat she too when ripened years she shall attain must of avoidless right be yours again i but the transient use of that require which soon too soon i must resign entire but if the destinies refuse my vow and no remission of her doom allow know i am determined to return no more so both retain or both to life restore thus while the bard melodiously complains and to his lyre accords his vocal strains the very bloodless shades attention keep and silent seem compassionate to weep even tantalus his flood unthirsty views nor flies the stream nor he the stream pursues ixions wondering wheel its whirl suspends and the voracious vultur charmed attends no mroe the belides their toil bemoan and sisiphus reclined sits listening on his stone then first it is said by sacred verse subdued the furies felt their cheeks with tears bedewed nor could the rigid king or queen of hell the impulse of pity in their hearts repel now from a troop of shades that last arrived eurydice was called and stood revived slow she advanced and halting seemed to feel the fatal wound yet painful in her heel thus he obtains the suit so much desired on strict observance of the terms required for if before he reach the realms of air he backward cast his eyes to view the fair the forfeit grant that instant void is made and she for ever left a lifeless shade now through the noiseless throng their way they bend and both with pain the rugged road ascend dark was the path and difficult and steep and thick with vapors from the smoaky deep they wellnigh now had passed the bounds of night and just approached the margin of the light when he mistrusting lest her steps might stray and gladsom of the glimpse of dawning day his longing eyes impatient backward cast to catch a lovers look but looked his last for instant dying she again descends while he to empty air his arms extends again she died nor yet her lord reproved what could she say but that too well he loved one last farewell she spoke which scarce he heard so soon she dropped so sudden disappeared all stunned he stood when thus his wife he viewed by second fate and double death subdued not more amazement by that wretch was shown whom cerberus beholding turned to stone nor ollenus could more astonished look when on himself lethaeas fault he took his beauteous wife who too secure had dared her face to vye with goddesses compared once joined by love they stand united still turned to contiguous rocks on idas hill now to repass the styx in vain he tries charon averse his pressing suit denies seven days entire along the infernal shores disconsolate the bard eurydice deplores defiled with filth his robe with tears his cheeks no sustenance but grief and cares he seeks of rigid fate incessant he complains and hells inexorable gods arraigns this ended to high rhodope he hastes and haemus mountain bleek with northern blasts and now his yearly race the circling sun had thrice complete through watery pisces run since orpheus fled the face of womankind and all soft union with the sex declined whether his ill success this change had bred or binding vows made to his former bed whatever the cause in vain the nymphs contest with rival eyes to warm his frozen breast for every nymph with love his lays inspired but every nymph repulsed with grief retired a hill there was and on that hill a mead with verdure thick but destitute of shade where now the muses son no sooner sings no sooner strikes his sweet resounding strings but distant groves the flying sounds receive and listening trees their roots stations leave themselves transplanting all around they grow and various shades their various kinds bestow here tall chaonian oaks their branches spread while weeping poplars there erect their head the foodful esculus here shoots his leaves that turf soft limetree this fat beach receives here brittle hazels laurels here advance and there tough ash to form the heros lance here silver firs with knotless trunks ascend there scarlet oaks beneath their acorns bend that spot admits the hospitable plane on this the maple grows with clouded grain here watery willows are with lotus seen there tamarisk and box for ever green with double hue here mirtles grace the ground and laurestines with purple berries crowned with pliant feet now ivies this way wind vines yonder rise and elms with vines entwined wild ornus now the pitchtree next takes root and arbutus adorned with blushing fruit then easybending palms the victors prize and pines erect with bristly tops arise to rhea grateful still the pine remains for atys still some favor she retains he once in human shape her breast had warmed and now is cherished to a tree transformed the fable of cyparissus amid the throng of this promiscuous wood with pointed top the taper cypress stood a tree which once a youth and heavenly fair was of that deity the darling care whose hand adapts with equal skill the strings to bows with which he kills and harps to which he sings for heretofore a mighty stag was bred which on the fertile fields of caea fed in shape and size he all his kind excelled and to carthaean nymphs was sacred held his beamy head with branches high displayed afforded to itself an ample shade his horns were gilt and his smooth neck was graced with silver collars thick with gems enchasd a silver boss upon his forehead hung and brazen pendants in his earrings rung frequenting houses he familiar grew and learnt by custom nature to subdue till by degrees of fear and wildness broke even stranger hands his proffered neck might stroke much was the beast by caeas youth caressed but thou sweet cyparissus lovdst him best by thee to pastures fresh he often was led by thee often watered at the fountains head his horns with garlands now by thee were tied and now thou on his back would wanton ride now here now there would bound along the plains ruling his tender mouth with purple reins twas when the summer sun at noon of day through glowing cancer shot his burning ray twas then the favorite stag in cool retreat had sought a shelter from the scorching heat along the grass his weary limbs he laid inhaling freshness from the breezy shade when cyparissus with his pointed dart unknowing pierced him to the panting heart but when the youth surpised his error found and saw him dying of the cruel wound himself he would have slain through desperate grief what said not phoebus that might yield relief to cease his mourning he the boy desired or mourn no more than such a loss required but he incessant grieved at length addressed to the superior powers a last request praying in expiation of his crime thenceforth to mourn to all succeeding time and now of blood exhausted he appears drained by a torrent of continual tears the fleshy color in his body fades and a green tincture all his limbs invades from his fair head where curling locks late hung a horrid bush with bristled branches sprung which stiffning by degrees its stem extends till to the starry skies the spire ascends apollo sad looked on and sighing cried then be for ever what thy prayer implied bemoaned by me in others grief excite and still preside at every funeral rite continued by mr croxall thus the sweet artist in a wondrous shade of verdant trees which harmony had made encircled sat with his own triumphs crowned of listening birds and savages around again the trembling strings he dextrous tries again from discord makes soft music rise then tunes his voice o muse from whom i sprung jove be my theme and thou inspire my song to jove my greteful voice i often have raised often his almighty power with pleasure praised i sung the giants in a solemn strain blasted and thunderstruck on phlegras plain now be my lire in softer accents moved to sing of blooming boys by gods beloved and to relate what virgins void of shame have suffered vengeance for a lawless flame the king of gods once felt the burning joy and sighed for lovely ganimede of troy long was he puzzled to assume a shape most fit and expeditious for the rape a birds was proper yet he scorns to wear any but that which might his thunder bear down with his masquerading wings he flies and bears the little trojan to the skies where now in robes of heavenly purple dressed he serves the nectar at the almightys feast to slighted juno an unwelcome guest hyacinthus transformed into a flower by mr ozell phoebus for thee too hyacinth designed a place among the gods had fate been kind yet this he gave as often as wintry rains are past and vernal breezes sooth the plains from the green turf a purple flower you rise and with your fragrant breath perfume the skies you when alive were phoebus darling boy in you he placed his heaven and fixed his joy their god the delphic priests consult in vain eurotas now he loves and spartas plain his hands the use of bow and harp forget and hold the dogs or bear the corded net over hanging cliffs swift he pursues the game each hour his pleasure each augments his flame the midday sun now shone with equal light between the past and the succeeding night they strip then smoothed with suppling oil essay to pitch the rounded quoit their wonted play a wellpoisd disk first hasty phoebus threw it cleft the air and whistled as it flew it reached the mark a most surprising length which spoke an equal share of art and strength scarce was it fallen when with too eager hand young hyacinth ran to snatch it from the sand but the cursed orb which met a stony soil flew in his face with violent recoil both faint both pale and breathless now appear the boy with pain the amorous god with fear he ran and raised him bleeding from the ground chafes his cold limbs and wipes the fatal wound then herbs of noblest juice in vain applies the wound is mortal and his skill defies as in a watered gardens blooming walk when some rude hand has bruised its tender stalk a fading lilly droops its languid head and bends to earth its life and beauty fled so hyacinth with head reclined decays and sickening now no more his charms displays o thou art gone my boy apollo cried defrauded of thy youth in all its pride thou once my joy art all my sorrow now and to my guilty hand my grief i owe yet from my self i might the fault remove unless to sport and play a fault should prove unless it too were called a fault to love oh could i for thee or but with thee dye but cruel fates to me that power deny yet on my tongue thou shall for ever dwell thy name my lyre shall sound my verse shall tell and to a flower transformed unheard of yet stamped on thy leaves my cries thou shall repeat the time shall come prophetic i foreknow when joined to thee a mighty ajax chief shall grow and with my plaints his name thy leaf shall show while phoebus thus the laws of fate revealed behold the blood which stained the verdant field is blood no longer but a flower full blown far brighter than the tyrian scarlet shone a lillys form it took its purple hue was all that made a difference to the view nor stopped he here the god upon its leaves the sad expression of his sorrow weaves and to this hour the mournful purple wears ai ai inscribed in funeral characters nor are the spartans who so much are famed for virtue of their hyacinth ashamed but still with pompous woe and solemn state the hyacinthian feasts they yearly celebrate the transformations of the cerastae and propaetides enquire of amathus whose wealthy ground with veins of every metal does abound if she to her propaetides would show the honor sparta does to him allow no more she would say such wretches would we grace than those whose crooked horns deformed their face from thence cerastae called an impious race before whose gates a reverend altar stood to jove inscribed the hospitable god this had some stranger seen with gore besmeared the blood of lambs and bulls it had appeared their slaughtered guests it was not flock nor herd venus these barbarous sacrifices viewed with just abhorrence and with wrath pursued at first to punish such nefarious crimes their towns she meant to leave her oncelovd climes but why said she for their offense should i my dear delightful plains and cities fly no let the impious people who have sinned a punishment in death or exile find if death or exile too severe be thought let them in some vile shape bemoan their fault while next her mind a proper form employs admonished by their horns she fixed her choice their former crest remains upon their heads and their strong limbs an oxs shape invades the blasphemous propaetides denied worship of venus and her power defied but soon that power they felt the first that sold their lewd embraces to the world for gold unknowing how to blush and shameless grown a small transition changes em to stone the story of pygmalion and the statue by mr dryden pygmalion loathing their lascivious life abhorred all womankind but most a wife so single chose to live and shunned to wed well pleased to want a consort of his bed yet fearing idleness the nurse of ill in sculpture exercised his happy skill and carved in ivory such a maid so fair as nature could not with his art compare were she to work but in her own defense must take her pattern here and copy hence pleased with his idol he commends admires adores and last the thing adored desires a very virgin in her face was seen and had she moved a living maid had been one would have thought she could have stirred but strove with modesty and was ashamed to move art hid with art so well performed the cheat it caught the carver with his own deceit he knows it is madness yet he must adore and still the more he knows it loves the more the flesh or what so seems he touches often which feels so smooth that he believes it soft fired with this thought at once he strained the breast and on the lips a burning kiss impressed it is true the hardened breast resists the gripe and the cold lips return a kiss unripe but when retiring back he looked again to think it ivory was a thought too mean so would believe she kissed and courting more again embraced her naked body over and straining hard the statue was afraid his hands had made a dint and hurt his maid explored her limb by limb and feared to find so rude a gripe had left a livid mark behind with flattery now he seeks her mind to move and now with gifts the powerful bribes of love he furnishes her closet first and fills the crowded shelves with rarities of shells adds orient pearls which from the conchs he drew and all the sparkling stones of various hue and parrots imitating human tongue and singingbirds in silver cages hung and every fragrant flower and odorous green were sorted well with lumps of amber laid between rich fashionable robes her person deck pendants her ears and pearls adorn her neck her taperd fingers too with rings are graced and an embroidered zone surrounds her slender waste thus like a queen arrayed so richly dressed beauteous she showed but naked showed the best then from the floor he raised a royal bed with covrings of sydonian purple spread the solemn rites performed he calls her bride with blandishments invites her to his side and as she were with vital sense possessed her head did on a plumy pillow rest the feast of venus came a solemn day to which the cypriots due devotion pay with gilded horns the milkwhite heifers led slaughtered before the sacred altars bled pygmalion offering first approached the shrine and then with prayers implored the powers divine almighty gods if all we mortals want if all we can require be yours to grant make this fair statue mine he would have said but changed his words for shame and only prayed give me the likeness of my ivory maid the golden goddess present at the prayer well knew he meant the inanimated fair and gave the sign of granting his desire for thrice in cheerful flames ascends the fire the youth returning to his mistress hies and impudent in hope with ardent eyes and beating breast by the dear statue lies he kisses her white lips renews the bliss and looks and thinks they redden at the kiss he thought them warm before nor longer stays but next his hand on her hard bosom lays hard as it was beginning to relent it seemed the breast beneath his fingers bent he felt again his fingers made a print twas flesh but flesh so firm it rose against the dint the pleasing task he fails not to renew soft and more soft at every touch it grew like pliant wax when chafing hands reduce the former mass to form and frame for use he would believe but yet is still in pain and tries his argument of sense again presses the pulse and feels the leaping vein convinced oerjoyd his studied thanks and praise to her who made the miracle he pays then lips to lips he joined now freed from fear he found the savor of the kiss sincere at this the wakened image opened her eyes and viewed at once the light and lover with surprise the goddess present at the match she made so blessed the bed such fruitfulness conveyed that ere ten months had sharpened either horn to crown their bliss a lovely boy was born paphos his name who grown to manhood walled the city paphos from the founder called the story of cinyras and myrrha nor him alone produced the fruitful queen but cinyras who like his sire had been a happy prince had he not been a sire daughters and fathers from my song retire i sing of horror and could i prevail you should not hear or not believe my tale yet if the pleasure of my song be such that you will hear and credit me too much attentive listen to the last event and with the sin believe the punishment since nature could behold so dire a crime i gratulate at least my native clime that such a land which such a monster bore so far is distant from our thracian shore let araby extol her happy coast her cinnamon and sweet amomum boast her fragrant flowers her trees with precious tears her second harvests and her double years how can the land be called so blessed that myrrha bears nor all her odorous tears can cleanse her crime her plant alone deforms the happy clime cupid denies to have inflamed thy heart disowns thy love and vindicates his dart some fury gave thee those infernal pains and shot her venomed vipers in thy veins to hate thy sire had merited a curse but such an impious love deserved a worse the neighboring monarchs by thy beauty led contend in crowds ambitious of thy bed the world is at thy choice except but one except but him thou can not choose alone she knew it too the miserable maid ere impious love her better thoughts betrayed and thus within her secret soul she said ah myrrha whither would thy wishes tend ye gods ye sacred laws my soul defend from such a crime as all mankind detest and never lodged before in human breast but is it sin or makes my mind alone the imagined sin for nature makes it none what tyrant then these envious laws began made not for any other beast but man the fatherbull his daughter may bestride the horse may make his mothermare a bride what piety forbids the lusty ram or more salacious goat to rut their dam the hen is free to wed the chick she bore and make a husband whom she hatched before all creatures else are of a happier kind whom nor illnatured laws from pleasure bind nor thoughts of sin disturb their peace of mind but man a slave of his own making lives the fool denies himself what nature gives too busy senates with an overcare to make us better than our kind can bear have dashed a spice of envy in the laws and straining up too high have spoiled the cause yet some wise nations break their cruel chains and own no laws but those which love ordains where happy daughters with their sires are joined and piety is doubly paid in kind o that i had been born in such a clime not here where it is the country makes the crime but whither would my impious fancy stray hence hopes and ye forbidden thoughts away his worth deserves to kindle my desires but with the love that daughters bear to sires then had not cinyras my father been what hindered myrrhas hopes to be his queen but the perverseness of my fate is such that he is not mine because he is mine too much our kindredblood debars a better tie he might be nearer were he not so nigh eyes and their objects never must unite some distance is required to help the sight fain would i travel to some foreign shore never to see my native country more so might i to my self my self restore so might my mind these impious thoughts remove and ceasing to behold might cease to love but stay i must to feed my famished sight to talk to kiss and more if more i might more impious maid what more can thou design to make a monstrous mixture in thy line and break all statutes human and divine can thou be called to save thy wretched life thy mothers rival and thy fathers wife confound so many sacred names in one thy brothers mother sister to thy son and fear thou not to see the infernal bands their heads with snakes with torches armed their hands full at thy face the avenging brands to bear and shake the serpents from their hissing hair but thou in time thincreasing ill control nor first debauch the body by the soul secure the sacred quiet of thy mind and keep the sanctions nature has designed suppose i should attempt the attempt were vain no thoughts like mine his sinless soul profane observant of the right and o that he could cure my madness or be mad like me thus she but cinyras who daily sees a crowd of noble suitors at his knees among so many knew not whom to choose irresolute to grant or to refuse but having told their names inquired of her who pleased her best and whom she would prefer the blushing maid stood silent with surprise and on her father fixed her ardent eyes and looking sighed and as she sighed began round tears to shed that scalded as they ran the tender sire who saw her blush and cry ascribed it all to maiden modesty and dried the falling drops and yet more kind he stroakd her cheeks and holy kisses joined she felt a secret venom fire her blood and found more pleasure than a daughter should and asked again what lover of the crew she liked the best she answered one like you mistaking what she meant her pious will he praised and bad her so continue still the word of pious heard she blushed with shame of secret guilt and could not bear the name twas now the mid of night when slumbers close our eyes and sooth our cares with soft repose but no repose could wretched myrrha find her body rouling as she rould her mind mad with desire she ruminates her sin and wishes all her wishes over again now she despairs and now resolves to try would not and would again she knows not why stops and returns makes and retracts the vow fain would begin but understands not how as when a pine is hewed upon the plains and the last mortal stroke alone remains laboring in pangs of death and threatening all this way and that she nods considring where to fall so myrrhas mind impelled on either side takes every bent but cannot long abide irresolute on which she should rely at last unfixd in all is only fixed to die on that sad thought she rests resolved on death she rises and prepares to choke her breath then while about the beam her zone she ties dear cinyras farewell she softly cries for thee i die and only wish to be not hated when thou know i die for thee pardon the crime in pity to the cause this said about her neck the noose she draws the nurse who lay without her faithful guard though not the words the murmurs overheard and sighs and hollow sounds surpised with fright she starts and leaves her bed and springs a light unlocks the door and entering out of breath the dying saw and instruments of death she shrieks she cuts the zone with trembling haste and in her arms her fainting charge embraced next for she now had leisure for her tears she weeping asked in these her blooming years what unforeseen misfortune caused her care to loath her life and languish in despair the maid with downcast eyes and mute with grief for death unfinished and illtimed relief stood sullen to her suit the beldame pressed the more to know and barred her withered breast adjurd her by the kindly food she drew from those dry founts her secret ill to show sad myrrha sighed and turned her eyes aside the nurse still urged and would not be denied nor only promised secrecy but prayed she might have leave to give her offered aid good will she said my want of strength supplies and diligence shall give what age denies if strong desires thy mind to fury move with charms and medicines i can cure thy love if envious eyes their hurtful rays have cast more powerful verse shall free thee from the blast if heaven offended sends thee this disease offended heaven with prayers we can appease what then remains that can these cares procure thy house is flourishing thy fortune sure thy careful mother yet in health survives and to thy comfort thy kind father lives the virgin started at her fathers name and sighed profoundly conscious of the shame nor yet the nurse her impious love divined but yet surmisd that love disturbed her mind thus thinking she pursued her point and laid and lulled within her lap the mourning maid then softly soothed her thus i guess your grief you love my child your love shall find relief my longexperiencd age shall be your guide rely on that and lay distrust aside no breath of air shall on the secret blow nor shall what most you fear your father know struck once again as with a thunderclap the guilty virgin bounded from her lap and threw her body prostrate on the bed and to conceal her blushes hid her head there silent lay and warned her with her hand to go but she received not the command remaining still importunate to know then myrrha thus or ask no more or go i prithee go or staying spare my shame what thou would hear is impious even to name at this on high the beldame holds her hands and trembling both with age and terror stands adjures and falling at her feet entreats sooths her with blandishments and frights with threats to tell the crime intended or disclose what part of it she knew if she no farther knows and last if conscious to her counsel made confirms anew the promise of her aid now myrrha raised her head but soon oppressed with shame reclined it on her nurses breast bathed it with tears and strove to have confessed twice she began and stopped again she tried the faltring tongue its office still denied at last her veil before her face she spread and drew a long preluding sigh and said o happy mother in thy marriage bed then groaned and ceased the good old woman shook stiff were her eyes and ghastly was her look her hoary hair upright with horror stood made to her grief more knowing than she would much she reproached and many things she said to cure the madness of the unhappy maid in vain for myrrha stood convict of ill her reason vanquished but unchanged her will perverse of mind unable to reply she stood resolved or to possess or die at length the fondness of a nurse prevailed against her better sense and virtue failed enjoy my child since such is thy desire thy love she said she durst not say thy sire live though unhappy live on any terms then with a second oath her faith confirms the solemn feast of ceres now was near when long white linen stoles the matrons wear ranked in procession walk the pious train offering first fruits and spikes of yellow grain for nine long nights the nuptialbed they shun and sanctifying harvest lie alone mixed with the crowd the queen forsook her lord and ceres power with secret rites adored the royal couch now vacant for a time the crafty crone officious in her crime the first occasion took the king she found easy with wine and deep in pleasures drowned prepared for love the beldame blew the flame confessed the passion but concealed the name her form she praised the monarch asked her years and she replied the same thy myrrha bears wine and commended beauty fired his thought impatient he commands her to be brought pleased with her charge performed she hies her home and gratulates the nymph the task was overcome myrrha was joyd the welcome news to hear but clogged with guilt the joy was unsincere so various so discordant is the mind that in our will a different will we find ill she presaged and yet pursued her lust for guilty pleasures give a double gust twas depth of night arctophylax had driven his lazy wain half round the northern heaven when myrrha hastened to the crime desired the moon beheld her first and first retired the stars amazed ran backward from the sight and shrunk within their sockets lost their light icarius first withdraws his holy flame the virgin sign in heaven the second name slides down the belt and from her station flies and night with sable clouds involves the skies bold myrrha still pursues her black intent she stumbled thrice an omen of the event thrice shrieked the funeral owl yet on she went secure of shame because secure of sight even bashful sins are impudent by night linked hand in hand thaccomplice and the dame their way exploring to the chamber came the door was open they blindly grope their way where dark in bed thexpecting monarch lay thus far her courage held but here forsakes her faint knees knock at every step she makes the nearer to her crime the more within she feels remorse and horror of her sin repents too late her criminal desire and wishes that unknown she could retire her lingering thus the nurse who feared delay the fatal secret might at length betray pulled forward to complete the work begun and said to cinyras receive thy own thus saying she delivered kind to kind accursed and their devoted bodies joined the sire unknowing of the crime admits his bowels and profanes the hallowed sheets he found she trembled but believed she strove with maiden modesty against her love and sought with flattering words vain fancies to remove perhaps he said my daughter cease thy fears because the title suited with her years and father she might whisper him again that names might not be wanting to the sin full of her sire she left the incestuous bed and carried in her womb the crime she bred another and another night she came for frequent sin had left no sense of shame till cinyras desired to see her face whose body he had held in close embrace and brought a taper the revealer light exposed both crime and criminal to sight grief rage amazement could no speech afford but from the sheath he drew the avenging sword the guilty fled the benefit of night that favored first the sin secured the flight long wandering through the spacious fields she bent her voyage to the arabian continent then passed the region which panchaea joined and flying left the palmy plains behind nine times the moon had mewed her horns at length with travel weary unsupplyd with strength and with the burden of her womb oppressed sabaean fields afford her needful rest there loathing life and yet of death afraid in anguish of her spirit thus she prayed ye powers if any so propitious are taccept my penitence and hear my prayer your judgments i confess are justly sent great sins deserve as great a punishment yet since my life the living will profane and since my death the happy dead will stain a middle state your mercy may bestow betwixt the realms above and those below some other form to wretched myrrha give nor let her wholly die nor wholly live the prayers of penitents are never vain at least she did her last request obtain for while she spoke the ground began to rise and gathered round her feet her legs and thighs her toes in roots descend and spreading wide a firm foundation for the trunk provide her solid bones convert to solid wood to pith her marrow and to sap her blood her arms are boughs her fingers change their kind her tender skin is hardened into rind and now the rising tree her womb invests now shooting upwards still invades her breasts and shades the neck when weary with delay she sunk her head within and met it half the way and though with outward shape she lost her sense with bitter tears she wept her last offense and still she weeps nor sheds her tears in vain for still the precious drops her name retain mean time the misbegotten infant grows and ripe for birth distends with deadly throws the swelling rind with unavailing strife to leave the wooden womb and pushes into life the mothertree as if oppressed with pain writhes here and there to break the bark in vain and like a laboring woman would have prayed but wants a voice to call lucinas aid the bending bole sends out a hollow sound and trickling tears fall thicker on the ground the mild lucina came uncalled and stood beside the struggling boughs and heard the groaning wood then reached her midwifehand to speed the throws and spoke the powerful spells that babes to birth disclose the bark divides the living load to free and safe delivers the convulsive tree the ready nymphs receive the crying child and wash him in the tears the parentplant distilled they swathed him with their scarfs beneath him spread the ground with herbs with roses raised his head the lovely babe was born with every grace even envy must have praised so fair a face such was his form as painters when they show their utmost art on naked loves bestow and that their arms no difference might betray give him a bow or his from cupid take away time glides along with undiscovered haste the future but a length behind the past so swift are years the babe whom just before his grandsire got and whom his sister bore the drop the thing which late the tree enclosed and late the yawning bark to life exposed a babe a boy a beauteous youth appears and lovelier than himself at riper years now to the queen of love he gave desires and with her pains revenged his mothers fires the story of venus and adonis by mr eusden for cythereas lips while cupid pressed he with a heedless arrow razed her breast the goddess felt it and with fury stung the wanton mischief from her bosom flung yet thought at first the danger slight but found the dart too faithful and too deep the wound fired with a mortal beauty she disdains to haunt the idalian mount or phrygian plains she seeks not cnidos nor her paphian shrines nor amathus that teems with brazen mines even heaven it self with all its sweets unsought adonis far a sweeter heaven is thought on him she hangs and fonds with every art and never never knows from him to part she whose soft limbs had only been displayed on rosy beds beneath the myrtle shade whose pleasing care was to improve each grace and add more charms to an unrivaled face now buskined like the virgin huntress goes through woods and pathless wilds and mountainsnows with her own tuneful voice she joys to cheer the panting hounds that chase the flying deer she runs the labyrinths of fearful hares but fearless beasts and dangerous prey forbears hunts not the grinning wolf or foamy boar and trembles at the lions hungry roar thee too adonis with a lovers care she warns if warned thou would avoid the snare to furious animals advance not nigh fly those that follow follow those that fly it is chance alone must the survivers save whenever brave spirits will attempt the brave o lovely youth in harmless sports delight provoke not beasts which armed by nature fight for me if not thy self vouchsafe to fear let not thy thirst of glory cost me dear boars know not how to spare a blooming age no sparkling eyes can sooth the lions rage not all thy charms a savage breast can move which have so deeply touched the queen of love when bristled boars from beaten thickets spring in grinded tusks a thunderbolt they bring the daring hunters lions roused devour vast is their fury and as vast their power cursed be their tawny race if thou would hear what kindled thus my hate then lend an ear the wondrous tale i will to thee unfold how the fell monsters rose from crimes of old but by long toils i faint see widedisplayd a grateful poplar courts us with a shade the grassy turf beneath so verdant shows we may secure delightfully repose with her adonis here be venus blessed and swift at once the grass and him she pressed then sweetly smiling with a raptured mind on his loved bosom she her head reclined and thus began but mindful still of bliss sealed the soft accents with a softer kiss perhaps thou may have heard a virgins name who still in swiftness swiftest youths oercame wondrous that female weakness should outdo a manly strength the wonder yet is true twas doubtful if her triumphs in the field did to her forms triumphant glories yield whether her face could with more ease decoy a crowd of lovers or her feet destroy for once apollo she implored to show if courteous fates a consort would allow a consort brings thy ruin he replied oh learn to want the pleasures of a bride nor shall thou want them to thy wretched cost and atalanta living shall be lost with such a rueful fate the affrighted maid sought green recesses in the woodland glade not sighing suitors her resolves could move she bad them show their speed to show their love he only who could conquer in the race might hope the conquered virgin to embrace while he whose tardy feet had laggd behind was doomed the sad reward of death to find though great the prize yet rigid the decree but blind with beauty who can rigor see even on these laws the fair they rashly sought and danger in excess of love forgot there sat hippomenes prepared to blame in lovers such extravagance of flame and must he said the blessing of a wife be dearly purchased by a risk of life but when he saw the wonders of her face and her limbs naked springing to the race her limbs as exquisitely turned as mine or if a woman thou might vie with thine with lifted hands he cried forgive the tongue which durst ye youths your welltimd courage wrong i knew not that the nymph for whom you strove deserved thunbounded transports of your love he saw admired and thus her spotless frame he praised and praising kindled his own flame a rival now to all the youths who run envious he fears they should not be undone but why reflects he idly thus is shown the fate of others yet untried my own the coward must not on loves aid depend the god was ever to the bold a friend mean time the virgin flies or seems to fly swift as a scythian arrow cleaves the sky still more and more the youth her charms admires the race it self to exalt her charms conspires the golden pinions which her feet adorn in wanton fluttrings by the winds are born down from her head the long fair tresses flow and sport with lovely negligence below the waving ribbands which her buskins tie her snowy skin with waving purple die as crimson veils in palaces displayed to the white marble lend a blushing shade nor long he gazed yet while he gazed she gained the goal and the victorious wreath obtained the vanquished sigh and as the law decreed pay the dire forfeit and prepare to bleed then rose hippomenes not yet afraid and fixed his eyes full on the beauteous maid where is he cried the mighty conquest won to distance those who want the nerves to run here prove superior strength nor shall it be thy loss of glory if excelled by me high my descent near neptune i aspire for neptune was grandparent to my sire from that great god the fourth my self i trace nor sink my virtues yet beneath my race thou from hippomenes oercome may claim an envied triumph and a deathless fame while thus the youth the virgins power defies silent she views him still with softer eyes thoughts in her breast a doubtful strife begin if it is not happier now to lose than win what god a foe to beauty would destroy the promised ripeness of this blooming boy with his lifes danger does he seek my bed scarce am i half so greatly worth she said nor has his beauty moved my breast to love and yet i own such beauty well might move it is not his charms it is pity would engage my soul to spare the greeness of his age what that heroic courage fires his breast and shines through brave disdain of fate confessed what that his patronage by close degrees springs from the imperial ruler of the seas then add the love which bids him undertake the race and dare to perish for my sake of bloody nuptials heedless youth beware fly timely fly from a too barbarous fair at pleasure choose thy love will be repaid by a less foolish and more beauteous maid but why this tenderness before unknown why beats and pants my breast for him alone his eyes have seen his numerous rivals yield let him too share the rigor of the field since by their fates untaught his own he courts and thus with ruin insolently sports yet for what crime shall he his death receive is it a crime with me to wish to live shall his kind passion his destruction prove is this the fatal recompense of love so fair a youth destroyed would conquest shame and nymphs eternally detest my fame still why should nymphs my guiltless fame upbraid did i the fond adventurer persuade alas i wish thou would the course decline or that my swiftness was excelled by thine see what a virgins bloom adorns the boy why will thou run and why thy self destroy hippomenes o that i never had been by those bright eyes unfortunately seen ah tempt not thus a swift untimely fate thy life is worthy of the longest date were i less wretched did the galling chain of rigid gods not my free choice restrain by thee alone i could with joy be led to taste the raptures of a nuptial bed thus she disclosed the womans secret heart young innocent and new to cupids dart her thoughts her words her actions wildly rove with love she burns yet knows not that it is love her royal sire now with the murmuring crowd demands the race impatiently aloud hippomenes then with true fervor prayed my bold attempt let venus kindly aid by her sweet power i felt this amorous fire still may she succor whom she did inspire a soft unenvious wind with speedy care wafted to heaven the lovers tender prayer pity i own soon gained the wished consent and all the assistance he implored i lent the cyprian lands though rich in richness yield to that surnamed the tamasenian field that field of old was added to my shrine and its choice products consecrated mine a tree there stands full glorious to behold gold are the leafs the crackling branches gold it chanced three apples in my hands i bore which newly from the tree i sportive tore seen by the youth alone to him i brought the fruit and when and how to use it taught the signal sounding by the kings command both start at once and sweep thunprinted sand so swiftly move their feet they might with ease scarce moistened skim along the glassie seas or with a wondrous levity be born over yellow harvests of unbending corn now favoring peals resound from every part spirit the youth and fire his fainting heart hippomenes they cried thy life preserve intensely labor and stretch every nerve base fear alone can baffle thy design shoot boldly onward and the goal is thine it is doubtful whether shouts like these conveyed more pleasures to the youth or to the maid when a long distance often she could have gained she checked her swiftness and her feet restrained she sighed and dwelt and languishd on his face then with unwilling speed pursued the race oerspent with heat his breath he faintly drew parched was his mouth nor yet the goal in view and the first apple on the plain he threw the nymph stopped sudden at thunusual sight struck with the fruit so beautifully bright aside she starts the wonder to behold and eager stoops to catch the rouling gold thobservant youth past by and scoured along while peals of joy rung from the applauding throng unkindly she corrects the short delay and to redeem the time fleets swift away swift as the lightning or the northern wind and far she leaves the panting youth behind again he strives the flying nymph to hold with the temptation of the second gold the bright temptation fruitlesly was tossed so soon alas she won the distance lost now but a little interval of space remained for the decision of the race fair author of the precious gift he said be thou o goddess author of my aid then of the shining fruit the last he drew and with his fullcollected vigor threw the virgin still the longer to detain threw not directly but across the plain she seemed awhile perplexed in dubious thought if the fardistant apple should be sought i lured her backward mind to seize the bait and to the massy gold gave double weight my favor to my votary was showed her speed i lessened and increased her load but least though long the rapid race be run before my longer tedious tale is done the youth the goal and so the virgin won might i adonis now not hope to see his grateful thanks poured out for victory his pious incense on my altars laid but he nor grateful thanks nor incense paid enraged i vowed that with the youth the fair for his contempt should my keen vengeance share that future lovers might my power revere and from their sad examples learn to fear the silent fanes the sanctified abodes of cybele great mother of the gods raised by echion in a lonely wood and full of brown religious horror stood by a long painful journey faint they chose their weary limbs here secret to repose but soon my power inflamed the lustful boy careless of rest he sought untimely joy a hallowed gloomy cave with moss oergrown the temple joined of native pumicestone where antique images by priests were kept and wooden deities securely slept thither the rash hippomenes retires and gives a loose to all his wild desires and the chaste cell pollutes with wanton fires the sacred statues trembled with surprise the towry goddess blushing veiled her eyes and the lewd pair to stygian sounds had sent but unrevengeful seemed that punishment a heavier doom such black profaneness draws their taper fingers turn to crooked paws no more their necks the smoothness can retain now covered sudden with a yellow mane arms change to legs each finds the hardning breast of rage unknown and wondrous strength possessed their altered looks with fury grim appear and on the ground their brushing tails they hear they haunt the woods their voices which before were musically sweet now hoarsly roar hence lions dreadful to the laboring swains are tamed by cybele and curbed with reins and humbly draw her car along the plains but thou adonis my delightful care of these and beasts as fierce as these beware the savage which not shuns thee timely shun for by rash prowess should thou be undone a double ruin is contained in one thus cautious venus schooled her favorite boy but youthful heat all cautions will destroy his sprightly soul beyond grave counsels flies while with yoked swans the goddess cuts the skies his faithful hounds led by the tainted wind lodged in thick coverts chanced a boar to find the callow hero showed a manly heart and pierced the savage with a sidelong dart the flying savage wounded turned again wrenchd out the gory dart and foamed with pain the trembling boy by flight his safety sought and now recalled the lore which venus taught but now too late to fly the boar he strove who in the groin his tusks impetuous drove on the discolored grass adonis lay the monster trampling over his beauteous prey fair cytherea cyprus scarce in view heard from afar his groans and owned them true and turned her snowy swans and backward flew but as she saw him gasp his latest breath and quivering agonize in pangs of death down with swift flight she plunged nor rage forbore at once her garments and her hair she tore with cruel blows she beat her guiltless breast the fates upbraided and her love confessed nor shall they yet she cried the whole devour with uncontrolled inexorable power for thee lost youth my tears and restless pain shall in immortal monuments remain with solemn pomp in annual rites returned be thou for ever my adonis mourned could plutos queen with jealous fury storm and menthe to a fragrant herb transform yet dares not venus with a change surprise and in a flower bid her fallen hero rise then on the blood sweet nectar she bestows the scented blood in little bubbles rose little as rainy drops which fluttering fly born by the winds along a lowering sky short time ensued till where the blood was shed a flower began to rear its purple head such as on punick apples is revealed or in the filmy rind but half concealed still here the fate of lovely forms we see so sudden fades the sweet anemone the feeble stems to stormy blasts a prey their sickly beauties droop and pine away the winds forbid the flowers to flourish long which owe to winds their names in greecian song the end of the tenth book to the rt honble ye viscountess townshe r smith sculp  ovids metamorphoses book xi translated by mr dryden and others the death of orpheus by mr croxall here while the thracian bards enchanting strain sooths beasts and woods and all the listening plain the female bacchanals devoutly mad in shaggy skins like savage creatures clad warbling in air perceived his lovely lay and from a rising ground beheld him play when one the wildest with disheveled hair that loosely streamed and ruffled in the air soon as her frantic eye the lyrist spied see see the hater of our sex she cried then at his face her missive javelin sent which whizd along and brusht him as it went but the soft wreaths of ivy twisted round prevent a deep impression of the wound another for a weapon hurls a stone which by the sound subdued as soon as thrown falls at his feet and with a seeming sense implores his pardon for its late offense but now their frantic rage unbounded grows turns all to madness and no measure knows yet this the charms of music might subdue but that with all its charms is conquered too in louder strains their hideous yellings rise and squeaking hornpipes echo through the skies which in hoarse consort with the drum confound the moving lyre and every gentle sound then twas the deafend stones flew on with speed and saw unsoothd their tuneful poet bleed the birds the beasts and all the savage crew which the sweet lyrist to attention drew now by the female mobs more furious rage are driven and forced to quit the shady stage next their fierce hands the bard himself assail nor can his song against their wrath prevail they flock like birds when in a clustring flight by day they chase the boding fowl of night so crowded amphitheatres survey the stag to greedy dogs a future prey their steely javelins which soft curls entwine of budding tendrils from the leafy vine for sacred rites of mild religion made are flung promiscuous at the poets head those clods of earth or flints discharge and these hurl prickly branches sliverd from the trees and lest their passion should be unsupplyd the rabble crew by chance at distance spied where oxen straining at the heavy yoke the fallowd field with slow advances broke nigh which the brawny peasants dug the soil procuring food with long laborious toil these when they saw the ranting throng draw near quitted their tools and fled possessed with fear long spades and rakes of mighty size were found carelessly left upon the broken ground with these the furious lunaticks engage and first the laboring oxen feel their rage then to the poet they return with speed whose fate was past prevention now decreed in vain he lifts his suppliant hands in vain he tries before his neverfailing strain and from those sacred lips whose thrilling sound fierce tigers and insensate rocks could wound ah gods how moving was the mournful sight to see the fleeting soul now take its flight thee the soft warblers of the feathered kind bewailed for thee thy savage audience pined those rocks and woods that often thy strain had led mourn for their charmer and lament him dead and drooping trees their leafy glories shed naids and dryads with disheveled hair promiscuous weep and scarfs of sable wear nor could the rivergods conceal their moan but with new floods of tears augment their own his mangled limbs lay scattered all around his head and harp a better fortune found in hebrus streams they gently rould along and soothed the waters with a mournful song soft deadly notes the lifeless tongue inspire a doleful tune sounds from the floating lyre the hollow banks in solemn consort mourn and the sad strain in ecchoing groans return now with the current to the sea they glide born by the billows of the briny tide and driven where waves round rocky lesbos roar they strand and lodge upon methymnas shore but here when landed on the foreign soil a venomed snake the product of the isle attempts the head and sacred locks embrud with clotted gore and still freshdropping blood phoebus at last his kind protection gives and from the fact the greedy monster drives whose marbled jaws his impious crime atone still grinning ghastly though transformed to stone his ghost flies downward to the stygian shore and knows the places it had seen before among the shadows of the pious train he finds euridice and loves again with pleasure views the beauteous phantoms charms and clasps her in his unsubstantial arms there side by side they unmolested walk or pass their blissful hours in pleasing talk aft or before the bard securely goes and without danger can review his spouse the thracian women transformed to trees bacchus resolving to revenge the wrong of orpheus murdered on the madding throng decreed that each accomplice dame should stand fixed by the roots along the conscious land their wicked feet that late so nimbly ran to wreak their malice on the guiltless man sudden with twisted ligatures were bound like trees deep planted in the turfy ground and as the fowler with his subtle gins his feathered captives by the feet entwines that fluttering pant and struggle to get loose yet only closer draw the fatal noose so these were caught and as they strove in vain to quit the place they but increased their pain they flounce and toil yet find themselves controlled the root though pliant toughly keeps its hold in vain their toes and feet they look to find for even their shapely legs are clothed with rind one smites her thighs with a lamenting stroke and finds the flesh transformed to solid oak another with surprise and grief distressed lays on above but beats a wooden breast a rugged bark their softer neck invades their branching arms shoot up delightful shades at once they seem and are a real grove with mossy trunks below and verdant leaves above the fable of midas nor this sufficed the gods disgust remains and he resolves to quit their hated plains the vineyards of tymole ingross his care and with a better choir he fixes there where the smooth streams of clear pactolus rolled then undistinguished for its sands of gold the satyrs with the nymphs his usual throng come to salute their god and jovial danced along silenus only missed for while he reeled feeble with age and wine about the field the hoary drunkard had forgot his way and to the phrygian clowns became a prey who to king midas drag the captive god while on his totty pate the wreaths of ivy nod midas from orpheus had been taught his lore and knew the rites of bacchus long before he when he saw his venerable guest in honor of the god ordained a feast ten days in course with each continued night were spent in genial mirth and brisk delight then on the eleventh when with brighter ray phosphor had chased the fading stars away the king through lydias fields young bacchus sought and to the god his foster father brought pleased with the welcome sight he bids him soon but name his wish and swears to grant the boon a glorious offer yet but ill bestowed on him whose choice so little judgment showed give me says he nor thought he asked too much that with my body whatsoever i touch changed from the nature which it held of old may be converted into yellow gold he had his wish but yet the god repined to think the fool no better wish could find but the brave king departed from the place with smiles of gladness sparkling in his face nor could contain but as he took his way impatient longs to make the first essay down from a lowly branch a twig he drew the twig strait glittered with a golden hue he takes a stone the stone was turned to gold a clod he touches and the crumbling mold acknowledged soon the great transforming power in weight and substance like a mass of ore he plucked the corn and strait his grasp appears filled with a bending tuft of golden ears an apple next he takes and seems to hold the bright hesperian vegetable gold his hand he careless on a pillar lays with shining gold the fluted pillars blaze and while he washes as the servants pour his touch converts the stream to danaes shower to see these miracles so finely wrought fires with transporting joy his giddy thought the ready slaves prepare a sumptuous board spread with rich dainties for their happy lord whose powerful hands the bread no sooner hold but its whole substance is transformed to gold up to his mouth he lifts the savry meat which turns to gold as he attempts to eat his patrons noble juice of purple hue touched by his lips a gilded cordial grew unfit for drink and wondrous to behold it trickles from his jaws a fluid gold the rich poor fool confounded with surprise starving in all his various plenty lies sick of his wish he now detests the power for which he asked so earnestly before amidst his gold with pinching famine cursed and justly tortured with an equal thirst at last his shining arms to heaven he rears and in distress for refuge flies to prayers o father bacchus i have sinned he cried and foolishly thy gracious gift applied thy pity now repenting i implore oh may i feel the golden plague no more the hungry wretch his folly thus confessed touched the kind deitys goodnatured breast the gentle god annulled his first decree and from the cruel compact set him free but then to cleanse him quite from further harm and to dilute the relics of the charm he bids him seek the stream that cuts the land nigh where the towers of lydian sardis stand then trace the river to the fountain head and meet it rising from its rocky bed there as the bubling tide pours forth amain to plunge his body in and wash away the stain the king instructed to the fount retires but with the golden charm the stream inspires for while this quality the man forsakes an equal power the limpid water takes informs with veins of gold the neighboring land and glides along a bed of golden sand now loathing wealth the occasion of his woes far in the woods he sought a calm repose in caves and grottos where the nymphs resort and keep with mountain pan their silvan court ah had he left his stupid soul behind but his condition altered not his mind for where high tmolus rears his shady brow and from his cliffs surveys the seas below in his descent by sardis bounded here by the small confines of hypaepae there pan to the nymphs his frolic ditties played tuning his reeds beneath the checkered shade the nymphs are pleased the boasting sylvan plays and speaks with slight of great apollos lays tmolus was arbiter the boaster still accepts the trial with unequal skill the venerable judge was seated high on his own hill that seemed to touch the sky above the whispering trees his head he rears from their encumbring boughs to free his ears a wreath of oak alone his temples bound the pendant acorns loosely dangled round in me your judge says he there is no delay then bids the goatherd god begin and play pan tuned the pipe and with his rural song pleased the low taste of all the vulgar throng such songs a vulgar judgment mostly please midas was there and midas judged with these the mountain sire with grave deportment now to phoebus turns his venerable brow and as he turns with him the listening wood in the same posture of attention stood the god his own parnassian laurel crowned and in a wreath his golden tresses bound graceful his purple mantle swept the ground high on the left his ivory lute he raised the lute embossed with glittering jewels blazed in his right hand he nicely held the quill his easy posture spoke a masters skill the strings he touched with more than human art which pleased the judges ear and soothed his heart who soon judiciously the palm decreed and to the lute postpond the squeaking reed all with applause the rightful sentence heard midas alone dissatisfied appeared to him unjustly given the judgment seems for pans barbarick notes he most esteems the lyrick god who thought his untuned ear deserved but ill a human form to wear of that deprives him and supplies the place with some more fit and of an ampler space fixed on his noddle an unseemly pair flagging and large and full of whitish hair without a total change from what he was still in the man preserve the simple ass he to conceal the scandal of the deed a purple turbant folds about his head veils the reproach from public view and fears the laughing world would spy his monstrous ears one trusty barberslave that used to dress his masters hair when lengthened to excess the mighty secret knew but knew alone and though impatient durst not make it known restless at last a private place he found then dug a hole and told it to the ground in a low whisper he revealed the case and covered in the earth and silent left the place in time of trembling reeds a plenteous crop from the confided furrow sprouted up which high advancing with the ripening year made known the tiller and his fruitless care for then the rustling blades and whispering wind to tell the important secret both combined the building of troy phoebus with full revenge from tmolus flies darts through the air and cleaves the liquid skies near hellespont he lights and treads the plains where great laomedon sole monarch reigns where built between the two projecting strands to panomphaean jove an altar stands here first aspiring thoughts the king employ to found the lofty towers of future troy the work from schemes magnificent begun at vast expense was slowly carried on which phoebus seeing with the trident god who rules the swelling surges with his nod assuming each a mortal shape combine at a set price to finish his design the work was built the king their price denies and his injustice backs with perjuries this neptune could not brook but drove the main a mighty deluge over the phrygian plain twas all a sea the waters of the deep from every vale the copious harvest sweep the briny billows overflow the soil ravage the fields and mock the plowmans toil nor this appeased the gods revengeful mind for still a greater plague remains behind a huge sea monster lodges on the sands and the kings daughter for his prey demands to him that saved the damsel was decreed a set of horses of the suns fine breed but when alcides from the rock untied the trembling fair the ransom was denied he in revenge the newbuilt walls attacked and the twiceperjurd city bravely sacked telamon aided and in justice shared part of the plunder as his due reward the princess rescued late with all her charms hesione was yielded to his arms for peleus with a goddess bride was more proud of his spouse than of his birth before grandsons to jove there might be more than one but he the goddess had enjoyed alone the story of thetis and peleus etc for proteus thus to virgin thetis said fair goddess of the waves consent to wed and take some spritely lover to your bed a son you will have the terror of the field to whom in fame and power his sire shall yield jove who adored the nymph with boundless love did from his breast the dangerous flame remove he knew the fates nor cared to raise up one whose fame and greatness should eclipse his own on happy peleus he bestowed her charms and blessed his grandson in the goddess arms a silent creek thessalias coast can show two arms project and shape it like a bow twould make a bay but the transparent tide does scarce the yellowgravelld bottom hide for the quick eye may through the liquid wave a firm unweedy level beach perceive a grove of fragrant myrtle near it grows whose boughs though thick a beauteous grot disclose the wellwrought fabric to discerning eyes rather by art than nature seems to rise a bridled dolphin often fair thetis bore to this her loved retreat her favorite shore here peleus seized her slumbring while she lay and urged his suit with all that love could say but when he found her obstinately coy resolved to force her and command the joy the nymph oerpowerd to art for succor flies and various shapes the eager youth surprise a bird she seems but plies her wings in vain his hands the fleeting substance still detain a branchy tree high in the air she grew about its bark his nimble arms he threw a tiger next she glares with flaming eyes the frightened lover quits his hold and flies the seagods he with sacred rites adores then a libation on the ocean pours while the fat entrails crackle in the fire and sheets of smoke in sweet perfume aspire till proteus rising from his oozy bed thus to the poor desponding lover said no more in anxious thoughts your mind employ for yet you shall possess the dear expected joy you must once more the unwary nymph surprise as in her cooly grot she slumbring lies then bind her fast with unrelenting hands and strain her tender limbs with knotted bands still hold her under every different shape till tired she tries no longer to escape thus he then sunk beneath the glassy flood and broken accents fluttered where he stood bright sol had almost now his journey done and down the steepy western unequal run when the fair nereid left the briny wave and as she used retreated to her cave he scarce had bound her fast when she arose and into various shapes her body throws she went to move her arms and found em tied then with a sigh some god assists ye cried and in her proper shape stood blushing by his side about her waiste his longing arms he flung from which embrace the great achilles sprung the transformation of daedalion peleus unmixed felicity enjoyed blessed in a valiant son and virtuous bride till fortune did in blood his hands imbrue and his own brother by cursed chance he slew then driven from thessaly his native clime trachinia first gave shelter to his crime where peaceful ceyx mildly filled the throne and like his sire the morning planet shone but now unlike himself bedewed with tears mourning a brother lost his brow appears first to the town with travel spent and care peleus and his small company repair his herds and flocks the while at leisure feed on the rich pasture of a neighboring mead the prince before the royal presence brought showed by the suppliant olive what he sought then tells his name and race and country right but hides the unhappy reason of his flight he begs the king some little town to give where they may safe his faithful vassals live ceyx replied to all my bounty flows a hospitable realm your suit has chose your glorious race and farresounding fame and grandsire jove peculiar favors claim all you can wish i grant entreaties spare my kingdom would twere worth the sharing share tears stopped his speech astonished peleus pleads to know the cause from whence his grief proceeds the prince replied there is none of ye but deems this hawk was ever such as now it seems know twas a hero once daedalion named for warlike deeds and haughty valor famed like me to that bright luminary born who wakes aurora and brings on the morn his fierceness still remains and love of blood now dread of birds and tyrant of the wood my make was softer peace my greatest care but this my brother wholly bent on war late nations feared and routed armies fled that force which now the timorous pigeons dread a daughter he possessed divinely fair and scarcely yet had seen her fifteenth year young chione a thousand rivals strove to win the maid and teach her how to love phoebus and mercury by chance one day from delphi and cyllene past this way together they the virgin saw desire at once warmed both their breasts with amorous fire phoebus resolved to wait till close of day but mercurys hot love brookd no delay with his entrancing rod the maid he charms and unresisted revels in her arms twas night and phoebus in a beldams dress to the late rifled beauty got access her time complete nine circling moons had run to either god she bore a lovely son to mercury autolycus she brought who turned to thefts and tricks his subtle thought possessed he was of all his fathers slight at will made white look black and black look white philammon born to phoebus like his sire the muses loved and finely struck the lyre and made his voice and touch in harmony conspire in vain fond maid you boast this double birth the love of gods and royal fathers worth and jove among your ancestors rehearse could blessings such as these ever prove a curse to her they did who with audacious pride vain of her own dianas charms decryd her taunts the goddess with resentment fill my face you like not you shall try my skill she said and strait her vengeful bow she strung and sent a shaft that pierced her guilty tongue the bleeding tongue in vain its accents tries in the red stream her soul reluctant flies with sorrow wild i ran to her relief and tried to moderate my brothers grief he deaf as rocks by stormy surges beat loudly laments and hears me not entreat when on the funeral pile he saw her laid thrice he to rush into the flames assayed thrice with officious care by us was stayed now mad with grief away he fled amain like a stung heifer that resents the pain and bellowing wildly bounds along the plain over the most rugged ways so fast he ran he seemed a bird already not a man he left us breathless all behind and now in quest of death had gained parnassus brow but when from thence headlong himself he threw he fell not but with airy pinions flew phoebus in pity changed him to a fowl whose crooked beak and claws the birds control little of bulk but of a warlike soul a hawk become the feathered races foe he tries to ease his own by others woe a wolf turned into marble while they astonished heard the king relate these wonders of his hapless brothers fate the princes herdsman at the court arrives and fresh surprise to all the audience gives o peleus peleus dreadful news i bear he said and trembled as he spoke for fear the worst affrighted peleus bid him tell whilst ceyx too grew pale with friendly zeal thus he began when sol midheavn had gained and half his way was past and half remained i to the level shore my cattle drove and let them freely in the meadows rove some stretched at length admire the watery plain some cropd the herb some wanton swam the main a temple stands of antique make hard by where no gilt domes nor marble lure the eye unpolished rafters bear its lowly height hid by a grove as ancient from the sight here nereus and the nereids they adore i learnt it from the man who thither bore his net to dry it on the sunny shore adjoyns a lake enclosed with willows round where swelling waves have overflowd the mound and muddy stagnate on the lower ground from thence a russling noise increasing flies strikes the still shore and frights us with surprise strait a huge wolf rushed from the marshy wood his jaws besmeared with mingled foam and blood though equally by hunger urged and rage his appetite he minds not to assuage naught that he meets his rabid fury spares but the whole herd with mad disorder tears some of our men who strove to drive him thence torn by his teeth have died in their defense the ecchoing lakes the sea and fields and shore impurpled blush with streams of reeking gore delay is loss nor have we time for thought while yet some few remain alive we ought to seize our arms and with confedrate force try if we so can stop his bloody course but peleus cared not for his ruined herd his crime he called to mind and thence inferred that psammathes revenge this havoc made in sacrifice to murdered phocus shade the king commands his servants to their arms resolved to go but the loud noise alarms his lovely queen who from her chamber flew and her halfplaited hair behind her threw about his neck she hung with loving fears and now with words and now with pleading tears entreated that he would send his men alone and stay himself to save two lives in one then peleus your just fears o queen forget too much the offer leaves me in your debt no arms against the monster i shall bear but the seanymphs appease with humble prayer the citadels high turrets pierce the sky which homebound vessels glad from far descry this they ascend and thence with sorrow ken the mangled heifers lie and bleeding men the inexorable ravager they view with blood discolored still the rest pursue there peleus prayed submissive toward the sea and deprecates the ire of injured psamathe but deaf to all his prayers the nymph remained till thetis for her spouse the boon obtained pleased with the luxury the furious beast unstopd continues still his bloody feast while yet upon a sturdy bull he flew changed by the nymph a marble block he grew no longer dreadful now the wolf appears buried in stone and vanished like their fears yet still the fates unhappy peleus vexed to the magnesian shore he wanders next acastus there who ruled the peaceful clime grants his request and expiates his crime the story of ceyx and alcyone by mr dryden these prodigies affect the pious prince but more perplexed with those that happened since he purposes to seek the clarian god avoiding delphos his more famed abode since phlegyan robbers made unsafe the road yet could he not from her he loved so well the fatal voyage he resolved conceal but when she saw her lord prepared to part a deadly cold ran shivering to her heart her faded cheeks are changed to boxen hue and in her eyes the tears are ever new she thrice essayed to speak her accents hung and faltring died unfinished on her tongue or vanished into sighs with long delay her voice returned and found the wonted way tell me my lord she said what fault unknown thy once beloved alcyone has done whither ah whither is thy kindness gone can ceyx then sustain to leave his wife and unconcerned forsake the sweets of life what can thy mind to this long journey move or needst thou absence to renew thy love yet if thou go by land though grief possess my soul even then my fears will be the less but ah be warned to shun the watery way the face is frightful of the stormy sea for late i saw adrift disjointed planks and empty tombs erected on the banks nor let false hopes to trust betray thy mind because my sire in caves constrains the wind can with a breath their clamorous rage appease they fear his whistle and forsake the seas not so for once indulged they sweep the main deaf to the call or hearing hear in vain but bent on mischief bear the waves before and not content with seas insult the shore when ocean air and earth at once engage and rooted forests fly before their rage at once the clashing clouds to battle move and lightnings run across the fields above i know them well and marked their rude comport while yet a child within my fathers court in times of tempest they command alone and he but sits precarious on the throne the more i know the more my fears augment and fears are often prophetic of the event but if not fears or reasons will prevail if fate has fixed thee obstinate to sail go not without thy wife but let me bear my part of danger with an equal share and present what i suffer only fear then over the bounding billows shall we fly secure to live together or to die these reasons moved her starlike husbands heart but still he held his purpose to depart for as he loved her equal to his life he would not to the seas expose his wife nor could be wrought his voyage to refrain but sought by arguments to sooth her pain nor these availed at length he lights on one with which so difficult a cause he won my love so short an absence cease to fear for by my fathers holy flame i swear before two moons their orb with light adorn if heaven allow me life i will return this promise of so short a stay prevails he soon equips the ship supplies the sails and gives the word to launch she trembling views this pomp of death and parting tears renews last with a kiss she took a long farewell sighed with a sad presage and swooning fell while ceyx seeks delays the lusty crew raised on their banks their oars in order drew to their broad breasts the ship with fury flew the queen recovered rears her humid eyes and first her husband on the poop espies shaking his hand at distance on the main she took the sign and shook her hand again still as the ground recedes contracts her view with sharpened sight till she no longer knew the muchloved face that comfort lost supplies with less and with the galley feeds her eyes the galley born from view by rising gales she followed with her sight the flying sails when even the flying sails were seen no more forsaken of all sight she left the shore then on her bridalbed her body throws and sought in sleep her wearied eyes to close her husbands pillow and the widowed part which once he pressed renewed the former smart and now a breeze from shore began to blow the sailors ship their oars and cease to row then hoist their yards atrip and all their sails let fall to court the wind and catch the gales by this the vessel half her course had run and as much rested till the rising sun both shoars were lost to sight when at the close of day a stiffer gale at east arose the sea grew white the rolling waves from far like heralds first denounce the watery war this seen the master soon began to cry strike strike the topsail let the mainsheet fly and furl your sails the winds repel the sound and in the speakers mouth the speech is drowned yet of their own accord as danger taught each in his way officiously they wrought some stow their oars or stop the leaky sides another bolder yet the yard bestrides and folds the sails a fourth with labor laves the intruding seas and waves ejects on waves in this confusion while their work they ply the winds augment the winter of the sky and wage intestine wars the suffering seas are tossed and mingled as their tyrants please the master would command but in despair of safety stands amazed with stupid care nor what to bid or what forbid he knows the ungoverned tempest to such fury grows vain is his force and vainer is his skill with such a concourse comes the flood of ill the cries of men are mixed with rattling shrowds seas dash on seas and clouds encounter clouds at once from east to west from pole to pole the forky lightnings flash the roaring thunders roll now waves on waves ascending scale the skies and in the fires above the water fries when yellow sands are sifted from below the glittering billows give a golden show and when the fouler bottom spews the black the stygian dye the tainted waters take then frothy white appear the flatted seas and change their color changing their disease like various fits the trachin vessel finds and now sublime she rides upon the winds as from a lofty summit looks from high and from the clouds beholds the nether sky now from the depth of hell they lift their sight and at a distance see superior light the lashing billows make a loud report and beat her sides as battring rams a fort or as a lion bounding in his way with force augmented bears against his prey sidelong to seize or unapald with fear springs on the toils and rushes on the spear so seas impelled by winds with added power assault the sides and over the hatches tower the planks their pitchy covering washed away now yield and now a yawning breach display the roaring waters with a hostile tide rush through the ruins of her gaping side mean time in sheets of rain the sky descends and ocean swelled with waters upwards tends one rising falling one the heavens and sea meet at their confines in the middle way the sails are drunk with showers and drop with rain sweet waters mingle with the briny main no star appears to lend his friendly light darkness and tempest make a double night but flashing fires disclose the deep by turns and while the lightenings blaze the water burns now all the waves their scattered force unite and as a soldier foremost in the fight makes way for others and an host alone still presses on and urging gains the town so while the invading billows come abreast the hero tenth advanced before the rest sweeps all before him with impetuous sway and from the walls descends upon the prey part following enter part remain without with envy hear their fellows conquering shout and mount on others backs in hope to share the city thus become the seat of war an universal cry resounds aloud the sailors run in heaps a helpless crowd art fails and courage falls no succor near as many waves as many deaths appear one weeps and yet despairs of late relief one cannot weep his fears congeal his grief but stupid with dry eyes expects his fate one with loud shrieks laments his lost estate and calls those happy whom their funrals wait this wretch with prayers and vows the gods implores and even the skies he cannot see adores that other on his friends his thoughts bestows his careful father and his faithful spouse the covetous wordling in his anxious mind thinks only on the wealth he left behind all ceyx his alcyone employs for her he grieves yet in her absence joys his wife he wishes and would still be near not her with him but wishes him with her now with last looks he seeks his native shore which fate has destined him to see no more he sought but in the dark tempestuous night he knew not whither to direct his sight so whirl the seas such darkness blinds the sky that the black night receives a deeper dye the giddy ship ran round the tempest tore her mast and overboard the rudder bore one billow mounts and with a scornful brow proud of her conquest gained insults the waves below nor lighter falls than if some giant tore pindus and athos with the freight they bore and tossed on seas pressed with the ponderous blow down sinks the ship within the abyss below down with the vessel sink into the main the many never more to rise again some few on scattered planks with fruitless care lay hold and swim but while they swim despair even he who late a scepter did command now grasps a floating fragment in his hand and while he struggles on the stormy main invokes his father and his wifes in vain but yet his consort is his greatest care alcyone he names amidst his prayer names as a charm against the waves and wind most in his mouth and ever in his mind tired with his toil all hopes of safety past from prayers to wishes he descends at last that his dead body wafted to the sands might have its burial from her friendly hands as often as he can catch a gulp of air and peep above the seas he names the fair and even when plunged beneath on her he raves murmuring alcyone below the waves at last a falling billow stops his breath breaks over his head and whelms him underneath bright lucifer unlike himself appears that night his heavenly form obscured with tears and since he was forbid to leave the skies he muffled with a cloud his mournful eyes mean time alcyone his fate unknown computes how many nights he had been gone observes the waning moon with hourly view numbers her age and wishes for a new against the promised time provides with care and hastens in the woof the robes he was to wear and for her self employs another loom newdressd to meet her lord returning home flattering her heart with joys that never were to come she fumed the temples with an odorous flame and often before the sacred altars came to pray for him who was an empty name all powers implored but far above the rest to juno she her pious vows addressed her muchloved lord from perils to protect and safe over seas his voyage to direct then prayed that she might still possess his heart and no pretending rival share a part this last petition heard of all her prayer the rest dispersed by winds were lost in air but she the goddess of the nuptial bed tired with her vain devotions for the dead resolved the tainted hand should be repelled which incense offered and her altar held then iris thus bespoke thou faithful maid by whom thy queens commands are well conveyed haste to the house of sleep and bid the god who rules the night by visions with a nod prepare a dream in figure and in form resembling him who perished in the storm this form before alcyone present to make her certain of the sad event indud with robes of various hue she flies and flying draws an arch a segment of the skies then leaves her bending bow and from the steep descends to search the silent house of sleep the house of sleep near the cymmerians in his dark abode deep in a cavern dwells the drowzy god whose gloomy mansion nor the rising sun nor setting visits nor the lightsome noon but lazy vapors round the region fly perpetual twilight and a doubtful sky no crowing cock does there his wings display nor with his horny bill provoke the day nor watchful dogs nor the more wakeful geese disturb with nightly noise the sacred peace nor beast of nature nor the tame are nigh nor trees with tempests rocked nor human cry but safe repose without an air of breath dwells here and a dumb quiet next to death an arm of lethe with a gentle flow arising upwards from the rock below the palace moats and over the pebbles creeps and with soft murmurs calls the coming sleeps around its entry nodding poppies grow and all cool simples that sweet rest bestow night from the plants their sleepy virtue drains and passing sheds it on the silent plains no door there was the unguarded house to keep on creaking hinges turned to break his sleep but in the gloomy court was raised a bed stuffed with black plumes and on an ebonsted black was the covering too where lay the god and slept supine his limbs displayed abroad about his head fantastic visions fly which various images of things supply and mock their forms the leaves on trees not more nor bearded ears in fields nor sands upon the shore the virgin entering bright indulged the day to the brown cave and brushed the dreams away the god disturbed with this new glare of light cast sudden on his face unsealed his sight and raised his tardy head which sunk again and sinking on his bosom knocked his chin at length shook off himself and asked the dame and asking yawnd for what intent she came to whom the goddess thus o sacred rest sweet pleasing sleep of all the powers the best o peace of mind repairer of decay whose balms renew the limbs to labors of the day care shuns thy soft approach and sullen flies away adorn a dream expressing human form the shape of him who suffered in the storm and send it flitting to the trachin court the wreck of wretched ceyx to report before his queen bid the pale spectre stand who begs a vain relief at junos hand she said and scarce awake her eyes could keep unable to support the fumes of sleep but fled returning by the way she went and swerved along her bow with swift ascent the god uneasy till he slept again resolved at once to rid himself of pain and though against his custom called aloud exciting morpheus from the sleepy crowd morpheus of all his numerous train expressed the shape of man and imitated best the walk the words the gesture could supply the habit mimick and the mein belly plays well but all his action is confined extending not beyond our human kind another birds and beasts and dragons apes and dreadful images and monster shapes this demon icelos in heavens high hall the gods have named but men phobetor call a third is phantasus whose actions roll on meaner thoughts and things devoid of soul earth fruits and flowers he represents in dreams and solid rocks unmoved and running streams these three to kings and chiefs their scenes display the rest before the ignoble commons play of these the chosen morpheus is dispatched which done the lazy monarch overwatchd down from his propping elbow drops his head dissolved in sleep and shrinks within his bed darkling the demon glides for flight prepared so soft that scarce his fanning wings are heard to trachin swift as thought the flitting shade through air his momentary journey made then lays aside the steerage of his wings forsakes his proper form assumes the kings and pale as death despoiled of his array into the queens apartment takes his way and stands before the bed at dawn of day unmoved his eyes and wet his beard appears and shedding vain but seeming real tears the briny water dropping from his hairs then staring on her with a ghastly look and hollow voice he thus the queen bespoke know thou not me not yet unhappy wife or are my features perished with my life look once again and for thy husband lost lo all that is left of him thy husbands ghost thy vows for my return were all in vain the stormy south oertook us in the main and never shall thou see thy living lord again bear witness heaven i called on thee in death and while i called a billow stopped my breath think not that flying fame reports my fate i present i appear and my own wreck relate rise wretched widow rise nor undeplord permit my soul to pass the stygian ford but rise prepared in black to mourn thy perished lord thus said the playergod and adding art of voice and gesture so performed his part she thought so like her love the shade appears that ceyx spoke the words and ceyx shed the tears she groaned her inward soul with grief oppressed she sighed she wept and sleeping beat her breast then stretched her arms to embrace his body bare her clasping arms enclose but empty air at this not yet awake she cried o stay one is our fate and common is our way so dreadful was the dream so loud she spoke that starting sudden up the slumber broke then cast her eyes around in hope to view her vanished lord and find the vision true for now the maids who waited her commands ran in with lighted tapers in their hands tired with the search not finding what she seeks with cruel blows she pounds her blubbered cheeks then from her beaten breast the linen tare and cut the golden caul that bound her hair her nurse demands the cause with louder cries she prosecutes her griefs and thus replies no more alcyone she suffered death with her loved lord when ceyx lost his breath no flattery no false comfort give me none my shipwrecked ceyx is for ever gone i saw i saw him manifest in view his voice his figure and his gestures knew his luster lost and every living grace yet i retained the features of his face though with pale cheeks wet beard and dropping hair none but my ceyx could appear so fair i would have strained him with a strict embrace but through my arms he slipped and vanished from the place there even just there he stood and as she spoke where last the spectre was she cast her look fain would she hope and gazed upon the ground if any printed footsteps might be found then sighed and said this i too well foreknew and my prophetic fears presaged too true twas what i begged when with a bleeding heart i took my leave and suffered thee to part or i to go along or thou to stay never ah never to divide our way happier for me that all our hours assigned together we had lived even not in death disjoined so had my ceyx still been living here or with my ceyx i had perished there now i die absent in the vast profound and me without my self the seas have drowned the storms were not so cruel should i strive to lengthen life and such a grief survive but neither will i strive nor wretched thee in death forsake but keep thee company if not one common sepulcher contains our bodies or one urn our last remains yet ceyx and alcyone shall join their names remembered in one common line no farther voice her mighty grief affords for sighs come rushing in betwixt her words and stopped her tongue but what her tongue denied soft tears and groans and dumb complaints supplied twas morning to the port she takes her way and stands upon the margin of the sea that place that very spot of ground she sought or thither by her destiny was brought where last he stood and while she sadly said twas here he left me lingering here delayed his parting kiss and there his anchors weighed thus speaking while her thoughts past actions trace and call to mind admonished by the place sharp at her utmost ken she cast her eyes and somewhat floating from afar descries it seemed a corpse adrift to distant sight but at a distance who could judge aright it wafted nearer yet and then she knew that what before she but surmisd was true a corpse it was but whose it was unknown yet moved however she made the case her own took the bad omen of a shipwrecked man as for a stranger wept and thus began poor wretch on stormy seas to lose thy life unhappy thou but more thy widowed wife at this she paused for now the flowing tide had brought the body nearer to the side the more she looks the more her fears increase at nearer sight and she is her self the less now driven ashore and at her feet it lies she knows too much in knowing whom she sees her husbands corpse at this she loudly shrieks it is he it is he she cries and tears her cheeks her hair and vest and stooping to the sands about his neck she cast her trembling hands and is it thus o dearer than my life thus thus returnst thou to thy longing wife she said and to the neighboring mole she strode raised there to break thincursions of the flood headlong from hence to plunge her self she springs but shoots along supported on her wings a bird newmade about the banks she plies not far from shore and short excursions tries nor seeks in air her humble flight to raise content to skim the surface of the seas her bill though slender sends a creaking noise and imitates a lamentable voice now lighting where the bloodless body lies she with a funeral note renews her cries at all her stretch her little wings she spread and with her feathered arms embraced the dead then flickring to his palid lips she strove to print a kiss the last essay of love whether the vital touch revived the dead or that the moving waters raised his head to meet the kiss the vulgar doubt alone for sure a present miracle was shown the gods their shapes to winterbirds translate but both obnoxious to their former fate their conjugal affection still is tied and still the mournful race is multiplied they bill they tread alcyone compressed sevn days sits brooding on her floating nest a wintry queen her sire at length is kind calms every storm and hushes every wind prepares his empire for his daughters ease and for his hatching nephews smooths the seas aesacus transformed into a cormorant these some old man

ships were manned to sail the sea nor had their just resentments found delay had not the winds and waves opposed their way at aulis with united powers they meet but there crosswinds or calms detained the fleet now while they raise an altar on the shore and jove with solemn sacrifice adore a boding sign the priests and people see a snake of size immense ascends a tree and in the leasie summit spied a nest which over her callow young a sparrow pressed eight were the birds unfledged their mother flew and hovered round her care but still in view till the fierce reptile first devoured the brood then

her happy chance o argives we shall conquer troy is ours but long delays shall first afflict our powers nine years of labor the nine birds portend the tenth shall in the towns destruction end the serpent who his maw obscene had filled the branches in his curled embraces held but as in spires he stood he turned to stone the stony snake retained the figure still his own yet not for this the windbound navy weighed slack were their sails and neptune disobeyed some thought him loath the town should be destroyed whose building had his hands divine employed not so the seer who knew and known foreshowd the virgin phoebe with a virgins blood must first be reconciled the common cause prevailed and pity yielding to the laws fair iphigenia the devoted maid was by the weeping priests in

coming blow a mist before the ministers she cast and in the virgins room a hind she placed the oblation slain and phaebe reconciled the storm was hushed and dimpled ocean smiled a favorable gale arose from shore which to the port desired the grecian galleys bore the house of fame full in the midst of this created space betwixt heaven earth and skies there stands a place confining on all three with triple bound whence all things though remote are viewed around and thither bring their undulating sound the palace of loud fame her seat of power placed on the summet of a lofty tower a thousand winding entries long and wide receive of fresh reports a flowing tide a thousand crannies in the walls are made nor gate nor bars exclude the busy trade it is built of brass the better to diffuse the spreading sounds and multiply the news where ecchos in repeated ecchos play a mart for ever full and open night and day nor silence is within nor voice express but a deaf noise of sounds that never cease confused and chiding like the hollow roar of tides receding from the insulted shore or like the broken thunder heard from far when jove to distance drives the rolling war the courts are filled with a tumultuous din of crowds or issuing forth or entering in a thoroughfare of news where some devise things never heard some mingle truth with lies the troubled air with empty sounds they beat intent to hear and eager to repeat error sits brooding there with added train of vain credulity and joys as vain suspicion with sedition joined are near and rumors raised and murmurs mixed and panique fear fame sits aloft and sees the subject ground and seas about and skies above enquiring all around the goddess gives the alarm and soon is known the grecian fleet descending on the town fixed on defense the trojans are not slow to guard their shore from an expected foe they meet in fight by hectors fatal hand protesilaus falls and bites the strand which with expense of blood the grecians won and proved the strength unknown of priams son and to their cost the trojan leaders felt the grecian heroes and what deaths they dealt the story of cygnus from these first onsets the sigaean shore was strewn with carcasses and stained with gore neptunian cygnus troops of greeks had slain achilles in his carr had scoured the plain and cleared the trojan ranks wherever he fought cygnus or hector through the fields he sought cygnus he found on him his force essayed for hector was to the tenth year delayed his white manned steeds that bowed beneath the yoke he cheered to courage with a gentle stroke then urged his fiery chariot on the foe and rising shook his lance in act to throw but first he cried o youth be proud to bear thy death ennobled by pelides spear the lance pursued the voice without delay nor did the whizzing weapon miss the way but pierced his cuirass with such fury sent and signed his bosom with a purple dint at this the seed of neptune goddessborn for ornament not use these arms are worn this helm and heavy buckler i can spare as only decorations of the war so mars is armed for glory not for need it is somewhat more from neptune to proceed than from a daughter of the sea to spring thy sire is mortal mine is oceans king secure of death i should contemn thy dart though naked and impassible depart he said and threw the trembling weapon passed through nine bullhides each under other placed on his broad shield and stuck within the last achilles wrenchd it out and sent again the hostile gift the hostile gift was vain he tried a third a tough wellchosen spear the inviolable body stood sincere though cygnus then did no defense provide but scornful offered his unshielded side not otherwise the impatient hero fared than as a bull encompassed with a guard amid the circus roars provoked from far by sight of scarlet and a sanguine war they quit their ground his bended horns elude in vain pursuing and in vain pursued before to farther fight he would advance he stood considering and surveyed his lance doubts if he wielded not a wooden spear without a point he looked the point was there this is my hand and this my lance he said by which so many thousand foes are dead o whither is their usual virtue fled i had it once and the lyrnessian wall and tenedos confessed it in their fall thy streams caicus rolled a crimsonflood and thebes ran red with her own natives blood twice telephus employed their piercing steel to wound him first and afterward to heal the vigor of this arm was never vain and that my wonted prowess i retain witness these heaps of slaughter on the plain he said and doubtful of his former deeds to some new trial of his force proceeds he chose menaetes from among the rest at him he lanchd his spear and pierced his breast on the hard earth the lycian knocked his head and lay supine and forth the spirit fled then thus the hero neither can i blame the hand or javelin both are still the same the same i will employ against this foe and wish but with the same success to throw so spoke the chief and while he spoke he threw the weapon with unerring fury flew at his left shoulder aimed nor entrance found but back as from a rock with swift rebound harmless returned a bloody mark appeared which with false joy the flattered hero cheered wound there was none the blood that was in view the lance before from slain menaetes drew headlong he leaps from off his lofty car and in close fight on foot renews the war raging with high disdain repeats his blows nor shield nor armor can their force oppose huge cantlets of his buckler strew the ground and no defense in his bored arms is found but on his flesh no wound or blood is seen the sword it self is blunted on the skin this vain attempt the chief no longer bears but round his hollow temples and his ears his buckler beats the son of neptune stunned with these repeated buffets quits his ground a sickly sweat succeeds and shades of night inverted nature swims before his sight the insulting victor presses on the more and treads the steps the vanquished trod before nor rest nor respite gives a stone there lay behind his trembling foe and stopped his way achilles took the advantage which he found oerturnd and pushed him backward on the ground his buckler held him under while he pressed with both his knees above his panting breast unlacd his helm about his chin the twist he tied and soon the strangled soul dismissed with eager haste he went to strip the dead the vanished body from his arms was fled his seagod sire timmortalize his frame had turned it to the bird that bears his name a truce succeeds the labors of this day and arms suspended with a long delay while trojan walls are kept with watch and ward the greeks before their trenches mount the guard the feast approached when to the blueeyd maid his vows for cygnus slain the victor paid and a white heyfer on her altar laid the reeking entrails on the fire they threw and to the gods the grateful odor flew heaven had its part in sacrifice the rest was broiled and roasted for the future feast the chief invited guests were set around and hunger first asswagd the bowls were crowned which in deep draughts their cares and labors drowned the mellow harp did not their ears employ and mute was all the warlike symphony discourse the food of souls was their delight and pleasing chat prolonged the summersnight the subject deeds of arms and valor shown or on the trojan side or on their own of dangers undertaken fame achieved they talked by turns the talk by turns relieved what things but these could fierce achilles tell or what could fierce achilles hear so well the last great act performed of cygnus slain did most the martial audience entertain wondering to find a body free by fate from steel and which could even that steel rebate amazed their admiration they renew and scarce pelides could believe it true the story of caeneus then nestor thus what once this age has known in fated cygnus and in him alone these eyes have seen in caeneus long before whose body not a thousand swords could bore caeneus in courage and in strength excelled and still his othrys with his fame is filled but what did most his martial deeds adorn though since he changed his sex a woman born a novelty so strange and full of fate his listening audience asked him to relate achilles thus commends their common suit o father first for prudence in repute tell with that eloquence so much thy own what thou have heard or what of caeneus known what was he whence his change of sex begun what trophies joined in wars with thee he won who conquered him and in what fatal strife the youth without a wound could lose his life neleides then though tardy age and time have shrunk my sinews and decayed my prime though much i have forgotten of my store yet not exhausted i remember more of all that arms achieved or peace designed that action still is fresher in my mind than ought beside if reverend age can give to faith a sanction in my third i live twas in my second centry i surveyed young caenis then a fair thessalian maid caenis the bright was born to high command a princess and a native of thy land divine achilles every tongue proclaimed her beauty and her eyes all hearts inflamed peleus thy sire perhaps had sought her bed among the rest but he had either led thy mother then or was by promise tied but she to him and all alike her love denied it was her fortune once to take her way along the sandy margin of the sea the power of ocean viewed her as she passed and loved as soon as seen by force embraced so fame reports her virgintreasure seized and his new joys the ravisher so pleased that thus transported to the nymph he cried ask what thou will no prayer shall be denied this also fame relates the haughty fair who not the rape even of a god could bear this answer proud returned to mighty wrongs a mighty recompense of right belongs give me no more to suffer such a shame but change the woman for a better name one gift for all she said and while she spoke aster n majestic manly tone she took a man she was and as the godhead swore to caeneus turned who caenis was before to this the lover adds without request no force of steel should violate his breast glad of the gift the newmade warrior goes and arms among the greeks and longs for equal foes the skirmish between the centaurs and lapithites now brave perithous bold ixions son the love of fair hippodame had won the cloudbegotten race half men half beast invited came to grace the nuptial feast in a cool caves recess the treat was made whose entrance trees with spreading boughs oershade they sat and summoned by the bridegroom came to mix with those the lapythaean name nor wanted i the roofs with joy resound and hymen io hymen rung around raised altars shone with holy fires the bride lovely her self and lovely by her side a bevy of bright nymphs with sober grace came glittering like a star and took her place her heavenly form beheld all wished her joy and little wanted but in vain their wishes all employ for one most brutal of the brutal brood or whether wine or beauty fired his blood or both at once beheld with lustful eyes the bride at once resolved to make his prize down went the board and fastening on her hair he seized with sudden force the frighted fair it was eurytus began his bestial kind his crime pursued and each as pleased his mind or her whom chance presented took the feast an image of a taken town expressed the cave resounds with female shrieks we rise mad with revenge to make a swift reprise and theseus first what frenzy has possessed o eurytus he cried thy brutal breast to wrong perithous and not him alone but while i live two friends conjoined in one to justify his threat he thrusts aside the crowd of centaurs and redeems the bride the monster naught replied for words were vain and deeds could only deeds unjust maintain but answers with his hand and forward pressed with blows redoubled on his face and breast an ample goblet stood of antic mold and rough with figures of the rising gold the hero snatched it up and tossed in air full at the front of the foul ravisher he falls and falling vomits forth a flood of wine and foam and brains and mingled blood half roaring and half neighing through the hall arms arms the doubleformd with fury call to wreak their brothers death a medleyflight of bowls and jars at first supply the fight once instruments of feasts but now of fate wine animates their rage and arms their hate bold amycus from the robbed vestry brings the chalices of heaven and holy things of precious weight a sconce that hung on high with tapers filled to light the sacristy torn from the cord with his unhallowed hand he threw amid the lapythaean band on celadon the ruin fell and left his face of feature and of form bereft so when some brawny sacrificer knocks before an altar led an offered ox his eye balls rooted out are thrown to ground his nose dismantled in his mouth is found his jaws cheeks front one undistinguished wound this belates the avenger could not brook but by the foot a mapleboard he took and hurled at amycus his chin it bent against his chest and down the centaur sent whom sputtring bloody teeth the second blow of his drawn sword dispatched to shades below grineus was near and cast a furious look on the sidealtar censd with sacred smoke and bright with flaming fires the gods he cried have with their holy trade our hands supplied why use we not their gifts then from the floor an altarstone he heaved with all the load it bore altar and altars freight together flew where thickest thronged the lapythaean crew and at once broteas and oryus slew oryus mother mycale was known down from her sphere to draw the laboring moon exadius cried unpunished shall not go this fact if arms are found against the foe he looked about where on a pine were spread the votive horns of a stags branching head at grineus these he throws so just they fly that the sharp antlers stuck in either eye breathless and blind he fell with blood besmeared his eye balls beaten out hung dangling on his beard fierce rhaetus from the hearth a burning brand selects and whirling waves till from his hand the fire took flame then dashed it from the right on fair charaxus temples near the sight the whistling pest came on and pierced the bone and caught the yellow hair that shriveld while it shone caught like dry stubble fired or like seerwood yet from the wound ensued no purple flood but looked a bubbling mass of frying blood his blazing locks sent forth a crackling sound and hissed like red hot iron within the smithy drowned the wounded warrior shook his flaming hair then what a team of horse could hardly rear he heaves the thresholdstone but could not throw the weight it self forbad the threatened blow which dropping from his lifted arms came down full on cometes head and crushed his crown nor rhaetus then retained his joy but said so by their fellows may our foes be sped then with redoubled strokes he plies his head the burning lever not deludes his pains but drives the battered skull within the brains thus flushed the conqueror with force renewed evagrus dryas corythus pursued first corythus with downy cheeks he slew whose fall when fierce evagrus had in view he cried what palm is from a beardless prey rhaetus prevents what more he had to say and drove within his mouth the fiery death which entered hissing in and choked his breath at dryas next he flew but weary chance no longer would the same success advance for while he whirled in fiery circles round the brand a sharpened stake strong dryas found and in the shoulders joint inflicts the wound the weapon stuck which roaring out with pain he drew nor longer durst the fight maintain but turned his back for fear and fled amain with him fled orneus with like dread possessed thaumas and medon wounded in the breast and mermcros in the late race renowned now limping ran and tardy with his wound pholus and melaneus from fight withdrew and abas maimed who boars encountering slew and augur astylos whose art in vain from fight dissuaded the fourfooted train now beat the hoof with nessus on the plain but to his fellow cried be safely slow thy death deferred is due to great alcides bow mean time strong dryas urged his chance so well that lycidas areos imbreus fell all one by one and fighting face to face crenaeus fled to fall with more disgrace for fearful while he looked behind he bore betwixt his nose and front the blow before amid

still obeyed the bent while thus he stood perithous dart drove on and nailed him to the wood lycus and chromys fell by him oppressed helops and dictys added to the rest a nobler palm helops through either ear transfixed received the penetrating spear this dictys saw and seized with sudden fright leapt headlong from the hill of steepy height and crushed an ash beneath that could not bear his weight the shattered tree receives his fall and strikes within his fullblown paunch the sharpened spikes strong aphareus had heaved a mighty stone the fragment of a rock and would have thrown but theseus with a club of hardened oak the cubitbone of the bold centaur broke and left him maimed nor seconded the stroke then leapt on tall bianors back who bore no mortal burden but his own before

under foot his shield defends his head his other hand the lance protends even while he lay extended on the dust he sped the centaur with one single thrust two more his lance before transfixed from far and two his sword had slain in closer war to these was added dorylas who spread a bulls two goring horns around his head with these he pushed in blood already died him fearless i approached and thus defied now monster now by proof it shall appear whether thy horns are sharper or my spear at this i threw for want of other ward he lifted up his hand his front to guard his hand it passed and fixed it to his brow loud shouts of ours attend the lucky blow him peleus finished with a second wound which through the navel pierced he reeled around and dragged his dangling bowels on the ground trod what he dragged and what he trod he crushed and to his motherearth with empty belly rushed the story of cyllarus and hylonome nor could thy form o cyllarus foreslow thy fate if form to monsters men allow just bloomed thy beard thy beard of golden hue thy locks in golden waves about thy shoulders flew sprightly thy look thy shapes in every part so clean as might instruct the sculptors art as far as man extended where began the beast the beast was equal to the man add but a horses head and neck and he o castor was a courser worthy thee so was his back proportioned for the seat so rose his brawny chest so swiftly moved his feet coalblack his color but like jet it shone his legs and flowing tail were white alone beloved by many maidens of his kind but fair hylonome possessed his mind hylonome for features and for face excelling all the nymphs of double race nor less her blandishments than beauty move at once both loving and confessing love for him she dressed for him with female care she combed and set in curls her auborn hair of roses violets and lillies mixed and sprigs of flowing rosemary betwixt she formed the chaplet that adorned her front in waters of the pagasaean fount and in the streams that from the fountain play she washed her face and bathed her twice a day the scarf of furs that hung below her side was ermin or the panthers spotted pride spoils of no common beast with equal flame they loved their silvan pleasures were the same all day they hunted and when day expired together to some shady cave retired invited to the nuptials both repair and side by side they both engage in war uncertain from what hand a flying dart at cyllarus was sent which pierced his heart the javelin drawn from out the mortal wound he faints with staggring steps and seeks the ground the fair within her arms received his fall and strove his wandering spirits to recall and while her hand the streaming blood opposed joined face to face his lips with hers she closed stifled with kisses a sweet death he dies she fills the fields with undistinguished cries at least her words were in her clamor drowned for my stunned ears received no vocal sound in madness of her grief she seized the dart newdrawn and reeking from her lovers heart to her bare bosom the sharp point applied and wounded fell and falling by his side embraced him in her arms and thus embracing died even still methinks i see phaeocomes strange was his habit and as odd his dress six lions hides with thongs together fast his upper part defended to his waist and where man ended the continued vest spread on his back the houss and trappings of a beast a stump too heavy for a team to draw it seems a fable though the fact i saw he threw at pholon the descending blow divides the skull and cleaves his head in two the brains from nose and mouth and either ear came issuing out as through a colendar the curdled milk or from the press the whey driven down by weights above is drained away but him while stooping down to spoil the slain pierced through the paunch i tumbled on the plain then chthonyus and teleboas i slew a fork the former armed a dart his fellow threw the javelin wounded me behold the scar then was my time to seek the trojan war then i was hectors match in open field but he was then unborn at least a child now i am nothing i forbear to tell by periphantas how pyretus fell the centaur by the knight nor will i stay on amphyx or what deaths he dealt that day what honor with a pointless lance he won stuck in the front of a fourfooted man what fame young macareus obtained in fight or dwell on nessus now returned from flight how prophet mopsus not alone divined whose valor equaled his foreseeing mind caeneus transformed to an eagle already caeneus with his conquering hand had slaughtered five the boldest of their band pyrachmus helymus antimachus bromus the brave and stronger stiphelus their names i numbered and remember well no trace remaining by what wounds they fell latreus the bulkiest of the double race whom the spoiled arms of slain halesus grace in years retaining still his youthful might though his black hairs were interspersed with white betwixt thimbattled ranks began to prance proud of his helm and macedonian lance and rode the ring around that either host might hear him while he made this empty boast and from a strumpet shall we suffer shame for caenis still not caeneus is thy name and still the native softness of thy kind prevails and leaves the woman in thy mind remember what thou were what price was paid to change thy sex to make thee not a maid and but a man in show go card and spin and leave the business of the war to men while thus the boaster exercised his pride the fatal spear of caeneus reached his side just in the mixture of the kinds it ran betwixt the nether beast and upper man the monster mad with rage and stung with smart his lance directed at the heros heart it struck but bounded from his hardened breast like hail from tiles which the safe house invest nor seemed the stroke with more effect to come than a small pebble falling on a drum he next his fauchion tried in closer fight but the keen fauchion had no power to bite he thrust the blunted point returned again since downright blows he cried and thrusts are vain i will prove his side in strong embraces held he proved his side his side the sword repelled his hollow belly echoed to the stroke untouched his body as a solid rock aimed at his neck at last the blade in shivers broke thimpassive knight stood idle to deride his rage and offered often his naked side at length now monster in thy turn he cried try thou the strength of caeneus at the word he thrust and in his shoulder plunged the sword then writhed his hand and as he drove it down deep in his breast made many wounds in one the centaurs saw enraged thunhopd success and rushing on in crowds together press at him and him alone their darts they threw repulsed they from his fated body flew amazed they stood till monychus began o shame a nation conquered by a man a womanman yet more a man is he than all our race and what he was are we now what avail our nerves the united force of two the strongest creatures man and horse nor goddessborn nor of ixions seed we seem a lover built for junos bed mastered by this half man whole mountains throw with woods at once and bury him below this only way remains nor need we doubt to choke the soul within though not to force it out heap weights instead of wounds he chanced to see where southern storms had rooted up a tree this raised from earth against the foe he threw the example shown his fellowbrutes pursue with forestloads the warrior they invade othrys and pelion soon were void of shade and spreading groves were naked mountains made pressed with the burden caeneus pants for breath and on his shoulders bears the wooden death to heave thintolerable weight he tries at length it rose above his mouth and eyes yet still he heaves and struggling with despair shakes all aside and gains a gulp of air a short relief which but prolongs his pain he faints by fits and then respires again at last the burden only nods above as when an earthquake stirs the idaean grove doubtful his death he suffocated seemed to most but otherwise our mopsus deemed who said he saw a yellow bird arise from out the pile and cleave the liquid skies i saw it too with golden feathers bright nor ever before beheld so strange a sight whom mopsus viewing as it soared around our troop and heard the pinions rattling sound all hail he cried thy countrys grace and love once first of men below now first of birds above its author to the story gave belief for us our courage was increased by grief ashamed to see a single man pursued with odds to sink beneath a multitude we pushed the foe and forced to shameful flight part fell and part escaped by favor of the night the fate of periclymenos this tale by nestor told did much displease tlepolemus the seed of hercules for often he had heard his father say that he himself was present at the fray and more than shared the glories of the day old chronicle he said among the rest you might have named alcides at the least is he not worth your praise the pylian prince sighed ere he spoke then made this proud defense my former woes in long oblivion drowned i would have lost but you renew the wound better to pass him over than to relate the cause i have your mighty sire to hate his fame has filled the world and reached the sky which oh i wish with truth i could deny we praise not hector though his name we know is great in arms it is hard to praise a foe he your great father levelled to the ground messenias towers nor better fortune found elis and pylos that a neighboring state and this my own both guiltless of their fate to pass the rest twelve wanting one he slew my brethren who their birth from neleus drew all youths of early promise had they lived by him they perished i alone survived the rest were easy conquest but the fate of periclymenos is wondrous to relate to him our common grandsire of the main had given to change his form and changed resume again varied at pleasure every shape he tried and in all beasts alcides still defied vanquished on earth at length he soared above changed to the bird that bears the bolt of jove the newdissembled eagle now endud with beak and pounces hercules pursued and cuffd his manly cheeks and tore his face then safe retired and tourd in empty space alcides bore not long his flying foe but bending his inevitable bow reached him in air suspended as he stood and in his pinion fixed the feathered wood light was the wound but in the sinew hung the point and his disabled wing unstrung he wheeled in air and stretched his vans in vain his vans no longer could his flight sustain for while one gathered wind one unsupplyd hung drooping down nor poised his other side he fell the shaft that slightly was impressed now from his heavy fall with weight increased drove through his neck aslant he spurns the ground and the soul issues through the weazons wound now brave commander of the rhodian seas what praise is due from me to hercules silence is all the vengeance i decree for my slain brothers but it is peace with thee thus with a flowing tongue old nestor spoke then to full bowls each other they provoke at length with weariness and wine oppressed they rise from table and withdraw to rest the death of achilles the sire of cygnus monarch of the main mean time laments his son in battle slain and vows the victors death nor vows in vain for nine long years the smothered pain he bore  achilles was not ripe for fate before then when he saw the promised hour was near he thus bespoke the god that guides the year immortal offspring of my brother jove my brightest nephew and whom best i love whose hands were joined with mine to raise the wall of tottring troy now nodding to her fall do thou not mourn our power employed in vain and the defenders of our city slain to pass the rest could noble hector lie unpitied dragged around his native troy and yet the murderer lives himself by far a greater plague than all the wasteful war he lives the proud pelides lives to boast our town destroyed our common labor lost o could i meet him but i wish too late to prove my trident is not in his fate but let him try for that is allowed thy dart and pierce his only penetrable part apollo bows to the superior throne and to his uncles anger adds his own then in a cloud involved he takes his flight where greeks and trojans mixed in mortal fight and found out paris lurking where he stood and stained his arrows with plebeian blood phoebus to him alone the god confessed then to the recreant knight he thus addressed do thou not blush to spend thy shafts in vain on a degenerate and ignoble train if fame or better vengeance by thy care there aim and with one arrow end the war he said and showed from far the blazing shield and sword which but achilles none could wield and how he moved a god and mowed the standing field the deity himself directs aright the envenomed shaft and wings the fatal flight thus fell the foremost of the grecian name and he the base adultrer boasts the fame a spectacle to glad the trojan train and please old priam after hector slain if by a female hand he had foreseen he was to die his wish had rather been the lance and double ax of the fair warrior queen and now the terror of the trojan field the grecian honor ornament and shield high on a pile the unconquered chief is placed the god that armed him first consumed at last of all the mighty man the small remains a little urn and scarcely filled contains yet great in homer still achilles lives and equal to himself himself survives his buckler owns its former lord and brings new cause of strife betwixt contending kings who worthiest after him his sword to wield or wear his armor or sustain his shield even diomede sat mute with downcast eyes conscious of wanted worth to win the prize nor menelaus presumed these arms to claim nor he the king of men a greater name two rivals only rose laertes son and the vast bulk of ajax telamon the king who cherished each with equal love and from himself all envy would remove left both to be determined by the laws and to the grecian chiefs transferred the cause the end of the twelfth book to the honorable mrs margaret pelha e kirkall sc  ovids metamorphoses book xiii translated by mr dryden and others the speeches of ajax and ulysses by mr dryden the chiefs were set the soldiers crowned the field to these the master of the sevenfold shield upstarted fierce and kindled with disdain eager to speak unable to contain his boiling rage he rolled his eyes around the shore and grecian galleys halld aground then stretching out his hands o jove he cried must then our cause before the fleet be tried and dares ulysses for the prize contend in sight of what he durst not once defend but basely fled that memorable day when i from hectors hands redeemed the flaming prey so much it is safer at the noisie bar with words to flourish than engage in war by different methods we maintain our right nor am i made to talk nor he to fight in bloody fields i labor to be great his arms are a smooth tongue and soft deceit nor need i speak my deeds for those you see the sun and day are witnesses for me let him who fights unseen relate his own and vouch the silent stars and conscious moon great is the prize demanded i confess but such an abject rival makes it less that gift those honors he but hoped to gain can leave no room for ajax to be vain losing he wins because his name will be ennobled by defeat who durst contend with me were my known valor questioned yet my blood without that plea would make my title good my sire was telamon whose arms employed with hercules these trojan walls destroyed and who before with jason sent from greece in the first ship brought home the golden fleece great telamon from aeacus derives his birth the inquisitor of guilty lives in shades below where sisyphus whose son this thief is thought rouls up the restless heavy stone just aeacus the king of gods above begot thus ajax is the third from jove nor should i seek advantage from my line unless  achilles it were mixed with thine as next of kin achilles arms i claim this fellow would ingraft a foreign name upon our stock and the sisyphian seed by fraud and theft asserts his fathers breed then must i lose these arms because i came to fight uncalled a voluntary name nor shunned the cause but offered you my aid while he long lurking was to war betrayed forced to the field he came but in the rear and feigned distraction to conceal his fear till one more cunning caught him in the snare ill for himself and dragged him into war now let a heros arms a coward vest and he who shunned all honors gain the best and let me stand excluded from my right robbed of my kinsmans arms who first appeared in fight better for us at home had he remained had it been true the madness which he feigned or so believed the less had been our shame the less his counseled crime which brands the grecian name nor philoctetes had been left enclosed in a bare isle to wants and pains exposed where to the rocks with solitary groans his sufferings and our baseness he bemoans and wishes so may heaven his wish fulfill the due reward to him who caused his ill now he with us to troys destruction sworn our brother of the war by whom are born alcides arrows pent in narrow bounds with cold and hunger pinched and pained with wounds to find him food and clothing must employ against the birds the shafts due to the fate of troy yet still he lives and lives from treason free because he left ulysses company poor palamede might wish so void of aid rather to have been left than so to death betrayed the coward bore the man immortal spite who shamed him out of madness into fight nor daring otherwise to vent his hate accused him first of treason to the state and then for proof produced the golden store himself had hidden in his tent before thus of two champions he deprived our host by exile one and one by treason lost thus fights ulysses thus his fame extends a formidable man but to his friends great for what greatness is in words and sound even faithful nestor less in both is found but that he might without a rival reign he left this faithful nestor on the plain forsook his friend even at his utmost need who tired and tardy with his wounded steed cried out for aid and called him by his name but cowardice has neither ears nor shame thus fled the good old man bereft of aid and for as much as lay in him betrayed that this is not a fable forged by me like one of his an ulyssean lie i vouch even diomede who though his friend cannot that act excuse much less defend he called him back aloud and taxed his fear and sure enough he heard but durst not hear the gods with equal eyes on mortals look he justly was forsaken who forsook wanted that succor he refused to lend found every fellow such another friend no wonder if he roared that all might hear his elocution was increased by fear i heard i ran i found him out of breath pale trembling and half dead with fear of death though he had judged himself by his own laws and stood condemned i helped the common cause with my broad buckler hid him from the foe even the shield trembled as he lay below and from impending fate the coward freed good heaven forgive me for so bad a deed if still he will persist and urge the strife first let him give me back his forfeit life let him return to that opprobrious field again creep under my protecting shield let him lie wounded let the foe be near and let his quivering heart confess his fear there put him in the very jaws of fate and let him plead his cause in that estate and yet when snatched from death when from below my lifted shield i loosed and let him go good heavens how light he rose with what a bound he sprung from earth forgetful of his wound how fresh how eager then his feet to ply who had not strength to stand had speed to fly hector came on and brought the gods along fear seized alike the feeble and the strong each greek was an ulysses such a dread the approach and even the sound of hector bred him fleshed with slaughter and with conquest crowned i met and overturnd him to the ground when after matchless as he deemed in might he challenged all our host to single fight all eyes were fixed on me the lots were thrown but for your champion i was wished alone your vows were heard we fought and neither yield yet i returned unvanquishd from the field with jove to friend the insulting trojan came and menaced us with force our fleet with flame was it the strength of this tonguevaliant lord in that black hour that saved you from the sword or was my breast exposed alone to brave a thousand swords a thousand ships to save the hopes of your return and can you yield for a saved fleet less than a single shield think it no boast o grecians if i deem these arms want ajax more than ajax them or i with them an equal honor share they honored to be worn and i to wear will he compare my courage with his slight as well he may compare the day with night night is indeed the province of his reign yet all his dark exploits no more contain than a spy taken and a sleeper slain a priest made prisoner pallas made a prey but none of all these actions done by day nor ought of these was done and diomede away if on such petty merits you confer so vast a prize let each his portion share make a just dividend and if not all the greater part to diomede will fall but why for ithacus such arms as those who naked and by night invades his foes the glittering helm by moonlight will proclaim the latent robber and prevent his game nor could he hold his tottering head upright beneath that morion or sustain the weight nor that right arm could toss the beamy lance much less the left that ampler shield advance ponderous with precious weight and rough with cost of the round world in rising gold embossed that orb would ill become his hand to wield and look as for the gold he stole the shield which should your error on the wretch bestow it would not frighten but allure the foe why asks he what avails him not in fight and would but cumber and retard his flight in which his only excellence is placed you give him death that intercept his haste add that his own is yet a maidenshield nor the least dint has suffered in the field guiltless of fight mine battered hewed and bored worn out of service must forsake his lord what farther need of words our right to scan my arguments are deeds let action speak the man since from a champions arms the strife arose so cast the glorious prize amid the foes then send us to redeem both arms and shield and let him wear who wins em in the field he said a murmur from a multitude or somewhat like a stifled shout ensued till from his seat arose laertes son looked down a while and paused ere he begun then to the expecting audience raised his look and not without prepared attention spoke soft was his tone and sober was his face action his words and words his action grace if heaven my lords had heard our common prayer these arms had caused no quarrel for an heir still great achilles had his own possessed and we with great achilles had been blessed but since hard fate and heavens severe decree have ravished him away from you and me at this he sighed and wiped his eyes and drew or seemed to draw some drops of kindly dew who better can succeed achilles lost than he who gave achilles to your host this only i request that neither he may gain by being what he seems to be a stupid thing nor i may lose the prize by having sense which heaven to him denies since great or small the talent i enjoyed was ever in the common cause employed nor let my wit and wonted eloquence which often has been used in your defense and in my own this only time be brought to bear against my self and deemed a fault make not a crime where nature made it none for every man may freely use his own the deeds of long descended ancestors are but by grace of imputation ours theirs in effect but since he draws his line from jove and seems to plead a right divine from jove like him i claim my pedigree and am descended in the same degree my sire laertes was arcesius heir arcesius was the son of jupiter no parricide no banished man is known in all my line let him excuse his own hermes ennobles too my mothers side by both my parents to the gods allied but not because that on the female part my blood is better dare i claim desert or that my sire from parricide is free but judge by merit betwixt him and me the prize be to the best provided yet that ajax for a while his kin forget and his great sire and greater uncles name to fortify by them his feeble claim be kindred and relation laid aside and honors cause by laws of honor tried for if he plead proximity of blood that empty title is with ease withstood peleus the heros sire more nigh than he and pyrrhus his undoubted progeny inherit first these trophies of the field to scyros or to phthia send the shield and teucer has an uncles right yet he waves his pretensions nor contends with me then since the cause on pure desert is placed whence shall i take my rise what reckon last i not presume on every act to dwell but take these few in order as they fell thetis who knew the fates applied her care to keep achilles in disguise from war and till the threatening influence were past a womans habit on the hero cast all eyes were cozened by the borrowed vest and ajax never wiser than the rest found no pelides there at length i came with proffered wares to this pretended dame she not discovered by her mien or voice betrayed her manhood by her manly choice and while on female toys her fellows look grasped in her warlike hand a javelin shook whom by this act revealed i thus bespoke o goddessborn resist not heavens decree the fall of ilium is reserved for thee then seized him and produced in open light sent blushing to the field the fatal knight mine then are all his actions of the war great telephus was conquered by my spear and after cured to me the thebans owe lesbos and tenedos their overthrow syros and cylla not on all to dwell by me lyrnesus and strong chrysa fell and since i sent the man who hector slew to me the noble hectors death is due those arms i put into his living hand those arms pelides dead i now demand when greece was injured in the spartan prince and met at aulis to avenge the offense twas a dead calm or adverse blasts that reigned and in the port the windbound fleet detained bad signs were seen and oracles severe were daily thundered in our genrals ear that by his daughters blood we must appease dianas kindled wrath and free the seas affection interest fame his heart assailed but soon the father over the king prevailed bold on himself he took the pious crime as angry with the gods as they with him no subject could sustain their sovreigns look till this hard enterprise i undertook i only durst the imperial power control and undermined the parent in his soul forced him texert the king for common good and pay our ransom with his daughters blood never was cause more difficult to plead than where the judge against himself decreed yet this i won by dint of argument the wrongs his injured brother underwent and his own office shamed him to consent twas harder yet to move the mothers mind and to this heavy task was i designed reasons against her love i knew were vain i circumvented whom i could not gain had ajax been employed our slackened sails had still at aulis waited happy gales arrived at troy your choice was fixed on me a fearless envoy fit for a bold embassy secure i entered through the hostile court glittering with steel and crowded with resort there in the midst of arms i plead our cause urge the foul rape and violated laws accuse the foes as authors of the strife reproach the ravisher demand the wife priam antenor and the wiser few i moved but paris and his lawless crew scarce held their hands and lifted swords but stood in act to quench their impious thirst of blood this menclaus knows exposed to share with me the rough preludium of the war endless it were to tell what i have done in arms or council since the siege begun the first encounters past the foe repelled they skulkd within the town we kept the field war seemed asleep for nine long years at length both sides resolved to push we tried our strength now what did ajax while our arms took breath versed only in the gross mechanic trade of death if you require my deeds with ambushd arms i trappd the foe or tired with false alarms secured the ships drew lines along the plain the fainting cheered chastisd the rebeltrain provided forage our spent arms renewed employed at home or sent abroad the common cause pursued the king deluded in a dream by jove despaired to take the town and ordered to remove what subject durst arraign the power supreme producing jove to justify his dream ajax might wish the soldiers to retain from shameful flight but wishes were in vain as wanting of effect had been his words such as of course his thundering tongue affords but did this boaster threaten did he pray or by his own example urge their stay none none of these but ran himself away i saw him run and was ashamed to see who plied his feet so fast to get aboard as he then speeding through the place i made a stand and loudly cried o base degenerate band to leave a town already in your hand after so long expense of blood for fame to bring home nothing but perpetual shame these words or what i have forgotten since for grief inspired me then with eloquence reduced their minds they leave the crowded port and to their late forsaken camp resort dismayed the council met this man was there but mute and not recovered of his fear thersites taxed the king and loudly railed but his wide opening mouth with blows i sealed then rising i excite their souls to fame and kindle sleeping virtue into flame from thence whatever he performed in fight is justly mine who drew him back from flight which of the grecian chiefs consorts with thee but diomede desires my company and still communicates his praise with me as guided by a god secure he goes armed with my fellowship amid the foes and sure no little merit i may boast whom such a man selects from such an host unforced by lots i went without affright to dare with him the dangers of the night on the same errand sent we met the spy of hector doubletongud and used to lie him i dispatched but not till undermined i drew him first to tell what treacherous troy designed my task performed with praise i had retired but not content with this to greater praise aspired invaded rhesus and his thracian crew and him and his in their own strength i slew returned a victor all my vows complete with the kings chariot in his royal seat refuse me now his arms whose fiery steeds were promised to the spy for his nocturnal deeds and let dull ajax bear away my right when all his days outbalance this one night nor fought i darkling still the sun beheld with slaughtered lycians when i strewn the field you saw and counted as i passed along alastor chromius ceranos the strong alcander prytanis and halius noemon charopes and ennomus coon chersidamas and five beside men of obscure descent but courage tried all these this hand laid breathless on the ground nor want i proofs of many a manly wound all honest all before believe not me words may deceive but credit what you see at this he barred his breast and showed his scars as of a furrowed field well ploughd with wars nor is this part unexercisd said he that gyantbulk of his from wounds is free safe in his shield he fears no foe to try and better manages his blood than i but this avails me not our boaster strove not with our foes alone but partial jove to save the fleet this i confess is true nor will i take from any man his due but thus assuming all he robs from you some part of honor to your share will fall he did the best indeed but did not all patroclus in achilles arms and thought the chief he seemed with equal ardour fought preserved the fleet repelled the raging fire and forced the fearful trojans to retire but ajax boasts that he was only thought a match for hector who the combat sought sure he forgets the king the chiefs and me all were as eager for the fight as he he but the ninth and not by public voice or ours preferred was only fortunes choice they fought nor can our hero boast the event for hector from the field unwounded went why am i forced to name that fatal day that snatched the prop and pride of greece away i saw pelides sink with pious grief and ran in vain alas to his relief for the brave soul was fled full of my friend i rushed amid the war his relics to defend nor ceased my toil till i redeemed the prey and loaded with achilles marched away those arms which on these shoulders then i bore it is just you to these shoulders should restore you see i want not nerves who could sustain the ponderous ruins of so great a man or if in others equal force you find none is endud with a more grateful mind did thetis then ambitious in her care these arms thus labored for her son prepare that ajax after him the heavenly gift should wear for that dull soul to stare with stupid eyes on the learned unintelligible prize what are to him the sculptures of the shield heavens planets earth and oceans watery field the pleiads hyads less and greater bear undippd in seas orions angry star two differing cities engraved on either hand would he wear arms he cannot understand beside what wise objections he prepares against my late accession to the wars does not the fool perceive his argument is with more force against achilles bent for if dissembling be so great a crime the fault is common and the same in him and if he taxes both of long delay my guilt is less who sooner came away his pious mother anxious for his life detained her son and me my pious wife to them the blossoms of our youth were due our riper manhood we reserved for you but grant me guilty it is not much my care when with so great a man my guilt i share my wit to war the matchless hero brought but by this fool i never had been caught nor need i wonder that on me he threw such foul aspersions when he spares not you if palamede unjustly fell by me your honor suffered in the unjust decree i but accused you doomed and yet he died convinced of treason and was fairly tried you heard not he was false your eyes beheld the traitor manifest the bribe revealed that philoctetes is on lemnos left wounded forlorn of human aid bereft is not my crime or not my crime alone defend your justice for the facts your own it is true the advice was mine that staying there he might his weary limbs with rest repair from a long voyage free and from a longer war he took the counsel and he lives at least the event declares i counseled for the best though faith is all in ministers of state for who can promise to be fortunate now since his arrows are the fate of troy do not my wit or weak address employ send ajax there with his persuasive sense to mollify the man and draw him thence but xanthus shall run backward ida stand a leafless mountain and the grecian band shall fight for troy if when my counsel fail the wit of heavy ajax can prevail hard philoctetes exercise thy spleen against thy fellows and the king of men curse my devoted head above the rest and wish in arms to meet me breast to breast yet i the dangerous task will undertake and either die my self or bring thee back nor doubt the same success as when before the phrygian prophet to these tents i bore surpised by night and forced him to declare in what was placed the fortune of the war heavens dark decrees and answers to display and how to take the town and where the secret lay yet this i compassed and from troy conveyed the fatal image of their guardianmaid that work was mine for pallas though our friend yet while she was in troy did troy defend now what has ajax done or what designed a noisie nothing and an empty wind if he be what he promises in show why was i sent and why feared he to go our boasting champion thought the task not light to pass the guards commit himself to night not only through a hostile town to pass but scale with steep ascent the sacred place with wandering steps to search the citadel and from the priests their patroness to steal then through surrounding foes to force my way and bear in triumph home the heavenly prey which had i not ajax in vain had held before that monstrous bulk his sevnfold shield that night to conquer troy i might be said when troy was liable to conquest made why pointst thou to my partner of the war tydides had indeed a worthy share in all my toil and praise but when thy might our ships protected did thou singly fight all joined and thou of many were but one i asked no friend nor had but him alone who had he not been well assured that art and conduct were of war the better part and more availed than strength my valiant friend had urged a better right than ajax can pretend as good at least eurypylus may claim and the more moderate ajax of the name the cretan king and his brave charioteer and menelaus bold with sword and spear all these had been my rivals in the shield and yet all these to my pretensions yield thy boisterous hands are then of use when i with this directing head those hands apply brawn without brain is thine my prudent care foresees provides administers the war thy province is to fight but when shall be the time to fight the king consults with me no dram of judgment with thy force is joined thy body is of profit and my mind by how much more the ship her safety owes to him who steers than him that only rows by how much more the captain merits praise than he who fights and fighting but obeys by so much greater is my worth than thine who can but execute what i design what gainst thou brutal man if i confess thy strength superior when thy wit is less mind is the man i claim my whole desert from the minds vigor and the immortal part but you o grecian chiefs reward my care be grateful to your watchman of the war for all my labors in so long a space sure i may plead a title to your grace enter the town i then unbarrd the gates when i removed their tutelary fates by all our common hopes if hopes they be which i have now reduced to certainty by falling troy by yonder tottering towers and by their taken gods which now are ours or if there yet a farther task remains to be performed by prudence or by pains if yet some desperate action rests behind that asks high conduct and a dauntless mind if ought be wanting to the trojan doom which none but i can manage and overcome award those arms i ask by your decree or give to this what you refuse to me he ceased and ceasing with respect he bowed and with his hand at once the fatal statue showed heaven air and ocean rung with loud applause and by the general vote he gained his cause thus conduct won the prize when courage failed and eloquence over brutal force prevailed the death of ajax he who could often and alone withstand the foe the fire and joves own partial hand now cannot his unmasterd grief sustain but yields to rage to madness and disdain then snatching out his fauchion thou said he art mine ulysses lays no claim to thee o often tried and ever trusty sword now do thy last kind office to thy lord it is ajax who requests thy aid to show none but himself himself could overthrow he said and with so good a will to die did to his breast the fatal point apply it found his heart a way till then unknown where never weapon entered but his own no hands could force it thence so fixed it stood till out it rushed expelled by streams of spouting blood the fruitful blood produced a flower which grew on a green stem and of a purple hue like his whom unaware apollo slew inscribed in both the letters are the same but those express the grief and these the name the story of polyxena and hecuba by mr temple stanyan the victor with full sails for lemnos stood once stained by matrons with their husbands blood thence great alcides fatal shafts to bear assigned to philoctetes secret care these with their guardian to the greeks conveyed their ten years toil with wished success repaid with troy old priam falls his queen survives till all her woes complete transformed she grieves in borrowed sounds nor with an human face barking tremendous over the plains of thrace still iliums flames their pointed columns raise and the red hellespont reflects the blaze shed on joves altar are the poor remains of blood which trickld from old priams veins cassandra lifts her hands to heaven in vain dragged by her sacred hair the trembling train of matrons to their burning temples fly there to their gods for kind protection cry and to their statues cling till forced away the victor greeks bear off the invidious prey from those high towers astyanax is thrown whence he was wont with pleasure to look down when often his mother with a fond delight pointed to view his fathers rage in fight to win renown and guard his countrys right the winds now call to sea brisk northern gales sing in the shrowds and court the spreading sails farewell dear troy the captive matrons cry yes we must leave our longlovd native sky then prostrate on the shore they kiss the sand and quit the smoking ruins of the land last hecuba on board sad sight appears found weeping over her childrens sepulchers dragged by ulysses from her slaughtered sons whilst yet she graspt their tombs and kissed their mouldring bones yet hectors ashes from his urn she bore and in her bosom the sad relic wore then scattered on his tomb her hoary hairs a poor oblation mingled with her tears opposed to ilium lie the thracian plains where polymestor safe in plenty reigns king priam to his care commits his son young polydore the chance of war to shun a wise precaution had not gold consigned for the childs use debauched the tyrants mind when sinking troy to its last period drew with impious hands his royal charge he slew then in the sea the lifeless coarse is thrown as with the body he the guilt could drown the greeks now riding on the thracian shore till kinder gales invite their vessels moor here the wideopning earth to sudden view disclosed achilles great as when he drew the vital air but fierce with proud disdain as when he sought briseis to regain when stern debate and rash injurious strife unsheathed his sword to reach atrides life and will ye go he said is then the name of the once great achilles lost to fame yet stay ungrateful greeks nor let me sue in vain for honors to my manes due for this just end polyxena i doom with victimrites to grace my slighted tomb the phantom spoke the ready greeks obeyed and to the tomb led the devoted maid snatched from her mother who with pious care cherished this last relief of her despair superior to her sex the fearless maid approached the altar and around surveyed the cruel rites and consecrated knife which pyrrhus pointed at her guiltless life then as with stern amaze intent he stood  now strike she said now spill my generous blood  deep in my breast or throat your dagger sheath  whilst thus i stand prepared to meet my death  for life on terms of slavery i despise  yet sure no god approves this sacrifice  o could i but conceal this dire event  from my sad mother i should dye content  yet should she not with tears my death deplore  since her own wretched life demands them more  but let not the rude touch of man pollute  a virginvictim it is a modest suit  it best will please whoever demands my blood  that i untainted reach the stygian flood  yet let one short last dying prayer be heard  to priams daughter pay this last regard  it is priams daughter not a captive sues  do not the rites of sepulture refuse  to my afflicted mother i implore  free without ransom my dead corpse restore  nor barter me for gain when i am cold  but be her tears the price if i am sold  time was she could have ransomed me with gold thus as she prayed one common shower of tears burst forth and streamed from every eye but hers even the priest wept and with a rude remorse plunged in her heart the steels resistless force her slackened limbs sunk gently to the ground dauntless her looks unaltered by the wound and as she fell she strove with decent pride to guard what suits a virgins care to hide the trojan matrons the pale corpse receive and the whole slaughtered race of priam grieve sad they recount the long disastrous tale then with fresh tears thee royal maid bewail thy widowed mother too who flourished late the royal pride of asias happier state a captive lot now to ulysses born whom yet the victor would reject with scorn were she not hectors mother hectors fame scarce can a master for his mother claim with strict embrace the lifeless coarse she viewed and her fresh grief that flood of tears renewed with which she lately mourned so many dead tears for her country sons and husband shed with the thick gushing stream she bathed the wound kissed her pale lips then weltring on the ground with wonted rage her frantic bosom tore sweeping her hair amidst the clotted gore whilst her sad accents thus her loss deplore  behold a mothers last dear pledge of woe  yes it is the last i have to suffer now  thou my polyxena my ills must crown  already in thy fate i feel my own  it is thus least happily of my numerous seed  one should unslaughterd fall even thou must bleed  and yet i hoped thy sex had been thy guard  but neither has thy tender sex been spared the same achilles by whose deadly hate  thy brothers fell urged thy untimely fate  the same achilles whose destructive rage  laid waste my realms has robbed my childless age  when paris shafts with phoebus certain aid  at length had pierced this dreaded chief i said  secure of future ills he can no more  but see he still pursues me as before  with rage rekindled his dead ashes burn  and his yet murdering ghost my wretched house must mourn  this tyrants lust of slaughter i have fed  with large supplies from my too fruitful bed  troys towers lie waste and the wide ruin ends  the public woe but me fresh woe attends  troy still survives to me to none but me  and from its ills i never must be free  i who so late had power and wealth and ease  blessed with my husband and a large increase  must now in poverty and exile mourn  even from the tombs of my dead offspring torn  given to penelope who proud of spoil  allots me to the looms ungrateful toil  points to her dames and cries with scorning mien  see hectors mother and great priams queen  and thou my child sole hope of all that is lost  thou now art slain to sooth this hostile ghost  yes my child falls an offering to my foe  them what am i who still survive this woe  say cruel gods for what new scenes of death  must a poor aged wretch prolong this hated breath  troy fallen to whom could priam happy seem  yet was he so and happy must i deem his death for o my child he saw not thine  when he his life did with his troy resign  yet sure due obsequies thy tomb might grace  and thou shall sleep amidst thy kingly race  alas my child such fortune does not wait  our suffering house in this abandoned state  a foreign grave and thy poor mothers tears  are all the honors that attend thy hearse  all now is lost  yet no one comfort more  of life remains my muchloved polydore  my youngest hope here on this coast he lives  nursed by the guardianking he still survives  then let me hasten to the cleansing flood  and wash away these stains of guiltless blood strait to the shore her feeble steps repair with limping pace and torn dishevelled hair silvered with age  give me an urn she cried  to bear back water from this swelling tide when on the banks her son in ghastly hue transfixed with thracian arrows strikes her view the matrons shrieked her bigswoln grief surpast the power of utterance she stood aghast she had nor speech nor tears to give relief excess of woe suppressed the rising grief lifeless as stone on earth she fixed her eyes and then looked up to heaven with wild surprise now she contemplates over with sad delight her sons pale visage then her aching sight dwells on his wounds she varys thus by turns till with collected rage at length she burns wild as the motherlion when among the haunts of prey she seeks her ravished young swift flies the ravisher she marks his trace and by the print directs her anxious chase so hecuba with mingled grief and rage pursues the king regardless of her age she greets the murderer with dissembled joy of secret treasure hoarded for her boy the specious tale the unwary king betrayed fired with the hopes of prey  give quick he said  with soft enticing speech the promised store  whatever you give you give to polydore  your son by the immortal gods i swear  shall this with all your former bounty share she stands attentive to his soothing lies and darts avenging horror from her eyes then full resentment fires her boiling blood she springs upon him midst the captive crowd her thirst of vengeance want of strength supplies fastens her forky fingers in his eyes tears out the rooted balls her rage pursues and in the hollow orbs her hand imbrews the thracians fired at this inhuman scene with darts and stones assail the frantic queen she snarls and growls nor in an human tone then bites impatient at the bounding stone extends her jaws as she her voice would raise to keen invectives in her wonted phrase but barks and thence the yelping brute betrays still a sad monument the place remains and from this monstrous change its name obtains where she in long remembrance of her ills with plaintive howlings the wide desert fills greeks trojans friends and foes and gods above her numerous wrongs to just compassion move even junos self forgets her ancient hate and owns she had deserved a milder fate the funeral of memnon by mr croxall yet bright aurora partial as she was to troy and those that loved the trojan cause nor troy nor hecuba can now bemoan but weeps a sad misfortune more her own her offspring memnon by achilles slain she saw extended on the phrygian plain she saw and strait the purple beams that grace the rosy morning vanished from her face a deadly pale her wonted bloom invades and veils the lowering skies with mournful shades but when his limbs upon the pile were laid the last kind duty that by friends is paid his mother to the skies directs her flight nor could sustain to view the doleful sight but frantic with her loose neglected hair hastens to jove and falls a suppliant there o king of heaven o father of the skies the weeping goddess passionately cries though i the meanest of immortals am and fewest temples celebrate my fame yet still a goddess i presume to come within the verge of your ethereal dome yet still may plead some merit if my light with purple dawn controuls the powers of night if from a female hand that virtue springs which to the gods and men such pleasure brings yet i nor honors seek nor rites divine nor for more altars or more fanes repine oh that such trifles were the only cause from whence auroras mind its anguish draws for memnon lost my dearest only child with weightier grief my heavy heart is filled my warrior son that lived but half his time nipt in the bud and blasted in his prime who for his uncle early took the field and by achilles fatal spear was killed to whom but jove should i for succor come for jove alone could fix his cruel doom o sovereign of the gods accept my prayer grant my request and sooth a mothers care on the deceased some solemn boon bestow to expiate the loss and ease my woe jove with a nod complied with her desire around the body flamed the funeral fire the pile decreased that lately seemed so high and sheets of smoke rolled upward to the sky as humid vapors from a marshy bog rise by degrees condensing into fog that intercept the suns enlivening ray and with a cloud infect the cheerful day the sooty ashes wafted by the air whirl round and thicken in a body there then take a form which their own heat and fire with active life and energy inspire its lightness makes it seem to fly and soon it skims on real wings that are its own a real bird it beats the breezy wind mixed with a thousand sisters of the kind that from the same formation newly sprung upborn aloft on plumy pinions hung thrice round the pile advanced the circling throng thrice with their wings a whizzing consort rung in the fourth flight their squadron they divide ranked in two different troops on either side then two and two inspired with martial rage from either troop in equal pairs engage each combatant with beak and pounces pressed in wrathful ire his adversarys breast each falls a victim to preserve the fame of that great hero whence their being came from him their courage and their name they take and as they lived they dye for memnons sake punctual to time with each revolving year in fresh array the champion birds appear again prepared with vengeful minds they come to bleed in honor of the soldiers tomb therefore in others it appeared not strange to grieve for hecubas unhappy change but poor aurora had enough to do with her own loss to mind anothers woe who still in tears her tender nature shows besprinkling all the world with pearly dews the voyage of aeneas by mr catcott troy thus destroyed twas still denied by fate the hopes of troy should perish with the state his sire the son of cytherea bore and housholdgods from burning iliums shore the pious prince a double duty paid each sacred burden through the flames conveyed with young ascanius and this only prize of heaps of wealth he from antandros flies but struck with horror left the thracian shore stained with the blood of murdered polydore the delian isle receives the banished train driven by kind gales and favored by the main here pious anius priest and monarch reigned and either charge with equal care sustained his subjects ruled to phoebus homage paid his god obeying and by those obeyed the priest displays his hospitable gate and shows the riches of his church and state the sacred shrubs which eased latonas pain the palm and olive and the votive fane here grateful flames with fuming incense fed and mingled wine ambrosial odours shed of slaughtered steers the crackling entrails burned and then the strangers to the court returned on beds of tapstry placed aloft they dine with ceres gift and flowing bowls of wine when thus anchises spoke amidst the feast say mitred monarch phoebus chosen priest or ever from troy by cruel fate expelled when first mine eyes these sacred walls beheld a son and twice two daughters crowned thy bliss or errs my memory and i judge amiss the royal prophet shook his hoary head with snowy fillets bound and sighing said thy memory errs not prince thou saw me then the happy father of so large a train behold me now such turns of chance befall the race of man almost bereft of all for ah what comfort can my son bestow what help afford to mitigate my woe while far from hence in andros isle he reigns from him so named and there my place sustains him delius praescience gave the twiceborn god a boon more wondrous on the maids bestowed whatever they touched he gave them to transmute a gift past credit and above their suit to ceres bacchus and minervas fruit how great their value and how rich their use whose only touch such treasures could produce the dire destroyer of the trojan reign fierce agamemnon such a prize to gain a proof we also were designed by fate to feel the tempest that oerturnd your state with force superior and a ruffian crew from these weak arms the helpless virgins drew and sternly bad them use the grant divine to keep the fleet in corn and oil and wine each as they could escaped two strove to gain euboeas isle and two their brothers reign the soldier follows and demands the dames if held by force immediate war proclaims fear conquered nature in their brothers mind and gave them up to punishment assigned forgive the deed nor hectors arm was there nor thine aeneas to maintain the war whose only force upheld your iliums towers for ten long years against the grecian powers prepared to bind their captive arms in bands to heaven they reared their yet unfettered hands help bacchus author of the gift they prayed the gifts great author gave immediate aid if such destruction of their human frame by ways so wondrous may deserve the name nor could i hear nor can i now relate exact the manner of their altered state but this in general of my loss i knew transformed to doves on milky plumes they flew such as on idas mount thy consorts chariot drew with such discourse they entertained the feast then rose from table and withdrew to rest the following morn ere sol was seen to shine the inquiring trojans sought the sacred shrine the mystic power commands them to explore their ancient mother and a kindred shore attending to the sea the generous prince dismissed his guests with rich munificence in old anchises hand a scepter placed a vest and quiver young ascanius graced his sire a cup which from the aonian coast ismenian therses sent his royal host alcon of mile made what therses sent and carved thereon this ample argument a town with sevn distinguished gates was shown which spoke its name and made the city known before it piles and tombs and rising flames the rites of death and quires of mourning dames who barred their breasts and gave their hair to flow the signs of grief and marks of public woe their fountains dried the weeping naiads mourned the trees stood bare with searing cankers burned no herbage clothed the ground a ragged flock of goats halffamishd licked the naked rock of manly courage and with mind serene orions daughters in the town were seen one heaved her chest to meet the lifted knife one plunged the poyniard through the seat of life their countrys victims mourns the rescued state the bodies burns and celebrates their fate to save the failure of the illustrious line from the pale ashes rose of form divine two generous youths these fame coronae calls who join the pomp and mourn their mothers falls these burnished figures formed of antique mold shone on the brass with rising sculpture bold a wreath of gilt acanthus round the brim was rolled nor less expense the trojan gifts expressed a fuming censer for the royal priest a chalice and a crown of princely cost with ruddy gold and sparkling gems embossed now hoisting sail to crete the trojans stood themselves remembering sprung from teucers blood but heaven forbids and pestilential jove from noxious skies the wandering navy drove her hundred cities left from crete they bore and sought the destined land ausonias shore but tossed by storms at either strophas lay till scared by harpies from the faithless bay then passing onward with a prosperous wind left sly ulysses spacious realms behind ambracias state in former ages known the strife of gods the judge transformed to stone they saw for actian phoebus since renowned who caesars arms with naval conquest crowned next passed dodona wont of old to boast her vocal forest and chaonias coast where king molossus sons on wings aspired and saw secure the harmless fuel fired now to phaeacias happy isle they came for fertile orchards known to early fame epirus past they next beheld with joy a second ilium and fictitious troy here trojan helenus the scepter swayed who showed their fate and mystic truths displayed by him confirmed sicilias isle they reached whose sides to sea three promontories stretched pachynos to the stormy south is placed on lilybaeum blows the gentle west peloros cliffs the northern bear survey who rolls above and dreads to touch the sea by this they steer and favored by the tide secure by night in zancles harbor ride here cruel scylla guards the rocky shore and there the waves of loud charybdis roar this sucks and vomits ships and bodies drowned and ravenous dogs the womb of that surround in face a virgin and if ought be true by bards recorded once a virgin too a train of youths in vain desired her bed by seanymphs loved to nymphs of seas she fled the maid to these with female pride displayed their baffled courtship and their love betrayed when galatea thus bespoke the fair but first she sighed while scylla combed her hair you lovely maid a generous race pursues whom safe you may as now you do refuse to me though powerful in a numerous train of sisters sprung from gods who rule the main my native seas could scarce a refuge prove to shun the fury of the cyclops love tears choked her uttrance here the pitying maid with marble fingers wiped them off and said my dearest goddess let thy scylla know for i am faithful whence these sorrows flow the maids entreaties over the nymph prevail who thus to scylla tells the mournful tale the story of acis polyphemus and galatea by mr dryden acis the lovely youth whose loss i mourn from faunus and the nymph symethis born was both his parents pleasure but to me was all that love could make a lover be the gods our minds in mutual bands did join i was his only joy and he was mine now sixteen summers the sweet youth had seen and doubtful down began to shade his chin when polyphemus first disturbed our joy and loved me fiercely as i loved the boy ask not which passion in my soul was highr my last aversion or my first desire nor this the greater was nor that the less both were alike for both were in excess thee venus thee both heaven and earth obey immense thy power and boundless is thy sway the cyclops who defied the aetherial throne and thought no thunder louder than his own the terror of the woods and wilder far than wolves in plains or bears in forests are the inhuman host who made his bloody feasts on mangled members of his butchered guests yet felt the force of love and fierce desire and burnt for me with unrelenting fire forgot his caverns and his woolly care assumed the softness of a lovers air and combed with teeth of rakes his rugged hair now with a crooked scythe his beard he sleeks and mowes the stubborn stubble of his cheeks now in the crystal stream he looks to try his simagres and rowls his glaring eye his cruelty and thirst of blood are lost and ships securely sail along the coast the prophet telemus arrived by chance where aetnas summets to the seas advance who marked the tracts of every bird that flew and sure presages from their flying drew foretold the cyclops that ulysses hand in his broad eye should thrust a flaming brand the giant with a scornful grin replied vain augur thou have falsely prophesied already love his flaming brand has tossed looking on two fair eyes my sight i lost thus warned in vain with stalking pace he strode and stamped the margin of the briny flood with heavy steps and weary sought again the cool retirement of his gloomy den a promontory sharpning by degrees ends in a wedge and overlooks the seas on either side below the water flows this airy walk the giant lover chose here on the midst he sat his flocks unled their shepherd followed and securely fed a pine so burly and of length so vast that sailing ships required it for a mast he wielded for a staff his steps to guide but laid it by his whistle while he tried a hundred reeds of a prodigious growth scarce made a pipe proportioned to his mouth which when he gave it wind the rocks around and watery plains the dreadful hiss resound i heard the ruffianshepherd rudely blow where in a hollow cave i sat below on acis bosom i my head reclined and still preserve the poem in my mind oh lovely galatea whiter far than falling snows and rising lilies are more flowery than the meads as crystal bright erect as alders and of equal height more wanton than a kid more sleek thy skin than orient shells that on the shores are seen than apples fairer when the boughs they lade pleasing as winter suns or summer shade more grateful to the sight than goodly plains and softer to the touch than down of swans or curds new turned and sweeter to the taste than swelling grapes that to the vintage haste more clear than ice or running streams that stray through garden plots but ah more swift than they yet galatea harder to be broke than bullocks unreclaimd to bear the yoke and far more stubborn than the knotted oak like sliding streams impossible to hold like them fallacious like their fountains cold more warping than the willow to decline my warm embrace more brittle than the vine immovable and fixed in thy disdain rough as these rocks and of a harder grain more violent than is the rising flood and the praised peacock is not half so proud fierce as the fire and sharp as thistles are and more outrageous than a motherbear deaf as the billows to the vows i make and more revengeful than a trodden snake in swiftness fleeter than the flying hind or driven tempests or the driving wind all other faults with patience i can bear but swiftness is the vice i only fear yet if you knew me well you would not shun my love but to my wished embraces run would languish in your turn and court my stay and much repent of your unwise delay my palace in the living rock is made by natures hand a spacious pleasing shade which neither heat can pierce nor cold invade my garden filled with fruits you may behold and grapes in clusters imitating gold some blushing bunches of a purple hue and these and those are all reserved for you red strawberries in shades expecting stand proud to be gathered by so white a hand autumnal cornels latter fruit provide and plumbs to tempt you turn their glossy side not those of common kinds but such alone as in phaeacian orchards might have grown nor chestnuts shall be wanting to your food nor gardenfruits nor wildings of the wood the laden boughs for you alone shall bear and yours shall be the product of the year the flocks you see are all my own beside the rest that woods and winding valleys hide and those that folded in the caves abide ask not the numbers of my growing store who knows how many knows he has no more nor will i praise my cattle trust not me but judge your self and pass your own decree behold their swelling dugs the sweepy weight of ewes that sink beneath the milky freight in the warm folds their tender lambkins lie apart from kids that call with human cry new milk in nutbrown bowls is duly served for daily drink the rest for cheese reserved nor are these household dainties all my store the fields and forests will afford us more the deer the hare the goat the salvage boar all sorts of venson and of birds the best a pair of turtles taken from the nest i walked the mountains and two cubs i found whose dam had left em on the naked ground so like that no distinction could be seen so pretty they were presents for a queen and so they shall i took em both away and keep to be companions of your play oh raise fair nymph your beauteous face above the waves nor scorn my presents and my love come galatea come and view my face i late beheld it in the watery glass and found it lovelier than i feared it was survey my towering stature and my size not jove the jove you dream that rules the skies bears such a bulk or is so largely spread my locks the plenteous harvest of my head hang over my manly face and dangling down as with a shady grove my shoulders crown nor think because my limbs and body bear a thickset underwood of bristling hair my shape deformed what fouler sight can be than the bald branches of a leafless tree foul is the steed without a flowing mane and birds without their feathers and their train wool decks the sheep and man receives a grace from bushy limbs and from a bearded face my forehead with a single eye is filled round as a ball and ample as a shield the glorious lamp of heaven the radiant sun is natures eye and she is content with one add that my father sways your seas and i like you am of the watery family i make you his in making you my own you i adore and kneel to you alone jove with his fabled thunder i despise and only fear the lightning of your eyes frown not fair nymph yet i could bear to be disdained if others were disdained with me but to repulse the cyclops and prefer the love of acis heavens i cannot bear but let the stripling please himself nay more please you though that is the thing i most abhor the boy shall find if ever we cope in fight these giant limbs endud with giant might his living bowels from his belly torn and scattered limbs shall on the flood be born thy flood ungrateful nymph and fate shall find that way for thee and acis to be joined for oh i burn with love and thy disdain augments at once my passion and my pain translated aetna flames within my heart and thou inhuman wilt not ease my smart lamenting thus in vain he rose and strode with furious paces to the neighboring wood restless his feet distracted was his walk mad were his motions and confused his talk mad as the vanquished bull when forced to yield his lovely mistress and forsake the field thus far unseen i saw when fatal chance his looks directing with a sudden glance acis and i were to his sight betrayed where naught suspecting we securely played from his wide mouth a bellowing cry he cast i see i see but this shall be your last a roar so loud made aetna to rebound and all the cyclops labored in the sound affrighted with his monstrous voice i fled and in the neighboring ocean plunged my head poor acis turned his back and help he cried help galatea help my parent gods and take me dying to your deep abodes the cyclops followed but he sent before a rib which from the living rock he tore though but an angle reached him of the stone the mighty fragment was enough alone to crush all acis twas too late to save but what the fates allowed to give i gave that acis to his lineage should return and roll among the river gods his urn straight issued from the stone a stream of blood which lost the purple mingling with the flood then like a troubled torrent it appeared the torrent too in little space was cleared the stone was cleft and through the yawning chink new reeds arose on the new rivers brink the rock from out its hollow womb disclosed a sound like water in its course opposed when wondrous to behold full in the flood up starts a youth and navel high he stood horns from his temples rise and either horn thick wreaths of reeds his native growth adorn were not his stature taller than before his bulk augmented and his beauty more his color blue for acis he might pass and acis changed into a stream he was but mine no more he rowls along the plains with rapid motion and his name retains the story of glaucus and scylla by mr row here ceased the nymph the fair assembly broke the seagreen nereids to the waves betook while scylla fearful of the widespread main swift to the safer shore returns again there over the sandy margin unarrayd with printless footsteps flies the bounding maid or in some winding creeks secure retreat she baths her weary limbs and shuns the noondays heat her glaucus saw as over the deep he rode new to the seas and late received a god he saw and languishd for the virgins love with many an artful blandishment he strove her flight to hinder and her fears remove the more he sues the more she wings her flight and nimbly gains a neighboring mountains height steep shelving to the margin of the flood a neighboring mountain bare and woodless stood here by the place secured her steps she stayed and trembling still her lovers form surveyed his shape his hue her troubled sense appall and dropping locks that over his shoulders fall she sees his face divine and manly brow end in a fishs wreathy tail below she sees and doubts within her anxious mind whether he comes of god or monster kind this glaucus soon perceived and oh forbear his hand supporting on a rock lay near forbear he cried fond maid this needless fear nor fish am i nor monster of the main but equal with the watery gods i reign nor proteus nor palaemon me excel nor he whose breath inspires the sounding shell my birth it is true i owe to mortal race and i my self but late a mortal was even then in seas and seas alone i joyd the seas my hours and all my cares employed in meshes now the twinkling prey i drew now skilfully the slender line i threw and silent sat the moving float to view not far from shore there lies a verdant mead with herbage half and half with water spread there nor the horned heifers browsing stray nor shaggy kids nor wanton lambkins play there nor the sounding bees their nectar cull nor rural swains their genial chaplets pull nor flocks nor herds nor mowers haunt the place to crop the flowers or cut the bushy grass thither sure first of living race came i and sat by chance my dropping nets to dry my scaly prize in order all displayed by number on the greensword there i laid my captives whom or in my nets i took or hung unwary on my wily hook strange to behold yet what avails a lie i saw em bite the grass as i sat by then sudden darting over the verdant plain they spread their finns as in their native main i paused with wonder struck while all my prey left their new master and regained the sea amazed within my secret self i sought what god what herb the miracle had wrought but sure no herbs have power like this i cried and strait i plucked some neighboring herbs and tried scarce had i bit and proved the wondrous taste when strong convulsions shook my troubled breast i felt my heart grow fond of something strange and my whole nature laboring with a change restless i grew and every place forsook and still upon the seas i bent my look farewell for ever farewell land i said and plunged amidst the waves my sinking head the gentle powers who that low empire keep received me as a brother of the deep to tethys and to ocean old they pray to purge my mortal earthy parts away the watery parents to their suit agreed and thrice nine times a sacred charm they read then with lustrations purify my limbs and bid me bathe beneath a hundred streams a hundred streams from various fountains run and on my head at once come rushing down thus far each passage i remember well and faithfully thus far the tale i tell but then oblivion dark on all my senses fell again at length my thought reviving came when i no longer found my self the same then first this seagreen beard i felt to grow and these large honors on my spreading brow my long descending locks the billows sweep and my broad shoulders cleave the yielding deep my fishy tail my arms of azure hue and every part divinely changed i view but what avail these useless honors now what joys can immortality bestow what though our nereids all my form approve what boots it while fair scylla scorns my love thus far the god and more he would have said when from his presence flew the ruthless maid stung with repulse in such disdainful sort he seeks titanian circes horrid court the end of the thirteenth book to the rt honble countess of burlington  ovids metamorphoses book xiv translated by sir samuel garth m d the transformation of scylla now glaucus with a lovers haste bounds over the swelling waves and seeks the latian shore messena rhegium and the barren coast of

in view leave those that fly but those that like pursue if love can be by kind compliance won see at your feet the daughter of the sun sooner said glaucus shall the ash remove from mountains and the swelling surges love or humble seaweed to the hills repair ever i think any but my scylla fair strait circe reddens with a guilty shame and vows revenge for her rejected flame fierce liking often a spite as fierce creates for love refused without aversion hates to hurt her hapless rival she proceeds and by the fall of scylla glaucus bleeds some fascinating bevrage now she brews composed of deadly drugs and baneful juice at rhegium she arrives the ocean braves and treads with unwet feet the boiling waves upon the beach a winding bay there lies sheltered from seas and shaded from the skies this station scylla chose a soft retreat from chilling winds and raging cancers heat the vengeful sorcress visits this recess her charm infuses and infects the place soon as the nymph wades in her nether parts turn into dogs then at her self she starts a ghastly horror in her eyes appears but yet she knows not who it is she fears in vain she offers from her self to run and drags about her what she strives to shun oppressed with grief the pitying god appears and swells the rising surges with his tears from the detested sorceress he flies her art reviles and her address denies whilst hapless scylla changed to rocks decrees destruction to those barques that beat the seas the voyage of aeneas continued here bulgd the pride of famed ulysses fleet but good aeneas scapd the fate he met as to the latian shore the trojan stood and cut with welltimd oars the foaming flood he weathered fell charybdis but ere long the skies were darkened and the tempest strong then to the libyan coast he stretches over and makes at length the carthaginian shore here dido with an hospitable care into her heart receives the wanderer from her kind arms the ungrateful hero flies the injured queen looks on with dying eyes then to her folly falls a sacrifice aeneas now sets sail and plying gains fair eryx where his friend acestes reigns first to his sire does funeral rites decree then gives the signal next and stands to sea outruns the islands where volcanos roar gets clear of sirens and their faithless shore but looses palynurus in the way then makes inarime and prochyta the transformation of cercopians into apes the galleys now by pythecusa pass the name is from the natives of the place the father of the gods detesting lies often with abhorrence heard their perjuries the abandoned race transformed to beasts began to mimick the impertinence of man flatnosd and furrowed with grimace they grin and look to what they were too near akin merry in make and busy to no end this moment they divert the next offend so much this species of their past retains though lost the language yet the noise remains aeneas descends to hell now on his right he leaves parthenope his left misenus jutting in the sea arrives at cume and with awe surveyed the grotto of the venerable maid begs leave through black avernus to retire and view the muchloved manes of his sire strait the divining virgin raised her eyes and foaming with a holy rage replies o thou whose worth thy wondrous works proclaim the flames thy piety the world thy fame though great be thy request yet shall thou see the elysian fields the infernal monarchy thy parents shade this arm thy steps shall guide to suppliant virtue nothing is denied she spoke and pointing to the golden bough which in the avernian grove refulgent grew seize that she bids he listens to the maid then views the mournful mansions of the dead the shade of great anchises and the place by fates determined to the trojan race as back to upper light the hero came he thus salutes the visionary dame  o whether some propitious deity or loved by those bright rulers of the sky with grateful incense i shall style you one and deem no godhead greater than your own twas you restored me from the realms of night and gave me to behold the fields of light to feel the breezes of congenial air and natures blessed benevolence to share the story of the sibyll i am no deity replied the dame but mortal and religious rites disclaim yet had avoided deaths tyrannick sway had i consented to the god of day with promises he sought my love and said have all you wish my fair cumaean maid i paused then pointing to a heap of sand for every grain to live a year demand but ah unmindful of the effect of time forgot to covenant for youth and prime the smiling bloom i boasted once is gone and feeble age with lagging limbs creeps on sevn centries have i lived three more fulfill the period of the years to finish still who will think that phoebus dressed in youth divine had once believed his luster less than mine this withered frame so fates have willed shall waste to nothing but prophetic words at last the sibyll mounting now from nether skies and the famed ilian prince at cumae rise he sailed and near the place to anchor came since called cajeta from his nurses name here did the luckless macareus a friend to wise ulysses his long labors end here wandering achaemenides he meets and sudden thus his late associate greets whence came you here o friend and whither bound all gave you lost on far cyclopean ground a greeks at last aboard a trojan found the adventures of achaemenides thus achaemenides  with thanks i name aeneas and his piety proclaim i scapd the cyclops through the heros aid else in his maw my mangled limbs had laid when first your navy under sail he found  he raved till aetna labored with the sound raging he stalked along the mountains side and vented clouds of breath at every stride  his staff a mountain ash and in the clouds  often as he walks his grisly front he shrowds eyeless he gropd about with vengeful haste and justled promontories as he passed then heaved a rocks high summit to the main and bellowed like some bursting hurricane oh could i seize ulysses in his flight how unlamented were my loss of sight these jaws should piecemeal tear each panting vein grind every crackling bone and pound his brain as thus he raved my joints with horror shook the tide of blood my chilling heart forsook i saw him once disgorge huge morsels raw of wretches undigested in his maw from the pale breathless trunks whole limbs he tore his beard all clotted with overflowing gore my anxious hours i passed in caves my food was forest fruits and wildings of the wood at length a sail i wafted and aboard my fortune found an hospitable lord now in return your own adventures tell and what since first you put to sea befell the adventures of macareus then macareus  there reigned a prince of fame over tuscan seas and aeolus his name a largess to ulysses he consigned and in a steers tough hide enclosed a wind nine days before the swelling gale we ran the tenth to make the meeting land began when now the merry mariners to find imagined wealth within the bag unbind forthwith outrushd a gust which backwards bore our galleys to the laestrigonian shore whose crown antiphates the tyrant wore some few commissioned were with speed to treat we to his court repair his guards we meet two friendly flight preserved the third was doomed to be by those cursed cannibals consumed inhumanly our hapless friends they treat our men they murder and destroy our fleet in time the wise ulysses bore away and dropped his anchor in yon faithless bay the thoughts of perils past we still retain and fear to land till lots appoint the men polites true elpenor given to wine eurylochus my self the lots assign designed for dangers and resolved to dare to circes fatal palace we repair the enchantments of circe before the spacious front a herd we find of beasts the fiercest of the savage kind our trembling steps with blandishments they meet and fawn unlike their species at our feet within upon a sumptuous throne of state on golden columns raised thenchantress sat rich was her robe and amiable her mein her aspect awful and she looked a queen her maids not mind the loom nor household care  nor wage in needle work a scythian war but cull in canisters disastrous flowers  and plants from haunted heaths and fairy bowers  with brazen sickles reaped at planetary hours each dose the goddess weighs with watchful eye so nice her art in impious pharmacy entering she greets us with a gracious look and airs that future amity bespoke her ready nymphs serve up a rich repast the bowl she dashes first then gives to taste quick to our own undoing we comply her power we prove and show the sorcery soon in a length of face our head extends our chine stiff bristles bears and forward bends a breadth of brawn new burnishes our neck anon we grunt as we begin to speak alone eurylochus refused to taste nor to a beast obscene the man debased hither ulysses hastes so fates command and bears the powerful moly in his hand unsheaths his scymitar assaults the dame preserves his species and remains the same the nuptial rite this outrage strait attends the dower desired is his transfigurd friends the incantation backward she repeats inverts her rod and what she did defeats and now our skin grows smooth our shape upright our arms stretch up our cloven feet unite with tears our weeping general we embrace hang on his neck and melt upon his face twelve silver moons in circes court we stay whilst there they waste the unwilling hours away twas here i spied a youth in parian stone his head a pecker bore the cause unknown to passengers a nymph of circes train the mystery thus attempted to explain the story of picus and canens picus who once the ausonian scepter held could rein the steed and fit him for the field so like he was to what you see that still we doubt if real or the sculptors skill the graces in the finished piece you find are but the copy of his fairer mind four lustres scarce the royal youth could name till every lovesick nymph confessed a flame often for his love the mountain dryads sud and every silver sister of the flood those of numicus albula and those where almo creeps and hasty nar overflows where sedgy anio glides through smiling meads where shady farfar rustles in the reeds and those that love the lakes and homage owe to the chaste goddess of the silver bow in vain each nymph her brightest charms put on his heart no sovereign would obey but one she whom venilia on mount palatine to janus bore the fairest of her line nor did her face alone her charms confess her voice was ravishing and pleased no less wheneer she sung so melting were her strains the flocks unfed seemed listening on the plains the rivers would stand still the cedars bend and birds neglect their pinions to attend the savage kind in forestwilds grow tame and canens from her heavenly voice her name hymen had now in some illfated hour their hands united as their hearts before  whilst their soft moments in delights they waste  and each new day was dearer than the past ticus would sometimes over the forests rove and mingle sports with intervals of love it chanced as once the foaming boar he chased his jewels sparkling on his tyrian vest lascivious circe well the youth surveyed as simpling on the flowery hills she strayed her wishing eyes their silent message tell and from her lap the verdant mischief fell as she attempts at words his courser springs over hills and lawns and even a wish outwings thou shall not scape me so pronounced the dame if plants have power and spells be not a name she said  and forthwith formed a boar of air that sought the covert with dissembled fear swift to the thicket picus wings his way on foot to chase the visionary prey now she invokes the daughters of the night does noxious juices smear and charms recite such as can veil the moons more feeble fire or shade the golden luster of her sire in filthy fogs she hides the cheerful noon the guard at distance and the youth alone by those fair eyes she cries and every grace that finish all the wonders of your face o i conjure thee hear a queen complain nor let the suns soft lineage sue in vain whoeer thou art replied the king forbear none can my passion with my canens share  she first my every tender wish possessed  and found the soft approaches to my breast  in nuptials blessed each loose desire we shun  nor time can end what innocence begun  think not she cried to saunter out a life  of form with that domestic drudge a wife my just revenge dull fool ere long shall show what ills we women if refused can do think me a woman and a lover too  from dear successful spite we hope for ease  nor fail to punish where we fail to please now twice to east she turns as often to west thrice waves her wand as often a charm expressed on the lost youth her magic power she tries a loft he springs and wonders how he flies on painted plumes the woods he seeks and still the monarch oak he pierces with his bill thus changed no more over latian lands he reigns of picus nothing but the name remains the winds from drisling damps now purge the air the mist subsides the settling skies are fair the court their sovereign seek with arms in hand they threaten circe and their lord demand quick she invokes the spirits of the air  and twilight elves that on dun wings repair  to charnels and the unhallowed sepulcher now strange to tell the plants sweat drops of blood the trees are tossed from forests where they stood blue serpents over the tainted herbage slide pale glaring specter on the ether ride dogs howl earth yawns rent rocks forsake their beds and from their quarries heave their stubborn heads the sad spectators stiffend with their fears she sees and sudden every limb she smears then each of savage beasts the figure bears the sun did now to western waves retire in tides to temper his bright world of fire canens laments her royal husbands stay  ill suits fond love with absence or delay  where she commands her ready people run  she wills retracts bids and forbids anon restless in mind and dying with despair her breast she beats and tears her flowing hair six days and nights she wanders on as chance directs without or sleep or sustenance tiber at last beholds the weeping fair her feeble limbs no more the mourner bear stretched on his banks she to the flood complains and faintly tunes her voice to dying strains the sickening swan thus hangs her silver wings and as she droops her elegy she sings ever long sad canens wastes to air whilst fame the place still honors with her hapless name here did the tender tale of picus cease above belief the wonder i confess again we sail but more disasters meet foretold by circe to our suffering fleet my self unable further woes to bear declined the voyage and am refugd here aeneas arrives in italy thus macareus  now with a pious aim had good aeneas raised a funeral flame in honor of his hoary nurses name her epitaph he fixed and setting sail cajeta left and caught at every gale he steered at distance from the faithless shore where the false goddess reigns with fatal power and sought those grateful groves that shade the plain where tyber rouls majestic to the main and fattens as he runs the fair campain his kindred gods the heros wishes crown with fair lavinia and latinus throne but not without a war the prize he won drawn up in bright array the battle stands turnus with arms his promised wife demands hetrurians latians equal fortune share and doubtful long appears the face of war both powers from neighboring princes seek supplies and embassies appoint for new allies aeneas for relief evander moves his quarrel he asserts his cause approves the bold rutulians with an equal speed sage venulus dispatch to

argives won and flames had finished what the sword begun pallas incensed pursued us to the main in vengeance of her violated fane alone oileus forced the trojan maid yet all were punished for the brutal deed a storm begins the raging waves run high the clouds look heavy and benight the sky red sheets of lightning over the seas are spread our tackling yields and wrecks at last succeed it is tedious our disastrous state to tell even priam would have pitied what befell yet pallas saved me from the swallowing main at home new wrongs to meet as fates ordain chased from my country i once more

rest of agmons insolence complain and of irreverence the wretch arraign about to answer his blaspheming throat contracts and shrieks in some disdainful note to his new skin a fleece of feather clings

these thin remains to daunus realms i bring and here i reign a poor precarious king the transformation of appulus thus diomedes venulus withdraws unsped the service of the common cause puteoli he passes and surveyed a cave long honored for its awful shade here trembling reeds exclude the piercing ray  here streams in gentle falls through windings stray  and with a passing breath cool zephyrs play the goatherd god frequents the silent place as once the woodnymphs of the sylvan race till appulus with a dishonest air and gross behavior banished thence the fair the bold buffoon wheneer they tread the green their motion mimicks but with gests obscene loose language often he utters but ere long a bark in filmy network binds his tongue thus changed a base wild olive he remains  the shrub the coarseness of the clown retains the trojan ships transformed to seanymphs mean while the latians all their power prepare against fortune and the foe to push the war with phrygian blood the floating fields they stain but short of succors still contend in vain turnus remarks the trojan fleet ill manned unguarded and at anchor near the strand he thought and strait a lighted brand he bore and fire invades what scapd the waves before the billows from the kindling prow retire pitch rosin searwood on red wings aspire and vulcan on the seas exerts his attribute of fire this when the mother of the gods beheld her towry crown she shook and stood revealed her brindld lions reind unveiled her head and hovering over her favored fleet she said cease turnus and the heavenly powers respect nor dare to violate what i protect these galleys once fair trees on ida stood and gave their shade to each descending god nor shall consume irrevocable fate allots their being no determined date strait peals of thunder heavens high arches rend the hailstones leap the showers in spouts descend the winds with widend throats the signal give the cables break the smoking vessels drive now wondrous as they beat the foaming flood the timber softens into flesh and blood the yards and oars new arms and legs design a trunk the hull the slender keel a spine the prow a female face and by degrees the galleys rise green daughters of the seas  sometimes on coral beds they sit in state or wanton on the waves they feared of late the barks that beat the seas are still their care themselves remembering what of late they were to save a trojan sail in throngs they press but smile to see alcinous in distress unable were those wonders to deter the latians from their unsuccessful war both sides for doubtful victory contend and on their courage and their gods depend nor bright lavinia nor latinus crown warm their great soul to war like fair renown venus at last beholds her godlike son triumphant and the field of battle won brave turnus slain strong ardea but a name  and buried in fierce deluges of flame  her towers that boasted once a sovereign sway  the fate of fancied grandeur now betray a famished heron from the ashes springs and beats the ruin with disastrous wings calamities of towns distressed she feigns and often with woeful shrieks of war complains the deification of aeneas now

the alban name then epitus then gentle capys reigned then capetis the regal power sustained next he who perished on the tuscan flood and honored with his name the river god now haughty remulus begun his reign who fell by thunder he aspired to feign meek acrota succeeded to the crown from peace endeavoring more than arms renown to aventinus well resigned his throne the mount on which he ruled preserves his name and procas wore the regal diadem the story of vertumnus and pomona a hamadryad flourished in these days her name pomona from her woodland race in garden culture none could so excel or form the pliant souls of plants so well or to the fruit more generous flavours lend or teach the trees with nobler loads to bend the nymph frequented not the flattering stream  nor meads the subject of a virgins dream but to such joys her nursry did prefer alone to tend her vegetable care a pruninghook she carried in her hand and taught the straglers to obey command  lest the licentious and unthrifty bough  the too indulgent parent should undo  she shows how stocks invite to their embrace  a graft and naturalize a foreign race  to mend the salvage teint and in its stead  adopt new nature and a nobler breed now hourly she observes her growing care  and guards their nonage from the bleaker air then opes her streaming sluices to supply with flowing draughts her thirsty family long had she labored to continue free from chains of love and nuptial tyranny and in her orchards small extent immured her vowed virginity she still secured often would loose pan and all the lustful train of satyrs tempt her innocence in vain silenus that old dotard owned a flame and he that frights the thieves with stratagem of sword and something else too gross to name to the rt honble the lady juliana boil m pool sc   vertumnus too pursued the maid no less but with his rivals shared a like success to gain access a thousand ways he tries often in the hind the lover would disguise the heedless lout comes shambling on and seems just sweating from the labor of his teams then from the harvest often the mimick swain seems bending with a load of bearded grain sometimes a dresser of the vine he feigns and lawless tendrils to their bounds restrains sometimes his sword a soldier shows his rod an angler still so various is the god now in a forheadcloth some crone he seems a staff supplying the defect of limbs admittance thus he gains admires the store of fairest fruit the fair possessor more then greets her with a kiss the unpracticed dame admired a grandame kissed with such a flame now seated by her he beholds a vine around an elm in amorous foldings twine if that fair elm he cried alone should stand no grapes would glow with gold and tempt the hand or if that vine without her elm should grow twould creep a poor neglected shrub below be then fair nymph by these examples led nor shun for fancied fears the nuptial bed not she for whom the lapithites took arms nor spartas queen could boast such heavenly charms and if you would on womans faith rely none can your choice direct so well as i though old so much pomona i adore scarce does the bright vertumnus love her more it is your fair self alone his breast inspires with softest wishes and unsoyld desires then fly all vulgar followers and prove the god of seasons only worth your love on my assurance well you may repose vertumnus scarce vertumnus better knows true to his choice all looser flames he flies  nor for new faces fashionably dies the charms of youth and every smiling grace bloom in his features and the god confess besides he puts on every shape at ease but those the most that best pomona please still to oblige her is her lovers aim their likings and aversions are the same nor the fair fruit your burdened branches bear nor all the youthful product of the year could bribe his choice your self alone can prove a fit reward for so refined a love relent fair nymph and with a kind regret think it is vertumnus weeping at your feet a tale attend through cyprus known to prove how venus once revenged neglected love the story of iphis and anaxarete iphis of vulgar birth by chance had viewed fair anaxarete of teucers blood not long had he beheld the royal dame ere the bright sparkle kindled into flame often did he struggle with a just despair unfixd to ask unable to forbear  but love who flatters still his own disease  hopes all things will succeed he knows will please wherever the fair one haunts he hovers there and seeks her confident with sighs and prayer or letters he conveys that seldom prove  successless messengers in suits of love now shivering at her gates the wretch appears and myrtle garlands on the columns rears wet with a deluge of unbidden tears the nymph more hard than rocks more deaf than seas derides his prayers insults his agonies arraigns of insolence the aspiring swain and takes a cruel pleasure in his pain resolved at last to finish his despair he thus upbraids the inexorable fair  o anaxarete at last forget  the license of a passion indiscreet now triumph since a welcome sacrifice your slave prepares to offer to your eyes my life without reluctance i resign that present best can please a pride like thine but o forbear to blast a flame so bright doomed never to expire but with the light and you great powers do justice to my name the hours you take from life restore to fame then over the posts once hung with wreaths he throws the ready cord and fits the fatal noose for death prepares and bounding from above at once the wretch concludes his life and love ere long the people gather and the dead is to his mourning mothers arms conveyed first like some ghastly statue she appears then baths the breathless coarse in seas of tears and gives it to the pile now as the throng proceed in sad solemnity along to view the passing pomp the cruel fair hastes and beholds her breathless lover there struck with the sight inanimate she seems set are her eyes and motionless her limbs her features without fire her color gone and like her heart she hardens into stone in salamis the statue still is seen in the famed temple of the cyprian queen warned by this tale no longer then disdain o nymph beloved to ease a lovers pain so may the frosts in spring your blossoms spare and winds their rude autumnal rage forbear the story often vertumnus urged in vain but then assumed his heavenly form again such looks and luster the bright youth adorn as when with rays glad phoebus paints the morn the sight so warms the fair admiring maid like snow she melts so soon can youth persuade consent on eager wings succeeds desire and both the lovers glow with mutual fire the latian line continued now procas yielding to the fates his son mild numitor succeeded to the crown but false amulius with a lawless power at length deposed his brother numitor then ilias valiant issue with the sword her parent reinthrond the rightful lord next romulus to people rome contrives the joyous time of pales feast arrives he gives the word to seize the sabine wives the sires enraged take arms by tatius led bold to revenge their violated bed a fort there was not yet unknown to fame called the tarpeian its commanders name this by the false tarpeia was betrayed but death well recompensed the treacherous maid the foe on this newbought success relies and silent march the city to surprise saturnias arts with sabine arms combine but venus countermines the vain design entreats the nymphs that over the springs preside which near the fane of hoary janus glide to send their succors every urn they drain to stop the sabines progress but in vain the naiads now more stratagems essay and kindling sulphur to each source convey the floods ferment hot exhalations rise till from the scalding ford the army flies soon romulus appears in shining arms and to the war the roman legions warms the battle rages and the field is spread with nothing but the dying and the dead both sides consent to treat without delay and their two chiefs at once the scepter sway but tatius by lavinian fury slain great romulus continued long to reign the assumption of romulus now warrior mars his burnished helm puts on and thus addresses heavens imperial throne since the inferior world is now become  one vassal globe and colony to rome this grace o jove for romulus i claim admit him to the skies from whence he came long have thou promised an aetherial state to marss lineage and thy word is fate the sire that rules the thunder with a nod  declared the fiat and dismissed the god soon as the power armipotent surveyed the flashing skies the signal he obeyed and leaning on his lance he mounts his car his fiery coursers lashing through the air mount palatine he gains and finds his son good laws enacting on a peaceful throne  the scales of heavenly justice holding high  with steady hand and a discerning eye then vaults upon his carr and to the spheres swift as a flying shaft romes founder bears the parts more pure in rising are refined the gross and perishable lag behind his shrine in purple vestments stands in view he looks a god and is quirinus now the assumption of hersilia ere long the goddess of the nuptial bed with pity moved sends iris in her stead to sad hersilia  thus the metcor maid  chaste relict in bright truth to heaven allied the sabines glory and the sexs pride honored on earth and worthy of the love of such a spouse as now resides above some respite to thy killing griefs afford and if thou would once more behold thy lord retire to yon steep mount with groves oerspread which with an awful gloom his temple shade with fear the modest matron lifts her eyes and to the bright embassadress replies  o goddess yet to mortal eyes unknown but sure thy various charms confess thee one o quick to romulus thy votress bear  with looks of love he will smile away my care in whateer orb he shines my heaven is there then hastes with iris to the holy grove and up

grace the duchess of st albans e kirkall sculp  ovids metamorphoses book xv translated by mr dryden and others the pythagorean philosophy by mr dryden a king is sought to guide the growing state one able to support the public weight and fill the throne where romulus had sat renown which often bespeaks the public voice had recommended numa to their choice a peaceful pious prince who not content to know the sabine rites his study bent to cultivate his mind to learn the laws of nature and explore their hidden cause urged by this care his country he forsook and to crotona thence his journey took arrived he first inquired the founders name of this new colony and whence he came then thus a senior of the place replies well read and curious of antiquities it is said alcides hither took his way from spain and drove along his conquered prey then leaving in the fields his grazing cows he sought himself some hospitable house good croton entertained his godlike guest while he repaired his weary limbs with rest the hero thence departing blessed the place and here he said in times revolving race a rising town shall take his name from thee revolving time fulfilled the prophecy for myscelos the justest man on earth alemons son at argos had his birth him hercules armed with his club of oak oershadowd in a dream and thus bespoke go leave thy native soil and make abode where aesaris rowls down his rapid flood he said and sleep forsook him and the god trembling he waked and rose with anxious heart his country laws forbad him to depart what should he do twas death to go away and the god menaced if he dared to stay all day he doubted and when night came on sleep and the same forewarning dream begun once more the god stood threatening over his head with added curses if he disobeyed twice warned he studied flight but would convey at once his person and his wealth away thus while he lingered his design was heard a speedy process formed and death declared witness there needed none of his offense against himself the wretch was evidence condemned and destitute of human aid to him for whom he suffered thus he prayed o power who have deserved in heaven a throne not given but by thy labors made thy own pity thy suppliant and protect his cause whom thou have made obnoxious to the laws a custom was of old and still remains which life or death by suffrages ordains white stones and black within an urn are cast the first absolve but fate is in the last the judges to the common urn bequeath their votes and drop the sable signs of death the box receives all black but poured from thence the stones came candid forth the hue of innocence thus alemonides his safety won preserved from death by alcumenas son then to his kinsmangod his vows he pays and cuts with prosperous gales the ionian seas he leaves tarentum favored by the wind and thurine bays and temises behind soft sybaris and all the capes that stand along the shore he makes in sight of land still doubling and still coasting till he found the mouth of aesaris and promised ground then saw where on the margin of the flood the tomb that held the bones of croton stood here by the gods command he built and walled the place predicted and crotona called thus fame from time to time delivers down the sure tradition of the italian town here dwelt the man divine whom samos bore but now selfbanishd from his native shore because he hated tyrants nor could bear the chains which none but servile souls will wear he though from heaven remote to heaven could move with strength of mind and tread the abyss above and penetrate with his interior light those upper depths which nature hid from sight and what he had observed and learnt from thence loved in familiar language to dispense the crowd with silent admiration stand and heard him as they heard their gods command while he discoursed of heavens mysterious laws the worlds original and natures cause and what was god and why the fleecy snows in silence fell and rattling winds arose what shook the steadfast earth and whence begun the dance of planets round the radiant sun if thunder was the voice of angry jove or clouds with nitre pregnant burst above of these and things beyond the common reach he spoke and charmed his audience with his speech he first the taste of flesh from tables drove and argued well if arguments could move o mortals from your fellows blood abstain nor taint your bodies with a food profane while corn and pulse by nature are bestowed and planted orchards bend their willing load while labored gardens wholesome herbs produce and teeming vines afford their generous juice nor tardier fruits of cruder kind are lost but tamed with fire or mellowd by the frost while kine to pails distended udders bring and bees their honey redolent of spring while earth not only can your needs supply but lavish of her store provides for luxury a guiltless feast administers with ease and without blood is prodigal to please wild beasts their maws with their slain brethren fill and yet not all for some refuse to kill sheep goats and oxen and the nobler steed on browz and corn and flowery meadows feed bears tigers wolves the lyons angry brood whom heaven endud with principles of blood he wisely sundred from the rest to yell in forests and in lonely caves to dwell where stronger beasts oppress the weak by might and all in prey and purple feasts delight o impious use to natures laws opposed where bowels are in other bowels closed where fattend by their fellows fat they thrive maintained by murder and by death they live it is then for naught that mother earth provides the stores of all she shows and all she hides if men with fleshy morsels must be fed and chaw with bloody teeth the breathing bread what else is this but to devour our guests and barbrously renew cyclopean feasts we by destroying life our life sustain and gorge the ungodly maw with meats obscene not so the golden age who fed on fruit nor durst with bloody meals their mouths pollute then birds in airy space might safely move and timorous hares on heaths securely rove nor needed fish the guileful hooks to fear for all was peaceful and that peace sincere whoever was the wretch and cursed be he that envied first our foods simplicity the essay of bloody feasts on brutes began and after forged the sword to murder man had he the sharpened steel alone employed on beasts of prey that other beasts destroyed or man invaded with their fangs and paws this had been justified by natures laws and selfdefence but who did feasts begin of flesh he stretched necessity to sin to kill mankillers man has lawful power but not the extended license to devour ill habits gather by unseen degrees as brooks make rivers rivers run to seas the sow with her broad snout for rooting up thintrusted seed was judged to spoil the crop and intercept the sweating farmers hope the covetous churl of unforgiving kind the offender to the bloody priest resigned her hunger was no plea for that she died the goat came next in order to be tried the goat had cropped the tendrills of the vine in vengeance laity and clergy join where one had lost his profit one his wine here was at least some shadow of offense the sheep was sacrificed on no pretense but meek and unresisting innocence a patient useful creature born to bear the warm and woolly fleece that clothed her murderer and daily to give down the milk she bred a tribute for the grass on which she fed living both food and raiment she supplies and is of least advantage when she dies how did the toiling ox his death deserve a downright simple drudge and born to serve o tyrant with what justice can thou hope the promise of the year a plenteous crop when thou destroyst thy laboring steer who tilled and ploughd with pains thy else ungrateful field from his yet reeking neck to draw the yoke that neck with which the surly clods he broke and to the hatchet yield thy husbandman who finished autumn and the spring began nor this alone but heaven it self to bribe we to the gods our impious acts ascribe first recompense with death their creatures toil then call the blessed above to share the spoil the fairest victim must the powers appease so fatal it is sometimes too much to please a purple fillet his broad brows adorns with flowery garlands crowned and gilded horns he hears the murderous prayer the priest prefers but understands not it is his doom he hears beholds the meal betwixt his temples cast the fruit and product of his labors past and in the water views perhaps the knife uplifted to deprive him of his life then broken up alive his entrails sees torn out for priests tinspect the gods decrees from whence o mortal men this gust of blood have you derived and interdicted food be taught by me this dire delight to shun warned by my precepts by my practice won and when you eat the welldeserving beast think on the labrer of your field you feast now since the god inspires me to proceed be that whatever inspiring power obeyed for i will sing of mighty mysteries of truths concealed before from human eyes dark oracles unveil and open all the skies pleased as i am to walk along the sphere of shining stars and travel with the year to leave the heavy earth and scale the height of atlas who supports the heavenly weight to look from upper light and thence survey mistaken mortals wandering from the way and wanting wisdom fearful for the state of future things and trembling at their fate those i would teach and by right reason bring to think of death as but an idle thing why thus affrighted at an empty name a dream of darkness and fictitious flame vain themes of wit which but in poems pass and fables of a world that never was what feels the body when the soul expires by time corrupted or consumed by fires nor dies the spirit but new life repeats in other forms and only changes seats even i who these mysterious truths declare was once euphorbus in the trojan war my name and lineage i remember well and how in fight by spartas king i fell in argive junos fane i late beheld my buckler hung on high and owned my former shield then death so called is but old matter dressed in some new figure and a varied vest thus all things are but altered nothing dies and here and there the unbodyd spirit flies by time or force or sickness dispossessed and lodges where it lights in man or beast or hunts without till ready limbs it find and actuates those according to their kind from tenement to tenement is tossed the soul is still the same the figure only lost and as the softened wax new seals receives this face assumes and that impression leaves now called by one now by another name the form is only changed the wax is still the same so death so called can but the form deface the immortal soul flies out in empty space to seek her fortune in some other place then let not piety be put to flight to please the taste of glutton appetite but suffer inmate souls secure to dwell lest from their seats your parents you expel with rabid hunger feed upon your kind or from a beast dislodge a brothers mind and since like typhis parting from the shore in ample seas i sail and depths untried before this let me further add that nature knows no steadfast station but or ebbs or flows ever in motion she destroys her old and casts new figures in another mold even times are in perpetual flux and run like rivers from their fountain rolling on for time no more than streams is at a stay the flying hour is ever on her way and as the fountain still supplies her store the wave behind impels the wave before thus in successive course the minutes run and urge their predecessor minutes on still moving ever new for former things are set aside like abdicated kings and every moment alters what is done and innovates some act till then unknown darkness we see emerges into light and shining suns descend to sable night even heaven it self receives another dye when wearied animals in slumbers lie of midnight ease another when the gray of morn preludes the splendour of the day the disk of phoebus when he climbs on high appears at first but as a bloodshot eye and when his chariot downward drives to bed his ball is with the same suffusion red but mounted high in his meridian race all bright he shines and with a better face for there pure particles of ether flow far from the infection of the world below nor equal light the unequal moon adorns or in her wexing or her waning horns for every day she wanes her face is less but gathering into globe she fattens at increase perceivst thou not the process of the year how the four seasons in four forms appear resembling human life in every shape they wear spring first like infancy shoots out her head with milky juice requiring to be fed helpless though fresh and wanting to be led the green stem grows in stature and in size but only feeds with hope the farmers eyes then laughs the childish year with flowrets crowned and lavishly perfumes the fields around but no substantial nourishment receives infirm the stalks unsolid are the leaves proceeding onward whence the year began the summer grows adult and ripens into man this season as in men is most repleat with kindly moisture and prolifick heat autumn succeeds a sober tepid age not froze with fear nor boiling into rage more than mature and tending to decay when our brown locks repine to mix with odious gray last winter creeps along with tardy pace sour is his front and furrowed is his face his scalp if not dishonored quite of hair the ragged fleece is thin and thin is worse than bare even our own bodies daily change receive some part of what was theirs before they leave nor are today what yesterday they were nor the whole same tomorrow will appear time was when we were sowed and just began from some few fruitful drops the promise of a man then natures hand fermented as it was molded to shape the soft coagulated mass and when the little man was fully formed the breathless embrio with a spirit warmed but when the mothers throws begin to come the creature pent within the narrow room breaks his blind prison pushing to repair his stiffled breath and draw the living air cast on the margin of the world he lies a helpless babe but by instinct he cries he next essays to walk but downward pressed on four feet imitates his brother beast by slow degrees he gathers from the ground his legs and to the rolling chair is bound then walks alone a horseman now become he rides a stick and travels round the room in time he vaunts among his youthful peers strongbond and strung with nerves in pride of years he runs with mettle his first merry stage maintains the next abated of his rage but manages his strength and spares his age heavy the third and stiff he sinks apace and though it is downhill all but creeps along the race now sapless on the verge of death he stands contemplating his former feet and hands and milolike his slackened sinews sees and withered arms once fit to cope with hercules unable now to shake much less to tear the trees so helen wept when her too faithful glass reflected on her eyes the ruins of her face wondering what charms her ravishers could spy to force her twice or even but once to enjoy thy teeth devouring time thine envious age on things below still exercise your rage with venomed grinders you corrupt your meat and then at lingering meals the morsels eat nor those which elements we call abide nor to this figure nor to that are tied for this eternal world is said of old but four prolifick principles to hold four different bodies two to heaven ascend and other two down to the center tend fire first with wings expanded mounts on high pure void of weight and dwells in upper sky then air because unclogd in empty space flies after fire and claims the second place but weighty water as her nature guides lies on the lap of earth and mother earth subsides all things are mixed of these which all contain and into these are all resolved again earth rarifies to dew expanded more the subtle dew in air begins to soar spreads as she flies and weary of her name extenuates still and changes into flame thus having by degrees perfection won restless they soon untwist the web they spun and fire begins to lose her radiant hue mixed with gross air and air descends to dew and dew condensing does her form forego and sinks a heavy lump of earth below thus are their figures never at a stand but changed by natures innovating hand all things are altered nothing is destroyed the shifted scene for some new show employed then to be born is to begin to be some other thing we were not formerly and what we call to die is not tappear or be the thing that formerly we were those very elements which we partake alive when dead some other bodies make translated grow have sense or can discourse but death on deathless substance has no force that forms are changed i grant that nothing can continue in the figure it began the golden age to silver was debased to copper that our metal came at last the face of places and their forms decay and that is solid earth that once was sea seas in their turn retreating from the shore make solid land what ocean was before and far from strands are shells of fishes found and rusty anchors fixed on mountainground and what were fields before now washed and worn by falling floods from high to valleys turn and crumbling still descend to level lands and lakes and trembling bogs are barren sands and the parched desert floats in streams unknown wondering to drink of waters not her own here nature living fountains opes and there seals up the wombs where living fountains were or earthquakes stop their ancient course and bring diverted streams to feed a distant spring so lycus swallowed up is seen no more but far from thence knocks out another door thus erasinus dives and blind in earth runs on and gropes his way to second birth starts up in argos meads and shakes his locks around the fields and fattens all the flocks so mysus by another way is led and grown a river now disdains his head forgets his humble birth his name forsakes and the proud title of caicus takes large amenane impure with yellow sands runs rapid often and as often stands and here he threats the drunken fields to drown and there his dugs deny to give their liquor down anigros once did wholesome draughts afford but now his deadly waters are abhorred since hurt by hercules as fame resounds the centaurs in his current washed their wounds the streams of hypanis are sweet no more but brackish lose the taste they had before antissa pharos tire in seas were pent once isles but now increase the continent while the leucadian coast main land before by rushing seas is severed from the shore so zancle to the italian earth was tied and men once walked where ships at anchor ride till neptune overlooked the narrow way and in disdain poured in the conquering sea two cities that adorned the achaian ground buris and helice no more are found but whelmed beneath a lake are sunk and drowned and boatsmen through the crystal water show to wondering passengers the walls below near traezen stands a hill exposed in air to winterwinds of leafy shadows bare this once was level ground but strange to tell the included vapors that in caverns dwell laboring with cholick pangs and close confined in vain sought issue for the rumbling wind yet still they heaved for vent and heaving still enlarged the concave and shot up the hill as breath extends a bladder or the skins of goats are blown tinclose the hoarded wines the mountain yet retains a mountains face and gathered rubbish heals the hollow space of many wonders which i heard or knew retrenching most i will relate but few what are not springs with qualities opposed endud at seasons and at seasons lost thrice in a day thine ammon change their form cold at high noon at morn and evening warm thine athaman will kindle wood if thrown on the pild earth and in the waning moon the thracians have a stream if any try the taste his hardened bowels petrify whatever it touches it converts to stones and makes a marble pavement where it runs crathis and sybaris her sister flood that slide through our calabrian neighbor wood with gold and amber dye the shining hair and thither youth resort for who would not be fair but stranger virtues yet in streams we find some change not only bodies but the mind who has not heard of salmacis obscene whose waters into women soften men or ethiopian lakes which turn the brain to madness or in heavy sleep constrain clytorian streams the love of wine expel such is the virtue of the abstemious well whether the colder nymph that rules the flood extinguishes and balks the drunken god or that melampus so have some assured when the mad proetides with charms he cured and powerful herbs both charms and simples cast into the sober spring where still their virtues last unlike effects lyncestis will produce who drinks his waters though with moderate use reels as with wine and sees with double sight his heels too heavy and his head too light ladon once pheneos an arcadian stream ambiguous in the effects as in the name by day is wholesome bevrage but is thought by night infected and a deadly draught thus running rivers and the standing lake now of these virtues now of those partake time was and all things time and fate obey when fast ortygia floated on the sea such were cyanean isles when typhis steered betwixt their streights and their collision feared they swam where now they sit and firmly joined secure of rooting up resist the wind nor aetna vomiting sulphurous fire will ever belsh for sulphur will expire the veins exhausted of the liquid store time was she cast no flames in time will cast no more for whether earths an animal and air imbibes her lungs with coolness to repair and what she sucks remits she still requires inlets for air and outlets for her fires when tortured with convulsive fits she shakes that motion choaks the vent till other vent she makes or when the winds in hollow caves are closed and subtle spirits find that way opposed they toss up flints in air the flints that hide the seeds of fire thus tossed in air collide kindling the sulphur till the fuel spent the cave is cooled and the fierce winds relent or whether sulphur catching fire feeds on its unctuous parts till all the matter gone the flames no more ascend for earth supplies the fat that feeds them and when earth denies that food by length of time consumed the fire famished for want of fuel must expire a race of men there are as fame has told who shivering suffer hyperborean cold till nine times bathing in minervas lake soft feathers to defend their naked sides they take it is said the scythian wives believe who will transform themselves to birds by magic skill smeared over with an oil of wondrous might that adds new pinions to their airy flight but this by sure experiment we know that living creatures from corruption grow hide in a hollow pit a slaughtered steer bees from his putrid bowels will appear who like their parents haunt the fields and bring their honyharvest home and hope another spring the warlikesteed is multiplied we find to wasps and hornets of the warrior kind cut from a crab his crooked claws and hide the rest in earth a scorpion thence will glide and shoot his sting his tail in circles tossed refers the limbs his backward father lost and worms that stretch on leaves their filmy loom crawl from their bags and butterflies become even slime begets the frogs loquacious race short of their feet at first in little space with arms and legs endud long leaps they take raised on their hinder part and swim the lake and waves repel for nature gives their kind to that intent a length of legs behind the cubs of bears a living lump appear when whelpd and no determined figure wear their mother licks em into shape and gives as much of form as she her self receives the grubs from their sexangular abode crawl out unfinished like the maggots brood trunks without limbs till time at leisure brings the thighs they wanted and their tardy wings the bird who draws the carr of juno vain of her crowned head and of her starry train and he that bears the artillery of jove the strongpouncd eagle and the billing dove and all the feathered kind who could suppose but that from sight the surest sense he knows they from the included yolk not ambient white arose there are who think the marrow of a man which in the spine while he was living ran when dead the pith corrupted will become a snake and hiss within the hollow tomb all these receive their birth from other things but from himself the phoenix only springs selfborn begotten by the parent flame in which he burned another and the same who not by corn or herbs his life sustains but the sweet essence of amomum drains and watches the rich gums arabia bears while yet in tender dew they drop their tears he his five centuries of life fulfilled his nest on oaken boughs begins to build or trembling tops of palm and first he draws the plan with his broad bill and crooked claws natures artificers on this the pile is formed and rises round then with the spoil of casia cynamon and stems of nard for softness strewn beneath his funeral bed is reared funeral and bridal both and all around the borders with corruptless myrrh are crowned on this incumbent till aetherial flame first catches then consumes the costly frame consumes him too as on the pile he lies he lived on odours and in odours dies an infant phoenix from the former springs his fathers heir and from his tender wings shakes off his parent dust his method he pursues and the same lease of life on the same terms renews when grown to manhood he begins his reign and with stiff pinions can his flight sustain he lightens of its load the tree that bore his fathers royal sepulcher before and his own cradle this with pious care placed on his back he cuts the buxome air seeks the suns city and his sacred church and decently lays down his burden in the porch a wonder more amazing would we find the hyaena shows it of a double kind varying the sexes in alternate years in one begets and in another bears the thin camelion fed with air receives the color of the thing to which he cleaves india when conquered on the conquering god for planted vines the sharpeyd lynx bestowed whose urine shed before it touches earth congeals in air and gives to gems their birth so coral soft and white in oceans bed comes hardened up in air and glows with red all changing species should my song recite before i ceased would change the day to night nations and empires flourish and decay by turns command and in their turns obey time softens hardy people time again hardens to war a soft unwarlike train thus troy for ten long years her foes withstood and daily bleeding bore the expense of blood now for thick streets it shows an empty space or only filled with tombs of her own perished race her self becomes the sepulcher of what she was mycene sparta thebes of mighty fame are vanished out of substance into name and dardan rome that just begins to rise on tibers banks in time shall mate the skies widening her bounds and working on her way even now she meditates imperial sway yet this is change but she by changing thrives like moons newborn and in her cradle strives to fill her infanthorns an hour shall come when the round world shall be contained in rome for thus old saws foretell and helenus anchises drooping son enlivened thus when ilium now was in a sinking state and he was doubtful of his future fate o goddessborn with thy hard fortune strive troy never can be lost and thou alive thy passage thou shall free through fire and sword and troy in foreign lands shall be restored in happier fields a rising town i see greater than what ever was or is or ever shall be and heaven yet owes the world a race derived from thee sages and chiefs of other lineage born the city shall extend extended shall adorn but from iulus he must draw his breath by whom thy rome shall rule the conquered earth whom heaven will lend mankind on earth to reign and late require the precious pledge again this helenus to great aeneas told which i retain ever since in other mould my soul was clothed and now rejoice to view my country walls rebuilt and troy revived anew raised by the fall decreed by loss to gain enslaved but to be free and conquered but to reign it is time my hardmouthed coursers to control apt to run riot and transgress the goal and therefore i conclude whatever lies in earth or flits in air or fills the skies all suffer change and we that are of soul and body mixed are members of the whole then when our sires or grandsires shall forsake the forms of men and brutal figures take thus housed securely let their spirits rest nor violate thy father in the beast thy friend thy brother any of thy kin if none of these yet there is a man within o spare to make a thyestaean meal tinclose his body and his soul expel ill customs by degrees to habits rise ill habits soon become exalted vice what more advance can mortals make in sin so near perfection who with blood begin deaf to the calf that lies beneath the knife looks up and from her butcher begs her life deaf to the harmless kid that ere he dies all methods to procure thy mercy tries and imitates in vain thy childrens cries where will he stop who feeds with household bread then eats the poultry which before he fed let plough thy steers that when they lose their breath to nature not to thee they may impute their death let goats for food their loaded udders lend and sheep from wintercold thy sides defend but neither sprindges nets nor snares employ and be no more ingenious to destroy free as in air let birds on earth remain nor let insidious glue their wings constrain nor opening hounds the trembling stag affright nor purple feathers intercept his flight nor hooks concealed in baits for fish prepare nor lines to heave em twinkling up in air take not away the life you cannot give for all things have an equal right to live kill noxious creatures where it is sin to save this only just prerogative we have but nourish life with vegetable food and shun the sacrilegious taste of blood these precepts by the samian sage were taught which godlike numa to the sabines brought and thence transferred to rome by gift his own a willing people and an offered throne o happy monarch sent by heaven to bless a salvage nation with soft arts of peace to teach religion rapine to restrain give laws to lust and sacrifice ordain himself a saint a goddess was his bride and all the muses over his acts preside the story of hippolytus by mr catcott advanced in years he died one common date his reign concluded and his mortal state their tears plebeians and patricians shed and pious matrons wept their monarch dead his mournful wife her sorrows to bewail withdrew from rome and sought the arician vale hid in thick woods she made incessant moans disturbing cynthias sacred rites with groans how often the nymphs who ruled the wood and lake reproved her tears and words of comfort spoke how often in vain the son of theseus said thy stormy sorrows be with patience laid nor are thy fortunes to be wept alone weigh others woes and learn to bear thine own be mine an instance to assuage thy grief would mine were none  yet mine may bring relief you have heard perhaps in conversation told what once befell hippolytus of old to death by theseus easy faith betrayed and caught in snares his wicked stepdame laid the wondrous tale your credit scarce may claim yet strange to say in me behold the same whom lustful phaedra often had pressed in vain with impious joys my fathers bed to stain till seized with fear or by revenge inspired she charged on me the crimes her self desired expelled by theseus from his home i fled with heaps of curses on my guiltless head forlorn i sought pitthean troezens land and drove my chariot over corinthus strand when from the surface of the level main a billow rising heaved above the plain rolling and gathering till so high it swelled a mountains height the enormous mass excelled then bellowing burst when from the summit cleavd a horned bull his ample chest upheavd his mouth and nostrils storms of briny rain expiring blew dread horror seized my train i stood unmoved my fathers cruel doom claimed all my soul nor fear could find a room amazed awhile my trembling coursers stood with prickdup ears contemplating the flood then starting sudden from the dreadful view at once like lightning from the seas they flew and over the craggy rocks the rattling chariot drew in vain to stop the hotmouthd steeds i tried and bending backward all my strength applied the frothy foam in driving flakes distains the bits and bridles and bedews the reins but though as yet untamed they run at length their heady rage had tired beneath my strength when in the spokes a stump intangling tore the shattered wheel and from its axle bore the shock impetuous tossed me from the seat caught in the reins beneath my horses feet my reeking guts dragged out alive around the jagged stump my trembling nerves were wound then stretched the wellknit limbs in pieces haled part stuck behind and part the chariot traild till midst my cracking joints and breaking bones i breathed away my wearied soul in groans no part distinguished from the rest was found but all my parts an universal wound now say selftorturd nymph can you compare our griefs as equal or in justice dare i saw besides the darksome realms of woe and bathed my wounds in smoking streams below there i had staid nor second life enjoyed but paeans son his wondrous art employed to light restored by medicinal skill in spite of fate and rigid plutos will thinvidious object to preserve from view a misty cloud around me cynthia threw and lest my sight should stir my foes to rage she stamped my visage with the marks of age my former hue was changed and for it shown a set of features and a face unknown awhile the goddess stood in doubt or crete or delos isle to choose for my retreat delos and crete refused this wood she chose bad me my former luckless name depose which kept alive the memory of my woes then said immortal life be thine and thou hippolytus once called be virbius now here then a god but of thinferior race i serve my goddess and attend her chase egeria transformed to a fountain but others woes were useless to appease egerias grief or set her mind at ease beneath the hill all comfortless she laid the dropping tears her eyes incessant shed till pitying phoebe eased her pious woe thawed to a spring whose streams for ever flow the nymphs and virbius like amazement filled as seized the swains who tyrrhene furrows tilled when heaving up a clod was seen to roll untouched selfmovd and big with human soul the spreading mass its former shape deposed began to shoot and arms and legs disclosed till formed a perfect man the living mold opened its new mouth and future truths foretold and tages named by natives of the place taught arts prophetic to the tuscan race or such as once by romulus was shown who saw his lance with sprouting leaves oergrown when fixed in earth the point began to shoot and growing downward turned a fibrous root while spread aloft the branching arms displayed over wondering crowds an unexpected shade the story of cippus by sir samuel garth m d or as when cippus in the current viewed the shooting horns that on his forehead stood his temples first he feels and with surprise his touch confirms the assurance of his eyes strait to the skies his horned front he rears and to the gods directs these pious prayers if this portent be prosperous o decree to rome the event if otherwise to me an altar then of turf he hastes to raise rich gums in fragrant exhalations blaze the panting entrails crackle as they fry and boding fumes pronounce a mystery soon as the augur saw the holy fire and victims with presaging signs expire to cippus then he turns his eyes with speed and views the horny honors of his head then cried hail conqueror thy call obey those omens i behold presage thy sway rome waits thy nod unwilling to be free and owns thy sovereign power as fates decree he said  and cippus starting at the event spoke in these words his pious discontent far hence ye gods this execration send and the great race of romulus defend better that i in exile live abhorred then ever the capitol should style me lord this spoke he hides with leaves his omend head then prays the senate next convenes and said if augurs can foresee a wretch is come designed by destiny the bane of rome two horns most strange to tell his temples crown if ever he pass the walls and gain the town your laws are forfeit that illfated hour and liberty must yield to lawless power your gates he might have entered but this arm seized the usurper and withheld the harm haste find the monster out and let him be condemned to all the senate can decree or tied in chains or into exile thrown or by the tyrants death prevent your own the crowd such murmurs utter as they stand as swelling surges breaking on the strand or as when gathering gales sweep over the grove and their tall heads the bending cedars move each with confusion gazed and then began to feel his fellows brows and find the man cippus then shakes his garland off and cries the wretch you want i offer to your eyes the anxious throng looked down and sad in thought all wished they had not found the sign they sought in haste with laurel wreaths his head they bind such honor to such virtue was assigned then thus the senate  hear o cippus hear so godlike is thy tutelary care that since in rome thy self forbids thy stay for thy abode those acres we convey the ploughshare can surround the labor of a day in deathless records thou shall stand enrolled and romes rich posts shall shine with horns of gold the occasion of aesculapius being brought to rome by mr welsted melodious maids of pindus who inspire the flowing strains and tune the vocal lyre traditions secrets are unlocked to you old tales revive and ages past renew you who can hidden causes best expound say whence the isle which tiber flows around its altars with a heavenly stranger graced and in our shrines the god of physic placed a wasting plague infected latiums skies pale bloodless looks were seen with ghastly eyes the dire diseases marks each visage wore and the pure blood was changed to putrid gore in vain were human remedies applied in vain the power of healing herbs was tried wearied with death they seek celestial aid and visit phoebus in his delphic shade in the worlds center sacred delphos stands and gives its oracles to distant lands here they implore the god with fervent vows his salutary power to interpose and end a great afflicted citys woes the holy temple sudden tremors proved the laurelgrove and all its quivers moved in hollow sounds the priestess thus began and through each bosom thrilling horrors ran  the assistance roman

expect success when these clear oracles the senate knew the sacred tripods counsels they pursue depute a pious and a chosen band who sail to epidaurus neighboring land before the grecian elders when they stood they pray em to bestow the healing god  ordained was he to save ausonias state  so promised delphos and unerring fate opinions various their debates enlarge some plead to yield to rome the sacred charge others tenacious of their countrys wealth refuse to grant the power who guards its health while dubious they remained the wasting light withdrew before the growing shades of night thick darkness now obscured the dusky skies now roman closed in sleep were mortal eyes when healths auspicious god appears to thee and thy glad dreams his form celestial see in his left hand a rural staff preferred his right is seen to stroke his decent beard  dismiss said he with mildness all divine  dismiss your fears i come and leave my shrine  this serpent view that with ambitious play  my staff encircles mark him every way  his form though larger nobler i will assume  and changed as gods should be bring aid to rome here fled the vision and the visions flight was followed by the cheerful dawn of light now was the morn with blushing streaks oerspread and all the starry fires of heaven were fled the chiefs perplexed and filled with doubtful care to their protectors sumptuous roofs repair by genuin signs implore him to express what seats he deigns to choose what land to bless scarce their ascending prayers had reached the sky lo the serpentine god erected high forerunning hissings his approach confessed bright shone his golden scales and waved his lofty crest the trembling altar his appearance spoke the marble floor and glittering cieling shook the doors were rocked the statue seemed to nod and all the fabric owned the present god his radiant chest he taught aloft to rise and round the temple cast his flaming eyes struck was the astonished crowd the holy priest his temples with white bands of ribbon dressed with reverent awe the power divine confessed the god the god he cries all tongues be still each conscious breast devoutest ardour fill o beauteous o divine assist our cares and be propitious to thy votaries prayers all with consenting hearts and pious fear the words repeat the deity revere the romans in their holy worship joined with silent awe and purity of mind gracious to them his crest is seen to nod and as an earnest of his care the god thrice hissing vibrates thrice his forked tongue and now the smooth descent he glides along still on the ancient seats he bends his eyes in which his statue breaths his altars rise his longlovd shrine with kind concern he leaves and to forsake the accustomed mansion grieves at length his sweeping bulk in state is born through the thronged streets which scattered flowers adorn through many a fold he winds his mazy course and gains the port and moles which break the oceans force twas here he made a stand and having viewed the pious train who his last steps pursued seemed to dismiss their zeal with gracious eyes while gleams of pleasure in his aspect rise and now the latian vessel he ascends beneath the weighty god the vessel bends the latins on the strand great jove appease their cables loose and plough the yielding seas the highreard serpent from the stern displays his gorgeous form and the blue deep surveys the ship is wafted on with gentle gales and over the calm ionian smoothly sails on the sixth morn the italian coast they gain and touch laciniae graced with junos fane now fair calabria to the sight is lost and all the cities on her fruitful coast they pass at length the rough sicilian shore the brutian soil rich with metallic ore the famous isles where aeolus was king and paestus blooming with eternal spring minervas cape they leave and capreaes isle campania on whose hills the vineyards smile the city which alcides spoils adorn naples for soft delight and pleasure born fair

guardians of the vestal flame from every part tumultuous they repair and joyful acclamations rend the air along the flowery banks on either side where the tall ship floats on the swelling tide

great mistress rome receives him now on the masts top reclined he waves his brow and from that height surveys the great abodes and mansions worthy of residing gods the land a narrow neck it self extends round which his course the stream divided bends the streams two arms on either side are seen stretched out in equal length the land between the isle so called from hence derives its name twas here the salutary serpent came nor sooner has he left the latian pine but he assumes again his form divine and now no more the drooping city mourns joy is again is restored and health returns the deification of julius caesar but aesculapius was a foreign power in his own city caesar we adore him arms and arts alike renowned beheld in peace conspicuous dreadful in the field his rapid conquests and swiftfinishd wars the hero justly fixed among the stars yet is his progeny his greatest fame the son immortal makes the fathers name the seagirt britons by his courage tamed for their high rocky cliffs and fierceness famed his dreadful navies which victorious rode over niles affrighted waves and sevensourced flood numidia and the spacious realms regained where cyniphis or flows or juba reigned the powers of titled mithridates broke and pontus added to the roman yoke triumphal shows decreed for conquests won for conquests which the triumphs still outshone these are great deeds yet less than to have given the world a lord in whom propitious heaven when you decreed the sovereign rule to place you blessed with lavish bounty human race now lest so great a prince might seem to rise of mortal stem his sire must reach the skies the beauteous goddess that aeneas bore foresaw it and foreseeing did deplore for well she knew her heros fate was nigh devoted by conspiring arms to die trembling and pale to every god she cried behold what deep and subtle arts are tried to end the last the only branch that springs from my iulus and the dardan kings how bent they are how desperate to destroy all that is left me of unhappy troy am i alone by fate ordained to know uninterrupted care and endless woe now from tydides spear i feel the wound now iliums towers the hostile flames surround troy laid in dust my exiled son i mourn through angry seas and raging billows born over the wide deep his wandering course he bends now to the sullen shades of styx descends with turnus driven at last fierce wars to wage or rather with unpitying junos rage but why record i now my ancient woes sense of past ills in present fears i lose on me their points the impious daggers throw forbid it gods repel the direful blow if by cursed weapons numas priest expires no longer shall ye burn ye vestal fires while such complainings cyprias grief disclose in each celestial breast compassion rose not gods can alter fates resistless will yet they foretold by signs the approaching ill dreadful were heard among the clouds alarms of ecchoing trumpets and of clashing arms the suns pale image gave so faint a light that the sad earth was almost veiled in night the aethers face with fiery meteors glowed with storms of hail were mingled drops of blood a dusky hue the morning star overspread and the moons orb was stained with spots of red in every place portentous shricks were heard the fatal warnings of the infernal bird in every place the marble melts to tears while in the groves revered through length of years boding and awful sounds the ear invade and solemn music warbles through the shade no victim can atone the impious age no sacrifice the wrathful gods assuage dire wars and civil fury threat the state and every omen points out caesars fate around each hallowed shrine and sacred dome nighthowling dogs disturb the peaceful gloom their silent seats the wandering shades forsake and fearful tremblings the rocked city shake yet could not by these prodigies be broke the plotted charm or staid the fatal stroke their swords the assassins in the temple draw their murdering hands nor gods nor temples awe this sacred place their bloody weapons stain and virtue falls before the altar slain twas now fair cypria with her woes oppressed in raging anguish smote her heavenly breast wild with distracting fears the goddess tried her hero in the etherial cloud to hide the cloud which youthful paris did conceal when menelaus urged the threatening steel the cloud which once deceived tydides sight and saved aeneas in the unequal fight when jove  in vain fair daughter you assay to oerrule destinys unconquered sway your doubts to banish enter fates abode a privilege to heavenly powers allowed there shall you see the records engraved in length on irn and solid brass with mighty strength which heavens and earths concussion shall endure maugre all shocks eternal and secure

dreadful powers shall shake pharsalias plain and drench in gore philippis fields again a mighty leader in sicilias flood great pompeys warlike son shall be subdued aegypts soft queen adorned with fatal charms shall mourn her soldiers unsuccessful arms too late shall find her swelling hopes were vain and know that rome over memphis still must reign what name i afric or niles hidden head far as both oceans roll his power shall spread all the known earth to him shall homage pay and the seas own his universal sway when cruel war no more disturbs mankind to civil studies shall he bend his mind with equal justice guardian laws ordain and by his great example vice restrain where will his bounty or his goodness end to times unborn his generous views extend the virtues of his heir our praise engage and promise blessings to the coming age late shall he in his kindred orbs be placed with pylian years and crowded honors graced mean time your heros fleeting spirit bear fresh from his wounds and change it to a star so shall great julius rites divine assume and from the skies eternal smile on rome this spoke the goddess to the senate flew where her fair form concealed from mortal view her caesars heavenly part she made her care nor left the recent soul to waste to air but bore it upwards to its native skies glowing with newborn fires she saw it rise forth springing from her bosom up it flew and kindling as it soared a comet grew above the lunar sphere it took its flight and shot behind it a long trail of light the reign of augustus in which ovid flourished thus raised his glorious offspring julius viewed beneficently great and scattering good deeds that his own surpassed with joy beheld and his large heart dilates to be excelled what though this prince refuses to receive the preference which his juster subjects give fame uncontrolled that no restraint obeys the homage shunned by modest virtue pays and proves disloyal only in his praise though great his sire him greater we proclaim so atreus yields to agamemnons fame achilles so superior honors won and peleus must submit to peleus son examples yet more noble to disclose so saturn was eclipsed when jove to empire  jove rules the heavens the earth augustus sways each claims a monarchs and a fathers praise celestials who for rome your cares employ ye gods who guarded the remains of troy ye native gods here born and fixed by fate quirinus founder of the roman state o parent mars from whom quirinus sprung chaste vesta caesars household gods among most sacred held domestic phoebus thou to whom with vesta chaste alike we bow great guardian of the high tarpeian rock and all ye powers whom poets may invoke o grant that day may claim our sorrows late when loved augustus shall submit to fate visit those seats where gods and heroes dwell and leave in tears the world he ruled so well the poet concludes the work is finished which nor dreads the rage of tempests fire or war or wasting age come soon or late deaths undetermined day this mortal being only can decay my nobler part my fame shall reach the skies and to late times with blooming honors rise whatever the unbounded roman power obeys all climes and nations shall record my praise if it is allowed to poets to divine one half of round eternity is mine finis
