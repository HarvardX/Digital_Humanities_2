sir did this address aim no farther than at the common end of dedicators i should have been proud enough to have declined the trouble and you too wise to have approved this public manner of offering it  to praise you were impertinent and to tell others of my obligations to you would have the appearance rather of vanity than gratitude  the truth is i make free with your name on this occasion not so much to protect my book as to complete my argument  i have ventured to criticize the works of a very celebrated writer who took it into his head to oppose the solid wisdom of the gospel by the visions of false philosophy as his at best is but the cause of wit and eloquence all the support he could give it was only to tell us how plato wrote mine being that of truth and christianity i have the advantage of realizing all i say in bidding the world take notice how you live  in a word i was willing to bring the question to a short issue and show by a known example to what an elevation true christianity can exalt human nature till therefore philosophic taste can produce a parallel effect religion must bear the palm and christianity like her parent wisdom will be justified of her children

etc essay i on ridicule considered as a test of truth section i it has been the fate of lord shaftesburys characteristics beyond that of most other books to be idolized by one party and detested by another while the first regard it as a work of perfect excellence as containing every thing that can render mankind wise and happy the latter are disposed to rank it among the most pernicious of writings and brand it as one continued heap of fustian scurrility and falsehood  this circumstance has always appeared to me a demonstration that passion and prejudice have had a greater share than reason in deciding upon the merits of this work which many read with displeasure more with admiration but few with impartial judgment it is probable the truth lies between the two extremes of these discordant opinions and that the noble writer has mingled beauties and blots faults and excellencies with a liberal and unsparing hand  these so far as they relate to religion and morals it is my present intention to point out without regard to the bigoted censures of his friends or enemies while i foresee that some will frown upon me for allowing him any thing and others treat me with a contemptuous smile for presuming to differ with him at all  the first thing that occurs to an unprejudiced mind in the perusal of the characteristics is that generous spirit of freedom which shines throughout the whole the noble author every where asserts that natural privilege of man which has been so often denied him of seeing with his own eyes and judging by his own reason it may possibly appear strange to some why he should so extremely labor a point so plain but in justice to his lordship these gentlemen must remember or be informed that in former times some welldesigning men among ourselves from a groundless dread of an unlimited freedom of the press attempted to make a most unnatural and cruel separation between truth and liberty having shaken off the corruptions of popery and established what they thought a pure and perfect system they unhappily stopped short in their full carrier of glory preposterously attempting to deprive others of that common privilege which they had so nobly exercised themselves this mistaken spirit seemed entirely subdued by the excellent lock and others about the time of the revolution but at the period when our noble author wrote it not only revived but was heightened by a terrible accession of bitterness and rancour hence those frequent sallies of invective which he throws out against this intolerant principle which he justly stigmatizeth as equally impolitic irrational and unchristian  it is the glory of our days that this accursed spirit of persecution is at least dying away what pity that we cannot add it is wholly extinguished it is true we most of us profess ourselves friends to a freedom of inquiry in the main but why in the main why that needless circumstance of hesitation would we embrace error or do we think that truth can suffer by the most rigid scrutiny on the contrary not only the perfection but the very being of knowledge depends on the exercise of freedom for whatever some may fear from an open and unlimited enquiry it seems evidently the only means vouchsafed us for the attainment of truth the abuse of it may be hurtful but the want of it is fatal such indeed are the clear and undoubted principles of our religion neither sure can these declarations surprise us for if human and political establishments had been sacred or unviolable where had been our protestantism nay where our christianity dare we then to desert or discountenance a principle on which not only the purity but the very existence of our religion depends nor is this principle less consonant with the strictest reason it is falsehood only that loves and retires into darkness truth delights in the day and demands no more than a just light to appear in perfect beauty a rigid examination is its only test for experience has taught us that even obstinacy and error can endure the fires of persecution but it is genuine truth and that alone which comes out pure and unchanged from the severer tortures of debate  it will ever be our truest praise therefore to join the noble apologist in his encomiums on freedom the only permanent basis on which religion or virtue can be established nor can we less approve his frequent recommendations of politeness cheerfulness and good humor in the prosecution of our most important enquiries the morose contemptuous and surly species of composition is generally an appendage to bigotry as appears in instances innumerable both among the mistaken friends and enemies of religion on the contrary the amiable qualities of cheerfulness and good humor cast a kind of sunshine over a composition and naturally engage us in favor of the writer they resemble that gentle smile that often lights up the human countenance the neverfailing indication of a humane temper how naturally then must we be disposed to listen how open our minds to receive conviction when we perceive our opponents intention is benevolent when we perceive that his aim is not victory but information that he means not to insult but to instruct us  so far out of an unfeigned regard to truth it should be my boast to take party with the noble writer on the same principle it will now be necessary to depart from him for not content with establishing the free exercise of reason and the way of cheerfulness in treating the subjects of religion and morals he revolts from the principle on which the rational advocates for religion were willing to have joined him and appeals to a new test the test of ridicule this in his two first treatises he attempts to establish as a surer method of conviction and that ridicule which had hitherto been employed in disgracing known falsehood he informs us may be successfully applied to the investigation of unknown truth  he has gained a numerous train of followers in this new opinion it may be therefore necessary to examine its foundations  section ii it is great pity the noble author has not condescended to a little more precision in treating the question now before us he indulges the gaiety of spirit the freedom of wit and humor so far that a reader who seeks information rather than amusement is often at a loss to know where his argument or even his opinion lies this no doubt was in part owing to a generous abhorrence of pedantry which he takes all occasions of exposing to contempt yet a better reason may possibly be alleged for in recommending and enforcing the use of ridicule what could be more natural and proper than the power of ridicule itself to draw a striking picture of demure folly and solemn imposture was a masterpiece of prudence but to have argued seriously would have destroyed his argument it would have been a tacit confession that there is a deeper foundation on which ridicule itself must rest he must therefore have overturned even while he intended to establish this new pillar and ground of truth  here then we discover why the noble author is so witty in defense of wit and chooses to maintain the cause of raillery by raillery itself he smiles at his adversary who had attempted to find coherence in his first letter vol iii p     0  he glories in being an adventurer in the way of miscellany where cuttings and shreds of learning with various fragments and points of wit are drawn together and tacked in any fantastic form where the wild and whimsical under the name of the odd and pretty succeed in the room of the graceful and beautiful where justness and accuracy of thought are set aside as too constraining and of too painful an aspect to be endured in the agreeable and more easy commerce of gallantry and modern wit ibid p   etc  hence with reason he proceeds to his conclusion that grounds and foundations are of no moment in a kind of work which according to modern establishment has properly neither top nor bottom beginning nor end vol iii p     it must be confessed that in the conduct of the literary warfare they who depend on the regularity and force of arguments have but a sorry chance against these nimble adventurers in the sallies of wit and ridicule these hussars in disputation who confide more in their agility than strength or discipline and by sudden evolutions and timely skulking can do great mischiefs without receiving any ill qualified indeed is the saturnine complexion of the dry reasoner to cope with this mercurial spirit of modern wit the formalist is under a double difficulty not only to conquer his enemy but to find him though it must be owned the search is a harder task than the victory and more mortifying as it ends in showing us that this redoubted figure of ridicule armed at all points like reason is no other than an airy phantom tricked up by the goddess of folly to confound formal wisdom as that other in the poet to mislead his hero tum dea nube cava tenuem sine viribus umbram in faciem aeneae visu mirabile monstrum dardaniis ornat telis clypeumque jubasque divini assimilat capitis dat inania verba dat sine mente sonum gressusque effingit euntis illum autem absentem aeneas in praelia poscit tunc levis haud ultra latebras jam quaerit imago sed sublime volans nubi se immiscuit atrae virg aen x     etc    since therefore the noble writer declines treating this subject in the way of close argument we must take our chance with him upon the terms he has been pleased to prescribe we must be content to go a gleaning for his opinions and pick them up as they lie thinly scattered through a wide extent of pages  but however his lordships high quality may exempt him from the established forms of argument it were the height of imprudence in writers of inferior rank to attempt an imitation of his peculiar manner his delicate raillery therefore will best be repayed by sober reasoning this sure his most zealous admirers cannot take amiss it is the noble authors allowed maxim that a jest which will not bear a serious examination is certainly false wit vol i p     neither was he a stranger to the methodical species of composition as appears from that fine chain of moral reasoning which connects his enquiry concerning virtue where he proceeds through the work with a pace equally regular and majestic indeed should we form our idea of him from the attitudes in which his sorry mimics present him to our view we should see him laboring through a confused mass of words and random halfmeanings entangled in his own argument and throwing himself into every unnatural and awkward posture to make his way though in vain into common sense but this is a very bad picture of our noble author though it be all his affected admirers can exhibit of him in their own productions deformities are easily copied true features and graceful attitudes are caught by the hand of a master only for in reality none ever knew the value of order and proportion better than lord shaftesbury he knew that confusion can only tend to disgrace truth or disguise falsehood method indeed may degenerate into stiffness but to despise order is the silliest affectation especially when the slovenly and consused form of the composition if it may be properly said to have any pretends to the character of elegance it becomes of all others the grossest and most contemptible pedantry  section iii the divine author of our being having given us several different powers sense imagination memory and reason as the inlets preservers and improvers of knowledge it may be proper here briefly to remark their respective provinces as the senses are the fountains whence we derive all our ideas so these are infinitely combined and associated by the imagination memory preserves these assemblages of things reason compares distinguishes and separates them by this means determining their differences and pointing out which are real and which fictitious  the passions are no more than the several modes of pleasure and pain to which the author of nature has wisely subjected us for our own and each others preservation love hope and joy fair pleasures smiling train hate fear and grief the family of pain to these we may add two more of a mixed kind pity and contempt which seem to partake of both pain and pleasure  as the senses and imagination are the sources of all our ideas it follows that they are the sources of all our modes of pleasure and pain that is of all our passions nor is any passion strongly excited in the soul by mere knowledge only till the imagination has formed to itself some kind of picture or representation of the good or evil apprehended thus aristotle justly defines fear to be a kind of pain arising from the phantasy or appearance of future evil  arist rhet   ii c      consistently with this he again truly observes that though all men know they must die yet while death is at a distance they never think of it  ib   ii c      the same may be observed concerning the belief of future existence which never sways the conduct of mankind till the imagination is strongly impressed by steady and repeated contemplation  as therefore it appears to be the province of sense and imagination to present and associate ideas but not to mark their real differences and as the passions are always excited according to the suggestions of these two powers it follows that apparent not real good and evil are universally the objects of all our passions thus the respective objects of joy fear anger are apparent good apparent danger apparent injury universally whether the object be real or fictitious while it is apparent that is while the imagination represents it as real it will produce its relative passion  it is the province of reason alone to correct the passions imagination and passion can never correct themselves every assemblage of ideas every impression made upon them has an object apparently real therefore without the aids of reason the active and separating power the mind can never distinguish real from fictitious objects and as it is the province of reason only thus to regulate the senses and imagination and to determine when they impress a truth or suggest a falsehood so it is no less the province of the same corrective power to determine concerning the modes of apparent good and evil and thus to fix both our opinions and passions on their proper objects some of these truths are both finely and philosophically expressed by our great poet in the following passage but know that in the soul are many lesser faculties that serve reason as chief among these fancy next her office holds of all external things which the five watchful senses represent she forms imaginations aerie shapes which reason joining or disjoining frames all what we affirm or what deny and call our knowledge or opinion parad lost b v  00 etc   upon this just dependence of imagination and passion on the superior and leading faculty of reason the whole weight of this question concerning the application and use of ridicule depends but that we may obtain as wide a view as possible of our subject it may be proper to ascertain the nature limits and ends of the different kinds of literary composition which take their rise from these three different powers as they subsist in man thus we shall discover to which of them the way of ridicule is to be referred and determine how far it may or may not with propriety be regarded as a test of truth  perhaps there is no species of writing except only that of mere narration but what will fall under the denomination of poetry eloquence or argument the first lays hold of the imagination the second through the imagination seizes the passions the last addresseth itself to the reason of mankind the immediate essential end therefore of poetry is to please of eloquence to persuade of argument to instruct to this end the poet dwells on such images as are beautiful the orator selects every circumstance that is affecting the philosopher only admits what is true but as all these in their several kinds of writing address themselves to man who is compounded of imagination passion and reason so they seldom confine themselves to their respective provinces but lay hold of each others art the more effectually to gain admission and success to their own yet still the masters in these various kinds of composition know how to keep their several boundaries distinct not to make unwarrantable inroads into each others provinces nor remove those lines which nature has prescribed but so to limit their excursions that the intelligent may always know what is designed a poem an oration or an argument would it not carry us too far from our subject it might perhaps be both a new and pleasing speculation to point out the writers in these several kinds who have been most remarkably excellent or defective with regard to this just union of these three species of composition at present it must suffice to have hinted such a criticism which the reader may easily prosecute   thus the judicious poet though his immediate and universal aim is beautiful imitation yet in order to become more pleasing endeavors often to be interesting always to be rational his application being made to man should he let loose imagination to its random flights he must shock the reason of every penetrating observer hence appears the necessity of cultivating that maxim in poetical composition which the two best of french critics boileau and bouhours have so much insisted on that all poetical beauty must be founded in truth que si on me demand ce que cest que cet agreement et ce fell  a mon avis il consiste principalement a ne jamais presenter au lecteur que des penss vrais et des expressions justes oeuvres de boileau tom i pref p     car enfin pour vous dire un peu par order ce quc je pense la dessu la verite est la premiere qualite et comme le fondement des pensees les plus belles sont vitieuses ou plutot celles qui passent pour belles et qui semblent letre ne le sont pas en effet si ce fonds leur manque bouhours man de bien pens p       because in the unlimited excursions of fancy though one faculty should approve yet another is disgusted though imagination acquiesce in false beauty reason will reject it with disdain thus although the primary and essential end of poetry is to please by imitation yet as it is addressed to man instruction makes a necessary though an adventitious part of its character hence the debate mentioned by strabo l i between eratosthenes and some of the ancients may easily be decided the first insisting that pleasure the other that instruction was the only end of poetry they were both wrong as it appears that these two ends must always be united in some degree however eratosthenes was nearer the truth as he alleged the essential end it is no bad description given by mr dryden and others of the end of poetry that it is to instruct by pleasing though upon the whole it throws more weight on the circumstance of instruction than the thing will bear the admirers of lord s who love pompous declamation may see a great deal said on this subject and with little precision in stradas third prolusion     from this view of things we may in passing further see the nature limits and comparative excellence of the various kinds of poetry the descriptive holds entirely of the imagination and may be termed pure poetry or imitation yet with regard to the secondary end of instruction it seems to merit only the lowest place because it is then perfect when it satisfies the imagination and while it offends not reason or the affections nothing further with regard to these faculties is expected from it the tragic comic satiric and the elegy as they chiefly regard the passions and the heart of man so they draw much of their force from the sources of eloquence on the other hand the didactic as it makes its chief application to reason though it retains so much of the graces of imagination as to merit the name of poetry is principally of the logical species the epic by its great extent includes all these kinds by turns and is therefore the noblest both in its primary and secondary intention much indeed has been occasionally asserted by several writers concerning the superior dignity of the tragic species thus the excellent mr addison a perfect tragedy is the noblest production of humane nature spectator no       but this has been more in the way of assirmation than proof their opinion seems to have been founded on a mistaken interpretation of aristotle whose supposed authority on this subject has generally passed unquestioned but whoever shall thoroughly examine the sentiments of the grand master will find he only meant to assert that the mode of imitation in tragedy is more forcible and therefore superior to that of the epic kind because in the last the action is only told in the former it is visibly represented this is the truth but if we consider not the mode of imitation but the subjects imitated if we consider the comparative greatness of the action which these two kinds of poetry can comprehend and the moral ends of instruction no less than the variety and beauty of description which constitutes the very essence of poetry we shall find the epic greatly superior on account of the extent and importance of those actions and the variety of characters which it is capable of involving thus for instance such an action as the death of oedipus or cato may be more perfectly imitated because visibly represented in tragedy than in the epos but a much greater and more extensive action such as the establishment of an empire with all its subordinate episodes religious political and moral cannot be comprehended or exhibited in tragedy while yet they may be perfectly described in the epopee  so much concerning poetry will be found to have relation to our subject but as the question concerning ridicule will turn chiefly on the proper subordination of eloquence it will be necessary to consider this kind of composition in a more particular manner  eloquence then is no other than a species of poetry applied to the particular end of persuasion for persuasion can only be effected by rowzing the passions of the soul and these we have seen are only to be moved by a force impressed on the imagination assuming the appearance of truth which is the essential nature of poetical composition thus the lord verulam in all persuasions that are wrought by eloquence and other impression of like nature which paint and disguise the true appearance of things the chief recommendation unto reason is from the imagination de aug scient   ii  and the judicious strabo consistently with this theory tells us that in fact the oratorial elocution was but an imitation of the poetical this appeared first and was approved they who imitated it took off the measures but still preserved all the other parts of poetry in their writings such were cadmus the milesian pherecydes and hecataeus their followers then took something more from what was left and at length elocution descended into the prose which is now among us  strabo lib i     thus as the passions must have an apparent object of good or evil offered by the imagination in order to excite them so eloquence must offer apparent evidence ere it can be received and acquiesced in for the mind cannot embrace known falsehood so that every opinion which eloquence instills though it be the pure result of certain fictitious images impressed on the fancy is always regarded as the result of rational conviction and received by the mind as truth  hence we may perceive the just foundation of the wellknown maxim in rhetorical composition artis est celare artem in every other art where the end is pleasure instruction or admiration the greater art the master displays the more effectually he gains his purpose but where the end is persuasion the discovery of his art must defeat its force and design for ere he can persuade he must seem to apply to his hearers reason while in fact he is working on his imagination and affections now this once known must defeat his purpose because nothing can persuade but what has the appearance of truth  hence too we may see where the true medium lies between the too frequent use and delicate avoidance of poetical images in eloquence metaphors similies bold figures and glowing expressions are proper so far as they point the imagination to the main subject on which the passion is to be excited when they begin to amuse they grow absurd and here by the way lies the essential difference between the epic and tragic composition for the epic tending chiefly to admiration and instruction allows a full display of art but the tragic being of the persuasive kind must only regard and touch upon poetical images in this single view as they tend to rowze the passions of the soul macrobius saturnal   iv passim has collected many elegant examples of this poctic elocution from the eneid he has ranged them in classes and pointed out the fountains whence the great poet drew his pathos and sure it may with truth be affirmed that the masterstrokes of that divine work are rather of the tragic than the epic species  these remarks will enable us to discover the impropriety of an opinion commonly held see mr humes essay on eloquence  that the reason why eloquence had such power and wrought such wonders in athens and rome was because it had become the general taste and study of the times that consequently these cities were more sensible to its charms and therefore more warmly affected by it now though with regard to pure poetry or strict argument where either pleasure or truth are the purposed ends this reasoning might hold yet when applied to eloquence it seems to be without foundation for where ignorance is predominant there any application to the fancy or the passions is most likely to wear the appearance of reason and therefore the most likely to persuade as men improve in knowledge such application must proportionably lose its force and true reasoning prevail hence it should seem that they who make the constituent principles of eloquence familiar to their imagination must of all others be best enabled to separate truth from its appearances and distinguish between argument and coloring an artful oration will indeed afford great pleasure to one who has applied himself to the study of rhetoric yet not so as that he shall be persuaded by it on the contrary his pleasure consists in a reflex act of the understanding and arises from the very circumstance which prevents persuasion a discovery of the masters art  the true reason therefore why eloquence gained such mighty power in these famed republics was because the orators addressed themselves to the people as their judges here the art triumphed for it had not reason to instruct but imagination and passion to control accordingly we find that no sooner was the popular government destroyed and the supreme power lodged in a single hand than eloquence began sensibly to languish and decay the mighty orators who could sway the passions of a mixed multitude found their art baffled and overthrown when opposed to the cool determinations of cunning ministers or the determined will of arbitrary masters thus with great judgment though not much honesty the roman poet exhorts his countrymen to disdain the low accomplishments of eloquence he knew they belonged to a republic excudent alii spirantia mollius era  orabunt causas melius  tu regere imperio populos roman memento hae tibi crunt arts eneid   vi   with the same penetration he lays the scene in a popular assembly when he gives us a picture of eloquence triumphant i mean in that sine passage where he compares neptune stilling the noise of the waves to an orator appeasing the madness of the people ac veluti magno in populo cum saepe coorta est seditio saevitque animis ignobile vulgus jamque saces et saxa volant furor arma ministrat tum pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum quem conspexere silent arrectisque auribus astant ille regit dictis animos et pectora mulcet sic cunctus pelagi cecidit fragor en   i   it is true we have a supposed instance on record of the power of tullys eloquence after liberty was destroyed even on the great destroyer himself when we read the oration pro ligario  we stand amazed at its effects for sure there is nothing equal to them in the composition itself and it appears an event almost unaccountable that caesar who was himself an accomplished orator who knew all the windings of the art and was at the same time of the most determined spirit should be so shaken on this occasion as to tremble drop his papers and acquit the prisoner though many have attributed this to the force of tullys elocution casaubon sir w temple mr hume etc  it seems rather to have been the effect of cesars art we know with what unwearied application he courted ciceros friendship he saw where his vanity and his weakness lay with perfect address therefore he played back the orators art upon himself his concern was feigned and his mercy artificial as he knew that nothing could so effectually win tully to his party as giving him the pride of having conquered caesar  but whatever of truth there may be in this conjecture so much is evident that the scene where alone eloquence can work its mighty effects is that of a popular assembly an absolute monarchy quenches it at once nor can public freedom itself give it any considerable play where the public freedom has any firmer basis than that of a mere democracy for where the councils of a nation depend on the united reason of elected representatives or wise and cunning statesmen though the labored essays of eloquence may often amuse they will seldom determine this seems to be the case of our own age and country and were it necessary to enlarge on this subject it might be made appear that they who complain of the decay of public eloquence among us assign a cause which has no real existence when they attribute that decay to a neglect of the art see mr humes essay on eloquence  while in fact it necessarily arises from the ruling principles of the times and the nature of our constitution  thus eloquence gains its end of persuasion by offering apparent truth to the imagination as argument gains its proper end of conviction by offering real truth to the understanding mr hobbes seems to have been well aware of this distinction this says he viz laying evidence before the mind is called teaching the hearer is therefore said to learn but if there be not such evidence then such teaching is called persuasion and begets no more in the hearer than what is in the speakers bare opinion hobbes on hum nature   here then we perceive that the consequences of eloquence with regard to speculative instruction and inquiry are of a very different nature from those which relate to morals and action to instruction or inquiry every species of eloquence must for ever be an enemy for though it may lead the mind to acquiesce in a just opinion yet it leads it to acquiesce upon a false foundation it puts the hearer or reader in the speakers or writers power and though he be so honest as to lead him in the path of truth yet still he leads him blindfold in this sense and under this limitation mr lockes remark is true we must allow that all the art of rhetoric besides order and clearness all the artificial and figurative application of words eloquence has invented are for nothing else but to insinuate wrong ideas move the passions and thereby mislead the judgment and so indeed are perfect cheats lock on hum und   but if we regard what is of more importance to man than mere speculative truth i mean the practical ends of human life and moral action then eloquence assumes a higher nature nor is there in this practical sense any necessary connection between moving the passions and misleading the judgment for though the ends of truth and persuasion are then essentially different when the orator strikes the imagination with fictitious images in which case falsehood becomes apparent truth and eloquence the instrument of deceit yet the ends of persuasion and conviction opinion and knowledge concur when such impressions are made on the imagination and passions as consist with the dictates of right reason in this case eloquence comes in to the aid of argument and impresses the truths which logic teaches in a warmer and more effectual manner it paints real good and evil in all the glowing colors of imagination and thus inflames the heart with double ardor to embrace the one and reject the other  nay so far is eloquence from being the universal instrument of practical deceit that on the contrary it should seem the moral is more natural than the immoral application of it because ere the dishonest application can take place circumstances must be wrested and misrepresentations imposed on the fancy in opposition to truth and reason whereas in the proper application nothing further is necessary than to draw out and impress those images and analogies of things which really exist in nature  it may be further observed that as eloquence is of a vague unsteady nature merely relative to the imaginations and passions of mankind so there must be several orders or degrees of it subordinate to each other in dignity yet each perfect in their kind the common end of each is persuasion the means are different according to the various capacities fancies and affections of those whom the artist attempts to persuade the pathetic orator who throws a congregation of enthusiasts into tears and groanings would raise affections of a very different nature should he attempt to proselyte an english parliament as on the other hand the finest speaker that ever commanded the house would in vain point the thunder of his eloquence on a quakermeeting so again with regard to the oratory if it may be called so of the bar at a country assize for the higher courts of justice admit not eloquence it is easy to observe what a different tour the learned council takes in addressing himself to the judge or jury he is well aware that what passes with the one for argument of proof would be derided by the other as pastboard declamation this difference in the kind with respect to the eloquence of the pulpit is no less remarkable in different countries thus the very agreeable and sensible voltaire observes that in france where reasoning has little connection with religion a sermon is a long declamation spoken with rapture and enthusiasm that in italy where taste and virtue give a tincture to superstition itself a sermon is a kind of devotional comedy that in england where religion submits to reason it is a solid dissertation sometimes a dry one which is read to the congregation without action or elocution the passage in the original is thus un sermon en france est une longue declamation scrupuleusement divisee en trois points et recitee avec enthousiasme en angleterre un sermon est une dissertation solid et quelquesois seche quun homme lit au peuple sans geste et sans aucune eclat de voix en italy cest une comedy spirituelle    and he justly concludes that the discourse which raises a french audience to the highest pitch of devotion would throw an english one into a fit of laughter  hence too and hence alone we may account for a fact which however seemingly improbable is too wellknown to be doubted of that although in france the applauded pulpit eloquence is of the enthusiastic in england of the severe and rational species yet the taste of these two nations in tragedy or theatrical eloquence is mutually reversed the english are enthusiastic the french severe and rational now though this fact may carry the appearance of selfcontradiction yet on the principle here laid down the known circumstances of the two kingdoms will explain it sufficiently in england a general spirit of reasoning and enquiry has extinguished the natural enthusiasms of the human mind in religious subjects while our unrestrained warmth of imagination and habitual reverence for the noble irregularities of shakespeare concur to make us despise the rigid laws of the stage on the contrary in france the severities of the academy have utterly quenched the high tragic spirit while as yet religious criticism has made but little progress among the subjects of the most christian king  in further proof of this principle we may appeal to ancient fact to the progress of eloquence in greece there we find it first appeared decked in all the glowing colors of poetry afterward in an age of more polished manners and extensive knowledge when the rhetors attempted to carry this kind of eloquence to a still higher degree they found the times would not bear it they were baffled in their attempt as succeeding ages grew more knowing they grew more fastidious and refined the orators were obliged gradually to lower and bring down eloquence from its high standard till at length it gained a form and character entirely new as we find it in xenophons chastised manner of attic elegance see the passage quoted above from strabo p        to conclude with one proof more in favor of this principle it appears that these different kinds were acknowledged sufficiently in ancient rome though the true distinction between them seems not to have been thoroughly perceived unless by tully himself the correct and attic species having gained a number of admirers under the patronage of sallust who first encouraged it in rome sic sallustio vigente amputatae sententiae et verba ante expectatum cadentia et obscura brevitas fuere pro cultu senec epist    many were the debates concerning the superior force and propriety of this or the more elevated manner the patrons of the attic style derided cicero as being loose tumid and exuberant constat nec ciceroni quidem obtrectatores defuisse quibus inflatus et tumens nec satis pressus supra modum exultans et superfluens et parum atticus videretur dialog apud tacit    on the contrary he too had his partisans who despised the calm and correct species as void of energy and power mihi falli multum videntur qui solos esse atticos credunt tenues et lucidos et significantes sed quadam eloquentiae frugalitate contentos ac manum semper intra pallium continentes quintil    thus by overlooking the relative nature of eloquence they mutually fell into an extreme both forgetting that either of these kinds might be of superior propriety and force according to the imaginations passions and capacities of those to whom they should be applied but tully with a superior sagacity saw clearly where the true distinction lay for speaking of calvus a patronizer of the attic manner he says hence his eloquence gained a high reputation among the learned and attentive but among the vulgar for whom eloquence was chiefly formed it was of no esteem sed ad calvum revertamur  ejus oration nimia religione attenuata doctis et attente audientibus erat illustris a multitudine autem et a soro cui nata eloquentia est devorabatur in brut     now among these several kinds of eloquence justness of thought and expression striking figures argument adorned with every pathetic grace are the characters of the highest sophistry and buffoonry ambiguous and dishonest hints coarse language false and indecent images are the characters of the lowest between these two extremes there lies a variety of intermediate kinds each ascending toward the highest in proportion as they abound with its proper characters for as the imagination and passions are then most refined and just when they bear to the same point with reason so that species of eloquence is the noblest which tends to conduct them thither les egyptiens comparoient ceux qui preferent le coloris au dessein dans la peinture a ceux qui en matiere deloquence et de poesy preferent les pensees brillantes aux pensees justes ciceron le maitre et le modele de leloquence latin a dit en appliquant sa reflection a lorateur que nous laissons bientot des tableaux qui nous attirent dabord par la force du coloris au lieu que nous revenons toujours a ceux qui excellent par la beauty du dessein qui est le vrai caractere de lantique sethos   ii p  0    on this principle and on this alone we may with propriety and precision determine the comparative excellence and dignity of those who aspire to the palm of eloquence on this principle it seems to be that a severe but able judge prefers demosthenes to tully see dr swifts letter to a young clergyman  and on this principle he deserves the preference  thus we are at length arrived at the point where eloquence and argument persuasion and conviction unite where the orators art becomes subservient to the interests of truth and only labors to adorn and recommend her  we come now to the third species of composition that of argument which applying solely to the reason of man and to the proof or investigation of truth is of a more simple and uncompounded nature in its principles and therefore needs not to be so particularly explained for pleasure being the primary end of poetry and persuasion that of eloquence the real nature of things is often in part disguised and compelled to bend to the imagination and the passions but truth being the end of argument the varying colors of imagination and passion must be drawn off and human reason itself bend to the real uniform nature of things  yet on this occasion it may be proper to remark that the rational faculty in man cannot be comprehensive or perfect in its operations without a union with a strong imagination and this not only in the arts of poetry or eloquence but in the severest investigations of truth for reason alone cannot search out new ideas but only compare and distinguish those which sense and imagination present to her and the senses being of small extent imagination is therefore the great universal instrument of human knowledge and human action without the aids of imagination therefore reason works in a contracted sphere being destitute of materials unable to make the necessary excursions into the immensity of nature and wanting that power which alone can range through the whole extent of created being and bring home all the possible and apparent analogies of things setting them before her discerning eye and submitting them to her sovereign approbation or dislike from this noble union arises that boundless penetration which so far surpasses mere judgment and which according as it is exerted in poetry eloquence philosophy morals or religion strikes into the various and untroden paths of nature and truth forms the distinguished names of homer shakespeare milton demosthenes tully aristotle bacon lock bail pascal newton hooker berkley warburton giving that essential superiority and preeminence which has ever been first the envy and then the admiration of mankind  thus as it appeared above how necessary the restraints of reason are to the perfection of works of imagination so here it is evident that a full union of imagination is necessary to the perfect operations of reason taken singly they are each defective when their powers are joined they constitute true genius  but however requisite the force of imagination may be to the perfection of reason and the production of true genius yet still reason remains the superior and corrective power therefore every representation of poetry or eloquence which only apply to the fancy and affections must finally be examined and decided upon must be tried rejected or received as the reasoning faculty shall determine  and thus reason alone is the detecter of falsehood and the test of truth  section iv he who would judge aright of the proportions of a spacious dome must not creep from one corner to another by the help of a glimmering taper but rather light up a central branch which may illuminate the whole at once by doing something like this in our remarks on the three different kinds of composition we have enabled the intelligent reader to see with ease that wit raillery and ridicule in every shape they can possibly assume are no other than so many species of poetry or eloquence  pure wit when not applied to the characters of men is properly a species of poetry it amuses and delights the imagination by those sudden assemblages and pleasing pictures of things which it creates and from every common occasion can raise such striking appearances as throw the most phlegmatic tempers into a convulsion of goodhumoured mirth and undesigning laughter  but ridicule or raillery which is the subject of our inquiry has a further scope and intention it solely regards the opinions passions actions and characters of men and may properly be denominated that species of writing which excites contempt with laughter  still more particularly we may observe that as eloquence in general is but the application of poetry to the end of persuasion so ridicule in particular is no more than the application of that particular species of poetry called wit to the same end of persuasion it tends to excite contempt in the same manner as the other modes of eloquence raise love pity terror rage or hatred in the heart of man  now that contempt which certain objects raise in the mind is a particular mode of passion the objects of this passion are apparent falsehood incongruity impropriety or turpitude of certain kinds but as the object of every excited passion must be examined by reason ere we can determine whether it be proper or improper real or fictitious so every object that excites contempt must fall under this general rule thus before it can be determined whether our contempt be just reason alone must examine circumstances separate ideas distinguish truth from its appearances decide upon restrain and correct the passion  thus ridicule is no other than a species of eloquence and accordingly we find it mentioned and expressly treated as such by the best writers of antiquity aristotle as in every subject leads the way as ridicule seems to be of some use in pleading it was the opinion of gorgias that you ought to confound your adversarys serious argument by raillery and his raillery by serious argument and he judged well  arist rhet   iii c       here he first gives the sentiments of a sage and then confirms them by his own authority  to offer all that tully has said upon the subject of ridicule would be to transcribe a considerable part of his second book de oratore after having gone through several topics of rhetoric he comes at length to this of ridicule and assigns to the elder caesar the task of explaining the force and application of this art in the course of his reasonings on this subject he affirms first that ridicule is a branch of eloquence est autem plane oratoris movere risum  res saepe quas argumentis dilui non facile est joco risuque dissolvit      dly that certain kinds of turpitude or incongruity are its proper object locus autem et regio quasi ridiculi turpitudine quadam et deformitate continetur  nec insignis improbitas et scelere juncta nec rursus miseria insignis agitata ridetur  quamobrem materies omnis ridiculorum est in istis vitiis  quae neque odio magno nec misericordia maxima digna sunt      dly that the orator must be temperate in the application of it in quo non modo illud praecipitur ne quid insulse sed etiam si quid perridicule possis vitandumest oratori utrumque ne aut scurrilis jocus sit aut mimicus      thly that its force may consist either in thought or expression but that its perfection lies in a union of both duo sunt genera sacetiarum quorum alterum re tractatur alterum dicto  nam quod quibuscunque verbis dixeris facetum tamen est re continetur quod mutatis verbis salem amittit in verbis habet leporem omnem  maxim autem homines delectari si quando risus conjuncte re verboque moveatur    and lastly that after all it is but the lowest kind of eloquence est mea sententia vel tenuissimus ingenii fructus de oratore   ii passim     quintilian builds chiefly on tully when he treats of ridicule in the sixth book of his institutions he too considers it as a branch of eloquence and gives rules for its efficacy and restraint risum judicis movendo et illos tristes solvit affectus et animum ab intention rerum frequenter avertit et aliquando etiam resicit et a satietate vel a fatigatione renovat  habet enim ut cicero dicit sedem in deformitate aliqua et turpitudine  rerum autem saepe ut dixi maximarum momenta vertit cum odium iramque frequentissime frangat  ea quae dicit vir bonus omnia salva dignitate ac verecundia dicet nimium enim risus pretium est si probitatis impendio constat quint inst   vi     now in consequence of these proofs a few observations will naturally arise with regard to ridicule in particular similar to those which were made in the last section upon eloquence in general  as first ridicule must render every proposition it supports apparently true ere it can be received and acquiesced it thus every opinion which ridicule instills though it be the pure result of certain images impressed on the imagination by which the passion of contempt is excited is always regarded as the conviction of reason and received by the mind as truth and thus by offering apparent truth ridicule gains its end of persuasion  again it may be observed that the consequences of ridicule with regard to speculative instruction or inquiry are of a very different nature from those which relate to morals and action to the first it must ever be an enemy but to the latter it may be an enemy or friend according as it is fairly or dishonestly applied it comes in to the aid of argument when its impressions on the imagination and passions are consistent with the real nature of things when it strikes the fancy and affections with fictitious images it becomes the instrument of deceit  thus ridicule may befriend either truth or falsehood and as it is morally or immorally applied may illustrate the one or disguise the other yet it should seem that the moral is more natural than the immoral application of ridicule inasmuch as truth is more congenial to the mind than falsehood and so the real more easily made apparent than the sictitious images of things  ridicule therefore being of a vague unsteady nature merely relative to the imaginations and passions of mankind there must be several orders or degrees of it suited to the fancies and capacities of those whom the artist attempts to influence among these several kinds of ridicule justness of thought and expression adorned with striking figures is the highest coarse language buffoonry false and indecent images are the characters of the lowest for as the imagination and passions are then most refined and just when they bear to the same point with reason so that species of ridicule is most genuine which tends to conduct them thither  but however ridicule may impress the idea of apparent turpitude or falsehood on the imagination yet still reason remains the superior and corrective power therefore every representation of ridicule which only applies to the fancy and affections must finally be examined and decided upon must be tried rejected or received as the reasoning faculty shall determine  and thus ridicule can never be a detector of falsehood or a test of truth  section v in further confirmation of these truths the direct proofs of which may possibly lie somewhat remote from common apprehension let us appeal to experience to the general sense and practice of mankind and here we shall find that contempt and ridicule are always founded on preconceived opinion whatever be the foundation of it whether reason or imagination truth or falsehood  for in fact do not we see every different party and association of men despising and deriding each other according to their various manner of thought speech and action does not the courtier deride the foxhunter and the foxhunter the courtier what is more ridiculous to a beau than a philosopher to a philosopher than a beau drunkards are the jest of sober men and sober men of drunkards physicians lawyers soldiers priests and freethinkers are the standing subjects of ridicule to one another wisdom and folly the virtuous and the vile the learned and ignorant the temperate and debauched all give and return the jest according to the various impressions of fancy and affection the aspects of things are varied and consequently the same object seen under these different lights and attitudes must in one mind produce approbation in another contempt  if we examine the conduct of political bodies or religious sects we shall find it of a similar nature each of these railly every other according to the prejudices they have imbibed in favor of their own system how contemptible and ridiculous are the european forms of government in the eyes of an asiatic a venetian was introduced to the king of pegu when this prince was informed by him that the venetians had no king he laughed so excessively that he lost his breath and could not speak for a good while recueil des voyages etc  and do not we on this side the hellespont repay them in their own kind are we a whit more united among ourselves in our ideas of the ridiculous when applied to modes of empire what is more contemptible to an englishman than that slavish submission to arbitrary will and lawless power which prevails almost universally on the continent and they are little acquainted with the state of affairs abroad who know not that within the precincts of tyranny english freedom is one of the commonest topics of raillery and ridicule every mans judging for himself is the subject of the frenchmans drollery one mans judging for all is the subject of ours the case is parallel with regard to religious tenets where people are at liberty to speak their thoughts is there any species of invective which the church of rome has not exercised upon all who have dissented from its measures and have not the divines of the reformed churches been as arrant droles in vindication of their respective systems what ribaldry and coarse banter has been thrown nay rather what has not been thrown by the freethinkers on religion and christianity and how basely have some of our divines prostituted their pens in former days by descending to the same dirty level even the soureness of puritanism nay the sullenness of quakerism have sometimes relaxed and yielded themselves up to the love of joking and sly hints in demure phrase and sober countenance have as plainly spoken their contempt of those they pitied as the loud laughter and grimace of worldly men the disdain of those they profess to hate  but what need we wonder that a difference of opinion in such weighty affairs as those of government and religion should inspire a mutual contempt when we see that any considerable variation of manners in the most ordinary circumstances of life has the same effect the customs of ancient times have been held so ridiculous by many moderns that honest homer has been branded as a dunce only because he has recorded them what raillery has been thrown on the venerable bard as well as the hero he describes only because he has told us that patroclus acted in the capacity of cook for himself and his friend achilles il  and that the princess nausicaa followed by all her maids went down to wash the kings and queens clothes along with her own odyss  rebecca and her historian genesis have fallen under the same ignorant censure because she went down to draw water and so have the daughters of augustus for spinning their fathers clothes when he was master of the world thus the undebauched simplicity of ancient times becomes the jest of modern luxury and folly from the same principle any new mode of speech or action seen in our own times appears ridiculous to those who give way to the sallies of uninformed contempt and laughter what superior airs of mirth and gayety may be seen in a club of citizens passing judgment on the scotch the western or any other remote provincial dialect while at the other end of the town the stream of ridicule runs as strong on the manners and dialect of the exchange the least unusual circumstance of habit beyond what the fashion prescribes is by turns so sensibly ridiculous that one half of the expense of dress seems to consist in accommodating it to the dictates and caprice of the current opinion and it is a just complaint of the greatest tragic poet of the age that this indulged spirit of ridicule is a fundamental obstruction to the improvement of the french theater we dare not says he hazard any thing new upon the stage in the presence of a people whose constant practice is to ridicule every thing that is not fashionable nous craignons de hazarder sur la scene de spectacles nouveaux devant une nation accoutumee a tourner en ridicule tout ce qui nest pas dusage voltaire disc sur la trag     neither is the taste of mankind less capricious with regard to the methods of ridicule quaenam tandem in loquendo aut in scribendo quasi titillatione risum lacessunt dictum unum aut alterum brevicula narratio nonnibil repentinum et fortuitum et recens et novitate sua primum vavassor de ludicra dictione    than the objects of it how many sayings and repartees are recorded from antiquity as the quintessence of raillery which among us only raise a laugh because they are insipid tully himself often attempts in vain to extort a smile from his modern reader even the sales plautini have in great measure lost their poignancy there is a certain mode of ridicule peculiar to every age and country what a curious contrast to each other are an italian and a dutch buffoon and i suppose the raillery of a french and a russian drole are as different as the nimble pranks of a monkey from the rude gambols of a bear even the same country has numerous subdivisions and under species of ridicule what is high humor at wapping is rejected as nauseous in the city what is delicate raillery in the city grows coarse and intolerable as you approach st jamess and many a well meant joke that passes unheeded in all these various districts would set an innocent country village in an uproar of laughter  this subject might be much enlarged on for the modes and objects of ridicule are as indefinite as the imagined combinations of things but from these examples drawn from the conduct of particulars it appears no less than from the general nature and faculties of man that ridicule has no other source than imagination passion prejudice and preconceived opinion and therefore can never be the detecter of falsehood or test of truth  section vi the cause might be safely rested here yet to throw a still clearer light on the subject of our enquiry let us now examine what his lordship has advanced in support of his new method of investigation and as the noble writer has not thought it expedient to descend often to the argumentative way we must make the most of what we find in him that looks like a reason  he tells his friend that nothing is ridiculous except what is deformed nor is any thing proof against raillery except what is handsome and just  one may defy the world to turn real bravery and generosity into ridicule a man must be soundly ridiculous who with all the wit imaginable would go about to ridicule wisdom or laugh at honesty or good manners vol i p           here we have a mixture of equivocal language and pompous declamation if he means to assert that nothing is ridiculous except what is apparently deformed the proposition is true but foreign to the purpose because through the error of imagination things apparently deformed may be really beautiful if he means to assert that nothing can be made to appear ridiculous but what is really deformed i should be glad to know where the noble author had conversed in the platonic republic it may be so but in our gothic systems matters go quite otherwise so far as common observation reaches it is easiest of all things to make that appear ridiculous which is not really deformed and how should it be otherwise while the human imagination is liable to be imposed on and capable of receiving fictitious for real representations  the noble author tells us next that nothing is proof against raillery except what is handsome and just  perhaps nor that neither though it be true that nothing of the opposite kind is proof against raillery yet sure it is a strange mistake to imagine that what is really handsome and just is always proof against it for by sictitious images impressed on the fancy what is really handsome and just is often rendered apparently false and deformed and thus becomes actually contemptible and ridiculous  but one may defy the world to turn real bravery and generosity into ridicule safely my lord while they retain their native appearance and beauty of proportion but alas how easy is it to disguise them it is but concealing varying or adding a circumstance that may strike the fancy and they at once assume new shapes new names and natures thus the virtues which seen in a direct light attract our admiration by their beauty when beheld through the oblique mediums of ridicule start up in the forms of idiots hags and monsters  but the noble writer enforces these general appeals to fact by one extraordinary instance he tells us the divinest man who had ever appeared in the heathen world was in the height of witty times and by the wittiest of all poets most abominably ridiculed in a whole comedy writ and acted on purpose but so far was this from sinking his reputation or suppressing his philosophy that they each increased the more for it vol i p     it must be owned this is an extraordinary assertion unless he means to affirm that the reputation and philosophy of socrates arose from his blood as the christian sects sprung from the blood of martyrs vol i  for it appears from all the records of antiquity that the wit of aristophanes was the most formidable enemy that ever attacked the divine philosopher this whetted the rage of a misled multitude and dragged to death that virtue which has ever since been the admiration of mankind in this opinion we have the concurrence of the first writer of the present age ded to the div leg of moses p  0  and the confession of another who although of a turn conceited and fantastical enough is yet of unquestioned credit for his ingenuity and learning this writer speaking of the wild wit of an aristophanes tells us that the comedy inscribed the clouds is an execrable attempt to expose one of the wisest and best of men to the fury and contempt of a lewd multitude in which it had but too much success letters on mythology p       it is true palmerius a learned french critic of the last age had from the number of years between the acting the clouds of aristophanes and the death of socrates pretended that aelian was mistaken in assigning this play as one of the principal causes of his destruction p brumoy who has wrote so excellently of the greek theater after having examined the affair with the utmost candor concludes thus his account aelians seems only defective in that he has not remarked the long interval that passed between the representation of the clouds and the condemnation of socrates but although the comedy did not give the finishing stroke to socrates yet it might have indisposed the minds of the people since these comic accusations became very serious ones which at length destroyed the wisest of the greeks son recit ne semble defectueux que pour navoir pas marque le long intervalle qui se passa enter la representation des nuees et la condemnation de socrate concluons que bien que sa comedy nait pas port le dernier coup a socrate elle a pu indisposer les esprits puisque les accusations comiques devinrent des accusations tres serieuses qui perdirent ensin le plus sage des grees tom v p   0    but since the noble author seems to have adopted the other opinion and as i am told some shallow mimics of modern platonism have lately stolen palmeriuss criticism and revived this stale pretense of the number of years between the representation of the clouds and the death of socrates it may be necessary to transcribe the following passage from platos apology which puts the matter beyond all doubt but it is just o athenians that i should first reply to the false charge of my first accusers because several laid their groundless accusations against me many years ago whom i dread more than the adherents of anytus though these too be very powerful in persuasion but those are still more powerful who have possessed and swayed you from your very infancy in laying false accusations against me many indeed have been these my accusers and long have they continued thus to accuse me and persuaded and misled you at that early age when you were most easy of belief while i in the mean time was without one defender and what is worst of all i know not so much as their very names except only that of the comedian  what then do my accusers say  socrates is criminal in that he enquires too curiously concerning what is under the earth and in the heavens and in that he can make the worse appear the better reason and that he teaches these things to others such then is the accusation for such things you saw in aristophaness comedy where a fictitious socrates is carried about affirming that he takes journeys through the air and talking much more idle stuff of the same nature  plat apel sec     here we see the philosopher refers their accusation to its original cause and this he positively affirms was no other than the old impressions made against him on the minds of the athenians by the comedy of the clouds as so much stir has been made about the case of socrates with regard to ridicule it may not be amiss to show what his opinion of it was in general when considered as a test of truth in the fifth book of platos republic socrates proposes that women should engage in all the public affairs of life along with men this to glauco appears ridiculous in some of its circumstances socrates replies that may be but let us go to the merits of the question setting aside all raillery advising the railleurs to be serious and putting them in mind that the very practice now approved in greece of men appearing naked was not long ago treated there with the highest ridicule as it is to this day among many barbarians   the following part of this passage i would recommend to the modern patronizers of the way of ridicule     so much for the silencing which is the only conviction of obstinacy and ignorance but in reality it is a matter of small consequence in the present question whether the ridicule of the comic poet was in fact destructive to the divine philosopher or not but as it demonstrably was it is therefore a case in point however suppose it was not what is the consequence why only this that dishonest ridicule failed of its desired success in one instance and how does this affect the question so long as ten thousand other instances may be alleged to the contrary which no man that is not void of common sense or common honesty can possibly deny  from the appeals to fact already made see above    may be drawn innumerable instances of this nature there we see truth wisdom virtue liberty successfully disguised and derided by this very means the cause of falsehood folly vice tyranny maintained if to these it were necessary to add more we cannot perhaps in history find a more flagrant proof of the power of ridicule against virtue herself than in that heap of execrable comedies which have been the bane and reproach of this kingdom through a series of ninety years during this period the generality of our comic poets have been the unwearied ministers of vice and have done her work with so thorough an industry that it would be hard to find one virtue which they have not sacrificed at her shrine as effects once established are not easily removed so not only this but the succeeding generation will probably retain the impressions made in the two preceding ones when innocence was the sport of abandoned villainy and the successful adulterer decked out with all the poets art at the expense of the ridiculed and injured husband when moral virtue and religion were made the jest of the licentious and female modesty was banished to make way for shameless effrontery the fair sat panting at a courtiers play and not a mask went unimprovd away the modest fan was lifted up no more and virgins smiled at what they blushed before essay on criticism    section vii here then we have accumulated proofs of the fatal influences of ridicule when let loose from the restraints of reason  yet still his lordship insists that truth it is supposed may bear all lights vol i p     to which it is replied that truth will indeed bear every light but a false one he adds that one of those principal lights or natural mediums by which things are to be viewed in order to a through recognition is ridicule itself vol i p     this is full as wise a method to manifest the rectitude of truth as it would be to show the rectitude of a ruling staff to emerge one part of it in clear water the staff indeed would still continue strait but the two mediums in which it lies though both natural ones would concur to make it appear crooked just so it is with truth when half shown by the medium of reason and the other half by the medium of ridicule  but the noble writer asks us how can any one of the least justness of thought endure a ridicule wrong placed ibid p      i answer by being misled or mistaken and then men are ready to bear any thing show me him whose imagination never received or retained a false impression and i shall readily allow he can never endure a ridicule wrong placed but of this infallible race i know none except the inhabitants of utopia it is true he heartily acknowledges that the vulgar may swallow any sordid jest any mere drollery and bussoonry ibid  indeed how then can he desy the world to turn real bravery or generosity into ridicule or laugh successfully at honesty or goodmanners and where was the wonder or improbability that the wit of aristophanes should incite a lewd multitude to destroy the divine philosopher limpudence quil avoit de tourner en ridicule la religion devoit etre reprimee car une refutation serieuse ne fait pas a beaucoup pres tant de mal que les railleries dun homme desprit les jeunes gens se laissent gater par ces sorts de moqueurs plus que lon ne scauroit dire bail art bion     but then he tells us it must be a siner and truer wit that takes with the men of sense and breeding vol i p     this sentence it must be owned is artful enough because it obliges one to make a separation that may look like illnatured before one can expose its weakness a truer wit indeed may be necessary to take with the men of sense but these i apprehend may sometimes be distinguished from the men of breeding for it is certain that in most countries the vulgar are a much more considerable body than is generally imagined yet although neither reason nor the passions gain any advantages from high life it must be owned the imagination acquires a certain delicacy which the low vulgar are generally strangers to the coarse pranks of a merry andrew that engage the attention of a country fair would make but a poor figure at st jamess but still it is only in the modes not the objects of ridicule with regard to which the courtier differs from the clown the peasant and his lord are equally susceptible of false impressions equally liable to have falsehood obtruded on them for truth folly for wisdom vice for virtue the methods only of ridicule the engines of deceit must vary must be accommodated to the different views of things and circumstances of life among which they have respectively been conversant thus it must indeed be a finer but by no means a truer kind of wit that takes with the men of breeding  the noble writer proceeds to ask what rule or measure is there in the world except in the considering the real temper of things to find which are truly serious and which ridiculous and how can this be done unless by applying the ridicule to see whether it will bear vol i p      yes sure there is another rule the rule of reason which alone can distinguish appearances from realities and fix the true nature of things from whose determinations alone we ever can distinguish true from pretended gravity just from groundless raillery but the way of investigation here proposed by his lordship inverts the very order and constitution of things by this means appearances take the place of realities imagination usurps the sovereignty which belongs to reason and ridicule is made the test of what is rational instead of reason being made the test of what is ridiculous  yet still the noble author suspects ill consequences that subjects may be very grave and weighty in our imagination but very ridiculous and impertinent in their own nature ibid p     true and on the other hand things may appear ridiculous and impertinent in our imagination which are very grave and weighty in their own nature what then is the consequence in either case why only this that imagination and therefore ridicule which depends upon it can never be a test of truth  but his lordship insists that gravity is of the very essence of imposture vol i p     yet this will do little for his purpose unless he can prove too that imposture is of the essence of gravity and if so what will become of the enquiry concerning virtue gravity it is true is commonly an attendant of imposture and so is laughter generally speaking of folly with as much reason therefore as the noble writer infers from hence that gravity is imposture we may infer that laughter is folly in disguise in truth the inference is groundless in both cases though every knave should affect gravity yet every grave man is not a knave though every fool will be laughing yet every man that laughs is not a fool we may be serious and honest as well as merry and wise mirth and gravity are both harmless things provided they be properly applied and we have seen that it is the province of reason alone to determine when they are so  but after all the proposition that gravity is of the essence of imposture is false it is only an occasional though indeed a pretty close attendant since this other maxim was taken for granted that reason was the test of truth let once his lordships be generally embraced that ridicule is so and we should soon see buffoonry as close an attendant on imposture as now gravity the trial has been made and successfully enough too by him who has kept the multitude in opinion for twenty years together and by this time perhaps himself that learning and religion are better taught in his conventicle than in all the universities and churches of christendom put together and sure if any thing be the essence of his imposture it is buffoonry  and here let us not forget to observe that the noble writer often as in the passage last cited confounds mirth urbanity or good humor with raillery or ridicule than which no two things in nature are more diametrically opposite the first as it arises solely from sudden and pleasing resemblances impressed on the imagination is justly regarded by all as the best mediator in every debate the last as it arises solely from contempt is therefore no less justly regarded by most as an embroiler and incendiary he sets out with a formal profession of proving the efficacy of humor and ridicule in the investigation of truth yet by shifting and mixing his terms he generally slides insensibly into mere encomiums on goodbreeding cheerfulness urbanity and free enquiry and then from these premises often draws consequences in favor of ridicule as if it were an equivalent term this indeed keeps something like an argument on foot and misleads the superficial reader  but the noble author triumphs in another observation when speaking of modern zealots he tells us that whatever they think grave and solemn they suppose must never be treated out of a grave and solemn way though what another thinks so they can be contented to treat otherwise and are forward to try the edge of ridicule against any opinions besides their own vol i p  0  now if this be so how is gravity of the essence of imposture as he had before affirmed but whatever becomes of that proposition the remark is just and whomsoever he means to compliment with the name of zealots whether in religion or freethinking i shall not compliment as exceptions to the truth of it there is scarce a topic of religion either for its dishonor or support that has not been exposed to the illiberal jokes of some bungler in controversy and a much coarser advocate in the cause of ridicule supposed to be mr collins  has wrote an elaborate and most tedious dissertation to prove that the way of raillery has been successfully applied by every sect of religionists and infidels to the destruction of each others tenets and the establishment of their own how he gains his conclusion that an engine which tends to fix mankind in their preconceived opinions and establish so many species of error is of importance and efficacy in the search of truth may not be so easy to determine in the mean time in reply to his whole treatise as well as to the last mentioned remark of our noble author it may be sufficient to observe that mankind often retain their own and oppose others opinions from an imperfect view of the nature of things their peculiar tenets in religion as in other subjects are often founded in imagination only their objections to those of others are often as groundless and fanciful how natural then is it for them to communicate their opinions on that foundation on which they received them how natural that they should throw the colors of imagination on the tenets they oppose that they should obtrude the like fictitious images on others which themselves have embraced as truth that they should hold forth appearances for realities employ eloquence instead of logic and endeavor to persuade whom they should but cannot convince  it seems therefore that his lordships observation which contains the quintessence of his associates work and which probably was the leaven that leavened the whole lump of malice and dullness instead of being favorable to ridicule as a test of truth can only tend to disgrace it for since every religious and unbelieving sect has alike successfully employed it in supporting their respective tenets and in rendering those of their adversaries contemptible it follows inasmuch as doctrines which are essentially repugnant cannot all be true that ridicule is one of the most powerful engines by which error can be maintained and established  section viii we shall only mention one more of the noble writers arguments in favor of his new test but it is indeed the very keystone of this visionary arch which he has with such fantastic labor thrown over the depths of error in order to invite mankind over it as a short and secure passage to the abode of truth and wisdom  he tells us that a new species of enthusiasts french prophets having lately risen up among us we have delivered them over to the cruellest contempt in the world i am told for certain that they are at this very time the subject of a choice droll or puppetshow at bartlmyfair  and while bartlmyfair is in possession of this privilege i i dare stand security to our national church that no sect of enthusiasts no new venders of prophecy or miracles shall ever get the start or put her to the trouble of trying her strength with them in any case vol i p         so far for peace sake we venture to agree with the noble writer but now comes a finishing stroke indeed  for he proceeds to congratulate the present age that in the beginnings of the reformation when popery had got possession smithfield was used in a more tragical way and that had not the priests as is usual preferred the love of blood to all other passions they might in a merrier way perhaps have evaded the greatest force of our reforming spirit vol i p      and now for forms sake let us suppose the noble author to be what he assumes a friend to religion and reformation under this character he recommends ridicule to us as of sovereign use to investigate truth try honesty and unmask formal hypocrisy and error to prove this use he tells us what we should least have expected that if instead of the tragical way of smithfield the romish priests had preferred the comic drollery of bartlmyfair they had perhaps gained their point and evaded the greatest force of our reforming spirit here the noble writer forgets his part which is that of a believer and a protestant but in his scarcity of proofs for the use of ridicule he has put the change upon us and perhaps upon himself and offered at one to show its force which without doubt must wonderfully recommend it to the favor of all sober men here then lies the dilemma let his followers then get him off as they can if their master be a believer he has reasoned ill if a freethinker he has managed worse had he been a little more knowing in the times he speaks of he might have found an instance more pertinent to his argument and more conformable to his character an instance which shows not what ridicule might be supposed capable of doing but what it actually effected and this not to stop reformation but to discredit popery bishop burnet tells us that in the year      plays and interludes were a great abuse in them mockrepresentations were made both of the clergy and of the pageantry of their worship the clergy complained much of these as an introduction to atheism when things sacred were thus laughed at and said they that begun to laugh at abuses would not cease till they had represented all the mysteries of religion as ridiculous the graver sort of reformers did not approve of it but political men encouraged it and thought nothing could more effectually pull down the abuses that yet remained than the exposing them to the scorn of the nation history of the reformation a d        this curious piece of history is remarkable and tends no less to support our general argument than to recommend what the noble writer is pleased to snear at the sobriety of our reforming spirit political men says the historian whose business and therefore whose aim was to persuade encouraged the way of ridicule but the graver sort of reformers whose nobler ministry and consequently whose purpose was to convince did not approve of it  but his lordship is so fond of his reflection that he pushes it still further i never heard says he that the ancient heathens were so well advised in their ill purpose of suppressing the christian religion in its first rise as to make use at any time of this bartlmyfair method but this i am persuaded of that had the truth of the gospel been any way surmountable they would have bid much fairer for the silencing it if they had chosen to bring our primitive founders upon the stage in a pleasanter way than that of bearskins and pitchbarrels vol i p     and as to the jews he says that with all their malice and inveteracy to our savior and his apostles after him had they but taken the fancy to act such puppetshows in his contempt as at this hour the papists are acting in his honor i am apt to think they might possibly have done our religion more harm than by all their other ways of severity ibid   what a favorite is that facetious droll of wood and wire the bartlmy fair hero with these modern advocates for mirth and raillery and indeed not without cause for of him they seem to have learnt their very wittiest practices who taught them to turn their backs upon their betters to disturb the most serious scenes with an unsavory joke and make a jest of the devil indeed they have so well taken off his manners that one description will serve them both and whether you suppose the fine one which follows to be meant of the original or one of the copies you are equally sure you have a good likeness sed praeter reliquos incedit homuncio rauca voce strepens  pygmaeum territat agmen major et immanem miratur turba gigantem hic magna fretus mole imparibusque lacertis confisus gracili jactat convitia vulgo et crebro solvit lepidum caput ora cachinno quanquam res agitur solenni scria pompa spernit sollicitum intractabilis ille tumultum et risu importunus adest atque omnia turbat musae angl match gest by mr addison    but to return to our argument be you well assured of this kind reader that whatever impressions are made upon a populace in the way of scenery and dramatic representation are no more than so many kinds of silent eloquence and persuasion that facts which ought to be proved are always taken for granted and things and persons often rendered apparently absurd which really are not so that the vulgar both high and low are apt to swallow any sordid jest or buffoonry so it be but accommodated to their preconceived opinions that this way of ridicule like every other as it is fairly or dishonestly applied will sweep away truth or falsehood without distinction that it will confound french prophets with english reformers and on the same false foundation establish the truths of protestantism or the absurdities of popery that as virtue herself cannot bear up against a torrent of ridicule so neither can religion that therefore christianity had indeed more to fear from the contemptuous misrepresentations than the bitterest rage of its enemies that christianity did in fact endure this more than firey trial that its divine founder was derided prophesy unto us who it was that smote thee as well as crucified that they who in succeeding times suffered for the faith endured cruel mockings no less than scourgings bonds and imprisonment that many a brave martyr offered up his prayers to heaven that he might be released by death from the contempt of his enemies and after being baited in the bearskin found a refuge in the faggot or the pitchbarrel  section ix however the noble writers modesty must not be forgotten for while he might have arrogated to himself the glory of this wondrous discovery he has informed us of an ancient sage whose idea of ridicule coincided with his own it was the saying of an ancient sage that humor was the only test of gravity vol i p      the reader will probably be surprised to find that the passage here referred to by the noble writer is no other than what has been already quoted from aristotle see above p    as a direction to the conduct of an orator it is likewise remarkable that his lordship in quoting the original passage in his margin has by the prudent omission of an emphatical expression converted it from a particular rule of rhetoric into a general maxim of philosophy the words   adversariorum  are omitted  but it is of all most remarkable that in his pretended translation he has entirely perverted the sense of the author whose authority he attempts to build upon  as ridicule says the great philosopher seems to be of some use in pleading it was the opinion of gorgias that you ought to confound your adversarys serious argument by raillery and his raillery by serious argument this is almost a literal translation of the passage but how the noble author could so far impose upon himself or others as to strip it of its native dress and disguise it under the fantastical appearance of a maxim that humor is the only test of gravity and gravity of humor  this is not so easy to account for  however this came to pass it is certain that the observation as it lies in aristotle is a just and a fine one as it lies in the noble writers maimed translation it is false if not unmeaning  that an orator should confound his adversarys raillery by serious argument is rational and just by this means he tears off the false disguises of eloquence and distinguishes real from apparent truth that he should confound his adversarys serious argument by raillery is if not a just yet a legal practice the aim and end of the advocate or orator is persuasion only to truth or falsehood as it happens if he has truth on his side it is likely what he will have then to do will be to confound his adversarys raillery by serious argument if truth be against him he will be forced to change weapons with his adversary whose serious argument he must try to confound by raillery this is all the mystery there is in the matter by which we see that whenever in this case ridicule is opposed to reasoning it is so far from being the test or support that it is the destruction of truth and the judicious quintilian fairly confesses it where he assigns the cause why ridicule is of such mighty force in oratory  quia animum ab intention rerum frequenter avertit  because it draws off the mind from attending to the real nature of things thus you see the propriety and beauty of the saying of our ancient sage when fairly represented  but as the noble writer has translated the passage it is a curiosity indeed humor is the only test of gravity and gravity of humor he applies it not to eloquence but philosophy not to persuasion but conviction and so by the strangest conversion in nature makes the trier and the thing tried each in their turns become agent and patient to one another but what artist ever attempted to try the justness of his square or level by the work which he has formed by the assistance of those instruments or was ever the gold which has been put to the test reciprocally applied to try the touchstone if therefore gravity or reasoning be the test of humor humor never can be the test of gravity as on the other hand if humor be the test of gravity then gravity can never be the test of humor  since therefore this seesaw kind of proof returns into itself and consequently ends in an absurdity it is plain that one half of the noble writers proposition must effectually destroy the other let us see then which moiety deserves to be supported his own comment on the passage will help us to determine which however he seems desirous his reader should receive as a part of the saying of his ancient sage but whoever will turn to the passage as it lies in aristotle will find that gorgias is entirely innocent of the whole affair  gravity says his lordship is the test of humor because a jest that will not bear a serious examination is certainly false wit true here we have a rational test established next he inverts the proposition sets it with its head downwards like a traytors scutcheon and now says he behold humor is the test of gravity to prove this reason requires he should have added because an argument which can be successfully ridiculed is certainly false logic but this was too hardy a proposition to be directly advanced he therefore contents himself with hinting that a subject which will not bear raillery is suspicious now we know that suspicion is often groundless that what is suspected to be false may yet be true so that the noble writer again suffers this new test to slip through his fingers even while he is holding it up to your admiration but if any thing further be necessary to clear up this point it may be observed in short that gravity or argument is the test of humor because reason marks the real differences of things that humor can never be the test of gravity because imagination can only suggest their apparent analogies  thus the sentiment of gorgias is grossly mistaken or designedly misrepresented by the noble writer as it lies in aristotle it is rational and consistent as it is taken up by his lordship it is chimerical and groundless  it might have been difficult to assign a reason why the noble writer should have attempted to establish this twofold method of proof had not he explained his intention in another place he there vol iii misc v c      etc wisely recommends the old scholastic manner to the clergy as being most suitable to their abilities and character the way of ridicule he appropriates to the men of taste and breeding declaring it ought to be kept sacred from the impure touch of an ecclesiastic for as clubs and cudgels have long been appropriated to porters and footmen while every gentleman is ambitious to understand a sword so the clumsy way of argumentation is only fit for priests and pedants but pointed wit is the weapon for the man of fashion this decides a quarrel handsomely the pretty fellow is at your vitals in a moment while the pedant keeps laboring at it for an hour together and neither gets nor gives so much as a broken bone  but still higher is the noble writers idea of wit and ridicule while he applies it not only to conquest but investigation and we must own it was an attempt worthy of his genius to establish this new and expeditious method of search and conviction in which by the sole application of so cheap and portable an instrument as that of raillery a gentleman might obtain the certain knowledge of the true proportion of things without the tedious and vulgar methods of mensuration in the mean time we whom the noble author has so often condescended to distinguish by the honorable title of formalists and pedants finding ourselves incapable of this sublime way of proof must be content to drudge on in the old and beaten track of reasoning and after all it is probable this new attempt will succeed no better than the curious conceit of the learned tailor in laputa who being employed in making a suit for the facetious gulliver disdained the vulgar measures of his profession and took that gentlemans altitude by the help of a quadrant this it must be acknowledged was a theory no less sublime than our noble authors yet it failed miserably when applied to practice for the sagacious traveller informs us that notwithstanding the acuteness and penetration of the artist his clothes were wretchedly ill made  section x we have now obviated every thing material that the noble writer has advanced in support of his new system but as one of his most zealous followers has undertaken in form to explain and defend his notions on this subject see a note on the pleasures of imagination a poem book iii  it may be proper to examine how far this gentlemans argument is consistent with truth  he tells us that to ask whether ridicule be a test of truth is in other words to ask whether that which is ridiculous can be morally true can be just and becoming or whether that which is just and becoming can be ridiculous  here as the foundation of all we see the same kind of ambiguity lurking as was observed in the noble writer in the passage already remarked on see above p     for if by that which is ridiculous he means that which is really ridiculous it is allowed this can never be morally true but this is so far from proving ridicule to be a test of truth that it implies the contrary it implies some further power which may be able to distinguish what is really ridiculous from what is only apparently so on the contrary if by that which is ridiculous he means that which is apparently ridiculous it may be affirmed this may be morally true because imagination and passion often take up with fictions instead of realities and can never of themselves distinguish them from each other he tells us his question does not deserve a serious answer at least it wanted an explanation  the gentleman proceeds for it is most evident that as in a metaphysical proposition offered to the understanding for its assent the faculty of reason examines the terms of the proposition and finding one idea which was supposed equal to another to be in fact unequal of consequence rejects the proposition as a falsehood so in objects offered to the mind for its esteem or applause the faculty of ridicule feeling an incongruity in the claim urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt  here the faculty of reason is excluded from the examination of moral truths and a new faculty never before heard of the faculty of ridicule is substituted in its place now when a stranger is introduced into good company and sure these can be no better than the public it is usual not only to tell his name but what he is and what his character this the gentleman has not condescended to do it is true in a preceding page he tells us that the sensation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas but a passion or emotion of the mind consequential to that perception in another place he expressly calls it a gay contempt now if the faculty of ridicule be the same as the sensation of ridicule or a gay contempt then by substituting the plain old term of contempt instead of the faculty of ridicule we shall clearly see what the above cited passage contains as in a metaphysical proposition the faculty of reason examines the terms and rejects the falsehood so in objects offered to the mind for its esteem and applause the passion of contempt feeling an incongruity in the claim urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt  why was not honest reason admitted of the council and set on the seat of judgment which of right belongs to her the affair would then have stood thus as in a metaphysical proposition the faculty of reason examines the terms and rejects the falsehood so in objects offered to the mind for its esteem or applause the same faculty of reason finding an incongruity in the claim urges the mind to reject it with contempt and laughter this would have been sense and argument but then it had not been characteristical  we shall now clearly discover the distinction that is to be made on the following passage and thus a double advantage is gained for we both detect the moral falsehood sooner than in the way of speculative enquiry and impress the minds of men with a stronger sense of the vanity and error of its authors ibid p  0    here it is evident that the design of detecting the moral falsehood sooner than in the way of speculative enquiry is an absurd attempt but that to impress the minds of men with a stronger sense of the vanity and error of its authors when reason has made the proper search is both a practicable and a rational intention  but it is said continues he that the practice is dangerous and may be inconsistent with the regard we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence ibid p  0   yet this is but a secondary objection the principal one is that the attempt is absurd however the circumstance of danger is not without its weight nor is the gentlemans reply at all sufficient  that the practice fairly managed can never be dangerous for though men are not dishonest in obtruding false circumstances upon us we may be so weak as to obtrude them upon ourselves nay it can hardly be otherwise if instead of exerting our reason to correct the suggestions of fancy and passion we give them an unlimited range and acquiesce in their partial or groundless representations without calling in reason to decide upon their truth or falsehood by this means we shall often view objects of real dignity and excellence in such shapes and colors as are foreign to their nature and then sit down and laugh most profoundly at the phantoms of our own creating  but still he insists that though false circumstances be imposed upon us yet the sense of ridicule always judges right or in more vulgar terms the passion of contempt always judges right whereas in truth it never judges at all being equally excited by objects real or imaginary that present themselves  observe therefore what a number of new phrases and blind guides this of ridicule if once admitted would bring in upon us and all on equal authority for with the same reason as the passion of contempt is styled the sense of ridicule the passion of fear may be called the sense of danger and anger the sense of injury but who has ever dreamt of exalting these passions into so many tests of the reality of their respective objects the design must have been rejected as absurd because it is the province of reason alone to correct the blind sallies of every passion and fix it on its proper object now the scheme of ridicule is of the same nature it proposes the passion of contempt as the test of moral falsehood which from the very terms appears to be a project full as wise as to make fear the test of danger or anger the test of injury  the gentleman proceeds next to the case of socrates he owns the socrates of aristophanes is as truly ridiculous a character as ever was drawn but it is not the character of socrates the divine moralist and father of ancient wisdom  no indeed and here lay the wickedness of the poets intention and the danger of his art in imposing fictions for realities on the misled multitude and putting a fools coat on the father of ancient wisdom it is true the people laughed at the ridiculous sophist but when the ridiculous sophist came to drink the poison what think you became of the father of ancient wisdom  but then he tells us that as the comic poet introduced foreign circumstances into the character of socrates and built his ridicule upon these so has the reasoning of spinoza made many atheists he has founded it indeed on suppositions utterly false but allow him these and his conclusions are unavoidably true and if we must reject the use of ridicule because by the imposition of false circumstances things may be made to seem ridiculous which are not so in themselves why we ought not to reject the use of reason because by proceeding on false principles conclusions will appear true which are impossible in nature let the vehement and obstinate declaimers against ridicule determine page  0    but why so much indignation against declaimers in one who writes in defense of ridicule a species of declamation then as to rejecting the use of ridicule a very material distinction is to be made as a mode of eloquence nobody attempts totally to reject it while it remains under the dominion of reason but as a test of truth i hope the reader has seen sufficient reason totally to reject it  neither will the parallel by any means hold good which the gentleman has attempted to draw between the abuse of ridicule and reason because the imagination to which the way of ridicule applies is apt to form to itself innumerable fictitious resemblances of things which tend to confound truth with falsehood whereas the natural tendency of reason is to separate these apparent resemblances and determine which are the real and which the fictitious although therefore spinoza has advanced many falsehoods in the way of speculative affirmation and founded his reasonings on these yet still reason will be her own correctress and easily discover the cheat but if the imagination be impressed with false appearances and the passion of contempt strongly excited neither the imagination nor the passion can ever correct themselves but must inevitably be misled unless reason be called in to rectify the mistake and bring back the passion to its proper channel  nay so far is the use of ridicule when prior to rational conviction from being parallel to reason or cooperative with it that on the contrary it has a strong tendency to prevent the efforts of reason and to confound its operations it is not pretended that human reason though the ultimate is yet in all cases an adequate test of truth it is always fallible often erroneous but it would be much less erroneous were every mode of eloquence and ridicule above all others kept remote from its operations were no passion suffered to blend itself with the researches of the mind for ridicule working on the imagination and passions disposes the mind to receive and acquiesce in any opinion without its proper evidence hence prejudice arises and the mind which should be free to examine and weigh those real circumstances which prove socrates to be indeed a divine philosopher is drawn by the prior suggestions of ridicule to receive and acquiesce in those false circumstances which paint him as a contemptible sophist  to conclude it is no difficult matter to point out the foundation of this gentlemans errors concerning ridicule they have arisen solely from his mistaking the passion of contempt for a judicial faculty hence all those newfangled expressions of  the faculty of ridicule  the sense of ridicule  and the feeling of the ridiculous in the use of which he seems to have imposed upon himself new phrases for realities and words for things i cannot better illustrate this remark than by transcribing a passage from the incomparable lock  another great abuse of words is the taking them for things to this abuse men are most subject who confine their thoughts to any one system and give themselves up to the firm belief of the perfection of any received hypothesis whereby they come to be persuaded that the terms of that sect are so suited to the nature of things that they perfectly correspond with their real existence who is there that has been bred up in the peripatetic philosophy who does not think the ten names under which are ranked the ten predicaments to be exactly conformable to the nature of things who is there of that school that is not persuaded that substantial forms vegetative souls abhorrence of a vacuum intentional species etc are something real  there is scarce any sect in philosophy has not a distinct set of terms that others understand not but yet this gibberish which in the weakness of human understanding serves so well to palliate mens ignorance and cover their errors comes by familiar use amongst those of the same tribe to seem the most important part of language and of all other the terms the most significant lock on hum understanding b iii c  0     and now to save the trouble of repetition the reader is left to determine how far the faculty of ridicule feeling the incongruity  and the sense of ridicule always judging right  may with propriety be placed among the learned gibberish abovementioned  it is strange this gentleman should have erred so widely in so plain a subject when we consider that he has accidentally thrown out a thought which if pursued would have led him to a full view of the point debated the sensation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas but a passion or emotion of the mind consequential to that perception p  0    section xi to return therefore to the noble writer as it is evident that ridicule cannot in general without absurdity be applied as a test of truth so can it least of all be admitted in examining religious opinions in the discussion of which his lordship seems principally to recommend it because by inspiring the contending parties with mutual contempt it has a violent tendency to destroy mutual charity and therefore to prevent mutual conviction  to illustrate this truth let us consider the following instance which seems clear and full to the point  there is not perhaps in any language a bolder or stronger ridicule than the wellknown apologue of the tale of a tub its manifest design is to recommend the english church and to disgrace the two extremes of popery and puritanism some indeed have pretended otherwise thus mr wotton in his reflections on learning says it is a designed banter upon all that is esteemed sacred among men and the pious author of the independent whig affirms it was the sole open attack that had been made upon christianity since the revolution except the oracles of reason and was not inferior in banter and malice to the attacks of celsus or julian or porphyry or lucian p     where by the way the oddity of the contrast is remarkable enough that he should pronounce the tale of a tub to be a libel on christianity while it is in fact a vindication of our ecclesiastical establishment and at the same time entitle his own book a vindication of our ecclesiastical establishment while in fact it is a libel on christianity    now if we consider this exquisite piece of raillery as a test of truth we shall find it impotent and vain for the question still recurs whether martin be a just emblem of the english jack of the scotch or peter of the roman church all the points in debate between the several parties are taken for granted in the representation and we must have recourse to argument and to that alone ere we can determine the merits of the question  if we next consider this masterpiece of wit as a mode of eloquence we shall find it indeed of great efficacy in confirming every member of the church of england in his own communion and in giving him a thorough distaste of those of scotland and rome and so far as this may be regarded as a matter of public utility so far the ridicule may be laudable  but if we extend our views so as to comprehend a larger plan of moral use we shall find this method of persuasion is such as charity can hardly approve of for by representing the one of these churches under the character of craft and knavery the other under that of incurable madness it must needs tend to inspire every member of the english church who believes the representation with such hatred of the one and contempt of the other as to prevent all friendly debate and rational remonstrance  its effect on those who hold the doctrines of calvin or of rome must be yet worse unless it can be proved that the way to attract the love and convince the reason of mankind is to show that we hate or despise them while they revere what we deride it is plain we cannot both view the subject in the same light and though we deride what appears to us contemptible we deride what to them appears sacred they will therefore accuse us of misrepresenting their opinions and abhor us as unjust and impious  thus although this noted apologue be indeed a vindication of our english church yet it is such as had been better spared because its natural effect is to create prejudice and inspire the contending parties with mutual distaste contempt and hatred  but if the way of ridicule is thus wholly to be rejected in treating every controverted subject it will probably be asked where then is it to be applied whether it is reasonable to calumniate and blacken it without distinction and whether it is not impiety thus to vilify the gifts of our maker  and it is certain that to do this were absurd and impious as on the other hand there is an equal absurdity and impiety in confounding that order of things which the creator has established and endeavoring to raise a blind passion into the throne of reason one party or other in this debate has certainly incurred the censure the censure is severe and let it fall where it is deserved i know none that endeavor to vilify and blacken ridicule without distinction unless when it presumes to elevate itself into a test of truth and then as a rebel to the order and constitution of nature it ought to be resolutely encountered and repelled till it take refuge in its own inferior station  the proper use of ridicule therefore is to disgrace known falsehood and thus negatively at least to enforce known truth yet this can only be affirmed of certain kinds of falsehood or incongruity to which we seem to have appropriated the general name of folly and among the several branches of this chiefly i think to affectation for as every affectation arises from a false pretense to praise so a contempt incurred tends to convince the claimant of his error and thus becomes the natural remedy to the evil  much more might be said on this head we might run through numerous divisions and subdivisions of folly but as the task would be both insignificant and endless i am unwilling to trouble the reader with such elaborate trifles  it seems an observation more worthy of our attention and regard that contempt whence ridicule arises being a selfish passion and nearly allied to pride if not absolutely founded on it we ought ever to keep a strict rein and in general rather curb than forward its emotions is there a more important maxim in philosophy than this that we should gain a habit of controuling our imaginations and passions by the use of reason especially those that are rather of the selfish than the benevolent kind that we should not suffer our fears to sink us in cowardice our joys in weakness our anger in revenge and sure there is not a passion that infests human life whose consequences are so generally pernicious as those of indulged contempt as the common occurrences of life are the objects which afford it nourishment so by this means it is kept more constantly in play than any other affection of the mind and is indeed the general instrument by which individuals families sects provinces and nations are driven from a state of mutual charity into that of bitterness and dissension we proceed from raillery to railing from contempt to hatred thus if the love of ridicule be not in itself a passion of the malevolent species it leads at least to those which are so add to this that the most ignorant are generally the most contemptuous and they the most forward to deride who are most incapable or most unwilling to understand narrow conceptions of things lead to groundless derision and this spirit of scorn in its turn as it cuts us off from all information confirms us in our preconceived and groundless opinions  this being the real nature and tendency of ridicule it cannot be worth while to descant much on its application or explore its subserviency to the uses of lise for though under the severe restrictions of reason it may be made a proper instrument on many occasions for disgracing known folly yet the turn of levity it gives the mind the distaste it raises to all candid and rational information the spirit of animosity it is apt to excite the errors in which it confirms us when its suggestions are false the extremes to which it is apt to drive us even when its suggestions are true all these conspire to tell us it is rather to be wished than hoped that its influence upon the whole can be considerable in the service of wisdom and virtue  lord shaftesbury himself in many other parts of his book strongly insists on the necessity of bringing the imagination and passions under the dominion of reason the only poison to reason says he is passion for false reasoning is soon redressed where passion is removed wit and humor part ii    and it is difficult to assign any cause that will not reflect some dishonor on the noble writer why he should thus strangely have attempted to privilege this passion of contempt from so necessary a subjection let it suffice in conclusion to observe that inconsistencies must ever arise and be persisted in when a roving fancy conducted by spleen and affectation goes in quest of idle novelties without subjecting itself to the just restraints of reason  upon the whole this new design of discovering truth by the vague and unsteady light of ridicule puts one in mind of the honest irishman who applied his candle to the sundial in order to see how the night went  essays on the characteristics etc essay ii on the obligations of man to virtue and the necessity of religious principle having considered the noble writers two first treatises so far as they regard the use of ridicule we now come to his soliloquy or advice to an author and here bating only a few accidental passages which will be occasionally pointed out hereafter we shall have little more to do than to approve and admire the whole dissertation being in its general turn one continued instance of its authors knowledge and refined taste in books life and manners i could dwell with pleasure on the beauties of this work if indeed they needed an explanation but that noble union of truth and eloquence which shines through the whole as it supersedes so it would disgrace any attempt of this kind to the work itself therefore i recommend the reader  the noble writer having thus prepared us for the depths of philosophy by enjoining an unfeigned and rigorous selfexamination proceeds to that highest and most interesting of all subjects the obligations of man to the practice of virtue and here it will probably appear that with a variety of useful truths he has blended several plausible mistakes which when more nearly viewed seem to be attended with a train of very extraordinary consequences what he has given us on this subject lies chiefly in the two treatises which compose his second volume but as he frequently refers us to the other parts of his writings where he has accidentally treated the same points in a more explicit manner so the same liberty of comparing one passage with anther will i apprehend be judged reasonable by the candid reader thus we shall more effectually penetrate into his true scope and intention and draw off as far as may be that veil of mystery in which for reasons best known to himself he has so often wrapped his opinions  section ii it is no uncommon circumstance in controversy for the parties to engage in all the fury of disputation without precisely instructing their readers or truly knowing themselves the particulars about which they differ hence that fruitless parade of argument and those opposite pretenses to demonstration with which most debates on every subject have been infested would the contending parties first be sure of their own meaning a species of selfexamination which i think the noble writer has not condescended to mention and then communicate their sense to others in plain terms and simplicity of heart the face of controversy would soon be changed and real knowledge instead of imaginary conquest would be the noble reward of literary toil  in the mean time a history of logomachies a strife about words well executed would be no unedifying work and in order to open a path to so useful an undertaking i will venture to give the present section as an introduction to it for sure among all the questions which have exercised the learned this concerning the obligations of man to virtue has given rise to the greatest profusion of loose talk and ambiguous expression the argument has been handled by several of great name and it might possibly be deemed presumption to differ from any of them had they not so widely differed among themselves much has been said and various have been their opinions concerning our obligations to virtue but little has been said in any definitive manner on the previous and fundamental question what virtue is by which i do not mean what actions are called virtuous for about that mankind are pretty well agreed but what makes virtue to be what it is and till we have determined this with all possible precision we cannot determine upon what foundation mankind are obliged to the practice of it our first enquiry therefore must be concerning the nature of virtue in the investigation of which the moralists of most ages seem to have been remarkably defective  let us first consider what our noble author has said on this subject he tells us the mind cannot be without its eye and ear so as to discern proportion distinguish sound and scan each sentiment and thought which comes before it it can let nothing escape its censure it feels the soft and harsh the agreeable and disagreeable in the affections and finds a foul and fair an harmonious and a dissonant as really and truly here as in any musical numbers or in the outward forms and representations of sensible things nor can it withold its admiration and ecstasy its aversion and scorn any more in what relates to one than to the other of these subjects so that to deny the common natural sense of a sublime and beautiful in things will appear an affectation merely to any one who considers duly of this affair inquiry concerning virtue part iii    the perception of this beauty he calls the moral sense or taste and affirms that virtue consists in a perfect conformity of our affections and actions with this supreme sense and symmetry of things or to use his own words the nature of virtue consists in a certain just disposition or proportionable affection of a rational creature toward the moral objects of right and wrong inquiry concerning virtue part iii     the next writer i shall mention is the learned and amiable dr clarke he thinks it necessary to reject this idea of virtue which the noble writer had established and as a surer foundation than what mere affection sense or taste could produce lays the basis of virtue in reason and insists that its true nature lies in a conformity of our actions with certain eternal and immutable relations and differences of things that from these which are necessarily perceived by every rational agent there naturally arise certain moral obligations which are of themselves incumbent on all antecedent to all positive institution and to all expectation of reward or punishment clarkes demonst passim   after these comes an ingenious and candid writer and in opposition to both these schemes of moral fixes the nature of virtue in a conformity of our actions with truth he affirms that no act whether word or deed of any being to whom moral good and evil are imputable that interferes with any true proposition or denies any thing to be as it is can be right that on the contrary every act is right which does not contradict truth but treats every thing as being what it is wollastons rel of not   passim   there are besides these several other philosophical opinions concerning the nature of virtue as that it consists in following nature  in avoiding all extremes  in the imitation of the deity but these are still more loose and indeterminate expressions if possible than the former if therefore the first should appear vague and ineffectual the latter must of course sall under an equal censure  now it will appear that all the three definitions of virtue which lord shaftesbury dr clarke and mr wollaston have given us in designed opposition to each other are equally defective because they do not give us any more particular or determinate ideas than what we have from that single word which with so much fruitless labor they attempt to define  let us first examine the noble writers definition in this view he says that virtue consists in a conformity of our affections with our natural sense of the sublime and beautiful in things or with the moral objects of right and wrong  now what new idea do we gain from this pompous definition have we not the same general idea from the word virtue as from the more diffused expression of the sublime and beautiful of things and cannot we gather as much from either of these as from the subsequent phrase the moral objects of right and wrong  they are all general names relative to something which is yet unknown and which is no more explained by the pretended definition than by the word which is attempted to be defined indeed when his lordship further affirms that to relieve the needy or help the friendless is an instance of this sublime and beautiful of things we then obtain a more determinate idea with regard to that particular case but still we are as much as ever at a loss for a general criterion or test by which the virtue of our other actions is to be determined to say therefore that virtue consists in acting according to the fair the handsome the sublime the beautiful the decent the moral objects of right and wrong is really no more than ringing changes upon words we might with equal propriety affirm that virtue consists in acting virtuously this deficiency mr wollaston clearly saw they says he who reckon nothing to be morally good but what they call honestum may denominate actions according as that is or is not the cause or end of them but then what is honestum something is still wanting to measure things by and to separate the honesta from the inhonesta rel of not p      dr clarkes definition seems not to include any thing more precise or determinate than the noble writers he affirms that virtue consists in a conformity of our actions with right reason or the eternal and immutable relations and differences of things here then a parallel question arises what is right reason and what these eternal relations which are affirmed by the learned writer to be the test or criterion of virtue and it is observable that when he comes to prove the truth and reality of these relations he is forced to resolve it into a selfevident proposition these things says he are so notoriously plain and selfevident that nothing but the extremest stupidity of mind corruption of manners or perverseness of spirit can possibly make any man entertain the least doubt concerning them demonst p  0  thus too his ingenious advocate when pushed by his adversary to declare whether he perceives the truth of these relations by proof or intuition confesses they may be looked upon as selfevident balguys tracts  d part of mor goodness p  0  here then we may observe a strong coincidence between the noble writers system of expression and this of dr clarke for as the one affirms that the sublime and beautiful of things is selfevident so the other affirms the same of the fit and reasonable and as the sublime and beautiful give us no more determinate ideas than the virtuous so neither can we obtain any additional information from the fit and reasonable we are equally at a loss to know what is fit and reasonable as to know what is virtuous therefore the one can never be an adequate definition of the other here too mr wollaston plainly saw the want of precision as to those he says who make right reason to be a law  it is true that whatever will bear to be tried by right reason is right and that which is condemned by it wrong  but the manner in which they have delivered themselves is not yet explicit enough it leaves room for so many disputes and opposite right reasons that nothing can be settled while every one pretends that his reason is right rel of not p      now it will doubtless appear a circumstance of singularity that mr wollaston who saw the essential defects of these two definitions should himself offer a third which is precisely liable to the same objection virtue says this learned writer consists in a conformity of our actions with truth in treating every thing as being what it is well be it so yet the question still recurs what is moral truth and this demands a definition no less than virtue which was the thing to be defined had lord shaftesbury lived to see this new theory proposed how naturally would he have retorted mr wollastons objection you mr wollaston reckon nothing to be morally good but what you call truth and you may indeed denominate actions according as that is or is not the cause or end of them but then what is truth something further is still wanting to measure things by and to separate truth from falsehood  thus too would dr clarke have naturally replied it is true that whatever will bear to be tried by truth is right and that which is condemned by it wrong but the manner in which you have delivered yourself is not yet explicit enough you have rather confounded my definition than given a new one of your own all that you have added is an impropriety of speech i speak of the rectitude of actions you of the truth of actions which i call an impropriety of speech because truth relates to affirmations not to actions to what is said not to what is done but supposing the propriety of your expression what further criterion have you gained you confess that truth is discovered by reason only for you say that to deny things to be as they are is the transgression of the great law of our nature the law of reason rel of not p     if so then reason is as good a guide as truth we can as certainly know what is right reason as what is truth if therefore my definition is defective yours must be so too if mine leaves room for so many disputes and opposite right reasons that nothing can be settled while every one pretends that this reason is right yours must of necessity be liable to the same objection must leave room for so many disputes and opposite truths that nothing can be settled while every one pretends that his idea of truth is the right one truth then can never be a better criterion than reason because our idea of truth must always depend upon our reason  thus it should seem that our three celebrated writers have not given the satiffaction which might have been expected in an affair of such philosophical importance their common attempt is to define the nature or fix the criterion of virtue to this end the first affirms it consists in a a conformity of our actions to the fair and handsome the sublime and beautiful of things the second the fitness reasons and relations of things the third the truth of things but inasmuch as these general terms of beauty fitness truth convey not any more determinate idea than that of virtue which they are brought to define the several pretended definitions are therefore inadequate and defective let it be observed once for all that the desinitions here censured as defective are little more than direct transcripts of what the old greek philosophers and tully after them have said on the same subject to show how generally this kind of language infects the writers on morality we need only transcribe the following passage from a follower of the noble writer we need not therefore be at a loss said he for a description of the sovereign good  we may call it rectitude of conduct  if that be too contracted we may enlarge and say it is  to live perpetually selecting and rejecting according to the standard of our being if we are for still different views we may say it is  to live in the discharge of moral offices  to live according to nature  to live according to virtue  to live according to just experience of those things which happen around us three treatises by j h treat  d p  0      what then is virtue let us consider its true nature in the following section  section iii there are few among mankind who have not been often struck with admiration at the sight of that variety of colors and magnificence of form which appear in an evening rainbow the uninstructed in philosophy consider that splendid object not as dependent on any other but as being possessed of a selfgiven and original beauty but he who is led to know that its place and appearance always varies with the situation of the sun that when the latter is in his meridian the former becomes an inconsiderable curve skirting the horizon that as the sun descends the rainbow rises till at the time of his setting it encompasses the heavens with a glorious circle yet dies away when he disappears the enquirer is then convinced that this gay meteor did but shine with a borrowed splendour derived from the influence of that mighty luminary  thus in like manner though the beauty fitness truth or virtue of all those actions which we term morally good seem at first view to reside in the several actions in an original and independent manner yet on a nearer scrutiny we shall find that properly speaking their nature arises from their ends and consequences that as these vary the nature of the several actions varies with them that from these alone actions gain their splendour are denominated morally good and give us the ideas of beauty fitness truth or virtue  the first proofs in support of this opinion shall be drawn from those very writers who most zealously oppose it and here it is first remarkable that while they attempt to fix their several criterions of absolute independent beauty fitness and truth they are obliged to admit exceptions which effectually destroy what they design to establish the following instance from one of these celebrated writers is equally applicable to the other two  mr wollaston speaks in the following manner to talk to a post or otherwise treat it as if it was a man would surely be reckoned an absurdity if not distraction why because this is to treat it as being what it is not and why should not the converse be reckoned as bad that is to treat a man as a post as if he had no sense and felt not injuries which he does feel as if to him pain and sorrow were not pain happiness not happiness rel of not p     now you see that on his scheme of absolute irrelative truth the absurdity of talking to a post is precisely of the same nature with that of injuring a man for in both cases we treat the post and the man as being what they are not consequently on this philophy if it be morally evil to injure a man it is likewise morally evil to talk to a post not that i suppose mr wollaston would have maintained this consequence he knew that the first of these absurdities would only deserve the name of folly that the latter of a crime as therefore he allows that truth is equally violated in either case as there is something highly immoral in the one and nothing immoral in the other here is an exception which overturns his principle which proves that the morality or immorality of actions depends on something distinct from mere abstract irrelative truth  the same exception must be admitted on dr clarkes system of expression for sure it is neither fit nor reasonable nor agreeable to the relations of things that a man should talk to a post yet although it be admitted as irrational and absurd i do not imagine any of dr clarkes defenders would say it was immoral so again with regard to lord shaftesbury it is clear there can be nothing of the sublime or beautiful in this action of talking to a post on the contrary there is to use his own manner of expression an apparent indecency impropriety and dissonance in it yet although his admirers might justly denominate it incongruous they would surely be far from branding it as vile here then the same exception again takes place which demonstrates that virtue cannot consist either in abstract fitness or beauty but that something further is required in order to constitute its nature  possibly therefore the patrons of these several theories may allege that actions which relate to inanimate beings only can properly be called no more than naturally beautiful fit or true but that moral fitness beauty or truth can only arise from such actions as relate to beings that are sensible or intelligent mr balguy expressly makes this exception he affirms that moral actions are such as are knowingly directed toward some object intelligent or sensible first treat on moral goodness p      and so far indeed this refinement approaches toward the truth as it excludes all inanimate things from being the objects of moral good and evil yet even this idea of moral beauty fitness or truth is highly indeterminate and defective because innumerable instances may be given of actions directed toward objects sensible and intelligent some of which actions are manifestly becoming fit or true others as manifestly incongruous irrational and false yet none of them in any degree virtuous or vicious meritorious or immoral thus to speak to a man in a language he understands is an action becoming fit or true it is treating him according to the order relations and truth of things it is treating him according to what he is on the contrary to speak to him in a language he understands not is an action neither becoming fit nor true it is treating him according to what he is not it is treating him as a post but although the first of these actions be undeniably becoming fit or true who will call it virtue and though the latter be undeniably incongruous irrational and false who will call it vice yet both these actions are directed toward a being that is sensible and intelligent it follows therefore that an action is not either morally good or evil merely because it is conformable to the beauty fitness or truth of things even though it be directed toward an object both sensible and intelligent but that something still further some more distinguishing and characteristic circumstance is necessary in order to fix its real essence  what this peculiar circumstance may be we come now to enquire and the first lights in this enquiry shall be borrowed from these very celebrated writers whom we have here ventured to oppose for such is the force and energy of truth that while they are attempting to involve her in a cloud of metaphysics she breaks through the mystic veil they had prepared and woven for her with so much art and diffuseth a stream of genuine luster which the most obdurate prejudice can only withstand by winking hard  and first though the noble writer every where attempts to fix an original independent moral beauty of action to which every thing is to be referred and which itself is not to be referred to any thing further essay on wit  soliloquy  enquiry  moralists  miscellanies  passim  yet when he comes to an enumeration of those particular actions which may be called morally beautiful he always singles out such as have a direct and necessary tendency to the happiness of mankind thus he talks of the notion of a public interest enqu b i p      as necessary toward a proper idea of virtue he speaks of public affection in the same manner and reckons generosity kindness and compassion as the qualities which alone can render mankind truly virtuous so again when he fixes the bounds of the social affections he evidently refers us to the same end of human happiness if kindness or love of the most natural sort be immoderate it is undoubtedly vicious for thus overgreat tenderness destroys the effect of love and excessive pity renders us incapable of giving succor enqu b i p      when he fixes the proper degrees of the private affections he draws his proof from this one point that by having the selfpassions too intense or strong a creature becomes miserable ibid  lastly when he draws a catalogue of such affections as are most opposite to beauty and moral good he selects  malice hatred of society  tyranny  anger  revenge  treachery  ingratitude ibid  in all these instances the reference to human happiness is so particular and strong that from these alone an unprejudiced mind may be convinced that the production of human happiness is the great universal fountain whence our actions derive their moral beauty  thus again though the excellent dr clarke attempts to six the nature and essence of virtue in certain differences relations and fitnesses of things to which our actions ought ultimately to be referred yet in enumerating the several actions which he denominates morally good he mentions none but what evidently promote the same great end the happiness of man he justly speaks of the welfare of the whole as being the necessary and most important consequence of virtuous action he tells us that it is more fit that god should regard the good of the whole creation than that he should make the whole continually miserable that all men should endeavor to promote the universal good and welfare of all than that all men should be continually contriving the ruin and destruction of all demonst p    etc  here again the reference is so direct and strong to the happiness of mankind that even from the instances alleged by the worthy author it appears that a conformity of our actions to this great end is the very essence of moral rectitude  mr wollaston is no less explicit in this particular for in every instance he brings the happiness of man is the single end to which his rule of truth verges in an unvaried manner thus in the passage already cited though he considers the talking to a post as an absurdity he is far from condemning it as an immoral action but in the same paragraph when he comes to give an instance of the violation of moral truth he immediately has recourse to man and not only so but to the happiness of man why says he should not the converse be reckoned as bad that is to treat a man as a post as if he had no sense and felt not injuries which he does feel as if to him pain and sorrow were not pain happiness not happiness at other times he affirms that the importance of the truths on the one and the other side should be diligently compared rel of not p     and i would gladly know how one truth can be more important than another unless upon this principle and in reference to the production of happiness himself indeed confirms this interpretation when he speaks as follows the truth violated in the former case was b had a property in that which gave him such a degree of happiness that violated in the latter was b had a property in that which gave him a happiness vastly superior to the other the violation therefore in the latter case was upon this account a vastly greater violation than in the former rel of not p      these evidences may seem sufficient but that all possible satisfaction may be given in a circumstance which is of the greatest weight in the present question these further observations may be added  as therefore these celebrated writers give no instances of moral beauty fitness or truth but what finally relate to the happiness of man so if we appeal to the common sense of mankind we shall see that the idea of virtue has never been universally affixed to any action or affection of the mind unless where this tendency to produce happiness was at least apparent what are all the black catalogues of vice or moral turpitude which we read in history or find in the circle of our own experience what are they but so many instances of misery produced and what are the fair and amiable achievements of legislators patriots and sages renowned in story what but so many efforts to raise mankind from misery and establish the public happiness on a sure foundation the first are vicious immoral deformed because there we see mankind afflicted or destroyed the latter are virtuous right beautiful because here we see mankind preserved and assisted  but that happiness is the last criterion or test to which the moral beauty truth or rectitude of our affections is to be referred the two following circumstances demonstrate first those very affections and actions which in the ordinary course of things are approved as virtuous do change their nature and become vicious in the strictest sense when they contradict this fundamental law of the greatest public happiness thus although in general it is a parents duty to prefer a childs welfare to that of another person yet if this natural and just affection gain such strength as to tempt the parent to violate the public for his childs particular welfare what was before a duty by this becomes immoderate and criminal this the noble writer has allowed if kindness or love of the most natural sort be immoderate it is undoubtly vicious enq on virtue  and hence he says the excess of motherly love is owned to be a vicious fondness enq on virtue  the same variation takes place with regard to every other relation between man and man insomuch that the superior regards which we owe to our family friends fellowcitizens and countrymen  regards which in their proper degree aspire to the amiable and high names of domestic love friendship patriotism  when once they desert and violate the grand principle of universal happiness become a vicious fondness a mean and odious partiality justly stigmatized by all as ignominious and unworthy  secondly with such uncontrouled authority does this great principle command us that actions which are in their own nature most shocking to every humane affection lose at once their moral desormity when they become subservient to the general welfare and assume both the name and the nature of virtue for what is more contrary to every gentle and kind affection that dwells in the human breast than to shed the blood or destroy the life of man yet the ruling principle abovementioned can reconcile us even to this and when the necessity of public example compels us to make a sacrifice of this kind though we may lament the occasion we cannot condemn the fact so far are we from branding it as murder that we approve it as justice and always defend it on this great principle alone that it was necessary for the public good  thus it appears that those actions which we denominate virtuous beautiful fit or true have not any absolute and independent but a relative and reflected beauty and that their tendency to produce happiness is the only source from whence they derive their luster hence therefore we may obtain a just and adequate definition of virtue which is no other than the the gentlemen above examined seem to have mistaken the attributes of virtue for its essence virtue is procuring happiness to procure happiness is beautiful reasonable true these are the qualities or attributes of the action but the action itself or its essence is procuring happiness  the reader who is curious to examine further into this subject may consult the prelim dissert to dr laws translation of kings origin of evil together with several passages in the translators notes where he will find sense and metaphysics united in a very eminent and extraordinary degree   conformity of our affections with the public good or the voluntary production of the greatest happiness  section iv it may possibly seem strange that so much has been thought necessary to be opposed to these metaphysical refinements concerning the nature of virtue but in reality it is a point of the utmost consequence for these refinements have given rise to a plausible objection which has been retailed in a popular manner by a late wordy writer whose least merit it is to have supplied our modish coffeehouse philosophers with such a variety of fashionable topics that they have never felt the least want of that antiquated assistance derived from knowledge parts and learning  this gentleman taking advantage of these metaphysical refinements and particularly of the noble writers imaginary scheme of absolute irrelative beauty the hunting after which he elegantly affirms is not much better than a wild goose chase fable of the bees vol i p   0 oct ed  attempts from hence to demonstrate for the benefit of his country that we are utterly mistaken when we look upon virtue and vice as permanent realities that must ever be the same in all countries and all ages fable of the bees p      and thus he prosecutes his argument  the worth or excellence of every thing he says varies according to fancy or opinion even in human creatures what is beautiful in one country is not so in another  three hundred years ago men were shaved as closely as they are now since that they have wore beards  how mean and comical a man looks that is otherwise welldressed in a narrowbrimed hat when every body wears broad ones and again how monstrous is a very great hat when the other extreme has been in fashion for a consideratime  the many ways of laying out a garden judiciously are almost innumerable and what is called beautiful in them varies according to the different taste of nations and ages p      thus capricious and uncertain he tells us are our ideas of natural beauty and these he brings home to the point of morals in morals there is no greater certainty plurality of wives is odious among christians and all the wit and learning of a great genius in defense of it has been rejected with contempt but polygamy is not shocking to a mohammedan what men have learnt from their infancy enslaves them and the force of custom warps nature and at the same time imitates her in such a manner that it is often difficult to know which of them we are influenced by in the east formerly sisters married brothers and it was meritorious for a man to marry his mother such alliances are abominable but it is certain that whatever horror we conceive at the thoughts of them there is nothing in nature repugnant against them but what is built upon mode and custom a religious mohammedan may receive as great an aversion against wine fable of the bees p          hence with great stretch of reasoning he concludes that virtue and vice are not permanent realities but vary as other fashions and are subject to no other law than that of fancy and opinion  and so far indeed this gentleman seems to have argued justly while he contends that mere approbation and dislike the mere idea of beauty and deformity truth or rectitude without reference to some further end can never constitute a real or permanent foundation of vice or virtue for as he has observed there have indeed been considerable differences of opinion upon some kinds of moral beauty and deformity in the different nations and ages of the world and each age and nation has ever been alike positive in asserting the propriety of its own therefore unless we have some further test some other distinguishing and characteristic circumstance to refer to besides that of mere approbation and dislike how shall we ever know which of these anomalous opinions are right or wrong if we have nothing further to appeal to than the mere propriety of taste though each may be thoroughly satisfied of the justness of his own yet he ought in reason to allow the same right of choice to the rest of mankind in every age and nation and thus indeed moral beauty and deformity virtue and vice could have no other law than that of fancy and opinion  but when the great end of public happiness is ultimately referred to as the one uniform circumstance that constitutes the rectitude of human actions then indeed virtue and vice assume a more real and permanent nature the common sense nay the very necessities of mankind will urge them to make an unvaried and just distinction for happiness and misery make too strong an appeal to all the faculties of man to be borne down by the caprice of fancy and opinion that it was either an accidental or a designed inattention to this great principle of happiness that gave this coarse writer an occasion to call in question the permanent reality of vice and virtue the following considerations may sufficiently convince us  should any one ask whether health and sickness are two different things no doubt we should answer in the affirmative and would surely suspect any mans sincerity who should tell us that what was accounted health in one age or nation was accounted sickness in another there are likewise such things as wholesome food and poisons nor would we entertain a much better opinion of him who should affirm that all depends upon fancy that bread or milk are nourishing or destructive that arsenic and sublimate are wholesome or poisonous as imagination and opinion dictate on the contrary we know their nature with respect to man is invariable the one universally wholesome the other poisonous further we know there have been debates among physicians about regimen and diet that some have maintained the wholesomeness of animal others of vegetable food some recommended the drinking of water others of wine yet none was ever so weak as to conclude from these different opinions about wholesome diet that the nourishing qualities of bread or the noxious ones of arsenic were not permanent realities with regard to man or that the first could be made poisonous the latter wholesome by dint of fancy and opinion  now the case we are debating is exactly parallel for sure the happiness and misery of mankind are things as distinct as health and sickness whence it follows that certain actions under the same circumstances must universally produce happiness or misery as naturally as food produces health or poison sickness and death we have already seen that whatever tends to the good of all is by the consent of all denominated virtue that whatever is contrary to this great end is universally branded as vice in the same manner as whatever nourishes the body is called food whatever destroys it poison accordingly we find the agreement among mankind as uniform on the one subject as on the other all ages and nations having without exception or variance maintained that humanity fidelity truth temperance and mutual benevolence do as naturally produce happiness as food gives health to the body that cruelty treachery lying intemperance inhumanity adultery murder do as naturally give rise to misery as poison brings on sickness and death  but has not this author given such instances as prove that what is detested as vice in one country is applauded as virtue in another that polygamy and incestuous marriages have been in some nations reputed lawful in others meritorious and if one virtue or vice be imaginary or variable does it not clearly follow that all are so  now a man of a common turn of thought would be apt to make a very different inference if from the variety of opinions among mankind as to some virtues or vices he concluded these were variable then from the universal agreement of mankind with regard to other virtues and vices he would conclude these were fixed and invariable the consent of mankind in the one proves as much as their disagreement in the other and it is evident that both their consent and disagreement arise from the same principle a principle which destroys the tenets which this author labors to establish for to resume our illustration as the various opinions concerning the superior wholesomeness of this or that kind of diet does not change the nature of bread or poison so neither can the various opinions concerning polygamy or incest affect or change the nature of benevolence and generosity adultery and murder it is plain these various opinions have been formed upon such actions only as are not universally and clearly connected with the happiness or misery of mankind as these actions have been deemed productive of the one or the other they have been regarded as virtues or vices but this variety of opinions does no more unsettle the nature of those actions whose tendency is clear and certain than the debates on the superior wholesomeness of animal or vegetable diet can change the nature of bread and poison hence it appears that virtue and vice are permanent realities and that their nature is fixed certain and invariable  thus one extreme produces another for the noble writer and this gentleman through a strong dislike of each others systems have both endeavored to prove too much and in consequence have proved nothing the one contending for the permanent reality of virtue and not content to fix it on its proper basis attempts to establish certain absolute and immutable forms of beauty without regard to any further end and thus by laying a chimerical foundation betrays the cause which he so generously defends the other intent on destroying the permanent reality of virtue and vice and perceiving how weak a basis the noble writer had laid for their establishment after proving this to be imaginary as wisely as honestly infers there is no real one in nature we now see the folly of these extremes that as on the one part virtue and vice are things merely relative to the happiness of man so on the other while man continues what he is all those relations which concern his happiness and arise from his present manner of existence are likewise permanent and immutable  section v but this idle objection against the permanent reality of virtue and vice is not the only one which the writer last mentioned has labored for the destruction of religion and virtue for the main drift and intention of his book is to prove no less a paradox than this that private vices are public benefits now till this objection be removed our idea and definition of virtue can never be thoroughly established for if private vices be public benefits then private virtues are public mischiefs and if so what becomes of our definition  now the first notable circumstance in this formidable assertion of dr mandeville is its utter inconsistency with all that he has advanced in order to destroy the reality of vice and virtue for if indeed these be mere names the creatures of fancy and opinion how can they be attended with any uniform effects how can they be either public benefits or public evils  if on the contrary they really produce certain uniform effects as he has attempted to prove how can they be mere nonentities the creatures of fancy and opinion here lies a gross and palpable incoherence take which of his two theories you please the other absolutely destroys it if vice be a public benefit it must be a permanent reality if it is not a permanent reality it cannot be a public benefit  let us now examine the foundations on which he has built this strange hypothesis his book may be analyzed into four different principles which he has variously combined or rather jumbled together according as each in their turn would best serve his purpose  the first principle he lays down or rather takes up i e for granted is that man is a compound of evil passions in other words that the gratisication of the natural appetites is in itself a vice there are in his book at least a hundred pages of the lowest commonplace declamation all founded on this one principle brought from the solitary caves and visions of the desert thus the desire of being esteemed by others he stigmatizes with the name of pride the natural desire of social converse between the two sexes he distinguishes by a grosser appellation in a word through the whole course of his argument he supposes that every selfish appetite that is every appetite which has regard to ourself is in its own nature vile and abominable this the candid reader will probably think a little hard upon human nature that no man can be virtuous while he endeavors to be esteemed while he loves to quench his thirst minister to posterity or eat his dinner on the weight of these plain instances the value of this first principle may be safely left to any mans impartial trial  having thus branded every gratification of the natural appetites he gains from hence a proper foundation for the second pillar of this temple of vice for he acquaints us with great solemnity that of all other vices that of luxury is most beneficial to a state and that if this were banished the nation all kinds of manual occupations would immediately languish and decay fable of the bees passim  he says indeed that pedants make objections to this vice of luxury and tell you that it enervates a people but he adds that since he has seen the world the consequences of luxury to a nation seem not so dreadful to him as they did ibid p      had he left the matter here we should have been at a loss to know how he would have made out this strange tale but the riddle is cleared up at once when we hear him say that every thing is luxury that is not immediately necessary to make man subsist as he is a living creature ibid p  0    we should have been startled perhaps had he assured us that he had a windmill which laid eggs and bred young ones but how easily had he reconciled us to his veracity by only saying that by a windmill he meant a goose or a turkey  thus when he affirms that luxury produces public happiness we stand ready for some deep and subtle speculation to support so wondrous a paradox but when he poorly tells us that every thing is luxury that is not immediately necessary to make man subsist as he is a living creature we laugh not so much at his impudence as at our own folly in giving ear to so idle a prater whose widemouthed paradoxes so soon dwindle into a little harmless nonsense and when we thought we had him reforming states and newmodeling philosophy he was all the while playing at crambo  lest it should be suspected that the features of this mans folly are here aggravated take a copy of his countenance in one instance out of many that might be given the consequences says he of this vice of luxury to a nation seem not so dreadful to me as they did  for clean linen weakens a man no more than flannel fable of the bees p      now from these passages laid together it appears first that luxury is a vice secondly that to wear clean linen is luxury and therefore it comes out as clear as the day that to wear clean linen is a vice  seriously the sophistry here employed is one of those insults that can be safely offered only to an english understanding which though none of the brightest is always ready to reflect the present object did ever any man before  except only a set of wrongheaded enthusiasts whose visions he is here obliged to adopt  did ever any man maintain that to use the bounties of nature or enjoy the conveniences of life was a criminal indulgence did ever any man maintain that he could be viciously luxurious who neither hurt his neighbor nor himself at this rate by an arbitrary use of words and putting one expression for another we might boldly advance the most palpable contradictions and maintain that dr m  d  le was a man of modesty and virtue  thus far we have seen this writer endeavoring to throw the false colors of vice upon the natural passions and such a use of the gifts of nature as is really innocent in examining his two remaining principles we shall find him acting a part the very reverse and with the same effrontery endeavoring to throw the false colors of public utility on such actions and affections as are really criminal and destructive  to this purpose he boldly selects some of the most flagrant crimes and assures us that without their happy influence the public would suffer exceedingly who had ever dreamt that mankind receives benefit from thieves and housebreakers yet he tells us that if all people were strictly honest half the smiths in the nation would want employment fable of the bees p      highwaymen too and robbers are useful in their generation for if a miser should be robbed of five hundred or a thousand guineas there is a common error with regard to misers on which this pretended argument is built they are generally accounted the greatest enemies of society because they hoard the wealth which ought to circulate now to give even a miser his due this is really a groundless charge for they seldom hoard more than certain useless papers or parchments in the shape of notes bonds and mortgages while the wealth which they thus hoard in imagination circulates freely among all ranks of people the guilt of the misers passion lies in its being essentially destructive both of justice and benevolence  it is certain that as soon as this money should come to circulate the nation would be the better for the robbery and receive the same and as real a benefit from it as if an archbishop had left the same sum to the public fable of the bees p      he is abundantly rhetorical on the large catalogue of solid blessings that accrue from and are owing to intoxicating gin fable of the bees p     insomuch that if the drunkenness and frenzy arising from the excessive use of this salutary liquor were curbed by the magistrate he seems to foretell the most fatal consequences to the public wealth and welfare  here then he enumerates several real crimes which are necessarily attended with great evils and these he demonstrates are accidentally productive of some good and this indeed is the only part of his argument that is attended with any degree of plausibility for here it must be owned there is room for a dishonest mind to confound though by no means to convince an impartial reader because the consequences of these crimes being of a various and discordant nature some having the appearance of good and others of ill to society a rhetorical display of the former may possibly induce a superficial enquirer who is caught by a glare of eloquence to doubt whether these do not really predominate but a moderate share of attention will convince us that this is impossible because all the real vices he mentions though they be accidentally productive of some good yet it is such as might effectually be obtained without them thus the money taken wrongfully by stealth or robbery is only of service to the public by its circulation but money may circulate without stealth or robbery and therefore it is neither the stealth nor robbery that is of service to the public on the other part there are great and substantial evils which these crimes and these alone give rise to on this occasion one might be very large on the terrors and distress the murders and consequent miseries which the villainies patronized by this writer do necessarily produce one who was master of dr mandevilles townrhetoric and townexperience might draw a striking picture of honest and industrious families rowzed from sleep at midnight only to be plundered and destroyed of the horrid attempts of abandoned wickedness let loose from fear by the security of darkness the shrieks of ravished maids and matrons the dying groans of brothers fathers husbands weltring in their blood the cries of innocent and helpless orphans weeping over their murdered parents deprived at once of all that were dear to them of all that could yield them consolation or support and suffering every vile indignity that unrelenting villainy can suggest or perpetrate and how think you does this scene of domestic horror change its original nature and rise at length into a public blessing why because the adventurers having made off with their booty may possibly lay it out upon a harlot or squander it in a nightcellar or a ginshop fable of the bees p        and thus the money circulates through the nation but in the mean time our philosopher has forgot the helpless family reduced to beggary by the prowess of his nocturnal herces he has forgot that the fond and indulgent parent might no less probably have laid out the money in the temperate maintenance and liberal education of his children which is now squandered in unprofitable riot and excess that these destroyers of other mens happiness and their own had they been employed in honest labor in the cultivation of lands or the improvement of manufactures might have done substantial services to the public and themselves without the guilty alloy of unprovoked mischief from these circumstances impartially compared it is evident that the only essential consequence of private vice is public misery and thus our authors new fashioned system of morals falls back again into nothing  his fourth principle is much less plausible indeed he never applies to this but when reduced to the last necessity when therefore every other foundation fails him he attempts to impose upon his readers negligence or simplicity by representing vice as a cause where in reality it is a consequence thus he tells us great wealth and foreign treasure will ever scorn to come among men unless you will admit their inseparable companions avarice and luxury where trade is considerable fraud will intrude to be at once wellbred and sincere is no less than a contradiction and therefore whilst man advances in knowledge and his manners are polished we must expect to see at the same time his desires enlarged his appetites refined and his vices increased fable of the bees p  0   so again having been driven from his other strong holds by certain impertinent remarkers whom he wisely dismisseth with an air of superiority and contempt he takes refuge in the same ambiguous phrases as that vice is inseparable from great and potent societies in the same manner as dirty streets are a necessary evil inseparable from the felicity of london fable of the bees preface p   etc   now though this happy simile may work wonders in a coffeehouse amongst those who see every dirty alley pregnant with demonstration yet it is to be hoped more serious readers may distinguish better and be enabled to tell him that before they grant his position that private vice is public benefit they expect he should prove that the dirt in london streets is the cause or instrument whereby london becomes a populous and flourishing city a proposition almost as remote from common apprehension as that tenterden steeple is the cause of goodwin sands thus we see how dexterously he puts the change upon the unwary reader and while he pretends to exhibit an essential cause slurs him off with an accidental consequence  into these four principles all evidently false or foreign to the purpose his whole book may be justly analyzed nor is there one observation in the compass of so many hundred pages which tends to support the pernicious falsehood that disgraceth his title page but what will naturally resolve itself into one or other of these wretched sophisms it is therefore unnecessary to lead the reader through all the windings of this immense labyrinth of falsehood it is enough to have given the clue which may safely conduct him through them  section vi having at length gained an adequate idea of virtue and found that it is no other than the voluntary production of the greatest public happiness we may now safely proceed to consider upon what foundations mankind are obliged to the practice of it  and here we shall find another metaphysical cloud resting upon this path in itself plain and easy to all mankind for the very notion of obligation to virtue has been as much consounded by moral writers as the idea of virtue itself and here we might travel through another system of logomachies while one asserts that we are obliged to love and pursue virtue because she is beautiful another because virtue is good another because virtue is good in itself a fourth because virtue is truth a fifth because it is agreeable to nature a sixth because it is agreeable to the relations of things  but it is supposed that the intelligent reader from a review of the first section of this essay may be convinced that all these amusing expressions amount to no more than this that there is some reason or other why we ought to practice virtue but that the particular reason does not appear notwithstanding all this refined pomp of affirmation and as it has already been made evident that the essence of virtue consists in a conformity of our affections and actions with the greatest public happiness so it will now appear that the only reason or motive by which individuals can possibly be induced or obliged to the practice of virtue must be the feeling immediate or the prospect of future private happiness  doubtless the noble writers admirers will despise and reject this as an unworthy maxim for so it has happened that in the height of their zeal for supporting his opinions they generally stigmatize private happiness as a thing scarce worth a wise mans enquiring after indeed the many ambiguous phrases of their master have contributed not a little to this vulgar error for in one place he brands the modern philosophers and divines with the name of sophisters and pedants for rating life by the number and exquisiteness of the pleasing sensations wit and hum part iii    at other times he speaks of pleasure with all the contempt of an ancient stoic moral part iii    in the same high style of the athenian porch he passes judgment on the hopes of the religious they have made virtue so mercenary a thing and have talked so much of its rewards that one can hardly tell what there is in it after all which can be worth rewarding wit part ii    so again he derides those modern projectors who would new frame the human heart and have a mighty fancy to reduce all its motions balances and weights to that one principle and foundation of a cool and deliberate selfishness and thus love of ones country and love of mankind must also be selflove wit part ii     now ere we proceed further it may be necessary to remark that in some degree there has been a strife about words in this particular too for these expressions of selfishness and disinterestedness have been used in a very loose and indeterminate manner in one sense a motive is called disinterested when it consists in a pure benevolent affection or a regard to the moral sense in another no motive is disinterested for even in acting according to these impulses of benevolence and conscience we gratify an inclination and act upon the principle or immediate feeling of private happiness thus when we say we love virtue for virtues sake it is only implied that we find immediate happiness from the love and practice of virtue without regard to external or future consequences  another source of mutual misapprehension on this subject has been the introduction of metaphorical expressions instead of proper ones nothing is so common among the writers on morality as the harmony of virtue  the proportion of virtue so the noble writer frequently expresses himself but his favorite term borrowed indeed from the ancients is the beauty of virtue  quae si videri posset mirabiles excitaret amores cicero  of this our author and his followers especially the most ingenious of them mr hutcheson  are so enamoured that they seem utterly to have forgot they are talking in metaphor when they describe the charms of this sovereign fair insomuch that an unexperienced person who should read their encomiums would naturally fall into the mistake of him who asked the philosopher whether the virtues were not living creatures senecae epist cxiv  now this figurative manner so essentially interwoven into philosophical disquisition has been the occasion of great error it tends to mislead us both with regard to the nature of virtue and our obligations to the practice of it for first it induces a persuasion that virtue is excellent without regard to any of its consequences and secondly that he must either want eyes or common discernment who does not at first sight fall in love with this matchless lady  therefore setting aside as much as may be all ambiguous expressions it seems evident that a motive from its very nature must be something that affects ourself if any man has found out a kind of motive which does not affect himself he has made a deeper investigation into the springs weights and balances of the human heart than i can pretend to now what can possibly affect ourself or determine us to action but either the feeling or prospect of pleasure or pain happiness or misery  but to come to the direct proof it is evident even to demonstration that no affection can in the strict sense be more or less selfish or disinterested than another because whatever be its object the affection itself is still no other than a mode either of pleasure or of pain and is therefore equally to be referred to the mind or feeling of the patient whatever be its external occasion indeed a late writer of subtilty and refinement has attempted to make a distinction here he says it has been observed that every act of virtue or friendship is attended with a secret pleasure from whence it has been concluded that friendship and virtue could not be disinterested but the fallacy of this is obvious the virtuous sentiment or passion produces the pleasure and does not arise from it i feel a pleasure in doing good to my friend because i love him but i do not love him for the sake of that pleasure humes essays mor and polit p      now to me the fallacy of this is obvious for in fact neither the passion nor the pleasure are either the cause or the consequence of each other they neither produce nor arise from each other because in reality they are the same thing under different expressions this will be clear if we state the case as follows to love my friend is to feel a pleasure in doing him good and conversely to feel a pleasure in doing good to my friend is to love him where it is plain that the terms are synonymous the pleasure therefore is the very passion itself and neither prior nor posterior to it as this gentleman supposes  again that the pleasures arising from benevolence and the moral sense are strictly selfish in this sense of the word like every other enjoyment seems evident from some parallel concessions of the noble writer for these seemingly disinterested pleasures he perpetually sets on a level with the perceptions of natural beauty order harmony and proportion these last are by all acknowledged to be of the selfish kind therefore the other are so too being only a higher order of the same and expressly called so by the noble writer moralists part ii   the reasons why the great universal principle of private happiness has not been so clearly seen in the benevolent as in the selfpassions seem to be these first ambiguous expressions such as have been remarked above   dly perhaps some degree of pride and affectation of merit because merit seems to appear in what is called disinterest   dly and perhaps principally because in the exercise of the benevolent passions the happiness is essentially concomitant with the passion itself and therefore is not easily separated from it by the imagination so as to be considered as a distinct end whereas in the passions called selfish the happiness sought after is often unattainable and therefore easily and necessarily distinguished by the imagination as a positive end this circumstance of union however as is judiciously remarked by one of the noble writers followers three treatises by j h treat  d on happiness p      proves the great superiority and excellence of the benevolent affections considered as a source of happiness beyond the passions and appetites commonly called the selfish  but although these observations be necessary in order to clear up an affair which has been much perplexed with philosophical or unphilosophical refinements yet on a closer examination it will appear in the most direct manner from the noble writer himself that there is no other principle of human action but that of the immediate or foreseen happiness of the agent that all these amusing speculations concerning the comely fit and decent all these verbal separations between pleasure interest beauty and good might have been sunk in one precise and plain disquisition concerning such actions and affections as yield a lasting and such as afford only a short and transient happiness for thus after all his lordship explains himself that happiness is to be pursued and in fact is always sought after that the question is not who loves himself and who not but who loves and serves himself the righest and after the truest manner  that it is the height of wisdom no doubt to be rightly selfish  even to leave family friends country and society  in good earnest who would not if it were happiness to do so wit and hum part iii     these expressions are so strongly pointed as to leave no further doubt concerning the noble writers sentiments on this subject indeed they are the natural dictates of common sense unsophisticated with false philosophy in every subsequent debate therefore wherein his lordships opinions are concerned we may safely build on this as an acknowledged and sure foundation that the motives or natural obligations of man to the practice of virtue can only arise from a sense of his present or a prospect of his future happiness  section vii now this conclusion will carry us to another question of a very interesting and abstruse nature that is how far and upon what foundation the uniform practice of virtue is really and clearly connected with the happiness of every individual for so far as we have seen and no further can every individual be naturally moved or obliged to the practice of it  this is evidently a question of fact and as it relates to the happiness of man can only be determined by appealing to his constitution if this be indeed uniform and invariable that is if every individual has the same perceptions passions and desires then indeed the sources of happiness must be similar and unchangeable if on the contrary different men be differently constituted if they have different perceptions passions and desires then must the sources of their happiness be equally various  it should seem therefore that while moralists have been enquiring into human happiness they have generally considered it as arising from one uniform and particular source instead of tracing it up to those various fountains whence it really springs which are indefinitely various combined and indeterminable and this seems to have been the most general foundation of error  if we speak with precision there are but three sources in man of pleasure and pain happiness and misery these are sense imagination and the passions now the slightest observation will convince us that these are associated separated and combined in man with a variety almost infinite in some the pleasures and pains of sense predominate imagination is dull the passions inactive in others a more delicate frame awakens all the powers of imagination the passions are refined the senses disregarded a third constitution is carried away by the strength of passion the calls of sense are contemned and imagination becomes no more than the necessary instrument of some further gratification  from overlooking this plain fact seems to have arisen the discordance among philosophers concerning the happiness of man and while each has attempted to exhibit one favorite picture as the paragon or standard of human kind they have all omitted some ten thousand other resemblances which actually subsist in nature  thus most of the epicurean sect though not the founder of it have discarded benevolence and virtue from their system of private happiness the modern patronizers of this scheme mr hobbes dr mandeville and several french writers after heaping up a collection of sordid instances which prove the sensual inclinations and selfishness of man leap at once to their desired conclusion that the pretended public affections are therefore no more than the same low passions in disguise that benevolence makes no part of mans nature that the human kind are absolutely unconnected with each other in point of affection and that every individual seeks and finds his private happiness in and from himself alone  the noble writer on the contrary viewing the brighter parts of human nature through the amiable medium of the socratic philosophy and fixing his attention on the public affections as the instruments both of public and private happiness rejects the epicureans pretenses with disdain and fully conscious of the high claims and energy of virtue affirms that the private affections are by no means a foundation for private happiness that on the contrary we must universally promote the welfare of others if we would effectually secure our own and that in every case  virtue is the good and vice the ill of every one enquiry concerning virtue passim   it is plain no two systems of philosophy can be more discordant than these yet each of them have obtained a number of partisans in all ages of the world the question relates to a fact and the fact lies open to the personal examination of all mankind whence then can so strange an opposition of sentiments arise  this seems to have arisen not from a false but a partial view and examination of the subject the stoic party dwell altogether on the social or public the epicurean no less on the private or selfish affections on these respectively they declaim so that according to the one mankind are naturally a race of demigods according to the other a crew of devils both forgetting what is unquestionably the truth that these social and private affections are blended in an endless variety of degrees and thus form an infinite variety of inclinations and of characters many of the particular facts therefore which these two sects allege are true but the general consequence they draw from these particular facts is groundless and imaginary thus it is true that mankind reap high enjoyments from the senses imagination and passions without any regard to the public affections but the consequence which the epicurean would draw from hence that therefore the public affections are never in any case a source of private happiness this is entirely void of evidence it supposes mankind to be one uniform subject while it is a subject infinitely various that every individual has the same feelings appetites fancies and affections while in fact they are mixed and combined in an endless variety of degrees so on the contrary it must appear to every impartial observer that the exercise of the public affections is a source of the highest gratification to many individuals but the stoics conclusion that therefore the uniform exercise of the public affections in preference to every other is the only source of happiness to every individual this is a conclusion equally void of evidence for like its opposite extreme it supposes mankind to be one uniform subject while in fact it is a subject indefinitely various it supposes that every individual has the same feelings appetites fancies and affections while in reality they are mixed and combined in an endless variety of degrees  let us now assign the most probable foundation on which these narrow and partial systems have been so commonly embraced for that two theories so opposite and so devoid of all rational support should have made their way in the world without some permanent cause beyond the instability of mere chance seems hardly credible  it should seem therefore that while the patronizers of these two systems have attempted to give a general picture of the human species they have all along taken the copy from themselves and thus their philosophy instead of being a true history of nature is no more than the history of their own imaginations or affections  this truth may receive sufficient confirmation from the lives and conduct of all the old philosophers from the elegant plato walking on his rich carpets to the unbred cynic snarling in his tub as every mans constitution led him so he adopted this or that sect of philosophy and reasoned concerning fitness decency and good read the characters of cato and caesar and you will clearly discover the true foundation on which the one became a rigid stoic the other a gross epicurean the first yet a boy discovered such an inflexible adherence to the privileges of his country that he refused his assent to what he thought a violation of them though threatened with immediate death plutarchi cato utic  the latter yet unpractised in the subtilties of philosophy and under the sole dominion of natural temper discovered at his first appearance in the world such traits of art spirit and ambition that sylla declared he saw something more formidable than marius rising in him suetonii julius caesar  to bring down the observation to modern times it is evident that the patronizers of these two systems inlist themselves according to the secret suggestions of their several passions it is well known that the writer of the fable of the bees was neither a saint in his life nor a hermit in his diet he seems to have been master of a very considerable sagacity much knowledge of the world as it appears in populous cities extremely sensible to all the grosser bodily enjoyments but for delicacy of sentiment imagination or passion for an exquisite taste either in arts or morals he appears to have been incapable of it  the noble writer is known to have been of a frame the very reverse of this his constitution was neither more nor less opposite to dr mandevilles than his philosophy his sensual appetites were weak his imagination all alive noble and capacious his passions were accordingly refined and his public affections in fancy at least predominant to these instances a moderate share of sagacity and knowledge of the world may add others innumerable in observing the temper and conduct of the followers os these two systems who always take party according to the biass of their own constitution among the epicureans we ever find men of high health florid complexions firm nerves and a capacity for pleasure of the stoic party are the delicate or sickly frames men incapable of the grosser sensual enjoyments and who either are or think themselves virtuous now from these accumulated proofs we may be convinced that they who give us these uniform pictures of a subject so various as mankind cannot have drawn them from nature that on the contrary they have copied them from their own hearts or imaginations and fondly erected themselves into a general standard of the human species  but although these observations may afford sufficient proof that the stoic and epicurean pictures of mankind are equally partial yet still it remains to be enquired how far upon the whole the human kind in reality leans toward the one or the other that is how far and in what degree the uniform practice of virtue constitutes the happiness of individuals now the only method of determining this question will be to select some of the most striking features of the human heart by this means we may approach toward a real likeness though from that infinite variety which subsists in nature the draught must ever be inadequate and defective  to begin with the lowest temperature of the human species there are great numbers of mankind in whom the senses are the chief sources of pleasure and pain to the harmony of sounds the beauty of forms the decorum of actions they are utterly insensible they are sagacious and learned in all the gratifications of sense but if you talk to them of the public affections of generosity kindness friendship good will you talk in a language they understand not they seem in a manner unconnected with the rest of their kind they view the praises censures enjoyments and sufferings of others with an eye of perfect indifference to men thus formed how can virtue gain admittance do you appeal to their taste of beauty they have none to their acknowledged perceptions of right and wrong these they measure by their private interest to the force of the public affections they never felt them thus every avenue is foreclosed by which virtue should enter  the next remarkable peculiarity is where not the senses but imagination is the predominant source of pleasure here the taste always runs into the elegant refinements of polite arts and acquirements of painting music architecture poetry sculpture or in defect of this truer taste on the false delicacies of dress furniture and equipage yet experience tells us that this character is widely different from the virtuous one that all the powers of imagination may subsist in their full energy while the public affections and moral sense are weak or utterly inactive nor can there be any necessary connection between these different feelings because we see numbers immersed in all the finer pleasures of imagination who never once consider them as the means of giving pleasure to others but merely as a selfish gratification this the noble writer seems to have been aware of and not without great address endeavors to convert the fact into a proof of his main theory though in reality it affords the strongest evidence against him the venustum the honestum the decorum of things will sorce its way they who refuse to give it scope in the nobler subjects of a rational and moral kind will find its prevalency elsewhere in an inferior order of things  as either in the study of common arts or in the care and culture of mere mechanic beauties  the specter still will haunt us in some shape or other and when driven from our cool thoughts and frighted from the closet will meet us even at court and fill our heads with dreams of grandeur titles honors and a false magnificence and beauty wit and hum part iv    all this is ingenious and plausible and the very elegant allusion of the specter still haunting us in some shape or other seems at first view to imply that even the most obstinate endeavors to get rid of the force of moral beauty are ineffectual and vain but a nearer examination will convince us that the noble writer applies here to eloquence rather than argument and puts us off with a metaphor instead of a reason for the pleasures of imagination whether they run in the channel of polite arts furniture planting building or equipage are indeed no specters but independent realities sairly existing in the mind they have no immediate or necessary connection with the happiness of mankind which is often and designedly violated in order to gain the possession of them it is true the pleasures of imagination and virtue are often united in the same mind but it is equally true that they are often separate that they who are most sensible to the one are entire strangers to the other that one man to purchase a fine picture will oppress his tenant that another to relieve his distressed tenant will sell his statues or his pictures the reason is evident the one draws his pleasure from imagination the other from affection only it is clear therefore that where imagination is naturally the predominant source of pleasure the motives to virtue must be very partial and weak since the chief happiness arises from a source entirely distinct from the benevolent affections  another and very different temperature of the heart of man is that wherein neither sense nor imagination but the passions are the chief sources of pleasure and pain this often forms the best or the worst of characters as it runs either first into the extreme of selfishness jealousy pride hatred envy and revenge or   dly into the amiable affections of hope faith candor pity generosity and good will or   dly into a various mixture or combination of these which is undoubtedly the most common temperature of human kind  now to the first of these tempers how can we affirm with truth that there is a natural motive or obligation to virtue on the contrary it should seem that if there be any motive it must be to vice for it is plain that from the losses disappointments and miseries of mankind such vile tempers draw their chief felicity the noble writer indeed in his zeal for virtue considers these black passions as unnatural and brands them as a source of constant misery enquiry  and sure it would be matter of joy to all good men to find his proofs convincing but if indeed this be not a true representation of the case i see not what service can be done to the interests of virtue by disguising truth it is not the part of a philosopher to write panegyrics but to investigate the real state of human nature and the only way of doing this to any good purpose is to do it impartially for with regard to human nature as well as individuals flattery is a crime no less than slander  when therefore the noble writer calls these affections unnatural he does not sufficiently explain himself if indeed by their being unnatural he means that they are such in their degrees or objects as to violate the public happiness which is the main intention of nature in this sense it is acknowledged they are unnatural but this interpretation is foreign to the question because it affects not the individual but if by their being unnatural he would imply that they are a source of constant misery to the agent this seems a proposition not easy to be determined in the affirmative  for the main proof which he brings in support of this assertion is that the men of gentlest dispositions and best of tempers have at some time or other been sufficiently acquainted with those disturbances which at ill hours even small occasions are apt to raise from these slender experiences of harshness and ill humor they fully know and will confess the ill moments which are passed when the temper is ever so little galled and fretted how must it fare therefore with those who hardly know any better hours in life and who for the greatest part of it are agitated by a through active spleen a close and settled malignity and rancour enquiry b ii part ii     now this instance is by no means sufficient to support the affirmation for it is plain that in the case of the men of gentlest dispositions and best of tempers occasionally agitated by ill humor there must be a strong opposition and discordance a violent conflict between the habitual affections of benevolence and these accidental eruptions of spleen and rancour which rise to obstruct their course a warfare of this kind must indeed be a state of complete misery when all is uproar within and the distracted heart set at variance with itself but the case is widely different where a through active spleen prevails a close and settled malignity and rancour for in this temper there is no parallel opposition of contending passions nor therefore any similar foundation for inward disquiet and intense misery so much the noble writer himself is obliged to own elsewhere is there that sordid creature on earth who does not prize his own enjoyment  is not malice and cruelty of the highest relish with some natures moralists part i  again and still more fully to the purpose had we sense we should consider it is in reality the through profligate the very complete unnatural villain alone who can any way bid for happiness with the honest man true interest is wholly on the one side or the other all between is inconsistency irresolution remorse vexation and an aguefit wit and hum part iv    neither is this acknowledgment peculiar to himself to be consistent either in virtue or in vice was the farthest that some of the most penetrating among the ancients could carry the point of morals see arrian epict lib iii c     thus where the selfish or malevolent affections happen to prevail there can be no internal motive or natural obligation to virtue  on the contrary where the amiable affections of hope candor generosity and benevolence predominate in this best and happiest of tempers virtue has indeed all the force and energy which the noble writer attributes to her charms for where the calls of sense are weak the imagination active and refined the public affections predominant there the moral sense must naturally reign with uncontrouled authority must produce all that selfsatisfaction that consciousness of merited kindness and esteem in which his lordship affirms the very essence of our obligation to virtue does consist this shall with pleasure be acknowledged nay asserted as the happiest of all temperaments whenever it can be found or acquired to a mind thus formed virtue does indeed bring an immediate and ample reward of perfect peace and sincere happiness in all the common situations of life it may therefore be with truth affirmed that a temper thus framed is indeed naturally and internally obliged to the uniform practice of virtue  there are besides these an endless variety of characters formed from the various combinations of these essential ingredients which are not designed as a full expression of all the tempers of mankind they are the materials only out of which these characters are formed they are no more than the several species of simple colors laid as it were upon the pallet which variously combined and associated by the hand of an experienced master would indeed call forth every striking resemblance every changeful feature of the heart of man  now among all this infinite variety of tempers which is found in nature we see there cannot be any uniform motive or obligation to virtue save only where the senses are weak the imagination refined and the public affections strongly predominant for in every other character where either the senses gross imagination or selfish passions prevail a natural opposition or discordance must arise and destroy the uniform motive to virtue by throwing the happiness of the agent into a different channel how seldom this sublime temper is to be found is hard to say but this may be affirmed with truth that every man is not really possessed of it in the conduct of life who enjoys it in imagination or admires it in his closet as it lies in the enquiry concerning virtue a character of this supreme excellence must needs be approved by most and the heart of man being an unexhausted fountain of selfdeceit what it approves is forward to think itself possessed of thus a lively imagination and unperceived selflove fetter the heart in certain ideal bonds of their own creating till at length some turbulent and furious passion arising in its strength breaks these fantastic shackles which fancy had imposed and leaps to its prey like a tiger chained by cobwebs  section viii from these different views of human nature let us now bring this argument to a conclusion  the noble writers scheme of morals therefore being grounded on a supposition which runs through the whole course of his argument that all mankind are naturally capable of attaining a taste or relish for virtue sufficient for every purpose of social life seems essentially defective for from the enquiry already made into the real and various constitution of man it appears that a great part of the species are naturally incapable of this fancied excellence that the various mixture and predominancy of sense imagination and passion give a different cast and complexion of mind to every individual that the feeling or prospect of happiness can only arise from this combination that consequently where the benevolent affections and moral sense are weak the selfish passions and perceptions headstrong there can be no internal motive or natural obligation to the consistent practice of virtue  the most plausible pretense i could ever meet with amidst all the pomp of declamation thrown out in support of this all sufficiency of a taste in morals is this that although the force and energy of this taste for virtue appears not in every individual yet the power lies dormant in every human breast and needs only be called forth by a voluntary selfdiscipline in order to be brought to its just perfection that the improvement in our taste in morals is parallel to the progress of the mind in every other art and excellence in painting music architecture picture in which a true taste however natural to man is not born with him but formed and brought forth to action by a proper study and application  the noble writer has innumerable passages of this kind so many indeed that it were labor lost to transcribe them charact passim  and one of his followers has affirmed in still more emphatical expressions if possible than his master that the height of virtuosoship is virtue letters of hydaspes to philemon let vi   now this state of the case though at first view it carries some degree of plausibility yet on a closer examination destroys the whole system for if as it certainly is the capacity for a taste in morals be similar to a capacity for a taste in arts it is clear that the most assiduous culture or selfdiscipline can never make it even general much less universal one man we see has a capacity or genius for painting another for music a third for architecture a fourth for poetry torture each of them as you please you cannot infuse a taste for any but his own congenial art if you attempt to make the poet an architect or the painter a musician you may make a pretending pedant never an accomplished master it is the same in morals where the benevolent affections are naturally strong there is a capacity for a high taste in virtue where these are weak or wanting there is in the same proportion little or no capacity for a taste in virtue to harangue therefore on the superior happiness attending the exercise of the public affections is quite foreign to the purpose this superior happiness is allowed where the public affections can be found or made predominant but how can any consequence be drawn from hence so as to influence those who never felt the impulse of public affection are not the pleasures of poetry painting music sublime pure and lasting to those who taste them does it therefore follow that all mankind or any of them can be harangued into a taste and love of these elegant arts while the very capacity of receiving pleasure from them is wanting thus in morals where a similar incapacity takes place through the natural want of a lively benevolence no progress can ever be made in the taste or relish for virtuous enjoyment though therefore you should prove as indeed one of lord shaftesburys followers has done that virtue is accommodate to all places and times is durable selfderived and indeprivable three treat by j h treat  d on happiness  whence he concludes it has the best title to the character of the sovereign good yet all the while the main point in debate is taken for granted that is whether the possession of it be any good at all now to those who receive no increase of internal happiness from it it cannot be a good and where there is a natural defect of benevolent affection it can give no internal happiness consequently though it have all the other characters of the sumnium bonum though it be durable selfderived and indeprivable it can never by such be regarded as the sovereign good  it is pleasant enough to observe the argumentation of the writer last mentioned after describing the fairest and most amiable of objects the true and perfect man that ornament of humanity that godlike being without regard either to pleasure or pain uninfluenced either by prosperity or adversity superior to the world and its best and worst events  he then raises an objection  does not this system border a little upon the chimerical  on my word a shrewd question and well worth a good answer and thus he clears it up  it seems to require said i a perfection to which no individual ever arrived that very transcendence said he is an argument on its behalf were it of a rank inferior it would not be that perfection which we seek would you have it said i beyond nature if you mean replied he beyond any particular or individual nature most undoubtedly i would three treat by j h treat  d on happiness p      it is not therefore to be wondered at that this gentleman wrapped up in visions of ideal perfection should express his contempt of those superficial censurers who profess to refute what they want even capacities to comprehend ibid p  0   doubtless he means those grovelling observers who draw their ideas of mankind from particular or individual natures and have not yet risen to the beatific vision ibid of the perfect man indeed the gentleman frankly owns that practice too often creeps where theory can soar three treat by j h treat  d on happiness p  0   and this i take to be a true account of the matter  thus as according to these moralists the relish or taste for virtue is similar to a taste for arts so what is said of the poet the painter and musician may with equal truth be said of the man of virtue  nascitur non fit hence it is evident that the noble writers system which supposes all men capable of this exalted taste is chimerical and groundless  but even supposing all men capable of this refined taste in morals there would arise an unanswerable objection against the efficacy of this refined theory though it were allowed that all mankind have the same delicate perception of moral as some few have of natural beauty yet the parallel would by no means hold that as the virtuoso always pursues his taste in arts consistently so the man of virtue must be equally consistent in action and behavior for the virtuoso being only engaged in mere speculation has no opposite affections to counteract his taste he meets with no obstructions in his admiration of beauty his enthusiasm takes its unbounded flight not retarded by any impediments of a discordant nature but the man of virtue has a different and more difficult task to perform he has often a numerous train of passions and these perhaps the most violent to oppose he must labor through the surrounding demands and allurements of selfish appetite must subdue the solicitations of every the most natural affection when it opposes the dictates of a pure benevolence hence even supposing the most refined taste for virtue common to all it must ever be retarded in its progress often baffled and overthrown amidst the struggle of contending passions  this seems to be a full and sufficient reply to all that can be urged in support of this fantastic system from a view of human nature but as the noble writer has attempted to confirm his theory by some collateral arguments of another kind it may be proper here to consider their real weight  he urges therefore the probability at least if not the certain truth of his hypothesis from hence that it would be an imputation on the wisdom of the deity to suppose that he had formed man so imperfect that the true happiness of the individual should not always coincide with that of the whole kind enquiry  and beyond question the assertion is true but the consequence he draws from it that therefore human happiness must always consist in the immediate feeling of virtuous enjoyment is utterly groundless this inference seems to have been drawn from a view of the brute creation in which we find instincts or immediate feelings are the only motives to action and in which we find too that these immediate propensities are sufficient for all the purposes of their being in this constitution of things the creators wisdom is eminently displayed because through a defect of reason or reflection no other kind of principle could possibly have taken place but the conclusion drawn from thence that man must have a similar strength of instinct implanted in him in order to direct him to his supreme happiness this is without foundation because the deity has given him not only present perceptions but reason reflection and a foresight of future good and evil together with a sufficient power to obtain the one and avoid the other as therefore man has sufficient notices of the moral government of god which will at length produce a perfect coincidence between the virtuous conduct and the happiness of every individual it implies no essential defect of wisdom in the creator to suppose that he has not given this universal and unerring biass toward virtue to the whole human species man is enabled to pursue and obtain his proper happiness by reason brutes by instinct  again the noble writer often attempts to strengthen his argument by representing the external good which naturally flows from virtue and the external evils which naturally attend on vice enquiry b ii p i    but sure this is rather deserting than confirming his particular theory which is to prove that happiness is essential to virtue and inseparable from it that misery is essential to vice and inseparable from it  now in bringing his proofs from happiness or misery of the external kind he surely deserts his original intention because these externals are not immediate but consequential not certain but contingent they are precisely of the nature of reward and punishment and therefore can have no part in the question now before us which relates solely to that happiness or misery arising from the inward state of the mind affections and moral sense on the commission of vice or the practice of virtue and this has been already considered at large  however that nothing may be omitted which can even remotely affect the truth we may observe in passing that after all the labored and wellmeant declamation on this subject it is much easier to prove that vice is the parent of external misery than that virtue is the parent of external happiness it is plain that no man can be vicious in any considerable degree but he must suffer either in his health his fame or fortune now the generality of moralists after proving or illustrating this have taken it for granted as a certain consequence that the external goods of life are by the law of contraries in a similar manner annexed to the practice of virtue but in reality the proof can reach no further than to show the happy consequences of innocence which is a very different thing from virtue for innocence is only the abstaining from evil virtue the actual production of good now it is evident indeed that by abstaining from evil that is by innocence we must stand clear of the miseries to which we expose ourselves by the commission of it and this is as far as the argument will go but if we rigorously examine the external consequences of an active virtue in such a world as this we shall find it must be often maintained at the expense both of health ease and fortune often the loss of friends and increase of enemies not to mention the unwearied diligence of envy which is ever watchful and prepared to blast distinguished merit in the mean time the innoxious man sits unmolested and tranquil loves virtue and praises it avoids the miseries of vice and the fatigues of active virtue offends no man and therefore is beloved by all and for the rest makes it up by fair words and civil deportment thus innocence and not virtue abslinence from evil not the production of good is the furthest point to which mankind in general can be carried from a regard to the external consequences of action  but whenever appearances grow too strong against the noble writers system he takes refuge in an  apage vulgus  as he had before allowed that the vulgar may swallow any sordid jest or buffoonry so here he frequently suggests that among the same ranks any kind of sordid pleasure will go down but as it must be a finer kind of wit that takes with the men of breeding so in morals the relish or tasle for virtue is what naturally prevails in the higher stages of life that the liberal and polished part of mankind are disposed to treat every other principle of action as groundless and imaginary but that among these the taste in morals if properly cultivated must needs be sufficient for all the purposes of virtue see misc  d c   and many other detached passages   in reply to this which is perhaps the weakest pretense of all that the noble writer has alleged we need only observe that those who are born to honors power and fortune come into the world with the same various mixture and predominancy of sense imagination and affections with the lowest ranks of mankind so that if they really enjoy better opportunities of being completely virtuous these must arise not from their internal constitution but their external situation in life let us examine how far this may give a biass either toward vice or virtue  now it is plain that with regard to the senses or bodily appetites the possession of power and fortune must be rather hurtful than favorable to virtue wealth gives opportunity of indulgence and indulgence naturally inflames hence the habits of sensual inclination must in general be stronger in the lord than the peasant therefore as nothing tends so much to imbrute the man and sink every nobler affection of the mind as a servile attendance on sensual pleasure so in this regard the possession of power and fortune is rather dangerous than savourable to virtue  the same may be affirmed in respect to the passions or affections can any thing tend so much to render any passion ungovernable as to know that we need not govern it that our power riches and authority raise us above control that we can hate oppress revenge with impunity are not the great of all others most obnoxious to flattery does not this tend to produce and nourish an overweening opinion of themselves an unjust contempt of others and is not true virtue more likely to be lost than improved amidst all these surrounding temptations  the imagination indeed is often refined and reason improved in the higher ranks of life beyond the reach of the mere vulgar but they are little acquainted with human nature who think that reason and imagination among the bulk of mankind are any thing more than the ministers of the ruling appetites and passions especially where the appetites and passions are inflamed by the early and habitual possession of honors power and riches  but still it will be urged that the great are under the dominion of a powerful principle which is almost unknown among the vulgar  the principle of honor  which is a perfect balance against all these surrounding difficulties and a full security to virtue  with regard to this boasted principle a very material distinction must be made by honor is sometimes meant an affection of mind determining the agent to the practice of what is right without any dependence on other mens opinions now this is but the moral sense under a new appellation it arises too not from any particular situation of life but from the natural constitution of the mind accordingly it is not confined to any one rank of men but is seen promiscuously among the great and vulgar it is therefore entirely beyond the present question which only relates to such circumstances as are peculiar to high life  the other and more common acceptance of the word honor and in which alone it belongs peculiarly to the great is an affection of the mind determining the agent to such a conduct as may gain him the applause or esteem of those whose good opinion he is fond of now this love of fame and fear of disgrace though as a secondary motive to action it be often of the highest consequence in life though it often counterfeits sometimes even rivals benevolence itself yet as a principal motive there cannot be a more precarious foundation of virtue for the effects of this principle will always depend on the opinions of others it will always take its particular complexion from these and must always vary with them thus it is a matter of mere accident whether its consequences be good or bad wholesome or pernicious if the applanded maxims be founded in benevolence the principle will so far lead to virtue if they be founded in pride folly or contempt the principle will lead to vice and without any designed satire on the great it must be owned the latter of these has ever been the predominant character of honor it were false indeed to affirm that the principle has no mixture of benevolent intention yet it is equally clear that its chief design is not so much to secure the happiness of all as to maintain the superiority of a few and hence this principle has ever led its votaries to abhor the commission not so much of what is unjust as of what is contemptible thus it is clear that the principle of honor as distinguished from benevolent affection and the moral sense can never be a sufficient foundation for the uniform practice of virtue  these are the main arguments by which the noble writer has attempted to support this imagined all sufficiency of the relish or taste in morals had human nature been indeed that uniform and noble thing which he seems to have thought it he had surely been right in fixing the obligations of man to virtue on so generous and amiable a principle but as on examination it appears that he has all along supposed this human nature to be what it is not his system is visionary and groundless and his applauded theory only fit to find a place with the boasted power of the great old geometer when he said   give me but a place to set my foot on and i will move the whole earth     most full indeed and clear to this purpose are the words of the noble writer himself who in his miscellaneous capacity and in a merry mood seems to have spoken more of truth than i believe he would care to stand to  such has been of late our dry task no wonder if it carries indeed a meagre and raw appearance it may be looked on in philosophy as worse than a mere egyptian imposition for to make brick without straw or stubble is perhaps an easier labor than to prove morals without a world and establish a conduct of life without the supposition of any thing living or extant besides our immediate fancy and world of imagination misc iv c     these sallies might possibly have seemed difficult to account for had not the noble writer himself saved us the labor of this task for he elsewhere tells us that all sound love and admiration is enthusiasm the transports of poets orators musicians virtuosi the spirit of travelers and adventurers gallantry war heroism all all enthusiasm it is enough i am content to be this new enthusiast moralists sub sin   and thus in another place he describes the effects of this high passion that  enthusiasm is wonderfully powerful and extensive  for when the mind is taken up in vision  its horror delight confusion fear admiration or whatever passion belongs to it or is uppermost on this occasion will have something vast immane and as painters say beyond life and this is what gave occasion to the name of fanaticism as it was used by the ancients in its original sense for an apparition transporting the mind letter on enthusiasm   section ix having sufficiently evinced the flimzy though curious contexture of these cobweb speculations spun in the closet let us now venture abroad into the world let us proceed to something applicable to life and manners and consider what are the real motives by which mankind may be swayed to the uniform practice of virtue  and first in minds of a gentle and generous disposition where the sensual appetites are weak the imagination refined and the benevolent affections naturally predominant these very affections and the moral sense arising from them will in all the common occurrences of life secure the practice of virtue to these fine tempers thus happily formed the inward satisfaction of a virtuous conduct exceeds that of every outward acquisition and affords to its possessor a more true and lasting happiness than wealth or fame or power can bestow  secondly where the same degrees of public affection subsist but stand opposed by sensual or selfish passions of equal violence even here the agent may rise to very high degrees of virtue but not without the aids of discipline and culture yet it is observable that the virtues of such a temper are rather conspicuous than consistent without some strengthening assistance the progress of the mind toward perfection is often broke by the sallies of disordered passion  there is yet another character essentially different from these but seldom distinguished because generally taken for the first many esteem themselves and are esteemed by others as having arrived at the most consummate virtue whose conduct never merits a higher name than that of being innoxious this is generally the case of those who love retreat and contemplation of those whose passions are naturally weak or carefully guarded by what the world calls prudence now as in the last mentioned character a curb from irregularity was requisite so here a spur to action is equally necessary for the support and security of virtue  as we descend through more common and inferior characters the internal motives to virtuous action grow less and less effectual weak or no benevolence a moral sense proportionably dull strong sensual appetites a clamorous train of selfish affections these mixed and varied in endless combinations form the real character of the bulk of mankind not only in cottages but in cities churches camps and courts so that some stronger ties some motives more efficacious are necessary not only for the perfection of virtue but the welfare nay the very being of society  it is not denied nay it is meant and insisted on that among all these various characters and tempers the culture of the benevolent affections ought to be assiduously regarded for though we have seen that the design of introducing an universal high relish or taste for virtue be visionary and vain yet still a lower or a lower degree may possibly be instilled we have only attempted to prove that the capacity for this high taste in morals is not universally or essentially interwoven with the human frame but dispensed in various degrees in the same manner as the capacity for a taste in inferior beauties in architecture painting poetry and music  to remedy this defect of unerring instinct in man by which he becomes a creature so much less consistent than the brute kinds providence has afforded him not only a sense of present but a foresight of future good and evil  hence the force of human laws which being established by common consent for the good of all endeavor so far as their power can reach by the infliction of punishment on offenders to establish the general happiness of society by making the acknowledged interest of every individual to coincide and unite with the public welsare  but as human laws cannot reach the heart of man as they can only inflict punishment on offenders but cannot bestow rewards on the obedient as there are many duties of imperfect obligation which they cannot recognize as force will sometimes defy and cunning often elude their power so without some further aids some motives to action more universally interesting virtue must still be left betrayed and deserted  now as it is clear from the course of these observations that nothing can work this great effect but what can produce an entire and universal coincidence between private and public happiness so is it equally evident that nothing can effectually convince mankind that their own happiness universally depends on procuring or at least not violating the happiness of others save only the lively and active belief of an allseeing and allpowerful god who will hereafter make them happy or miserable according as they designedly promote or violate the happiness of their fellow creatures and this is the essence of religion  this at first view should seem a motive or principle of action sufficient for all the purposes of happiness and virtue indeed the bulk of mankind seem agreed in this truth yet refining tempers who love to quit the common tracks of opinion have been bold enough to call even this in question among these the noble writer has been one of the most diligent it will therefore be necessary to consider the weight of his objections  to prevent misinterpretation it may be proper to observe that lord shaftesbury sometimes talks in earnest of the nobleness and dignity of religion but when he explains himself it appears he confines his idea of it to that part which consists solely in gratitude to and adoration of the supreme being without any prospect of future happiness or misery now though indeed this be the noblest part yet it is beyond the reach of all save only those who are capable of the most exalted degrees of virtue his theory of religion therefore is precisely of a piece with his theory of the moral sense not calculated for use but admiration and only existing in the place where they had their birth that is as the noble writer well expresses it in a mind taken up in vision  he sometimes talks or seems to talk in earnest too on the usefulness of religion in the common acceptance of the word with regard to which it is only necessary to observe that whatever he has said on this subject i readily assent to but this is no reason why it may not be necessary to obviate every thing he has thrown out to the contrary to prejudice common readers against religion through the vanity of being thought original to invent what is just or useful is the character of genius it is folly only and impertinence to broach absurdities  first therefore he often asserts that the hope of future reward and fear of future punishment is utterly unworthy of the free spirit of a man and only fit for those who are destitute of the very first principles of common honesty he calls it miserable vile mercenary and compares those who allow it any weight to monkies under the discipline of the whip wit and humor  enquiry  etc   in answer to these general cavils probably aimed principally at revelation which are only difficult to confute as they are vague and fugitive let it be observed first that whatever can be objected against religious fear holds good against the fear of human laws they both threaten the delinquent with the infliction of punishment nor is the fear of the one more unworthy than of the other yet the noble writer himself often speaks with the highest respect of legislators of the founders of society and empire who by the establishment of wise and wholesome laws drew mankind from their state of natural barbarity to that of cultivated life and social happiness unless indeed he supposes that orpheus and the rest of them did their business literally by taste and a fiddle if therefore the just fear of human power might be enforced without insulting or violating the generosity of our nature whence comes it that a just fear of the creator should so miserably degrade the species the religious principle holds forth the same motive to action and only differs from the other as the evil it threatens is infinitely greater and more lasting  further if we consider the religious principle in its true light there is nothing in it either mean slavish or unworthy to be in a fright indeed to live under the suggestions of perpetual terror in which the noble writer would persuade us the religious principle consists is far from an amiable condition but this belongs only to the superstitious or the guilty the first of these are salsely religious and to the last i imagine the noble writers most zealous admirers will acknowledge it ought to belong but to the rest of mankind the religious principle or fear of god is of a quite different nature it only implies a lively and habitual belief that we shall be hereafter miserable if we disobey his laws thus every wise man nay every man of common understanding has a like fear of every possible evil of the destructive power of natural agents of fire water serpents poison yet none of these fears more than the religious one imply a state of perpetual misery and apprehension none of them are inconsistent with the most generous temper of mind or truest courage none of them imply more than a rational sense of these several kinds of evil and from that sense a determination to avoid them thus the noble writer himself when it answers a different purpose acknowledges that a man of courage may be cautious without real fear inquiry b ii part ii    now the word caution in its very nature implies a sense of a possibility of evil and from that sense a determination to avoid it which is the very essence of the religious principle or the fear of god  and as to the other branch of religious principle the hope and prospect of higher degrees of future happiness and perfection  what is there of mean slavish or unworthy in it are all mankind to be blown up into the mockmajesty of the kingly stoic seated on the throne of arrogance and lording it in an empty region of chimaeras is not the prospect of happiness the great universal hinge of human action do not all the powers of the soul center in this one point does not the noble writer himself elsewhere acknowledge this see above sect vi of this essay  and that our obligations to virtue itself can only arise from this one principle that it gives us real happiness why then should the hope of a happy immortality be branded as base and slavish while the consciousness or prospect of a happy life on earth is regarded as a just and honorable motive  the noble writer indeed confesses that if by the hope of reward be understood the love and desire he ought to have said the hope of virtuous enjoyment it is not derogatory to virtue but that in every other sense the indulged hope of reward is not only mean and mercenary but even hurtful to virtue and common humanity for in this religious sort of discipline the principle of selflove which is naturally so prevailing in us indeed being no way moderated or restrained but rather improved and made stronger every day by the exercise of the passions in a subject of more extended selfinterest there may be reason to apprehend lest the temper of this kind should extend itself in general through all the parts of life  this to say the best of it is the very phrenzy of virtue religion proposes true happiness as the end and consequence of virtuous action this is granted it proposes it by such motives as must influence selflove and consequently has given the best means of procuring it yet it seems selflove being not restrained but made stronger will make man kind miss of true happiness that is by leading selflove into the path of true happiness religion will inevitably conduct it to false by commanding us to cherish our public affections it will certainly inflame the private ones by assuring us that if we would be happy hereafter we must be virtuous and benevolent it will beyond question render us vile and void of benevolence but this mode of reasoning is common with the noble writer  however at other times his lordship can descend to the level of common sense and prosecute his argument by proofs diametrically opposite to what he here advances for in proving the obligations of man to virtue after having modelled the inward state of the human mind according to his own imagination he proceeds to consider the passions which regard ourselves and draws another and indeed a stronger proof from these  he there proves inquiry b ii part ii   the folly of a vicious love of life because life itself may often prove a misfortune so of cowardice because it often robs us of the means of safety  excessive resentment because the gratification is no more than an alleviation of a racking pain  the vice of luxury creates a nauseating and distaste diseases and constant craving he urges the same objections against intemperate pleasure of the amourous kind he observes that ambition is ever suspicious jealous captious and incapable of bearing the least disappointment he then proceeds through a variety of other passions proving them all to be the sources of some internal or external misery thus he awakens the same passions of hope and fear which in a religious view he so bitterly inveighs against thus he exhibits a picture of future rewards and punishments even of the most selfish kind he recommends the conformity to virtue on the score both of present and future advantage he deters his reader from the commission of vice by representing the misery it will produce and these too such advantages and such miseries as are entirely distinct from the mere feeling of virtuous affection or its contrary from the considerations of safety alleviation of bodily pain the avoidance of distaste and diseases now does not his own cavil here recoil upon him that in this sort of discipline and by exhibiting such motives as these the principle of selflove must be made stronger by the exercise of the passions in a subject of more extended selfinterest and so there may be reason to apprehend lest the temper of this kind should extend itself in general through all the parts of life thus the objection proves equally against both in reality against neither for as we have seen the sense or prospect of happiness is the only possible motive to action and if we are taught to believe that virtuous affection will produce happiness whether the expected happiness lies in this life or another it will tend and equally tend to produce virtuous affection the noble writer therefore and his admirers might as well attempt to remove mountains as to prove that the hope and prospect of a happy immortality can justly be accounted more servile mercenary or hurtful than the view of those transient and earthly advantages which his lordship has so rhetorically and honestly displayed for the interest and security of virtue in truth they are precisely of the same nature and only differ in time duration and degree they are both established by our creator for the same great end of happiness and what god has thus connected it were absurd as well as impious to attempt to separate hence we may see the weakness and mistake of those fulsely religious who fall into an extreme directly opposite to this of the noble writer who are scandalized at our being determined to the pursuit of virtue through any degree of regard to its happy consequences in this life which regard they call worldly carnal profane for it is evident that the religious motive is precisely of the same kind only stronger as the happiness expected is greater and more lasting while therefore we set the proper and proportioned value upon each it is impossible we can act irrationally or offend that god who established both  this naturally leads to a further observation which shows the danger as well as folly of grovelling in systems virtue we see comes recommended and enforced on three principles it is attended with natural and immediate pleasure or advantage  it is commanded by human laws  it is enjoined by religion  yet the religionists have often decryd the first of these sanctions the fanatical moralists the last and even the second has not escaped the madness of an enthusiastic party which however never grew considerable enough in this kingdom to merit consutation     there is yet another circumstance observable in human nature which still further proves that the hope of a happy immortality has no tendency to produce selfish affection but its contrary for let the stoical tribe draw what pictures they please of the human species this is an undoubted truth that hope is the most universal source of human happiness and that man is never so sincerely and heartily benevolent as when he is truly happy in himself thus the high consciousness of his being numbered among the children of god and that his lot is among the saints that he is destined to an endless progression of happiness and to rise from high to higher degrees of perfection must needs inspire him with that tranquillity and joy which will naturally diffuse itself in acts of sincere benevolence to all his fellow creatures whom he looks upon as his companions in this race of glory thus will every noble passion of the soul be awakened into action while the joyless infidel possessed with the gloomy dread of annihilation too naturally contracts his affections as his hopes of happiness decrease while he considers and despises himself as no more than the beasts that perish  the noble writer indeed insinuates that there is a certain narrowness of spirit occasioned by this regard to a future life peculiarly observable in the devout persons and zealots of almost every religious persuasion enquiry b i part iii    in reply to which it is only necessary to affirm what may be affirmed with truth that with regard to devout persons the insinuation is a falsehood it was prudently done indeed to join the zealots or bigots in the same sentence because it is true that these being under the dominion of superstition forget the true nature and end of religion and are therefore scrupulously exact in the observation of outward ceremonies while they neglect the superior and essential matters of the law of justice benevolence and mercy  and as to the notion of confining the hope of future reward to that of virtuous enjoyment only this is a refinement parallel to the rest of the noble writers system and like all refinements contracts instead of enlarging our views it is allowed indeed that the pleasures of virtue are the highest we know of in our present state and it is therefore commonly supposed they may constitute our chief felicity in another but does it hence follow that no other sources of happiness may be dispensed which as yet are utterly unknown to us can our narrow and partial imaginations set bounds to the omnipotence of god and may not our creator vouchsafe us such springs of yet untasted bliss as shall exceed even the known joys of virtue as far as these exceed the gratifications of sense nay if we consider what is generally believed that our happiness will arise from an addition of new and higher faculties that in the present life the exercise of virtue itself arises often from the imperfection of our state if we consider these things it should seem highly probable that our future happiness will consist in something quite beyond our present comprehension will be such as eye has not seen nor ear heard neither has it entered into the heart of man to conceive  section x but beyond these objections the noble writer has more than once touched upon another which merits a particular consideration for he affirms that after all it is not merely what we call principle but a taste which governs men that even conscience such as is owing to religious discipline will make but a slight figure where this taste is set amiss misc iii c     the notion here advanced is not peculiar to himself he seems to have drawn it from a much more considerable writer who has endeavored to support the same proposition by a great variety of examples bail pens sur une comete  several authors of inferior rank have borrowed the same topic for popular declamation nay one has gone so far as to assert that man is so unaccountable a creature as to act most commonly against his principle fable of the bees   the objection indeed carries an appearance of force yet on a near examination it entirely vanishes  it must be owned that in most countries a considerable part of what is called religion deserves no other name than that of absurdity made sacred and it were strange indeed should bigotry and false religion produce that uprightness of heart that perfection of morals which is the genuine effect of truth  it must be owned that with regard to religious principle as well as moral practice every man has the power of being a hypocrite that knaves in order to be accounted honest may appear devout and we may reasonably suppose if we consider the innumerable artifices of villainy that the outward profession of religion becomes a frequent disguise to an atheistical and corrupted heart  but though these circumstances may sufficiently account for the appearance in many particular cases yet with regard to the general fact here seems to lie the proper solution of the difficulty that even where true religion is known professed and in speculation assented to it is seldom so thoroughly inculcated as to become a principle of action we have seen that imagination is the universal instrument of human action that no passion can be strongly excited in the soul by mere knowledge or assent till the imagination has formed to itself some kind of picture or representation of the good or evil apprehended see above essay i    now the senses and their attendant passions are continually urging their demands through the immediate presence of their respective objects so that nothing but the vivid image of some greater good or evil in futurity can possibly resist and overbalance their solicitations the idea therefore of future happiness and misery must be strongly impressed on the imagination ere they can work their full effects because they are distant and unseen but this habit of reflection is seldom properly fixed by education and thus for want of a proper impression religious principle is seldom gained and therefore seldom operates  but where a sincere and lively impression takes place where the mind is convinced of the being of a god that he is and is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him where the imagination has gained a habit of connecting this great truth with every thought word and action there it may be justly affirmed that piety and virtue cannot but prevail to say in a case of this nature that man will not act according to his principle is to contradict the full evidence of known facts we see how true mankind commonly are to their principle of pride or mistaken honor how true to their principle of avarice or mistaken interest how true to their principle of a regard to human laws why are they so because they have strongly and habitually connected these principles in their imagination with the idea of their own happiness therefore whenever the religious principle becomes in the same manner habitually connected in the imagination with the agents happiness that is whenever the religious principle takes place at all it must needs become infinitely more powerful than any other because the good it promises and the evil it threatens are infinitely greater and more lasting hence it appears that the corruption of mankind even where the purest religion is professed and in theory assented to does not arise from the weakness of religious principle but the want of it  and indeed on other occasions and to serve different purposes the noble writer and his partisans can allow and give examples of all that is here contended for nothing is so common among these gentlemen as to declaim against the terrible effects of priestly power it is their favorite topic to represent mankind as groaning under the tyranny of the sacred order now what does this representation imply but the force of religious principle improperly directed if mankind can be swayed by religious hope and fear to resign their passions and interests to the artifice or advantage of the priest why not to the benefit of mankind it is only impressing a different idea of duty the motive to action is in both cases the same and consequently must be of equal efficacy thus if religious principle were void of force the priesthood must be void of power the influence therefore of the priesthood however dishonestly applied is a demonstration of the force of religious principle  this therefore seems to be the truth although by timely and continued culture the religious principle might be made more universally predominant yet even as it is though not so thoroughly inculcated as to become generally a consistent principle of action in fact it has a frequent and considerable though partial and imperfect influence none but the thoroughly good and bad act on continued or consistent principles all the intermediate degrees of good and bad act at different times on various and inconsistent principles that is their imaginations are by turns given up to impressions of a different or even contrary nature this explains the whole mystery for hence it appears that the consistent or inconsistent conduct of men depends not on the nature of their principles but on having their principles whatever they are counteracted by opposite ones although therefore through a failure of timely discipline numbers of men appear to be of that capricious temper as not to be steady to any principle yet still the religious one will mix with the rest and naturally prevail in its turn this is certainly a common circumstance among the looser and more inconsiderate ranks of men who although by no means uniformly swayed by the precepts of religion are yet frequently struck with horror at the thought of actions peculiarly vile and deterred by the apprehension of an allseeing god from the commission of crimes uncommonly atrocious  here then lies the essential difference between the efficacy of taste and religious principle that the first being a feeling or perception dispensed in various degrees and in very weak ones to the bulk of mankind is incapable even through the most assiduous culture of becoming an universal or consistent motive to virtue but the religious principle arising from such passions as are common to the whole species must if properly inculcated universally prevail  it is evident therefore that in the very first dawns of reason religious principles ought to be impressed on the minds of children and this early culture continued through the succeeding stages of life but as the noble writer has strangely attempted to ridicule and dishonor religion in every shape so here he has endeavored to throw an odium on this method of religious discipline by representing it as the enemy to true morals and practical philosophy as it fetters the mind with early prejudices whatever manner in philosophy happens to bear the least resemblance to that of catechism cannot i am persuaded of itself seem very inviting such a smart way of questioning ourselves in our youth has made our manhood more averse to the expostulatory discipline and though the metaphysical points of our belief are by this method with admirable care and caution instilled into tender minds yet the manner of this anticipating philosophy may make the afterwork of reason and the inward exercise of the mind at a riper age proceed the more heavily and with greater reluctance  it is hard after having by so many pertinent interrogatories and decisive sentences declared who and what we are to come leisurely in another to enquire concerning our real self and end the judgment we are to make of interest and the opinion we should have of advantage and good which is what must necessarily determine us in our conduct and prove the leading principle of our lives advice etc part iii     in reply to this most philosophical paragraph let it be observed that it is not the design of religion to make sophists but good subjects of mankind that man being designed not for speculation but action religious principle is not to be instilled in a philosophical but a moral view therefore with regard to practice nothing can be more fit and rational than to impress acknowledged truths at an age when the recipient is incapable of their demonstrations in the same manner as we teach the mechanic to work on geometric principles while the proofs are unknown to him  but then the prejudices of education  yes these are the great stumbling block to a modern freethinker it still runs in his head that all mankind are born to dispute de omni scibili on all subjects  let therefore this minute philosopher reflect first that a prejudice does not imply as is generally supposed the falsehood of the opinion instilled but only that it is taken up and held without its proper evidence thus a child may be prejudiced in favor of truth as well as falsehood and in him neither the one nor the other can properly be called more than an opinion further the human mind cannot remain in a state of indifference with regard either to opinion or practice it is of an active nature and like a fertile field if by due cultivation it be not made to produce good fruit will certainly spring up in tares and thislles impressions opinions prejudices of one kind or other a child will inevitably contract from the things and persons that surround him and if rational habits and opinions be not infused in order to anticipate absurdities absurdities will rise and anticipate all rational habits and opinions his reason and his passions will put themselves in action however untoward and inconsistent in the same manner as his limbs will make an effort toward progressive motion however awkward and absurd the same objection therefore that lies against instilling a salutary opinion will arise against teaching him to walk erect for this too is a kind of  anticipating philosophy and sure a child left to his own selfdiscipline till he could come leisurely to enquire concerning his real self and end would stand as fair a chance to grovel in absurdity and bring down his reason to the sordid level of appetite as to crawl upon all four and dabble in the dirt thus the noble writers ridicule would sweep away the whole system of education along with the religious principle not an opinion or inclination must be controuled or so much as controverted lest by this anticipating philosophy the work of reason and the inward exercise of the mind at a riper age should proceed the more heavily and with greater reluctance the caprice of insancy must rule us till the very capacity of improvement should be destroyed and we must turn savages in order to be made perfect in the sovereign philosophy  it is no difficult matter therefore to determine whether a child should be left to the follies of his own weak understanding and nascent passions be left to imbibe the maxims of corrupt times and manners maxims which setting aside all regard to their speculative truth or falsehood do lead to certain misery or on the other hand shall be happily conducted to embrace those religious principles which have had the approbation of the best and wisest men in every age and nation and which are known and allowed to be the only means of true happiness to individuals families and states  this therefore ought to be the early and principal care of those who have the tuition of youth and they will soon find the happy effects of their instruction for as the childs understanding shall improve what was at first instilled only as an opinion will by degrees be embraced as truth reason will then assume her just empire and the great universal religious principle a rational obedience to the will of god will raise him to his utmost capacity of moral perfection will be a wide and firm foundation on which the whole fabric of virtue may rise in its just proportions will extend and govern his benevolence and moral sense will strengthen them if weak will confirm them if strong will supply their want if naturally defective in fine will direct all his passions to their proper objects and degrees and as the great masterspring of action at once promote and regulate every movement of his heart  it must be owned the noble writers caution against this anticipating philosophy has of late been deeply imbibed in consequence of it we have seen religious principle declaimed against ridiculed lamented the effect of this has been an abandoned degree of villainy in one class of mankind a lethargic indifference toward virtue or vice in another and in the third which boast the height of modern virtue we seldom see more than the first natural efforts the mere buddings of benevolence and honor which are too generally blasted ere they can ripen into action this contempt of religion has always been a fatal omen to free states nor if we may credit experience can we entertain any just hope that this fantastic scheme this boasted relish for beauty and virtue can ever give security to empire without the more solid supports of religious belief for it is remarkable that in the decline of both the greek and roman states after religion had lost its credit and efficacy this very taste this sovereign philophy usurped its place and became the common study and amusement as it is now among ourselves both of the vile and vulgar the fact with regard to greece is sufficiently notorious with regard to rome it may seem to demand a proof and who would think that quintilian in the following passage was not describing our own age and nation nunc autem quae velut propria philosophiae asseruntur passim tractamus omnes quis enim modo de justo aequo ac bono non et vir pessimus loquitur quint proaemium   what was formerly the philosophers province only is now invaded by all we find every wicked and worthless fellow in these days haranguing on virtue beauty and good what this leprosy of false knowledge may end in i am unwilling to say but this may be said with truth because it is justified by experience that along with the circumstance now remarked every other symptom is rising among us that has generally attended the dark and troubled evening of a commonwealth  doubtless many will treat these apprehensions with derision but this derision is far from being an evidence of their falsehood for no people ever fell a sacrifice to themselves till lulled and infatuated by their own passions blind security is an essential characteristic of a people devoted to destruction the fact is equally undeniable whether it arises from the moral appointment of providence or the connection of natural causes though this is seen and acknowledged by those who are conversant with the history of mankind yet it is hard to convey this evidence to those who seldom extend their views beyond their own short period of existence because they see the prevalence of the cause assigned while yet the pretended consequence appears not but they who look back into ancient time are convinced that the public effects of irreligion have never been sudden or immediate one age is falsely polite irreligious and vile the next is sunk in servitude and wretchedness this is analogous to the operation of other causes a man may be intemperate for twenty years before he feels the effects of intemperance on his constitution the sun and moon raise the tides yet the tides rise not to their height till a considerable time after the conjunction of these two luminaries we cannot therefore justly decide concerning the future effects of irreligion from its present state the examples of former times are a much better criterion and these are such as ought to make every man among us that regards posterity tremble for his posterity while he reads them  for this is but too just an epitome of the story of mankind that tyranny and superstition have ever gone hand in hand mutually supporting and supported taking their progress and fixing their dominion over all the kingdoms of the earth overwhelming it in one general deluge as the waters cover the sea here and there a happy nation emerges breathes for a while in the enlightened region of knowledge religion virtue freedom till in their appointed time irreligion and licentiousness appear mine the foundations of the fabric and sink it in the general abyss of ignorance and oppression  possibly the fatal blow may yet be averted from us it is surely the duty of every man in every station to contribute his share however inconsiderable to this great end this must be my apology for opposing the noble writers fantastic system which by exhibiting a false picture of human nature is in reality an inlet to vice while it seems most favorable to virtue and while it pretends to be drawn from the depths of philosophy is of all others most unphilosophical  essays on the characteristics etc essay iii on revealed religion and christianity section i in the course of the preceding essay we have seen the noble writer assuming the character of the professed dogmatist the reasoner in form in what remains to be considered concerning revealed religion and christianity we shall find him chiefly affecting the miscellaneous capacity the way of chat raillery innuendo or storytelling in a word that very species of the present modish composition which he so contemptuously ridicules where as he tells us justness and accuracy of thought are set aside as too constraining where grounds and foundations are of no moment and which has properly neither top nor bottom beginning nor end see above essay i    in this however his lordship is not quite so much to blame as might be imagined in his critical progress he had treated this dishabille of composition as the man in the fable did his pears unconscious he should be ever afterward reduced to diet on them himself the truth of the matter is that the broken hints the ambiguous expression and the ludicroserious of the gentle essayist perfectly secure him from the rough handling of the logicaldisputer  indeed the noble author has a double advantage from this cloud in which the graces so frequently secure their favorite he not only eludes the force of every argument the defenders of christianity allege in it is support but even pleads the privilege of being ranked in the number of sincere christians he takes frequent occasions of expressing his abhorrence of idle scepticks and wicked unbelievers in religion he declares himself of a more resigned understanding a ductile faith ready to be molded into any shape that his spiritual superiors shall prescribe at other times and in innumerable places he scatters such insinuations against christianity and that too with all the bitterness of sarcasm and invective as must needs be more effectual in promoting irreligion than a formal and avowed accusation for in the way of open war there is fair warning given to put reason upon guard that no pretending argument be suffered to pass without examination on the contrary the noble writers concealed method of raillery steals insensibly on his reader fills him with endless prejudice and suspicion and without passing through the judgment sixeth such impressions on the imagination as reason with all its effects will be hardly able afterward to efface  these inconsistent circumstances in his lordships conduct have made it a question among some what his real sentiments were concerning religion and christianity if it be necessary to decide this question we may observe that a disguised unbeliever may have his reasons for making a formal declaration of his assent to the religion of his country but it will be hard to find what should tempt a real christian to load christianity with scorn and infamy indeed the noble writer to do him justice never designed to leave us at a loss on this subject for he has been so good frequently to remind his reader to look out for the true drift of his irony lest his real meaning should be mistaken or disregarded  here then lies the force of his lordships attack on christianity in exciting contempt by ridicule a method which as we have already seen essay i passim  though devoid of all rational foundation is yet most powerful and efficacious in working upon vulgar minds thus the way of irony and false encomium which he so often employs against the blessed founder of our religion serves him for all weapons the deeper he strikes the wound the better he shields himself  we are not therefore to be surprised if we find the noble writer frequently affecting a mixture of solemn phrase and low buffoonry not only in the same tract but in the same paragraph in this respect he resembles the facetious drole i have somewhere heard of who wore a transparent masque which at a distance exhibited a countenance wrapped up in profound solemnity but those who came nearer and could see to the bottom found the native look distorted into all the ridiculous grimace which spleen and vanity could imprint  section ii but as natural religion is the only foundation of revealed it will be necessary ever we proceed to the last to obviate any insinuations which the noble writer may have thrown out against the former  as to the expectation of future happiness considered as the natural consequence of virtuous action his lordship has not that i know of either assirmed or insinuated any thing against it is reasonableness but with regard to the other branch of religion the belief of a future state of misery or punishment considered as the appointed consequence of vice this he has frequently endeavored to discredit in such a manner as would be no small degree of guilt to transcribe were it not to show at once the impiety and falsehood of his affirmations  in his letter on enthusiasm he has obliged us with several passages of this kind these it must be owned are so obscure that we must be content to refer them rather to the readers equitable construction than urge them as direct proofs  the apprehension and fear of something supernatural so universal among mankind he seems all along to deride as a visionary and groundless pannic let on enthus passim  he adds that while some sects such as the pythagorean and latter platonic joined in with the superstition and ethusiasm of the times the epicurean the academic and others were allowed to use all the force of wit and raillery against it ib  to convince us how much he approves the conduct of these libertine sects he boldly follows their example he assures us that such is the nature of the liberal polished and refined part of mankind so far are they from the mere simplicity of babes and sucklings that instead of applying the notion of a future reward or punishment to their immediate behavior in society they are apt much rather through the whole course of their lives to show evidently that they look on the pious narrations to be indeed no better than childrens tales and the amusement of the mere vulgar misc iii c    he confirms these opinions by assigning the reason why men of sense should stand clear of the fears of a futurity god is so good as to exceed the very best of us in goodness and after this manner we can have no dread or suspicion to render us uneasy for it is malice only and not goodness which can make us afraid let on enthus   is this the philosopher and patriot the lover of his country and mankind this the admirer of ancient wisdom of venerable sages who founded laws constitutions civil and religious rites whatever civilizes or polishes mankind moralists p i    tu pater et rerum inventor tu patria nobis suppeditas praecepta this sure is unhinging society to the utmost of his power for the force of religious sanctions depends as much on their being believed as the force of human laws depends on their being executed to destroy the belief of the one therefore is equivalent to suspending the other  but as the present debate concerns not the utility but the truth of religion it is chiefly incumbent on us to show that the noble writers opinion and reasoning on this subject are void of all foundation  it is observable therefore first that his lordship in other places allows that if there be naturally such a passion as enthusiasm it is evident that religion itself is of the kind and must be therefore natural to man misc ii c    and in his letter on enthusiasm even while he derides the proneness of mankind to the conscientious fear he adds that though epicurus thought these apprehensions were vain yet he was forced to allow them in a manner innate  from which concession a divine methinks might raise a goood argument against him for the truth as well as usefulness of religion now as some may possibly be at a loss to determine here whether the noble writer be in jest or earnest the argument he hints at is plainly this that if we look round the works of nature we shall find an analogy established which seems a proof that this natural fear which presses so universally on the human mind has a real and proportioned object the argument has been urged by many of great name in favor of the hope of future good and it is surely of equal force whatever that force may be when applied to the fear of future ill for we see through the whole creation every animal of whatever species directed by it is nature or the hand of providence to fear and shun it is proper and appointed enemy we find these apprehensions universally suited to the nature and preservation of every species among birds beasts fishes insects nor is there one fear though sometimes excessive in it is degree that is erroneous with regard to it is object the religious fear therefore which forces itself so universally on the human mind in every age and nation ignorant or knowing civilized or barbarous has probably an object suited to it is nature ordained for the welfare of the human species at least this argument must ever be of weight with those who draw their ideas of future existence from the instincts hopes and expectations of the human mind  indeed on the noble writers refined scheme of morals in which the natural affections of the mind are represented as allsufficient for the purposes of human happiness this argument must lose it is force because on this supposition the religious fear is supernumerary and useless but then this shows the supposition itself to be monstrous absurd and contrary to the established course of nature because nature gives no power or passion but to some proper and appointed end the very existence of the passion therefore is a proof of it is necessity  now if indeed the religious fear be necessary as we presume has been sufficiently proved in the preceding essay then from hence will arise a strong and convincing proof that the object of religious fear is real for we find through the whole extent of created being that the author of nature has annexed to all his designs and purposes the proper means or objects by which they may be fulfilled as therefore the religious fear is not only interwoven with the frame of man but absolutely necessary to his happiness it is object must be real because if not you suppose the creator to have given a necessary passion without it is proper and appointed object which would be a contradiction to the universal and known constitution of things  on this occasion we may observe the weakness of the epicurean system concerning providence for that sect has ever denied that the deity concerns himself with the moral conduct of man but from the wise and benevolent constitution of the natural world itself a strong proof arises in support of gods moral government of it and of the truth of the fears and expectations of the human mind for if we allow that he regards and preserves the natural order and symmetry of the creation that he has formed this immense system of being and secured it is continuance and welfare by certain laws necessary to the happiness of his creatures then we must on the same foundation conclude that he has likewise established such motives and laws of action as may determine man to prosecute the same end it were an imputation on the wisdom of the deity to conceive him as doing the one and omitting the other unless mind and morals be less worthy of his regard than matter and motion  but still the noble writer proceeds in the spirit of derision to expose the absurdities and mischiefs this misguided religious principle has occasioned he often expatiates on the superstitious horrors and surious zeal which have had their source in this principle and thence in the way of insinuation concludes it irrational and groundless  the facts it must be owned are notorious and undeniable but the consequence is no less evidently chimerical and vain lord shaftesbury himself has observed that in failure of a just prince or magistrate mankind are ready to submit themselves even to a tyrant like newborn creatures who have never seen their dam they will fancy one for themselves and apply as by nature prompted to some like form for favor and protection in the room of a true fosterfather and chief they will take after a false one and in the room of a legal government and just prince obey even a tyrant wit and h p iii    and hence he draws a strong proof of the force of the social or herding principle even from despotic power itself again he has remarked that  heroism and philanthropy are almost one and the same yet by a small misguidance of the affection a lover of mankind becomes a ravager a hero and deliverer becomes an oppressor and destroyer ib   it is the same in religion where the human mind ever restless in it is search for the great center of created being on which alone it can perfectly repose itself seeks but cannot find the true god it naturally sets up a false one in his place here too mankind like newborn creatures who have never seen their dam will fancy one for themselves and apply as by nature prompted to some like form for favor and protection in the room of a true fosterfather they will take after a false one and in the room of an allperfect god worship even an idol the religious principle thus misguided breaks forth indeed into enormities the most pernicious and destructive hence indeed by a small misguidance of the affection a lover of mankind becomes a ravager a saint an oppressor and destroyer but as from the abuse of the social principle so here in that of the religious one no other consequence can be justly drawn but that it is natural and strong  but further the noble writer finds the notion of future punishment inconsistent with his idea of divine goodness therefore says he we can have no dread or suspicion to make us uneasy for it is malice only and not goodness which can make us afraid enq b ii part ii     yet on another occasion his lordship can affirm and justly that a man of temper may resist or punish without anger and if so why may not divine goodness make us afraid for as divine goodness regards the greatest happiness of all it is creatures so if punishment be necessary to that end divine goodness will therefore ordain punishment to this purpose a writer of distinguished rank and penetration in reality goodness is the natural and just object of fear to an ill man malice may be appeased or satiated humor may change but goodness is as a fixed steady immovable principle of action if either of the former holds the sword of justice there is plainly ground for the greatest of crimes to hope for impunity but if it be goodness there can be no possible hope whilst the reasons of things or the ends of government call for punishment thus every one sees how much greater chance of impunity an ill man has in a partial administration than in a just and upright one it is said that the interest or good of the whole must be the interest of the universal being and that he can have no other be it so this author ld s has proved that vice is naturally the misery of mankind in this world consequently it was for the good of the whole that it should be so what shadow of reason then is there to assert that this may not be the case hereafter danger of future punishment and if there be danger there is ground of fear no more supposes malice than the present feeling of punishment does dr butlers sermons preface p      thus the noble writers derision and argumentation are equally chimerical and impious as it appears that the natural fears and expectations of the human mind are at least founded in probability  section iii his lordships opinions being so little favorable to natural religion we cannot wonder if we find him on every possible occasion throwing out insinuations and virulent remarks in order to disgrace revealed the first that will deserve our notice are such as tend to invalidate the credibility of scripture history  he tells us he who says he believes for certain or is assured of what he believes either speaks ridiculously or says in effect he believes strongly but is not sure so that whoever is not conscious of revelation nor has certain knowledge of any miracle or sign can be no more than sceptick in the case and the best christian in the world who being destitute of the means of certainty depends only on history and tradition for his belief of these particulars is at best but a sceptick christian misc ii c     now it should seem that the dexterity of this passage lies in a new application of two or three words for by  certain and assured he means more by  skepticism he means much less than it is ever used to signify and thus as in dr mandevilles philosophy already see above essay ii criticized wherever we have not demonstration it is plain we must needs be skeptics  but if indeed we must be skeptics in revealed religion on this account the same consequence will follow with regard to every other kind of knowledge that depends on human testimony we must be skeptics too in our belief of every past transaction nay of every thing transacted in our own times except only of what falls within the narrow circle of our proper observation the manners of men the site of countries the varieties of nature the truths of philosophy the very food we eat and liquids we drink are all received on the sole evidence of human testimony but what name would he merit among men who in these instances should say he does not believe for certain or is not assured of what he believes till in every case he should be impelled by the force of demonstration or the evidence of sense  and indeed on other occasions where christianity is not concerned the noble writer can speak in a very different and much juster manner for thus he appeals to nature in proof of the wisdom and goodness of the creator thus too in the system of the bigger world see there the mutual dependency of things the relation of one to another of the sun to this inhabited earth and of the earth and other planets to the sun the order union and coherence of the whole and know my ingenious friend that by this survey you will be obliged to own the universal system and coherent scheme of things to be established on abundant proof capable of convincing any fair and just contemplator of the works of nature moralists p ii    his lordships argument is surely just yet is there one to be found among five hundred of those who are thus convinced of the wise structure of the universe who have ever taken a survey of this immense system except only in the books and diagrams of experienced philosophers how few are capable even of comprehending the demonstrations on which the truth of the copernican system is established or receiving on any other proof than that of human testimony the relation of the earth and other planets to the sun the order union and coherence of the whole it cannot be supposed that even the noble writer himself ever went through the tedious process of experiment and calculation which alone can give absolute certainty in this extensive subject yet we find he is not in any degree skeptical in the case but very rationally determines that the wisdom of the deity in this universal system is established on abundant proof capable of convincing any fair and just contemplator of the works of nature  it appears then that a confidence in the veracity of others is not peculiar to the belief of revealed religion the same takes place in almost every subject more particularly we see that in the history of nature as in that of revelation the evidence of human testimony is the only sort of proof that can be given to mankind and whoever allows this proof as being  abundant and convincing in the one and disallows or despises it in the other how self satisfied soever he may be in his own imagination is neither a fair nor a just contemplator of the works and the ways of providence  if therefore any objection lies against the credibility of the scripture history it must consist in maintaining not that human testimony is insufficient to support it but that in fact it is not sufficiently supported by the evidence of human testimony if so this defect must arise either from a want of external evidence or secondly because the facts doctrines and composition of the bible are such that no testimony whatever can convince us that it is a divine revelation  with regard to the first of these the testimony on which the authenticity of the gospel history is founded this the noble writer has attacked by a long chain of insinuations in his last miscellany misc v c    where in the way of dialogue he has indeed amply repaid the treatment which in the preceding chapter he charges upon the clergy for here he has introduced two of that order who to use his own expression are indeed his very legitimate and obsequious puppets who cooperate in the most officious manner with the author toward the display of his own proper wit and the establishment of his private opinion and maxims ib c    where after the poor phantom or shadow of an adversary has said as little for his cause as can be imagined and given as many opens and advantages as could be desired he lies down for good and all and passively submits to the killing strokes of his unmerciful conqueror ib   to these gentlemen the noble writer assigns the herculean labor of proving the necessity of an absolute uniformity in opinion a hopeful project indeed as his lordship calls it elsewhere no wonder he comes off conqueror in such a debate but here lies the peculiarity of his conduct that while he pretends only to prove that the scripture cannot be a foundation for uniformity of opinion in all things he has thrown out such insinuations as evidently imply that there can be no foundation for believing the truth of any thing the gospel history contains he says he began by desiring them to explain the word scripture and by enquiring into the original of this collection of antienter and later tracts which in general they comprehended under that title whether it were the apocryphal scripture or the more canonical the full or halfauthorized the doubtful or the certain the controverted or uncontroverted the singly read or that of various reading the texts of these manuscripts or of those the transcripts copies titles catalogues of this church and nation or of that other of this sect and party or of another of those in one age called orthodox and in possession of power or of those who in another overthrew their predecessors authority and in their turn also assumed the guardianship and power of holy things for how these sacred records were guarded in those ages might easily he said be imagined by any one who had the least insight into the history of those times which we called primitive and those characters of men whom we styled fathers of the church misc v c     here as his lordship drags us into the beaten track of controversy the best compliment that can be paid the reader is to carry him through it by the shortest way the stale objections here raked together by the noble author have been so often and so fully refuted by a variety of excellent writers that to many it may seem a needless task even to touch upon the subject du pin le clerc tillemont whitby lardner phil lipsiensis etc and very lately mr jortin in his learned remarks on ecclesiastical history   however for the satisfaction of those who may think it necessary a summary view of the evidence is here subjoined  the authenticity therefore of the books of the new testament appears to be founded on the strongest moral evidence because from the earliest ages we find them ascribed to the apostles and evangelists whose names they bear thus st pauls epistles are mentioned by st peter and cited by clemens romanus who lived in the reign of claudius even before st paul was carried prisoner to rome polycarp and irenaeus were for some time contemporary with st john they both cite the four gospels and affirm they were all wrote by the apostles and evangelists whose names they bear justin martyr and clemens alexandrinus confirm their accounts in the following century and the great origin with whom i shall close the catalogue and who lived in the reign of severus in his book against celsus has cited all the gospels and most if not all the epistles under the names they now bear and the words of the several citations perfectly agree with those of the new testament now in use such a full proof of the genuineness of these sacred records as is not to be paralleled concerning any other book of equal or even of much less antiquity  the internal proof of their genuineness arising from their style and composition is no less eminent and particular the genius of every book is so perfectly agreeable to the character and education of it is respective author every custom described or alluded to either jewish greek or roman so entirely suited to the times every incident so natural so occasional so particular so perfectly identifyd that it were the very extreme of ignorance and folly to raise a doubt on this subject  that the gospelhistory has been transmitted to us pure and uncorrupted we have no less reason to believe it is well known how zealous the primitive christians were in the preservation of the scriptures we know they regarded them as their chief and dearest treasure and often laid down their lives rather than deliver the sacred records to their enemies who used every art of terror to seize and destroy them again the scriptures were not then locked up from the laity as now in the roman church but copies were taken dispersed and became immensely numerous they were universally read at the times of public worship in different nations of the world to this we may add that as now so then different sects and parties subsisted who all appealed to scripture for proof of their several opinions and these it is evident must have been so many checks upon each other to the general exclusion of mistake and fraud the jews and samaritans were checks upon each other in the same manner for the preservation of the purity of the pentatouch the samaritan pentatouch was printed in the last century and after two thousand years discord between the two nations varies as little from the other as any classic author in less tract of time has disagreed from itself by the unavoidable mistakes of so many transcribers see phil lipsiens     this being the real state of the case let us now consider the noble writers questions he asks whether by scripture be understood the apocryphal or more canonical the full or halfauthorized the doubtful or the certain the controverted or uncontroverted these questions are nearly synonymous and one short reply will clear them all there are many books concerning which there never was any doubt there are some concerning which the doubts have been fully cleared up there are others concerning which the doubts have been confirmed of the first kind are all the gospels and most of the epistles of the second are the epistle to the hebrews the second of peter second and third of john that of jude and the apocalypse of the third kind are the apocryphal books therefore indeed so called  the noble author goes on the single read or that of various reading my lord if by single read you mean a book in which there are no various readings there are none single read nor probably was there ever any book single read that went through more than one edition at least before the invention of printing and as the scriptures were oftener transcribed than any other book so a greater variety of of readings must naturally take place but i must inform your lordship from the learned phileleutherus lipsiensis that this is the most illiterate of all cavils for that in fact we have the sense of those ancient authors most entire where the various readings are most numerous as of those authors where the varieties are fewest the sense is most mutilated or obscure for a full view of this argument see phil lipsiens  but if by single read your lordship means an authentic text collected and composed out of the various readings i beg leave to inform you there is no such in the protestant churches they have been too modest to attempt any such thing nor does the truth suffer by it for as the learned critic just before quoted observes the most faulty copy of the new testament now in being does not obscure one moral doctrine or one article of faith  again the noble writer goes on in a profusion of synonymous terms the transcripts copies titles catalogues of this church or that of this sect or party or another of those in one age called orthodox or those who in another age overthrew them what unexperienced person would not imagine from hence that different churches sects or parties had each of them a bible different from the rest yet it is certain that however these parties differed in opinions we find from their writings now subsisting that they all appealed to one common scripture for their support  the noble writer takes his leave by paying a compliment to these primitive writers called the fathers of the church how these sacred records were guarded in those ages might be easily imagined etc  but to imagine is a much easier task than to prove especially when imagination is helped forward by inclination guarded indeed they were as we have seen from interpolation and falsehood but if he means to insinuate that they were guarded from inspection and criticism he does great injustice to christianity for whatever marks of secular views may be discovered in the conduct of the ancient christians in the succeeding ages we may safely bid defiance to the noble writers admirers to show any thing of this kind in the characters of those to whose testimony we have here appealed and on whose testimony joined to that of their numerous and ingenuous contemporaries the authenticity of the gospelhistory depends they were far from acting or writing with a view to temporal advantage they were struggling under the weight of heavy persecutions had no motives to preach or write but the great expectation of happiness hereafter founded on a firm belief of that holy religion which they propagated with an effect almost if not indeed miraculous  on this occasion i cannot but observe a strange insinuation thrown out elsewhere by the noble writer which however is so glaring a falsehood that he finds himself obliged to disavow it even while he labors to impress it on his readers imagination in all the colors of eloquence if says he the collateral testimony of other ancient records were destroyed there would be less argument or plea remaining against that natural suspicion of those who are called skeptical that the holy records themselves were no other than the pure invention or artificial compilement of an interested party in behalf of the richest corporation and most profitable monopoly in the world misc v c    now if his lordship be indeed in earnest in urging this insinuation he must believe that one set of men preached and wrote and endured bonds and imprisonment torments and death to the end that another set of men some three or four hundred years after might enjoy the rich corporations and profitable monopoly of church preferments how far this may be a proof of the noble writers sagacity i shall leave others to determine but if he believes not the insinuation as indeed he seems to disbelieve it then we cannot surely hesitate a moment concerning the measure of his sincerity  the gentleman therefore who makes so ridiculous a figure in the supposed conversation had he not been a poor obsequious puppet might have returned one general and satisfactory answer to all these extraordinary questions he might have desired his lordship to choose which he should like best or worst among all these controverted copies various readings manuscripts and catalogues adopted by whatever church sect or party nay he might have desired him to choose any of the almost infinite number of translations made of these books in distant countries and ages and taking that to be the scripture he appealed to might safely have relied on it as amply sufficient for all the great purposes of religion and christianity  section iv since therefore the scripture history appears to be supported by higher degrees of human testimony than any other ancient writing the only objections of real weight against it must be drawn from it is internal structure from the facts it relates the doctrines it inculcates or the form of it is composition  the facts related being as it were the foundation of all will naturally come first under consideration now these say the enemies of christianity are miraculous or out of nature and therefore absurd for as they can prove nothing so it is impossible that accounts of this kind could be so essentially mingled with a religion that should come from god  on this foundation the noble writer has taken frequent occasion to deride what he calls the mockery of miracles misc ii c    particularly those of our savior ib c    here we shall find him striking at the very basis of all revealed religion while he asserts that even supposing the truth of the facts miracles cannot witness either for god or men nor are any proof either of divinity or revelation moralists part ii   passim  but that his argument may be fairly represented let it appear in his own words the contemplation of the universe it is laws and government was i averd the only means which could establish the sound belief of a deity for what though innumerable miracles from every part assailed the sense and gave the trembling soul no respite what though the sky should suddenly open and all kinds of prodigies appear voices be heard or characters read what would this evince more than that there was certain powers could do all this but what powers whether one or more whether superior or subaltern mortal or immortal wise or foolish just or unjust good or bad this would still remain a mystery as would the true intention the infallibility or certainty of whatever these powers asserted ib   it is remarkable that the noble writer pretends here only to show that miracles are no proof of the existence of god yet in the conclusion of his argument he brings it home to the case of revelation to the true intention the infallibility or certainty of whatever these powers asserted this is clearly the scope of his argument and so indeed has it been understood by his underworkmen in infidelity who have with great industry retailed this objection as it is a circumstance of the last importance in regard to the truth of christianity it cannot be an unseasonable task to show in the fullest manner the vanity and error of this tritc cavil  but instead of considering single acts of of supernatural or miraculous power as being performed in attestation of any particular doctrine which has been the general way of treating this question it is my design to consider as one object that vast series and concatenation of miraculous acts recorded in the old and new testament wrought through a long succession of ages for the carrying on support and completion of the christian dispensation  with this view therefore let us first consider the means by which mankind are justly convinced of the being of a god now this conviction it is allowed by all arises from a union of power wisdom ann goodness displayed in the visible creation from this union alone arises the idea of an allperfect being so that a failure in any of these three essential circumstances would destroy the idea of a god the goodness of the deity is seen in the designed end or purpose of the creation which is the happiness of all his creatures his wisdom is seen in the proper means employed for the accomplishment of this great end his power fulfills what goodness had intended and wisdom contrived by putting these means in execution hence then alone we obtain the idea of a divinity from a union of perfect goodness wisdom and power  it is likewise i think acknowledged by all theists that as to the divine power it may work it is intentions either by a continued and uninterrupted superintendency or agency on matter or by impressing certain original and permanent qualities upon it which of these two kinds of operation may really prevail in nature is perhaps beyond the reach of human knowledge clearly to determine the newtonian philosophy indeed renders it highly probable that the continued agency of god prevails but a determination in this subject is indeed of no consequence since which soever of these methods be ordained the divine power is equally displayed while it ministers to the ends of goodness and wisdom  it is equally plain that if the divine goodness should determine to raise mankind to higher degrees of knowledge and virtue than what they could attain to by the preestablished laws of nature or to free them from defects and miseries occasioned by any incidental and voluntary corruptions posterior to their creation it is equally plain i say that an exertion of supernatural power for the accomplishment of this end would be a display proof or revelation of the divinity entirely similar to that which arises from the works of nature for both here and in the works of nature the proof of the divinity arises not from mere uniform acts of power but from the subserviency of divine power to this one great end the production of human happiness here then the noble writers objection is essentially defective what he affirms is either false or foreign to the question for if we suppose and the present question is put upon this footing only that the miraculous or supernatural effects are evidently subservient to similar ends of wisdom and goodness as appear in the works of the creation then sure we have equal reason to conclude and be convinced that they are the effects of one power  of one superior and immortal power  of one power wise just and good  in a word of that power which first brought nature into being established laws for the welfare of his creatures and when the happiness of his creatures requires an interposition gives still further evidences of his goodness wisdom and omnipotence by controuling those laws which himself had established  let us now apply these principles to the christian dispensation this we say was a scheme of providence which still continues operating whereby the deity determined to raise fallen and corrupted man to higher degrees of knowledge virtue and happiness than what by nature he could have attained in this design the divine goodness is eminently displayed  the means whereby this great design was accomplished was by separating a peculiar people from the rest of mankind not for their own sakes but for the sake of all by preserving them amidst their enemies by leading them forth into a distant country by establishthere the worship of the one god in opposition to the idolatries of surrounding nations till when the fullness of time should come and mankind be capable of receiving a more perfect revelation a savior jesus christ should be sent to free mankind from the power of ignorance and sin to bring life and immortality to light and communicate to all men the most perfect practical knowledge of the true god and of every moral duty in this dispensation is no less eminently displayed the divine wisdom  but what less than omnipotence itself could secure the perfect execution of a plan so mighty and extensive which reaching through the compass of many and distant ages must combat the power control the prejudices and work it is way through the discordant manners and opinions of all the kingdoms of the earth on this account the immediate exertion of divine power was necessary for it is proof support and completion accordingly we find it is omnipotent author carrying on this scheme of wisdom and goodness with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm he sent a man before his people even joseph who was sold to be a bondservant he increased his people exceedingly and made them stronger than their enemies he sent moses his servant and aaron and these showed his tokens among them and wonders in the land of ham he sent darkness and it was dark and turned their waters into blood their land brought forth frogs yea even in their kings chambers he gave them hailstones for rain and flames of fire in their land he spoke the word and the locusts came innumerable and devoured the fruit of their ground he smote all the firstborn in their land even the chief of all their strength he brought forth his people from among them he spread out a cloud to be a covering and fire to give them light in the nightseason he rebuked the red sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the deep as through a wilderness at their desire he brought quails and filled them with the bread of heaven he opened the rock of stone so that rivers ran in dry places  yet within a while they forgot his works and tempted god in the desert then the earth opened and swallowed up dathan and covered the congregation of abiram they joined themselves unto baalpeor and provoked him with their own inventions so the plague was great among them then being chastised they turned to their god he led them over jordan the waters divided to let them pass he discomfited their enemies at his word the sun abode in the midst of heaven and the moon stood still and hasted not to go down for a whole day so he gave the kingdoms of canaan to be an heritage unto his people that all the nations of the world might know that the hand of the lord is mighty and that they might fear the lord continually  hrre then we see that this mighty series of miraculous acts recorded in the old testament being the very means of preserving and separating the israelites from the rest of mankind and at the same time designed to impress them with a lasting idea of the uncontrollable and immediate power of god were generally awakening instances of omnipotence often of justice and terror in the punishment of cruel egyptians rebellious jews and idolatrous nations  in pursuing this vast concatenation of divine power through the series of miracles recorded in the new testament and wrought for the same end the completion of christianity we shall find them of a very different nature and complexion yet still admirably suited to accomplish the same designed ends of providence for now the fullness of time was come in which the wisdom of the deity ordained the immediate establishment of a religion of perfect purity and boundless love accordingly the series of miraculous acts wrought for this great end were such as must naturally engage mankind to a favorable reception of christianity were the very image and transcript expressed the very genius of that most aimable religion they were brought to support and establish in a word were continued instances of omnipotence joined with unbounded charity divine compassion and benevolence  the birth of jesus was proclaimed by a glorious apparition of superior beings who declared the end of his coming in that divine song of triumph glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men his life was one continued scene of divine power wisdom and beneficence he gave eyes to the blind ears to the deaf and feet to the lame he raised the dead to life rebuked the raging elements and made the winds and seas obey him when to fulfill the decrees of heaven and complete the great work of mans redemption he submitted to an ignominious death the vail of the temple was rent in twain a general darkness involved and an earthquake shook the city the same omnipotence by which he wrought his miracles raised him from the grave and after a short stay on earth during which he strengthened and confirmed his desponding followers translated him to heaven and now a new and unexpected scene of divine and miraculous power opened on mankind for the full establishment of christianity the spirit of god came down and dwelt with the apostles they were all filled with the holy ghost and spoke with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance they were invested with supernatural power to heal diseases were empowered to strike dead the deceitful ananias and sapphira and when imprisoned were delivered by the immediate hand of god by these means christianity gained a numerous train of proselytes among the jews but the great work of converting the gentiles was not yet begun to this end the apostle paul was destined and converted to christianity by an amazing act of supernatural and divine power in this important ministry he was frequently preserved by the miraculous care of providence did himself perform stupendous acts of power and beneficence by these means converting multitudes among the gentiles and planting christianity in the most knowing and polished nations of the earth  to this irresistible chain of evidence arising from the miraculous exertion of divine power we may add another collateral proof arising from the miraculous emanations of divine foreknowledge recorded in the bible and delivered in prophecy through a series of ages all centering in the same point the foretelling the completion of this immense plan of wisdom and goodness these predictions were fulfilled in the advent life death and resurrection of our savior who himself foretold the success of his apostles among the gentiles and the final dissolution of the jewish polity this came to pass in the destruction of the temple and when a bitter enemy to christianity attempted to make void the decrees of heaven in rebuilding this temple the only circumstance of union that could ever make the jews once more a people the very foundations were rent in pieces by an earthquake and the mad assailants against omnipotence buried in the ruins  from this mighty union therefore arises a proof similar to that which we obtain from the works of nature for as in these we see the happiness of the creation intended planned and produced and from hence discover the agency of the deity so in the progress and completion of christianity we find a parallel display of the divine attributes we see the advancement of mans happiness determined by divine goodness planned by divine wisdom foretold by divine knowledge accomplished by divine power and hence as in nature obtain a full manifestation proof or revelation of the deity  as this seems to be the true light in which the evidence arising from the scripturemiracles ought to be placed it may be proper now to add a few observations on what has been offered on this subject both by the defenders and the adversaries of christianity  i as to the degree of proof or evidence arising from a single miracle in support of any particular doctrine whatever force it may carry it is a point which we are by no means at present concerned to determine because as we have seen in the progress of the christian dispensation there is a vast series or chain all uniting in one common end it might be considered in the same manner by those who write in proof of the being of a god what evidence of his being would arise from a single vegetable or animal unconnected with the rest of the creation but however satisfying a single fact of this kind may be to impartial minds it were surely weak to argue on this foundation only while we can appeal to that mighty union of design which appears in the works of nature it should therefore seem that the defenders of christianity have generally set this evidence in too detached and particular a light for though the proof arising from a single miracle in support of a particular doctrine may be of sufficient force to convince an equitable mind yet sure it is infinitely stronger and more satisfactory if we view at once the whole chain of miracles by which the great scheme of christianity was propagated as one vast object because in this view we discover innumerable circumstances of mutual relation and agreement similar to those which are proofs of final causes in the natural world in a word we discover that union of design that concurrence of infinite goodness wisdom and power which is the sure indication of the divinity  ii if in a dispensation thus proved to be from god by all these concurring signatures of divinity any incidental circumstances should be found which are unaccountable to human reason it is the part of human reason to acquiesce in this mysterious and unknown part from what is clear and known because in a system or dispensation planned by infinite wisdom there must of necessity be something which finite wisdom cannot comprehend this the noble writer allows with regard to the works of nature if says he in this mighty union there be such relations of parts one to another as are not easily discovered if on this account the end and use of things does not every where appear there is no wonder since it is indeed no more than what must happen of necessity nor could supreme wisdom have otherwise ordered it for in an infinity of things thus relative a mind which sees not infinitely can see nothing fully moralists p ii     iii hence therefore may be evinced the vanity of this cavil that nothing can be proved to be a divine revelation which is not discoverable by human reason since whatever is reasonable needs no miracle to confirm it and whatever is beyond the reach of reason cannot be made to appear reasonable by any miracle whatsoever an objection urged by tindal morgan and others  hence i say the vanity of this cavil is evident because as in nature so in revelation the full evidence of divinity is founded not on single detached circumstances but on a mighty union or concatenation of facts implying the most perfect wisdom power and goodness this foundation being once laid if any thing incidental in either case appears unaccountable as to it is end or use it is naturally and properly involved or taken in as a part of this immense design which through it is vast extent must needs be incomprehensible to human reason  iv as to the objection that miracles may be wrought by inferior or subaltern baltern beings this vanishes at once with regard to the christian dispensation on the evidence as here stated for as the miraculous acts of power recorded in the bible were wrought for the support and accomplishment of a dispensation full of goodness and wisdom we have the same proof that they were the work of the supreme god as we have that nature is so it is true that in either case for aught we know inferior or subaltern beings may have been commissioned by the supreme as immediate agents but this possibility in either case can be a matter of no consequence to us while it is manifest that the delegated beings whatever they might be acted in full subserviency to the goodness wisdom and omnipotence of the one eternal god  v to the noble writers objection that while we labor to unhinge nature we bring confusion on the world and destroy that order from whence the one infinite and perfect principle is known moral p ii     the reply is easy and convincing for while the supernatural power is directed to advance the happiness of mankind it is so far from destroying any principle from whence the one perfect being is known that on the contrary it gives us still clearer and more satisfying notices of the divine providence it is allowed on all hands that there are imperfections in the creation and though there may be and doubtless are good reasons unknown to us why these should not in every instance be removed by a particular exertion of supernatural power yet when the divine wisdom sees fit thus to interpose for the further advancement of his creatures happiness can any thing be more irrational than to say that this is bringing confusion on the world the only question is whether  happiness shall be destroyed for the sake of a preestablished law or a preestablished law be suspended for the sake of happiness in other words whether power shall be subservient to goodness or goodness yield to power a question which no sound theist can be left at a loss to answer as therefore the exertion of divine power in nature is for the production of happiness the miraculous exertion of power for the further advancement of mans happiness is so far from bringing confusion on the world either the chaos and atoms of the atheists or the magic and demons of the polytheists that it is even the clearest proof or revelation of the divinity  vi without this apparent subserviency to the designs of wisdom and goodness all accounts of miraculous facts must be highly improbable because we have no reason to believe that the deity will ever counteract the established laws of nature unless for the sake of advancing the happiness of his creatures  vii on this account most of the pretended miracles recorded in the heathen story are highly improbable for it does not appear they were ever said to have been wrought in any series or chain they never were directed to the accomplishment of any one end through different periods of time were frequently far from being beneficent seldom accommodated even to any rational purpose but generally mere pretended acts of arbitrary and unmeaning power thus they are essentially distinguished from the scripture miracles and are utterly destitute of that internal evidence which arises from an union of design  viii hence we may clearly discover the reason why the wiser heathens ridiculed the jews even to a proverb for their extravagant regard to miracles they knew their own to be absurd and irrational this at once prevented them from enquiring into the real nature of the jewish miracles and at the same time led them to deride and reject these boasted wonders as being no better than their own  ix but on the evidence as here stated the scripture miracles become even probable from the circumstances under which they are recorded as they are beneficent as they were wrought through different periods of time in support of one dispensation full of wisdom and goodness as it is highly improbable that this dispensation could have been completed in all it is immense variety of circumstances without such an immediate interposition of divine power  x and now we shall plainly see the reason why we reject the accounts of miracles given by heathen writers while we believe the other parts of their story and yet cannot reject the jewish and christian miracles without rejecting at the same time the whole history in which they are contained for in the first case as the miracles are useless unmeaning and unconnected with the rest of the facts it appears they are merely political but the jewish and christian miracles make an essential part of the several events related they are strongly connected with this great history of providence and are indeed the very means by which providence completed it is gracious purpose the establishment of christianity we cannot therefore reject these miraculous accounts without rejecting all the natural events with which they are thus intimately interwoven and this we cannot do without destroying every received principle of assent and shaking the faith of all ancient history  i cannot conclude this argument without transcribing a noble passage from the book of wisdom where several of these truths are finely illustrated and which may convince us how just an idea the jews entertained of miraculous interposition beyond what their enemies have industriously represented the writer after recounting the stupendous chain of miracles wrought for the deliverence of the chosen people concludes thus in all things o lord thou have magnified and glorified thy people and have not despised to assist them in every time and place  for every creature in it is kind was fashioned a new and served in their own offices enjoined them that thy children might be kept without hurt  for the things of the earth were changed into things of the water and the thing that did swim went upon the ground the fire had power in the water contrary to his own virtue and the water forgot his own kind to quench  thus the elements were changed among themselves by a kind of harmony as when one tune is changed upon an instrument of music and the melody still remains  thus he nobly expresses the subserviency of the elements to the divine will and under the image of a musical instrument which the skilful master tunes changes and directs to the one purpose of harmony he aptly and beautifully represents the whole creation as an instrument in the hands of god which he orders varies and controuls to the one unvaryd end of happiness  section v having vindicated the scripture miracles from the noble writers objections and shown that they are so far from being useless or absurd that the grand scheme of providence could neither have been evidenced nor accomplished without them we have destroyed the chief foundation on which his lordship has attempted to fix his cavils against christianity on another subject i mean that of enthusiasm which naturally offers itself next to our consideration as this is the noble writers favorite topic we may reasonably expect to see him shine in it and in one respect indeed he does he never touches on the subject but he rises above himself his imagination kindles he catches the fire he describes and his page glows with all the ardors of this high passion  it will i presume be unnecessary to make any remarks on the large and eminent list of enthusiasts poets orators heroes legislators musicians and philosophers which his lordship cites from plato he may call them enthusiasts if it seem good to him and may justly rank himself in the number too if by that name be understood no more than a man of uncommon strength or warmth of imagination for this indeed is the requisite foundation of excellence in any of the characters here enumerated  the only circumstance we are concerned calmly to examine is that of religious enthusiasm chiefly to point out the essential qualities and characteristics which distinguish this from divine inspiration hence to prove that our savior and his apostles were not religious enthusiasts as the noble writer has suggested  it is indeed as his lordship observes a great work to judge of spirits whether they be of god we shall willingly join him in this principle too that in order to this end we must antecedently judge our own spirit whether it be of reason or sound sense free of every byassing passion every giddy vapor or melancholy fume this is the first knowledge and previous judgment to understand ourselves and know what spirit we are of afterward we may judge the spirit in others consider what their personal merit is and prove the validity of their testimony by the solidity of their brain on this principle then let the cause be determined  in examining this subject therefore we shall find first that in some respects enthusiasm must from it is nature always resemble divine inspiration secondly that in others it has generally attempted a further resemblance but has always betrayed itself thirdly that in other circumstances it is diametrically opposite to divine inspiration and void even of all seeming resemblance  first enthusiasm must from it is very nature in some respects always resemble divine inspiration they both have the deity for their object and consequently must both be attended with a devout turn of mind they must both be subject to strong and unusual impressions the one supernatural the other praeternatural that is beyond the ordinary efforts of nature though really produced by nature these through their uncommon force will often resemble and not easily be distinguished from those which are the real effect of supernatural power this circumstance deserves a particular attention for these two qualities which are common to both have induced many to reject the very notion of divine inspiration as mere ethusiasm whereas we see that supposing such a thing as divine inspiration it cannot but resemble enthusiasm in these two characters  but though it were strange if counterfeits did not hit off some features of their genuine originals yet it were more strange if they should be able to adopt them all by such a perfect imitation as to prevent their being detected  there are therefore secondly other circumstances in which enthusiasm has generally attempted a further resemblance of divine inspiration but in these has always betrayed itself spurious  the first of this kind is a pretense to and persuasion of the power of working miracles this persuasion must needs be natural to the enthusiast because he imagines himself in all things highly favored of heaven the notion of a communication of divine power will therefore be among the chief of his deliriums in this the enthusiast has been detected sometimes by the absurdity of the miracle attempted always by his inability to perform what he proposed there is scarce an absurdity so great but what has some time or other been aimed at by enthusiasts in the way of miraculous power their attempts have ever been void of all rational intention void of beneficence void of common discernment and hence manifestly the effects of a heated imagination that they have always failed in their attempts is no less known but these are truths so willingly allowed by the enemies of religion that we need not enlarge on them on the contrary we have seen the miracles of the gospel are rational beneficent united in one great end performed before numbers before enemies recorded by eyewitnesses his lordship indeed objects or insinuates that the testimony even of eyewitnesses cannot in this case be a foundation for assent unless we know them to have been free both from any particular enthusiasm and a general turn to melancholy but with regard to the miracles of the gospel we know that many were converted by them from their former prejudices and therefore could not possibly be under the influence of the christian enthusiasm supposing it such and as to their being free from melancholy for this we may safely appeal to the rational and consistent accounts given by the sacred penmen melancholy and enthusiasm must ever produce inconsistent visions for a proof that the scripture miracles are not of this nature we appeal to what has been already said on this subject in the preceding section  but there is one miraculous gift the gift of tongues which has more generally been supposed the peculiar effect of inspiration we have an account of this kind recorded in holy writ acts ii  and this account the noble writer has thought it expedient to turn to ridicule by representing this supposed miraculous gift as the mere effect of strong melancholy and natural inebriation to this purpose having observed from dr more that the vapors and fumes of melancholy partake of the nature of wine he adds one might conjecture from hence that the malicious opposers of early christianity were not unversed in this philosophy when they sophistically objected against the apparent force of the divine spirit speaking in diverse languages and attributed it to the power of new wine misc ii    agreably to this insinuated charge he tells us of a gentleman who has writ lately in defense of revived prophecy and has since fallen himself into the prophetic ecstasies the noble writer adds i saw him lately under an agitation as they call it uttering prophecy in a pompous latin style of which out of his ecstasy it seems he is wholly incapable let on enthu     here we may see how ready some people are to strain at a gnat and yet swallow a camel the noble writer ridicules the gift of tongues from divine inspiration as absurd and impossible yet he believes you see or affects to believe that this man could speak latin by the sole force of imagination and enthusiasm a compendious method this of learning languages i have somewhere met with a very rational remark that whereas it was charged by festus upon st paul that learning had made him mad this notion inverts the charge for thus  madness may make a man learned  but leaving his lordships admirers to determine which is the greater miracle a gift of tongues from god or a gift of tongues from melancholy it is our part to show the essential characters of distinction between the reality of one and the pretenses of the other now this will appear most evident if we compare them both in their manner and their end as to the manner of this new prophesying sect the noble writer himself tells us it was that of ecstacy and convulsion and that he saw this gentleman under an agitation when he had the gift of tongues as to the end pretended in this miraculous gift it appears there was really none for the pompous latin style was uttered among a people who in general understood the english language only it could therefore serve to no rational purpose on the contrary it appears that the miraculous gift of tongues conferred on the apostles was rational both in its manner and it is end there is not the least hint of it is having been attended with ecstasies or convulsions nay it appears from the account that it could not have been so attended and from the occasion it appears how proper it was with regard to it is end the recital is noble and rational let it answer for itself and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven  and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born parthians and medes and elamites the dwellers in mesopotamia and in judea and cappodocia in pontus and asia phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god how just an effort of divine power which should at once give instruction to those who most wanted it and be the natural means of conveying and dispersing the glad tidings of the gospel to every nation under heaven  it should seem probable therefore that the men who mocked and said these men are full of new wine were the natives of judea for peter we find immediately arose and addressed himself to these in particular ye men of judea etc and it was natural for them to entertain this suspicion because they neither understood what the apostles uttered nor could imagine how they should obtain a knowledge of so many various tongues they must therefore naturally suspect that the apostles were uttering unmeaning sounds and this they regarded as the effect of wine  another remarkable circumstance in which enthusiasts have often pretended to resemble the divinely inspired is the gift of prophecy which indeed is no more than another kind of miracle in this too enthusiasm has always betrayed itself first and principally with regard to the event the frequent attempts of this kind and their perpetual failure need not here been umerated they are known sufficiently this cannot be charged on the apostles with the least appearance of reason for it is a gift they hardly ever pretended to our savior indeed foretold many and great events  the defection of peter his own sufferings death resurrection and ascension the descent of the holy spirit the persecution of his disciples the propagation of his religion among the gentiles the approaching miseries and final destruction of jerusalem now all these events were clearly accomplished so far therefore are they from proving him an enthusiast that they demonstrate him possessed of divine foreknowledge  but besides the event there is a notable circumstance in the manner which has ever distinguished real from pretended true from false prophecy and which the noble writers groundless affirmations have made it necessary to insist on  he says i find by present experience as well as by all histories sacred and profane that the operation of this spirit is every where the same as to the bodily organ let on enth    in confirmation of this he cites a passage from the gentleman who was subject to the prophetic ecstasies which informs us that the ancient prophets had the spirit of god upon them under ecstasy with diverse strange gestures of body denominating them madmen or enthusiasts as appears evidently says he in the instances of balaam saul david ezekiel daniel ib  etc and he adds the gentleman proceeds to justify this by the practice of the apostolic times and by the regulation which the apostle himself applies to these seemingly irregular gifts ib  in this instance it is not unpleasant to observe the different views of his lordship and the gentleman he refers to in their endeavors to establish this pretended fact the one was zealous to fix a resemblance between the old and the new prophetic manner in order to strengthen the credit of the revived prophecy the others intention plainly was by that very resemblance which he was willing should pass for real to destroy the credit of the scripture prophecies well knowing that the other deserved none  but so it happens that the noble writers friend proves as bad an historian as he was a prophet and fails as miserably in relating past events as in foretelling future the truth is that both his lordship and the gentleman seem to have been in a fit of enthusiasm and have therefore been induced to mingle a little pious fraud through a zeal for their respective theories for in reality this pretended resemblance is utterly fictitious there is not the least hint in scripture that any of the persons mentioned as true prophets were ever subject to these ecstatic convulsive motions which the enthusiastic gentleman and his tribe were always seized with as to the regulation made by the apostle paul whoever consults the place   corinthians c xiv will find there is no mention made of ecstasies convulsions or extraordinary bodily motions and it is clear that our savior always delivered his prophecies on every incidental occasion under all the common circumstances of human life calm serene and with unaffected deliberation so that the whole charge is a bold continued falsehood void of truth and even the appearance of it  indeed from the instances which the noble writer cites from virgil and livy it is evident that the old heathen pretenders to prophecy were affected in the same convulsive manner as the modern christian enthusiasts his lordship might have cited twenty more from ancient writers and what can be rationally inferred from them what but this  that this convulsive agitation of the bodily organs is a circumstance that effectually betrays enthusiasm and distinguishes it from the real inspirations recorded in holy writ  these are the circumstances in which enthusiasm will generally seem to resemble real inspiration though on a nearer scrutiny these very circumstances will always detect it we come now to enumerate those other qualities peculiar to enthusiasm in which it bears no resemblance to divine inspiration and in which they are at first view clearly distinguished from each other and here it is remarkable that as the noble writer dwells on the former so he scarce ever touches on these following characters of clear distinction this peculiar conduct can hardly be judged accidental for a man of wit can easily improve a partial resemblance into a complete one but to have added other features of absolute dissimilarity would have weakened the likeness and consequently have disgraced the intended representation  the chief qualities which clearly and at first view distinguish enthusiasm from divine inspiration i find enumerated by the fine writer of the letter on st pauls conversion these are  heat of temper melancholy credulity selfconceit and ignorance so far as these relate to st paul the reader is referred to the excellent work here cited it is our part to consider them as they may affect our savior and the rest of his apostles and a brief consideration may suffice for all except the last are so repugnant to their characters that the very mention of them refutes the imputation  with regard to the first of these qualities uncommon heat of temper it is of all others most abhorrent from our saviors character he is every where sedate cool and unmoved even under the most bitter circumstances of provocation see dr laws life of christ where his character is described at large  he every where appears a perfect model of benevolence meekness and mild majesty the same temper generally prevails among his apostles more particularly we may observe of the evangelists who are the immediate evidences that in their writings they discover the most perfect coolness had they been of a fiery disposition they had not failed to load the enemies of their crucified lord with the bitterest sarcasms  with as little reason can melancholy be charged on the founders of christianity our savior came eating and drinking so entirely open unreserved and social that he was branded by his enemies as a friend of publicans and sinners another circumstance besides the passion for solitude has ever distinguished melancholy that is an overfondness and desire to suffer in the apprehended cause of truth beyond the just and rational ends of suffering now this is diametrically opposite to the character of our savior and his apostles for even jesus himself was in an agony at the apprehension of his approaching sufferings so far were his disciples from being tainted with this melancholy that they discovered unmanly fear for they all forsook him and fled it is true they afterward endured the severest trials with unshaken constancy yet still with the resigned spirit of martyrs not the eagerness and fanatic vaunts of all known enthusiasts for a remarkable instance of this see a story relating to savanorola charact misc ii c   in the notes   the charge of credulity has no better foundation to our savior himself it is in it is very nature utterly inapplicable his disciples have been often charged with credulity but on impartial examination it will appear that the charge is groundless for this is an unvarying circumstance in the credulity of an enthusiast that it never admits a doubt but it is evident from the united accounts of the gospelhistory that they osten nay always doubted of our saviors death though himself foretold it it is equally evident they not only doubted of but almost disbelieved his resurrection till overcome by irresistible evidence these circumstances afford another collateral proof that the apostles were not enthusiasts because it is essentially of the nature of enthusiasm to run on headlong in the open channel of the first conceived opinion now it is evident they changed their first opinion concerning the temporal dominion of christ into the firm belief of his death resurrection and spiritual kingdom we cannot therefore justly charge them with that credulity which is the characteristic of enthusiasm see this point treated with great particularity of proof in a pamphlet entitled  a discourse proving that the apostles were no enthusiasts by a campbel s t p   the next circumstance selfconceit which has ever been one of the most distinguishing qualities of enthusiasm is so distant from the character of jesus and his apostles that it has never i believe been laid to their charge the enthusiast is perpetually boasting of immediate converse and communication with the deity and overflows with a contempt of all who are not of his own system in our savior we discover the most unfeigned humility and compassion toward all men when urged to show his pretensions to a divine mission so far is he from resolving them into inward feelings impulses or notices from god the constant practice of every enthusiast that on the contrary he calmly appeals to his works and doctrines mat vii     adding in a strain the reverse of all enthusiasm that in what we bear witness only to ourselves our witness cannot be established as a truth john v     the same turn of mind appears in the apostles they affect no superiority themselves nor express or discover any contempt or spiritual pride with regard to others  the last quality common to enthusiasts is that of ignorance this has been sometimes charged on our savior himself often on his apostles with an air of triumph but so it is that seeming objections against truth become often the strongest evidence in support of it this will eminently appear in the present case if we consider that ignorance or want of letters when joined with enthusiasm must always produce the most inconsistent visions whimsical conduct and pernicious doctrines these effects ignorance and enthusiasm have wrought wherever they appeared in every age and nation nor can it indeed be otherwise for a lettered enthusiast may be supposed to have an internal balance which must in some degree counteract and regulate his visions while the unlettered is subject to no control but must become the sport and prey to the delirious flights of an unreined imagination  now that the apostles and evangelists were unlearned must needs be granted and though the noble writer has taken upon him to deride them on this account yet this very circumstance compared with their conduct and writings clears them at once from the charge of enthusiasm so far were they from the ravings of this passion common to all ignorant enthusiasts that we may defy the enemies of christianity to produce any instance either of speech or practice that has the smallest tincture of extravagance their conduct was regular and exemplary their words were the words of truth and soberness  as to the charge of ignorance against our savior the enemies of christianity have been more cautious yet it has been insinuated and indeed that he had not the common aids of human learning is not only acknowledged but insisted on could ignorant and blind enthusiasm then have produced the sublime religious doctrines and moral precepts which the evangelists have recorded from his mouth with as much truth it might be affirmed that the creation is the produce of chance with reason then may we ask the noble writer this question whence then had this man such wisdom seeing he spoke as never man spoke and the answer sure is one only that as it was not from man it must have been from god for even the enemies of christianity have born witness to it is excellence even when they intended to disgrace it while with fruitless labor they have attempted to prove that the most exalted truths and precepts of the gospel may be found scattered among the writings of the heathen sages  from these concurrent circumstances therefore we obtain a full internal proof that the founders of christianity were not enthusiasts as the noble writer has by the most labored and repeated insinuations attempted to represent them  section vi since therefore we have appealed to the religious and moral doctrines of christianity as a concurrent proof of it is divine original it will be necessary now to examine what the noble writer has alleged or suggested against this most essential part of our religion  and first it appears from the general turn of the characteristics that the noble author regards religious establishments as being quite at a distance from philosophy and truth with which he tells us in ancient times they never interfered he therefore derides every attempt to make them coalesce thus he tells us not only visionaries and enthusiasts of all kinds were tolerated by the ancients but on the other side philosophy had as free a course and was permitted as a balance against superstition  thus matters were happily balanced reason had fair play learning and science flourished wonderful was the harmony and temper which arose from all these contrarieties let on enthus  such therefore being his lordships idea of a public religion which he ever opposes to private opinion and philosophy it is no wonder he should insinuate the folly of christianity which promises to all it is proselytes that they shall know the truth and the truth shall make them free  but notwithstanding the noble writers partiality to the system of ancient paganism which he had deeply imbibed from his familiar converse with ancient writers no unprejudiced mind can hesitate a moment in determining the superior excellence of the christian religion compared with these wellmeant but defective schemes of heathen policy for as gross error and misapprehension of the divine nature and attributes was deeply interwoven with ancient paganism so it is well known that in fact the most horrid enormities were committed upon principle under the authority and example of their pretended gods lord shaftesbury himself owns what indeed it were folly to deny that the imitation of the deity is a powerful principle of action enq on virtue  if so it follows that to communicate a just idea of the divine perfections to all mankind must tend to secure their virtue and promote their happiness it is therefore equally ungenerous and impolitic to suffer mankind to live in ignorance and idolatry hence it is evident that reformations in religion are not the ridiculous things his lordship would represent them and that christianity if indeed it reveals the truth is a religion in it is tendency much more beneficial to mankind than ancient paganism  it is no difficult task to assign the original cause of this so different and even opposite genius of the pagan systems from that of christianity in early and ignorant ages the necessity of religious belief and religious establishments was seen by the leaders of mankind on this account they instituted the most salutary forms and doctrines which their unexperienced reason could suggest as nations grew wiser and more polished they saw the weakness and absurdity of these established systems but through a regard and perhaps a mistaken one to the public good were unwilling to discover these defects and absurdities to the people hence probably the rise of exoteric and esoteric doctrines for the furthest that human policy dared to go was to reveal the truth to a few initiated while the bulk of mankind even in the wisest and politest ages continued the dupes to the prejudices and superstitions of the most ignorant ones on the contrary it was a main design of the christian dispensation to dispel this cloud of ignorance which excluded mankind from all participation of divine truth to reveal those just and sublime ideas of the divinity which are the noblest as they are the surest foundation not only of piety but of morals and which so far as they can affect either piety or morals such is the triumph of christianity over the labored researches of false wisdom are no less intelligible to the peasant than the philosopher on this account christianity was perfect  relatively perfect in it is first delineation all attempts to change or add to its doctrines have but discovered their own absurdity and experience every day more and more convinces us that the only method of obtaining a pure and incorrupt system of practical religion and moral precepts is to search for them in the uncommented pages of the gospel  thus what was the effect of necessity among the heathens the noble writer very partially attributes to choice he mistakes a defect for an excellence and blindly prefers the weakness of man to the wisdom of god  another cavil frequently urged or insinuated by his lordship against christianity seems to have been the natural consequence of the lastmentioned he much admires the pagan religions as having been sociable and mutually incorporated into each other and often represents christianity as of an unsociable surly and solitary complexion tending to destroy every other but itself the consequence of this he tells us has been a new sort of policy which extends itself to another world and has made us leap the bounds of natural humanity and out of a supernatural charity has taught us the way of plaguing one another most devoutly let on enthu  now with regard to this pretended unsociable temper of christianity it must be owned indeed that our religion tends to swallow up and destroy every other in the same manner as truth in every subject tends to destroy falsehood that is by rational conviction the same objection might be urged against the newtonian philosophy which destroyed the cartesian fables or against the copernican system because the clumsy visions of ptolemy and tychobrahe vanished before it the same might be urged against the usefulness of the great source of day because it dims and extinguishes every inferior luster for the glimmering lamps of human knowledge lighted up by the philosophers served indeed to conduct them as a light shining in a dark place but these must naturally be sunk in a superior luster when the sun of righteousness should arise the gospel therefore is so far unsociable as to discredit error and is incompatible with this as light with darkness but not so unsociable as to compel the erroneous as to the religious debates then which christianity has occasioned and the wars and massacres consequent upon them which the noble writer so justly detests christianity stands clear of the charge till it can be shown that it countenanceth the inhuman principle of intolerance and this it is bitterest enemies can never do it is true that if we be so irrational as to take our idea of christianity from the representations of enthusiasts and bigots nothing can appear more absurd and mischevious as in like manner if we consider the heavens under the perplexed revolutions and malignant aspects of the old astronomers and astrologers nothing can be more unworthy either of divine wisdom or goodness but how can these false images affect the noble simplicity and benignity of the gospel or the solar system to the works and the word of god we must repair for a true idea of their undisguised perfection and there we shall read their divine author in the brightest characters of wisdom and goodness so far therefore is christianity from encouraging wars and massacres on account of a difference in opinion that it is divine founder has expressly warned his followers against the suggestions of this horrid temper luke ix  nor can these fatal consequences ever arise among christians till they have divested themselves of christian charity and ib mistaken the very principles of their profession  but the noble writer proceeds to still more bitter invectives if possible against christianity for he often insinuates that the prospect of happiness and misery in another life revealed in the gospel tends to the destruction of all true virtue wit and h p ii    indeed we cannot much wonder that his lordship should treat christianity in this manner when we consider what he has thrown out against religion in general in this respect these cavils have already been considered at large whatever therefore he has insinuated against our religion in particular will naturally be referred to and effectually be refuted by these more general observations see above ess ii    however there are two or three passages on this subject so remarkable that they may seem to deserve a separate consideration  after having ridiculed and branded christianity as destroying the disinterested part of virtue he tells us the jews as well as heathens were left to their philosophy to be instructed in the sublime part of virtue and induced by reason to that which was never enjoined them by command no premium or penalty being enforced in these cases the disinterested part subsisted the virtue was a free choice and the magnanimity of the act was left entire wit and h p ii     here again the noble writer has got to his peculiarities what other title this passage may deserve we shall soon discover for first supposing his assertion true what he notes in the jewish and heathen religions as an excellence had certainly been a defect for are not hottentots wild indians and arabs left to their philosophy to be induced by reason to that which was never enjoined them by command no premium or penalty being enforced in these cases the disinterested part subsists the virtue is a free choice and the magnanimity of the act is left entire thus the noble writer would again debase us into savages see above essay ii  0  and rather than not disgrace christianity would put the state of palestine greece and rome on a level with that of the cape of good hope blindly or shall we say knowingly disparaging what he elsewhere so justly applauds laws constitutions civil and religious rites whatever civilizes or polishes rude mankind moralists part i     but in fact neither the jews nor civilized heathens were ever tainted with this phrenzy they saw the necessity of religious belief and as they saw it is necessity so they enforced it with regard to the jews the noble writer contradicts himself within the compass of ten lines for there he says their religion taught no future state nor exhibited any rewards or punishments besides such as were temporal this is the very truth here then he owns a temporal sanction of premium and penalty reward and punishment yet in the passage above cited and which stands close by the other in the original he says there was no premium or penalty enforced no reward or punishment his lordship deals as fairly and consistently by the civilized heathens for could he indeed have forgot the distinguished rank which in the elysian fields was assigned to those who fell to save their country hic manus ob patriam pugnando vulner a passi  omnibus his nivea cinguntur tempora vitta eneid lib vi    and now let the impartial determine whether the noble writers observation has more of sagacity or of truth in it  but the christian doctrines relating to an hereafter are to undergo a yet severer inquisition from the noble writer they are to be tortured and mangled on the rack of wit shall i say or of buffoonry the misfortune is we are seldom taught to comprehend this self by placing it in a distinct view from it is representative or counterfeit in our holy religion which for the greatest part is adapted to the very meanest capacities it is not to be expected that a speculation of this kind should be openly advanced it is enough that we have hints given us of a nobler self than that which is commonly supposed the basis and foundation of our actions selfinterest is there taken as it is vulgarly conceived  in the same manner as the celestial phenomenon are in the sacred volumes generally treated according to common imagination and the then current system of astronomy and natural science so the moral appearances are in many places preserved without alteration according to vulgar prejudice  our real and genuine self is sometimes supposed that ambitious one which is fond of power and glory sometimes that childish one which is taken with vain show and is to be invited to obedience by promise of finer habitations precious stones and metals shining garments crowns and other such dazzling beauties by which another earth or material city is represented solil part iii     this passage contains two insinuated charges of a very different nature the one is true but no objection the other would indeed be an objection but that it is absolutely groundless it is true that our religion is for the greatest part adapted to the very meanest capacities and that the celestial phenomenon are in the sacred volumes generally treated according to common imagination etc and would the noble writer indeed have had it otherwise would he indeed have had them spoken of according to the philosophical construction of the universe rather than the received notions of mankind with how little reason we may soon be convinced if we consider first that the end of revelation was not to make mankind proficients in philosophy since the situation of the generality can never admit it and had the scriptures supposed this as indeed such a conduct would have supposed it this very circumstance had been an argument of their falsehood secondly even philosophers themselves though intimately acquainted with the construction of the universe do still descend to the level of mankind when they speak of the phenomenon of nature the sun sets and rises as it did three thousand years ago the moon changes wains is new and old the stars are in the firmament the sun still rules the day and the moon the night the reason is evident because astronomical discoveries have not the least influence on the practice of mankind because although the natural appearances of things are merely relative to the imagination only yet they are for that very reason necessary to be referred to as the imagination is the great universal instrument of life and human action  an objection therefore to the scriptures on this account betrays either a gross misapprehension of human nature or the most unpardonable insincerity yet we find objections of this kind frequently urged as if because the sacred penmen were empowered by god to reveal to us a certain measure of religious and moral truth suited to our present state they must therefore be endued with omniscience in order to make all men not only good subjects but good astronomers too  but though it were folly to object against the sacred penmen because they appear not to have been omniscient yet i cannot conclude this argument without producing a remarkable instance wherein their very ignorance of these speculative and unnecessary truths becomes a convincing proof of their veracity a circumstance which much more nearly concerns us we read in the book of joshua and he said in the sight of israel sun stay thou in gibeon and thou moon in the valley of ajalon and the sun abode and the moon stood still  and hasted not to go down for a whole day joshua x  here the standing still of these luminaries is related in such a manner as concurs with the common appearances of things and yet consists with the best discoveries in astronomy though unknown to the writer for we are now assured that if the sun stood still it must have been by suspending the diurnal rotation of the earth the standing still of the moon was therefore the necessary consequence this the writer appears not to have known yet he relates the fact though it was of no importance with regard to that event for which the miracle was wrought it is therefore of singular force in proving the veracity of the writer because had it not been true in fact it is a circumstance which could never have occurred to him  the noble writers other charge relating to the moral representations of the scriptures would indeed be of weight if it were founded in truth but so far from this that he has utterly reversed the fact for in reality these sensible representations of visible beauty and glory are only occasionally or accidentally hinted while the whole weight and energy of the gospel is employed in enforcing the idea of moral perfection of our nobler self of selfinterest in the higher sense of the necessity of extirpating every meaner passion and cherishing the great one of unbounded love as the necessary and only discipline that can qualify us for future happiness it is evident that the noble writer lays the principal stress of his charge on the apocalypse a work in it is whole turn strictly allegorical and therefore necessarily conversant in imagery and visible representation to this he has most perversely added a figurative expression of st paul who writing to a people among whom the prizeraces prevailed represents the christian progress as a contest of this kind and shows it is superiority over the former because says he they labor to obtain a corruptible but we an incorruptible crown in the mean time he has omitted the many discourses parables maxims of our savior in which he perpetually exhorts his disciples to endeavor after unfeigned virtue and universal benevolence as the only means that can bring them to future perfection he has forgot too the repeated exhortations of st paul who sets charity so high above every other gift or possession and adds the reason of it is preeminence because it shall never fail it is true indeed as the noble writer observes with what intention it is no difficult matter to determine that our holy religion is for the greatest part adapted to the very meanest capacities we may add and to the very worst of dispositions too and it is one of it is chief glories that it is so therefore we find it enforcing every motive that can work on every mind which must surely be acknowledged as the character of the religion that should come from him who knew what was in man but if the noble writer would further insinuate that the idea of future happiness ought to be confined to that of virtuous enjoyment whereas the christian religion does not so confine it we have already seen that from the nature of things this refinement is visionary and groundless see above essay ii     we now come to the examination of a passage more extraordinary and original than any yet produced the noble writer tells us i could be almost tempted to think that the true reason why some of the most heroic virtues have so little notice taken of them in our holy religion is because there would have been no room left for disinterestedness had they been entitled to a share of that infinite reward which providence has by revelation assigned to other duties private friendship and zeal for the public and our country are virtues purely voluntary in a christian they are no essential parts of his charity he is not so tied to the affairs of this life nor is he obliged to enter into such engagements with this lower world as are of no help to him in acquiring a better his conversation is in heaven nor has he occasion for such supernumerary cares and embarrassments here on earth as may obstruct his way thither or retard him in the careful task of working out his own salvation wit and h part ii     we have already seen that the real nature of virtue consists in procuring or promoting the greatest public happiness and that this truth is often occasionally acknowledged by lord shaftesbury himself consequently the highest or most heroic virtue is that which tends to accomplish this great end nor can any pretended virtue be either great or heroic that tends to obstruct or destroy it  on this plain principle selfevident to unbyassed reason let us examine the passage now before us and first as to private friendship which the noble writer says is a virtue purely voluntary in a christian  let us consider how far it may be regarded as a virtue at all  now on strict enquiry we shall find that the extreme degree of friendship recommended and applauded by the ancients and here patronized by the noble author is essentially repugnant to true virtue in friendship they placed the chief happiness  and if this consists in the supreme love of one it must needs diminish if not extinguish the love of all because our chief or whole attention must be employed our every view and design centered in giving pleasure or procuring happiness to one individual and this is the very fairest light it can be viewed in  for we shall further see how little it generally partakes of the nature of true virtue if we consider whence it has it is rise this is universally allowed to be a similarity of disposition will and manners this circumstance demonstrates that in general it must be contrary to virtue for hence the general good must be often sacrificed to gratify the will of one of this dreadsul effect instances might be produced almost innumerable let one suffice between tiberius gracchus and c blosius a dear and perfect friendship subsisted the latter being seized for aiding the former in his conspiracy was brought before the consuls he pleaded his friendship to gracchus in excuse for his crime he was then asked what suppose he had bid you fire the capitol would you have done it to this he boldly replied he never would have laid me under such a necessity but if he had i would have obeyed him cic laelius  a thorough friend sure but a vile citizen notwithstanding the artful gloss of an ingenious modern who has attempted to make out the innocence of his intentions see montaignes essay on this subject   it is true the advocates for this attachment sometimes assert that it cannot consist but with virtue that it ought not is certain that it cannot or does not is a groundless conceit unless they choose to make this circumstance a part of the definition which were idle sophistry but if by friendship be meant what indeed is always meant a violent love and attachment to another on account of a similarity of manners this it is certain has often nay most commonly subsisted without virtue among savages robbers heroes and banditti in lucians tract on friendship we find that out of twelve notable instances alleged near half the number were supported at the expense of justice or humanity either by the commission of rapine adultery or murder or by aiding the escape of those who ought to have suffered for these enormous crimes will any one allege the emperor tiberius or his favorite sejanus as patterns of virtue yet their friendship was so remarkable that in honor of it altars were dedicated to friendship by a senatorial decree nay some of the applauded instances appealed to by the noble author in his comment on this passage are even notorious in this respect such were theseus and pirithous equally remarkable for friendship rapes and plunder and such instances may still be found in every savage country where the strongest friendships are commonly formed where men thus leagued go upon bold adventures and hazard and give up life for each other without reluctance while they ravish their neighbors wives and carry off their cattle  with as little reason can it be urged that friendships in general are disinterested so as to aspire to the name of merit for merit if it exists can only arise from virtue and virtue we have seen does not essentially belong to friendship nay in lucians tract it is warmly debated between the contending parties whether affection or private advantage has a more considerable share in this applauded union indeed the civilized and haughty greek stands upon the punctilio of honor and piques himself on the notion of disinterest but the undisguised scythian insists that mutual advantage and support are the ruling motives however in conclusion they fairly agree in comparing a set of fast friends to geryon with three heads and six hands enabled through this increase of strength to overturn all opposition luciani toxaris  but suppose affection the ruling principle as unquestionably it often is where is the merit while confined to one person nay it must rather lean toward demerit because it appears it is rather dangerous than favorable to public affection and virtue it is evident then that the friendly affection is no more meritorious than the conjugal paternal or filial affection which being of a contracted nature are often consistent with great baseness of mind and destructive of a more enlarged benevolence thus a writer of distinguished abilities many instances occur in history and daily experience of men not ashamed to commit base and selfish enormities who have retained a tenderness for their posterity by the strong and generous instinct of nature the story of licinius macer who was father to calvus the great orator is very remarkable as related by a roman annalist having gone through the office of praetor and governed a province he was accused upon returning home of extortion and abuses of his power the very morning of his trial he strangled himself after having sent word to cicero who was preparing to plead against him that being determined to put an end to his life before sentence though the penalty did not extend to taking it away the prosecution could not go on and his fortune would be saved to the benefit of his son  considerations on the law of forfeiture p       and what degree of merit or disinterest there is in regards of this nature when separate from more extensive ones we may learn from the noble writer himself who says there is a selfishness in the love that is paid to a wife and in the attendance on a family and all the little affairs of it which had i my full scope of action in the public i should hardly have submitted to ld ss let to mr molesworth let ix   so far then is clear that friendship or a violent affection founded on a similarity of disposition and manners is more likely to produce vice than virtue as it tends to fix such habits of mind as must lessen our concern for the general good and in fact every ones experience will point out to him numbers of men naturally benevolent to all but so strongly biased and drawn in by particular attachments that their regards and beneficence are centered wholly on a select few while the rest of mankind pass unheeded and unassisted and have no share in their benevolence further than what selfdeceit throws out in unmeaning wishes for their welfare  it is no less evident that through the natural advantages of this partial alliance mankind must ever be prone to embrace it in exclusion of more extensive affections where no such advantages can follow it would therefore have been a defect in the christian religion to have enjoined or even recommended it in this extreme accordingly we find in the gospel every attachment of this kind however natural and alluring it may be set very little above the lowest selfishness and justly represented as entirely consistent with it if ye do do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye do not the publicans even the same mat v   besides there is something so extraordinary in the noble writers scheme of enjoying friendship as sufficiently exposes it is own weakness friendship his lordship allows can only arise from a consent and harmony of minds in the note  how then could christianity have enjoined us the practice of this supposed virtue what must it have enjoined us why to go in quest of a mind resembling our own it might with equal propriety have enjoined us to go in quest of a face resembling our own and with as much reason for all the purposes of true virtue  but if by friendship be meant what indeed is not generally meant a particular love and esteem for the virtuous or worthy in which sense alone it can have any tendency to produce true virtue then we may justly affirm that it is recommended in the gospel both by example and by precept it is naturally involved in that allcomprehensive command of universal charity for though many have been zealous in their friendships while they were insensible to public affection yet such is the temperament of human nature that no instance was ever known of a man zealous for the happiness of all yet remiss in or incapable of a true friendship for the worthy it is recommended by st paul who says that peradventure for a good man one would even dare to die it is recommended by our saviors example who selected a beloved disciple as his bosom friend whose writings are the overflowings of a heart filled with the purest and most unbounded love st john  above all it is recommended by our savior in that noble and divine passage who is my mother or my brethren even he that does the will of my father which is in heaven he is my brother and sister and mother matt xii   so much for the spurious virtue of private friendship let us next consider the noble writers charge against christianity on account of it is not enjoining a zeal for the public and our country for this too it seems is a virtue purely voluntary in a christian now all the absurdities which load his charge with regard to friendship fall with equal weight on this groundless imputation for if by zeal for the public and our country be meant a zeal that is inconsistent with the rights and common welfare of mankind it is so far from being a virtue that as in the case of friendship it is really a crime because it tends to produce the most fatal consequences and an army of victorious warriors returning triumphant on this vile principle however graced with the flattering title of heroes and ensigns of glory are in truth no better than a band of public robbers or as our great poet a christian and a lover of mankind finely expresses it an impious crew of men conspiring to uphold their state by worse than hostile deeds violating the ends for which our country is a name so dear sampson agonistes  now it is evident beyond a doubt that at the time when our savior appeared this destructive partiality this avowed conspiracy against the common rights of mankind was universally prevalent among the most civilized nations the jews were not exempted from this common excess  inter ipsos fides obstinata adversus alios hostile odium was their character among the heathens the greeks and romans committed and boasted of the most cruel enormities conquered and inslaved innocent nations plundered cities and laid waste kingdoms through this absurd and impious love of their country a principle no better in many of it is consequences than the most horrid and accursed bigotry it had therefore been an essential defect nay rather a mischievous absurdity in the christian religion to have enjoined encouraged or countenanced a partiality unjust in itself to which from views of private advantage mankind must ever be prone and which at the time when christianity began to spread was indeed the reigning and predominant error  but if by zeal for the public and love of our country be meant such a regard to it is welfare as shall induce us to sacrifice every view of private interest for it is accomplishment yet still in subordination to the greater law of universal justice this is naturally nay necessarily involved in the law of universal charity the noble writer indeed affirms it is no essential part of the christians charity on the contrary it is a chief part of the christians charity it comes nobly recommended by the examples of jesus and st paul the one wept over the approaching desolation of his country the other declared his willingness to be cut off from the christian community if by this means he might save his countrymen and that it necessarily arises from the principle of universal love will be evident if we consider the nature and situation of man his nature is such that he inevitably contracts the strongest affection for those with whom he converseth most intimately and whose manners and relations civil and religious are most nearly connected with his own his situation is such that he seldom has an opportunity of doing good offices to any society of men save only those of his own country all others being naturally removed beyond the narrow sphere of private beneficence hence the great precept of universal charity does essentially involve a zeal for the public and love of our country at once it curbs the exorbitance of this natural partiality and carries it to it is full perfection  the necessity of this great regulating principle will further appear if we consider that with regard to the conduct of separate states and kingdoms toward each other no sanctions of human law can ever take place in this respect all nations must ever be in a state of nature there was therefore a more particular necessity on this account of regulating their conduct toward each other by the great law of universal charity  it may seem strange that the noble writer should be ignorant of these truths but after the imputations he has here thrown on christianity it will surely appear more strange that he was not ignorant of them and that these bitter sarcasms were thrown out against the clear convictions of his own mind yet nothing is more evident as will now appear that he understood the nature of christian charity is indisputable he defines it and properly in the note annexed to the passage here referred to in another place he calls it the principle of love the greatest principle of our religion moralists part ii    in a following paragraph he calls it that divine love which our religion teaches ib  but what is of all most remarkable he sets it under the new and whimsical denominations of goodnature and friendship to mankind far above private friendship and love of our country take the passages as they lie in the noble writer can any friendship be so heroic as that toward mankind or particular friendship well subsist without such an enlarged affection ib    again  theocles had almost convinced me that to be a friend to any one in particular twas necessary first to be a friend to mankind ib    lastly and above all and can your country and what is more your kind require less kindness from you or deserve less to be considered than even one of these chancecreatures  o philocles how little do you know the extent and power of goodnature and to what an heroic pitch a soul may rise which knows the through force of it and distributing it rightly frames in itself an equal just and universal friendship ib    here then we see the former paragraph utterly reversed for  universal love is now the only heroic principle and  private friendship and the love of our country are only commendable as they make subordinate parts of it  to this astonishing and wilful perversion of the moral principles of christianity we may add the subsequent part of the same invenomed paragraph for he proceeds to insinuate as if christian charity were no active principle but such as leads it is proselytes to a state of mere contemplation and inaction without regard to social life and the affairs of this lower world we may defy the noble writers most zealous admirers to find any other rational construction for the following passage the christian he says is not obliged to enter into such engagements with this lower world as are of no help to him in acquiring a better his conversation is in heaven nor has he occasion for such supernumerary cares and embarrassments here on earth as may obstruct his way thither or retard him in the careful task of working out his own salvation unexampled prevarication thrown out against that religion which enjoins an active virtue a regard to the present happiness of man in every possible relation as the only way to obtain felicity hereafter against that religion whose founder did not idly harangue in a closet upon beauty virtue and decorum amidst the indolence and pride of life but practiced the divine truths he taught and  went about doing good amongst the meanest and most despised of his fellow citizens  to be unmoved on this occasion were stupidity not to confess it cowardice error should be exposed with calmness but dishonesty merits our abhorrence  yet from these cavils though groundless and misrepresentations though voluntary we may draw an observation which highly recommends christianity we may hence see the superior excellence and dignity of it is moral precepts above the most applauded among the heathen and how nobly by one great principle it rectifies every little partiality to which the human heart is subject for this is clear that in one age or nation friendship has been idolized as the supreme virtue in another hospitality indeed the noble writer pursuing the same kind intention to christianity pretends that the law of hospitality or regard to strangers among the ancient heathens was equivalent nay he gives a very disingenious suggestion as if it was far superior to christian charity such says he was ancient heathen charity and pious duty toward the whole of mankind both those of different nations and different worships misc iii c   in the notes for instances of this he is forced to go back as far as homer who indeed has given us some fine pictures of ancient manners of this kind in his odyssey the noble writer might have found others in no respect inferior in the old testament recorded long before universal charity was ever thought of in the stories of abraham and lot the truth is the guest or stranger was held sacred because he was under the protection of his host it was therefore deemed criminal to violate a trust thus reposed but it happens unfortunately for his lordships argument that in these old times rapine and plunder were as much in vogue as either friendship or hospitality and equally creditable these phantom appearances of virtue are still to be seen in the arabian deserts as frequently as ever if a traveller comes to the door of a wild arabs tent at night he is received with so boundless an hospitality that the host would expose himself his wife and children to certain destruction to save the life of his guest had this hospitable savage met the traveller in the deserts at noon he would have stripped him to the skin and on the least resistance laid him dead at his feet and this was the true extent of the noble writers boasted heathen charity   in a third the love of our country in a fourth enthusiastic contemplation in a fifth the austerities of the hermit in a sixth the external practice of religion in a seventh which is the fashionable peculiarity of our own times occasional acts of humanity and compassion while the more extensive and public views of beneficence are neglected or even derided how different how superior is the great christian principle of universal love which rising gradually by a progress through all the less enlarged affections toward parents children friends country and spreading till it embraces all mankind and every creature that has life forms that perfect virtue in which human weakness is most prone to be defective and which implies and includes every moral perfection christianity alone has kindled in the heart of man this vital principle which beaming there as from a center like the great fountain of light and life that sustains and chears the attendant planets renders it is proselytes indeed  burning and shining lights shedding their kindly influence on all around them in that just proportion which their respective distances may demand  section vii the preceding remarks may sufficiently obviate every cavil of the noble writer against the essential parts of christianity but as his lordship has casually interspersed several random insinuations we must be content to receive them as they happen to appear since they are of that disjointed kind as to be incapable of connection  in a marginal note he gives an account of the migration of the israelites from egypt under the conduct of moses he thinks proper to reject the clear account which the jewish legislator himself gives that they departed in order to worship the true god and preposterously prefers what tacitus and justin have said on that subject who affirm indeed but without proof that the jews were driven out of egypt on account of their leprosy misc ii c   notes  this partiality might of itself appear mysterious enough when we consider the particular and consistent account given us by the very leader of the expedition for what should we think of the man who should prefer the random conjectures of an ignorant modern to xenophons retreat or caesars commentaries but the noble writers partiality will appear still more unaccountable if we consider the following passage of strabo a writer as much beyond tacitus in candor as beyond justin if indeed justin and not trogus pompeius be answerable for this slander in true judgment this author strabo second to none in antiquity speaks thus moses an egyptian priest retreated along with a number of religious followers for he affirmed and taught that the egyptians were mistaken who imaged the deity under the forms of the brutecreation as likewise the libyans and greeks who represented the gods under the human shape he held that alone to be god which comprehends every living creature the earth and sea which is called heaven the world or the universal nature whose image who that is in his right mind would dare to form out of any earthly materials rejecting therefore all use of images he determined to dedicate to him a temple worthy of his nature and worship him without images  on this principle he persuaded and brought over many welldisposed men and led them forth into that country where now jerusalem is built  strabo   xvi    a noble testimony sure from a heathen writer less he could not say if he was well informed and unless he had embraced the jewish religion he could not have said more  there is another passage  misc v c   which discovers somewhat of unfair dealing in the noble writer in the margin he prettily enough criticizes the preface to st lukes gospel but in the text he has paraphrased the evangelists expression in a manner so distant from any thing st luke either wrote or meant as must not a little astonish every candid reader st luke says  it seemed good to him to write in order the things that he knew to which the noble writer adds as there were many it seems long afterward who did and undertook accordingly to write in order and as seemed good to them etc  what shall we say of the noble writer on this occasion why this only that inasmuch as it seemed good to him to interpret this preface of st luke he therefore thought himself at liberty to interpret it as it seemed good to him  there are three more subjects which his lordship has thought fit to represent in the manner which seemed good to him these are first the divine foreknowledge communicated to joseph in the interpretation of pharaohs dreams secondly the rise of bigotry or religious intolerance and persecution thirdly and principally the relation which the jewish institutions bear to the egyptian see misc ii c    in all these the noble writer has employed every art of insinuation and address that he might throw an odium on the mosaic dispensation these passages might well merit a particular consideration had i not been happily prevented by my most learned friend who has fully exposed their weakness in that inestimable treasure of all true knowledge the divine legation of moses thither the reader is reserrd where he will find these questions treated with that reach and mastery so peculiar to the author of that great work with relation to the first of these points see the div leg vol ii p     for the second see ib book ii   for the third see book iv   passim   it may now be necessary to examine the third chapter of the noble writers second miscellany where he makes it his pretense to prove the force of humor in religion of which it may be said that it is the truest piece of randomwork the most genuine farce that is perhaps to be met with in any writer of whatever age or nation he divides it as every farce ought to be divided into three acts in its progress we are carried into a very fairyland of thought if not more properly a confused chaos for first he sets about with great solemnity to prove that wit and humor are corroborative of religion and promotive of true faith to prove this a story is told by which it appears that not wit and humor but good humor or easiness of temper is thus corroborative and promotive then in conclusion wit and humor come in again to overturn all that has been done and show that good humor has suffered itself to be ridiculously imposed upon  though it does not appear that our modern advocates for wit and humor are so nearly interested in their fate as they seem to think themselves yet it must be owned their generosity is so much the more to be applauded in thus pleading the cause of clients who never employed them however taking for granted what seems to be the real foundation of their writings on this subject that talking in praise of wit and humor is a proof of their being possessed of them and that consequently they are parties in the cause i shall not envy the noble writer any mans admiration who may think proper to esteem him a wit on account of the grotesque appearances he assumes throughout this present miscellany it is my intention only to convince the plain reader that this supposed wit is by no means philosophical  the first head therefore he tells us is to make it appear that wit and humor are corroborative of religion and promotive of true faith to this purpose he tires us with a story not the most elegantly planned in my apprehension of a club of merry gentlemen who in a traveling expedition meeting with sorry roads and worse fare laughed themselves into a belief that both roads accommodations and cookery were perfectly good what follows is the moral or application of this curious conceit had i to deal with a malicious reader he might perhaps pretend to infer from this story of my traveling friends that i intended to represent it as an easy matter for people to persuade themselves into what opinion or belief they pleased  now without troubling ourselves to enquire how far this story is a proof of the noble writers fundamental maxim that ridicule is a test of truth let us proceed to the intended moral which seems evidently calculated to throw a false light on religious belief by representing it as the mere effect of prejudice selfimposition and deceit to rescue it therefore from this insinuated calumny we need not deny but insist that the passions false interests and prejudices of mankind must indeed for ever hang as a bias upon their opinions but it must be farther observed too that these passions and false interests will at least as often prejudice them against religion as in its favor it is true there are prejudices in favor of religion arising from education but there are prejudices against it too arising from vicious passions some are sanguine in their hopes and hence while their conduct is virtuous wish and therefore believe religion to be true others are sanguine in their hopes but abandoned in their conduct and therefore live themselves into a belief that religon is false some through a dread of annihilation persuade themselves beyond the strength of evidence others through the prevalence of a suspicious cast of mind reject even what is probable thus passions and prejudices work powerfully indeed but they work both for and against religion it should seem then that the noble writers moral which he aims at religion may with equal force be applied to infidelity for it is but supposing a man given up to vanity or vice and we shall soon see him enter into such a plot as this against his own understanding and endeavor by all possible means to persuade both himself and others of what he thinks convenient and useful to disbelieve it is idle therefore to insist on the prejudices either for or against religion they will both naturally arise and it is the part of reason to control them but we may safely leave it to any ones determination which temper of mind is the most amiable that which entertains prejudices in favor of religion or against it  the noble writer proceeds to his second head but seems at the same time conscious how little it was to any good purpose however in failure of truth and method he again has recourse to what he seems to think wit and humor and which for aught i know may pass for such among his admirers however says he lest i should be charged for being worse than my word i shall endeavor to satisfy my reader by pursuing my method proposed if peradventure he can call to mind what that method was or if he cannot the matter is not so very important but that he may safely pursue his reading without further trouble  but though it was prudently done in the noble writer to throw the subject of his second head into shades yet for the sake of truth we must drag it into light it was therefore to prove that wit and humor are used as the proper means of promoting true faith by the holy founders of religion but when we come to the point for wit and humor by virtue of a certain dexterity of hand the reader is again unexpectedly presented with good humor in their stead this it will be said is nimble dealing but what of that so long as it may tend to disgrace christianity and its founder the noble writers application therefore is still more extraordinary the affection and love which procures a true adherence to the new religious foundation must depend either on a real or counterfeit goodness in the religious founder whatever ambitious spirit may inspire him whatever savage zeal or persecuting principle may lie in reserve roady to disclose itself when authority and power is once obtained the first scene of doctrine however fails not to present us with the agreeable views of joy love meakness gentleness and moderation  to speak my inmost sentiments of this passage it is of too black a nature to deserve a reply there are certain degrees of calumny so flagrant as injured truth disdains to answer and this is of the kind on this occasion therefore we shall leave the noble writer to the reflections of every honest man in conformity to the example of that blessed person  who when he was reviled reviled not again see above   of this essay p       the next circumstance in holy writ that falls under his lordships animadversion is what he calls the famous entry or high dance performed by david in the procession of the sacred coffer in which he has again represented things as it seemed good to him here by confounding ancient with modern manners in such a way as is quite unworthy of his character and suited only to the genius of a coffeehouse freethinker he has endeavored to bring down the solemn procession of a grand religious festival to a level with the merriments of an apish dancing master this representation may very probably pass current among many of his admirers so that it had been necessary to set the matter in its true light but that here too i am happily prevented by a judicious writer who has done all imaginable justice to the argument and effectually exposed the noble writers weakness and insincerity see dr lelands answer to the moral philosopher p     etc   his lordship now proceeds to the story of the prophet jonah which he has burlesqued and turned to farce with that delicacy so peculiar to himself the story itself is indeed authenticated by our saviors mention of it as emblematical of his own death and resurrection its moral is excellent being an illustrious display of the divine mercy to penitent and returning sinners exemplified in gods remitting the punishment denounced and sparing a devoted city on its sincere repentance as also of the frailty and imperfection of the best of men set forth in the prophets behavior on the occasion to this we may add the propriety of the miracle recorded which was itself an extraordinary and most awakening instance of punishment inflicted on disobedience and remitted on repentance and therefore bearing a strong relation to the event for which it was wrought being peculiarly adapted when made known to the ninevites to induce them to hearken to the prophets preaching to believe what he denounced and promised and rouse them at once into a fear of gods justice and a reliance on his mercy  such then being the real nature of the fact the secret of the noble writers polite representation lies in his burlesquing the circumstances of the supposed dialogue between god and the prophet an easy task for any one who is disingenuous or ignorant enough to represent as strictly litteral what is evidently parabolical according to the frequent and known manner of composition in the earliest ages see the div leg vol ii where a full account is given of the origin and progress of this kind of writing  this his lordship seems to have been aware of whatsoever of this kind may be allegorically understood or in the way of parable or fable etc now had he treated the scripture story with the same candor which he affords to other ancient writers he would not have abused this passage in so unworthy a manner a writer of no abilities if provided only with a sufficient quantity of spleen and false conceit might easily ridicule his favorite piece the judgment of hercules and to a raw imagination disgrace that instructive fable by burlesquing the supposed conference between the goddesses and the hero virgil has in fact been so served and if works of mere invention and of the heroic kind studiously contrived to avoid every thing low obscure or equivocal are subject to this abuse can we wonder if the succinct history of an ancient fact recording the dispensations of providence a matter very obscure in itself and relative to ancient manners so distant from our own should be liable to the false and dishonest lights of buffoonry we may further observe that the noble writers ridicule sometimes falls on divine providence itself his tutor had good eyes and a long reach he overtook the renegade at sea etc  could an epicurean have used more indecent language  his lordship goes on to ridicule the descriptions narrations expressions and phrases of holy scripture but these we shall pass over at present as they will deserve a separate consideration he touches once more on the patriarch abraham and they who are curious enough to look for the objection may find a full answer to it in the place here referred to div leg vol ii p   0   the next and only remaining circumstance worthy of notice in this miscellany is a pretended translation from plutarch in which the noble writer deals as honorably by that author as before by gorgias or aristotle see above essay i ix  but here too i am prevented by the learned phileleutherus lipsiensis however as his lordships conduct is remarkable on this occasion it may not be improper to exhibit a view of it in the great critics words who it must be owed has chastised the noble writer somewhat roughly and aristarchuslike  he mr collins quotes the place as it is translated forsooth in the characteristics a book writ by an anonymous but whoever he is a very whimsical and conceited author o wretched grecians  so that author renders plutarch who bring into religion that frightful mien of sordid and vilifying devotion illfavored humiliation and contrition abject looks and countenances consternations prostrations disfigurations and in the act of worship distortions constrained and painful postures of the body wry faces beggarly tones mumpings grimaces cringings and the rest of this kind  thus far that nameless opiniatre and our worthy writer mr collins introduces it with a grave air that plutarch thus satirizes the public forms of devotion which yet are such as in almost all countries pass for the true worship of god  this would partly be true if those were really the words of plutarch but as not one syllable of them is found there what must we think of this couple of corrupters and forgers there is nothing in all this but their own disfigurations and distortions of the original their own mumpings and beggarly tones while they pretend to speak in plutarchs voice  plutarch having observed that superstition alone allows no ease nor intermission even in sleep their dreams adds he do as much torment them then as their waking thoughts did before they seek for expiations of those visions nocturnal charms sulfurations dippings in the sea sittings all day on the ground o greeks inventors of barbarian ills whose superstition has devised rowlings in the mire and in the kennels dippings in the sea grovelings and throwings upon the face deformed sittings on the earth absurd and uncouth adorations this is a verbal interpretation of that place  and now i dare ask the reader if he has seen a more flagrant instance of unfaithfulness and forgery than this of our two writers humiliation and contrition known words in your english liturgy are to be traduced here under plutarchs name where do those and their other phrases appear in the original or where do the rites he really speaks of appear in your form of worship who among you roll themselves in mire or wallow in kennels a ceremony fit only to be enjoined to such crackbrained and scandalous writers phil lipsiens p   0 etc   the remaining part of this random essay is so completely vague and unintelligible that although it be evidently designed as a continued sneer at christianity it is impossible to pick so much as an objection or even an idea out of it it is therefore below criticism to conclude when i see the noble writer debase himself in this strange manner exercising at once the lowest derision and inflicting the deadliest wounds on religion and christianity i must own the appearance he makes call up to my imagination a remark of his own that there cannot be a sight more shocking and contemptible than that of a man acting at once the part of a merryandrew and an executioner wit and h part i iii   it may be necessary finally to obviate his lordships perpetual sneer at the mysteries of our religion these when particular topics fail him are the standing objects of his raillery to cite particular passages of this kind were needless because they are innumerable the plain implication of all his gross banter is that because in the christian dispensation there are some things which surpass human comprehension christianity is therefore absurd and ridiculous  with regard to this cavil therefore it is not my intention to insist on proving the difference between things being above reason and things being contrary to reason or that propositions may be true though they are above our reason so long as they are not contrary to it full enough has been said on this subject and by no body better than by the excellent mr boil it is a question of more importance to decide why any thing mysterious should be admitted into a religion revealed for the use of man and in answer to this we need only observe that revealed religion being designed for mans use its essential doctrines are plain intelligible to all accommodated to the nature and faculties of the human kind but as this system not only reveals to us our duty but all motives too which may induce us to practice it so in order to enforce these and convince us of the truth of their divine original it was necessary that a history of providence or gods dispensation should be revealed along with them hence something mysterious must needs arise unless you suppose man infinite in knowledge for as this system reveals to us several particulars so far as they stand connected with piety and morals which relate to the nature of god the state of other and superior beings the original condition of man the interposition of providence for his redemption the change of his nature and faculties through the future periods of his existence in all which circumstances his present reach of thought could give him no information it is evident that in these accounts many subjects must be touched upon and other systems of being occasionally glanced at the full knowledge of which must be far beyond his present comprehension now so far as these truths and facts though imperfectly revealed have any tendency to enlighten his mind as to the general plan of providence or stand connected in any other manner with religion and virtue so as to encourage and promote them they must surely be admitted as circumstances of great propriety and use or even supposing some of them to be of none yet if they stand so essentially connected with others which are so that the one cannot be destroyed without the other this very circumstance of essential union effectually destroys every objection against their being of divine original  there may be likewise and undoubtedly are some few mysteries of another kind in the mosaic dispensation such i mean as may seem to some apprehensions not so easily reconcilable to the moral attributes of god of which kind there are some too in the constitution of the natural world now here in revelation as in nature it is the part of human reason to acquiesce in this mysterious and unknown part from what is clear and known see above iv of this essay  of this kind perhaps is the expulsion of the canaanites under joshua which the noble writer has taken such pains to vilify advice p iii iii  he might with as much reason insult the creator for the admission of storm famine or pestilence for as in nature so in revealed religion we are not to judge of the whole constitution or dispensation of things from small and seeming exceptions on the contrary it is the part of wisdom to determine concerning these seeming exceptions from a full view of the whole dispensation if this evidently tend to good the unprejudiced enquirer into nature and revelation attributes the doubt and darkness which may involve any particular part to his own incapacity and ignorance and justly for as the noble writer has told us on this very occasion in an infinity of things thus relative a mind which sees not infinitely can see nothing fully mor part ii iv   let us therefore while as yet we see but as through a glass and darkly contemplate the works of god with reverence and submission let us wait the happier hour when we shall know even as we are known when we shall be raised to a more enlarged comprehension of our creators immense designs and the whole intelligent creation shall join in confessing and adoring the unerring rectitude of all his dispensations  section viii hitherto we have seen the noble writer buffooning and disgracing christianity from a false representation of its material part we shall now consider what he has thrown out against the composition style and manner of the sacred scriptures for on this too he has thought it expedient to point his raillery  he tells us in the ironical tone that the scriptural descriptions narrations expressions and phrases are in themselves many times exceedingly pleasant entertaining and facetious  that our saviors style  his parables similies comparisons  his exhortations to his disciples the images under which he often couches his morals and prudential rules  carry with them a certain festivity alacrity and good humor so remarkable that i should look upon it as impossible not to be moved in a pleasant manner at their recital misc ii c    to these general cavils he has added a simile in another miscellany which as is usual with all fanciful writers is to stand for an argument he says it is no otherwise in the grammatical art of characters and painted speech than in the art of painting itself i have seen in certain christian churches an ancient piece or two affirmed on the solemn faith of priestly tradition to have been angelically and divinely wrought by a supernatural hand and sacred pencil had the piece happened to be of a hand like raphaels i could have found nothing certain to oppose to this tradition but having observed the whole style and manner of the pretended heavenly workmanship to be so indifferent as to vary in many particulars from the truth of art i presumed within myself to beg pardon of the tradition and assert confidently that if the pencil had been heavenguided it could never have been so lame in it is performance misc v c    this ingenious conceit in the subsequent paragraph he very clearly though slyly applies to the holy scriptures  it is the province of wit to form comparisons of philosophy to detect their weakness when they are obtruded on us as a test of truth on examination therefore i will venture to say the noble writers parallel will be found highly irregular and defective  for there is an essential difference between paintings and writing both in their end and execution paintings with regard to their end are things of mere amusement and taste consequently all their value lies in the exquisiteness of the art and the fine hand of the master it is likewise a species of art that lies chiefly among the few the bulk of mankind or in the noble writers more elegant phrase the mere vulgar being incapable through a want of leisure of gaining any proficiency in this taste or of acquiring that curious discernment in ordonnance drawing and coloring which is at once the pride and pleasure of the virtuosotribe  but with respect to language the affair is otherwise it is ends are various from the four different kinds of literary composition as explained above see essay i    there must arise a correspondent variety of style the poetical the oratorial the historical and didactic the first of these kinds alone partakes of the nature of picture and therefore can alone be properly compared with it as they are both referred to the imagination for the end of pleasure the other three species of composition tending chiefly to utility by the means of persuasion or instruction draw their prime value from plainness clearness and precision from being adapted not to the taste of the fastidious critic but to the capacities of those who are the intended objects of persuasion or instruction here then the noble writers parallel is essentially defective since it was the intention of providence in the sacred scriptures to condescend to what his lordships quality and refined wisdom entitle him to disdain even to instruct the mere vulgar whereas the end of painting is only the amusement of the few  in regard to the execution we shall find as wide a difference there is in philosophical strictness but one unvaryd language or style in painting which is such a modification of light or colors as may imitate whatever objects we find in nature this consists not in the application of arbitrary signs but has it is foundation in the senses and reason of mankind and is therefore the same in every age and nation but in the literary style or language the matter is far otherwise for language being the voluntary application of arbitrary signs according to the consent of different men and nations there is no single uniform model of nature to be followed hence gracefulness or strength of style harmony or softness copious expression terse brevity or contrasted periods have by turns gained the approbation of particular countries now all these supposed beauties of speech are relative local and capricious and consequently unworthy the imitation of a divine artist who to fit the speech he ordains to the great work of universal instruction would we may reasonably suppose strip it of every local peculiar and grotesque ornament and convey it unaccompanyd by all but the more universal qualities common to every tongue  the noble writer then might with some show of reason have objected to the style of scripture had the writers boasted it is elegance as mahomet did that of his koran and defied all his opposers to write any thing approaching it in this respect but the sacred penmen discover no design or desire of excelling as fine writers on the contrary st paul says they came not with the power of human speech and gives a reason for it which does honor to his mission  though this scrutiny alone might be sufficient to detect and discredit the wantonness of the noble writers comparison yet it will further lead us to a full disclosure of the truth by showing that to be the peculiar characteristic of the scripture composition which has ever held the first rank among the qualities of human writings i mean that of unadorned simplicity  as much has been said by many writers on the subject of simplicity with very little precision and particularly by the noble writer who seems to separate the simple manner from the sublime as if they were incompatible advice part ii    and indeed in his own compositions preposterously deserts the one when ever he attempts the other see the moralists passim  it may be necessary here to fix the idea of a just simplicity this may be said to consist in truth and weight of sentiment clothed in such images and style as may most effectually convey it to the readers mind if any of these circumstances be wanting if the sentiment be false or tristing if the images or style be such as tend rather to fix the attention on themselves than on the sentiment they are employed to convey the just simplicity is destroyed this as might be proved by a large induction of particulars is the circumstance in which the best critics of antiquity placed the supreme excellence of writing and in this use of the term it appears that not only the familiar the narrative the didactic but the pathetic and sublime manner too are so far from being inconsistent with simplicity that they are then only in their perfection when founded on it  it is true indeed that the sacred records are as the noble writer calls them  multifarious and of different characters varying according to the situation intention and natural capacity of the writers misc v c    yet amidst all this variety of manner the reigning quality of simplicity is so uniform and conspicuous that the boldest enemy of christianity will not be forward to hazard the credit of his taste by calling it in question  if we examine them in this light we shall find that according to the division made above essays i    they consist of four different kinds the poetic oratorial historical and didactic forms the poetic lies chiefly in the book of psalms of job and several detached passages in the prophets particularly of isaiah they contain many noble efforts of unmixed poetry or pure imitation yet these being all centered in one intention that of extolling the works and celebrating the power wisdom and goodness of the deity do generally partake of the character of eloquence being chiefly of the lyric kind see essay i    in all these the great character of simplicity is so strongly predominant that every attempt to embellish them by adding the supernumerary decorations of style in translation has ever been found to weaken and debase them  as to the oratorial or pathetic parts innumerable might be produced equal if not superior to any recorded by profane antiquity in these the leading character of simplicity is no less remarkable our saviors parables and exhortations are generally admirable in this quality filled with unfeigned compassion for the weakness and miseries of man they breathe nothing but the purest benevolence st pauls last conversation with his friends at ephesus on his departure for jerusalem acts c xx  his discourses on the resurrection and on charity his reproofs his commendations his apologies especially that before agrippa ib c xxvi  are wrote in the noblest strain of simplicity and as a perfect model of this kind we may give the story of joseph and his brethren which for tenderness true pathos and unmixed simplicity is beyond compare superior to any thing that appears in ancient story  but as the most important part of scripture lies in the historical and preceptive part especially in the new testament whence chiefly our idea of duty must be drawn so we find this uniform and simple manner eminently prevailing throughout in every precept and narration the history is conveyed in that artless strain which alone could adapt it to the capacities of all mankind the precepts delivered by our savior are drawn from the principles of common sense improved by the most exalted love of god and man and either expressed in clear and direct terms or couched under such images and allusions as are every where to be found in nature such as are and must ever be universally known and familiar to all mankind see newton on daniel  mr jortins discourses  dr laws life of christ  in which we may further observe his manner of teaching was greatly superior even to the noble writers justly applauded socrates who for the most part drew his images and allusions from the less known arts and manners of the city though indeed not without reason he did not aim at the instruction of mankind but of the more literate part of his fellow citizens his proper end was rather reforming the minds of those who had been ill taught than instructing those who had never learnt to return through all this variety of striking allusion and moral precept the style ever continues the same unadorned simple and even by the noble writers own confession  vehement and majestic misc ii c    yet never drawing the readers attention on itself but on the divine sentiments it conveys  to this we may further add that these several kinds of composition are mixed and united with such propriety and force as is scarce to be equalled in any other writings the poetical parts are heightened by the great strokes of eloquence and precept the pathetick by the noblest imagery and justest morals and the preceptive is strengthened and enforced by all the aids of poetry eloquence and parable calculated at once to engage the imagination to touch the passions and command the reason of mankind  it is true this unadorned simplicity so conspicuous in the scripture composition has often given offense to puerile critics the noble writer has but revived the objection it was weakly urged by celsus in the infancy of the christian religion origin contra cells   vii  at the period when letters revived in europe the florid taste was so prevalent in italy under the pontificate of leo the tenth that the composition of the scriptures was on this account held in general contempt and one of the fine gentlemen in literature cardinal pietro bembo  of those days is known to have declared that he dared not to read the bible lest it should endanger his style we may easily form judgment of the taste of that age from this one circumstance that their most elaborate and celebrated compositions were all wrote in a dead language for thus they became mere imitators even to a degree of servility and it is sufficient for the defenders of the bible to observe that along with it every other great model of ancient writing fell into the same disgrace at the abovementioned period while the general taste and attention was turned from weight of sentiment and strength of image and expression to the local and capricious decorations of style and language but the reign of this false taste was of short duration so that for a long time past the comparative merit of ancient writers has been weighed in a juster scale  now if we examine the writers whose composition has stood the test of ages and obtained that highest honor the concurrent approbation of distant times and nations we shall find that the character of simplicity is the unvarying circumstance which alone has been able to gain this universal homage from mankind among the greeks whose writers in general are of the simple kind the divinest poet homer  the most commanding orator demosthenes  the finest historian xenophon  and deepest philosopher aristotle  are above the rest conspicuously eminent in this great quality the roman writers rise toward perfection according to that measure of true simplicity which they mingle in their works indeed they are all inferior to the greek models but who will deny that lucretius horace virgil livy terence tully are at once the simplest and best of roman writers unless we add the noble annalist tacitus  who appeared in after times who notwithstanding the political turn of his genius which sometimes interferes is admirable in this great quality and by it far superior to his contemporaries it is this one circumstance that has raised the venerable dante the father of modern poetry above the succeeding poets of his country who could never long maintain the local and temporary honors bestowed upon them but have fallen under that just neglect which time will ever decree to those who desert a just simplicity for the florid colorings of style contrasted phrases affected conceits the mere trappings of composition and gothic minutiae it is this has given to boileau the most lasting wreath in france to shakespeare and milton in england especially to the last whose writings are more unmixed in in this respect and who had formed himself entirely on the simple model of the best greek writers and the sacred scriptures mr dryden somewhere observes that milton never sinks so far below himself as when he falls on some track of scripture it is equally true that he never rises so far above himself as when he falls on some track of scripture it is easy to guess what was the drift of mr drydens remark but the observations made above  essay i   will easily reconcile these seeming contradictions when milton adopts the poetical parts of scripture he rises above himself but by an injudicious application of the historical or didactic parts he often falls indeed  this naturally leads us to an observation on mr humes essay  on simplicity and refinement in writing he has attempted to fix a certain union of these two qualities which he says constitutes the most perfect form of composition it were to be wished he had given us some better reasons in support of this opinion which itself seems to be a mere refinement the progress of his argument is remarkable  he draws all his instances from poets and having given some examples of poets who are both simple and unpoetical in the extreme he arbitrarily throws the censure on the too great degree of simplicity instead of fixing it where he ought viz on the too great mixture of the historical oratorial or argumentative species in proof of this we need only allege the examples of homer pindar and callimachus where simplicity and at the same time sublimity and the true poetic forms are in their last perfection thus all he proves is that a poet ought not to be unpoetical  next he puts virgil and racine on a level as having attained the nearest to this imagined union of simplicity and refinement here he obliges us again to call his taste in question for every page of racine is full of turns both of phrase and sentiment whereas we scarce meet with three instances of this kind in all virgils writings  he then gives us his idea of simplicity those compositions which have the recommendation of simplicity have nothing surprising in the thought when divested of that elegance of expression and harmony of numbers with which it is clothed  from these extraordinary premises we are naturally prepared to expect his conclusion that catullus and parnel are his favorite authors     as it appears from these instances that simplicity is the only universal characteristic of just writing so the superior eminence of the sacred scriptures in this prime quality has been generally acknowledged one of the greatest critics in antiquity himself conspicuous in the sublime and simple manner has born this testimony to the writings of moses and st paul longinus  and by parity of reason we must conclude that had he been conversant with the other sacred writers his taste and candor would have allowed them the same encomium  but we need not have recourse to authorities for the proof of the superior weight and dignity of the sacred scriptures in this great quality it is evident to demonstration from the following circumstance it has been often observed even by writers of no mean rank that the scriptures suffer in their credit by the disadvantage of a literal version while other ancient writings enjoy the advantage of a free and embellished translation but in reality these gentlemens concern is illplaced and groundless for the truth is that most other writings are indeed impaired by a literal translation whereas giving only a due regard to the idioms of different languages the sacred writings when literally translated are then in their full perfection now this is an internal proof that in all other writings there is a mixture of local relative exterior ornament which is often lost in the transfusion from one language to another but the internal beauties which depend not on the particular construction of tongues no change of tongue can destroy hence the biblecomposition preserves its native beauty and strength alike in every language by the sole energy of unadorned phrase natural images weight of sentiment and great simplicity  it is in this respect like a rich vein of gold which under the severest trials of heat cold and moisture retains its original weight and splendour without either loss or alloy while baser metals are corrupted by earth air water fire and assimilated to the various elements through which they pass  this circumstance then may be justly regarded as sufficient to vindicate the composition of the sacred scriptures as it is at once their chief excellence and greatest security it is their excellence as it renders them intelligible and useful to all it is their security as it prevents their being disguised by the false and capricious ornaments of vain or weak translators  we may safely appeal to experience and fact for the confirmation of these remarks on the superior simplicity utility and excellence of the style of holy scripture is there any book in the world so perfectly adapted to all capacities that contains such sublime and exalting precepts conveyed in such an artless and intelligible strain that can be read with such pleasure and advantage by the lettered sage and the unlettered peasant to whom then would the noble writer send mankind for religious and moral instruction to the divine plato it may be supposed or more probably to the inraptured strains of philocles and theocles and sure mankind must reap much instruction and advantage from the puffed epithets and sustian style of a philosophical romance we may reasonably hope indeed soon to see nay do we not already see the happy effects of this high discipline for in fact the noble writers characteristics are now the standing oracle in the office the shop nay as i am informed sometimes even in the coblers stall we need not wonder therefore that in these new habitations of taste sublimed phrase and abstruse philosophy the simple strains of the gospel are damned and discarded  to return then to the noble writers comparison if indeed we have departed from it these united observations may convince us that the only circumstance in painting which can with any propriety be compared to literary style is that of coloring and on this principle we may farther confirm all that has been said on the superior excellence of the simple manner for it is well known and the noble writer knew it that while the masters in this fine art confined the pencil to the genuine forms of grace and greatness and only superadded to these the temperate embellishments of a chastised and modest coloring the art grew toward its perfection but no sooner was their attention turned from truth simplicity and design to the gaudy decorations of a rich and luscious coloring than their credit declined with their art and the experienced eye which contemplates the old pictures with admiration surveys the modern with indifference or contempt  to conclude we see there are two kinds of composition essentially opposed to each other the one turns the attention on itself the other on the truths it conveys the first may be justly compared to a sunbeam playing on the surface of the water which attracts and dazzles the beholders eye by its own useless splendour the last is like a sunbeam darting to the bottom which while itself is unseen or unobserved communicates its brightness and illumines every object on which it falls  how far the first of these may belong to to the noble writer let others determine it is sufficient to have proved that the last is the unvaried style and manner of the sacred scriptures  section ix it would have been strange had his lordship emptied so much of his gall on christianity without bestowing a share on its ministers it may therefore be expected that something should be said on his treatment of the english clergy  so far as his spirit of satire may have been provoked by the persecuting and intolerant principles of some of the clergy in his time it is highly commendable it matters not in what rank order or profession the enemies of freedom may appear what shape or pretense soever they may assume it is a work of true charity to stigmatize and disgrace them as the enemies of mankind  but it appears too evidently that the noble writers spleen arose from another foundation for his satire is not so often pointed against them as being the enemies of freedom as the friends of christianity with a view of disgracing them in this regard he has ridiculed and abused their writings their preaching and even their persons it will only be necessary to select a few instances of this kind from an infinite number in all which the delicacy of the raillery is so conspicuous as to need no illustration  in his soliloquy he has paid his compliments to the writings of the clergy under the title of candidates for authorship of the sanctified kind these he says may be termed a sort of pseudoascetics who can have no real converse either with themselves or with heaven  and although the books of this sort by a common idiom are called good books the authors for certain are a sorry race   a saintauthor of all men least values politeness  he is above the consideration of that which in a narrow sense we call manners nor is he apt to examine any other faults than those which he calls sins solil part i     thus he deals with the clergy when they are dull enough to write seriously on the most interesting subjects but if any of the order happens to fall into a gayer turn of composition the charge is renewed under another form then the burlesque divinity grows mightily in vogue and the cried up answers to heterodox discourses are generally such as are written in drollery  joy to the reverend authors who can afford to be thus gay and condescend to correct us in this laywit misc v c     their preaching is another standing subject of derision and ridiculed they must be whether they divide their discourse or divide it not if the first then the following stroke of raillery is prepared for them come we now as our authentic rhetoricians express themselves to our second head misc ii c    if the latter then our religious pastors have changed their manner of distributing to us their spiritual food  they have run into the more savory way of learned ragout and medley the elegant courtdivine exhorts in miscellany and is ashamed to bring his twos and threes before a fashionable assembly misc ii c     the defenders of christianity are baited in their turn for example let a zealous divine and flaming champion of our faith when inclined to show himself in print make choice of some tremendous mystery of religion opposed heretofore by some damnable heresiarch  a ring is made and readers gather in abundance every one takes party and encourages his own side  this shall be my champion  this man for my money  well hit on our side  again a good stroke  there he was even with him  have at him next bout  excellent sport misc i c     the same familiar elegance of composition joined with a surprising effort in the noble writers own sublime runs through the following paragraph where he compares a controversy in divinity to a match at football so have i known a crafty glazier in time of frost procure a football to draw into the street the emulous chiefs of the robust youth the tumid bladder bounds at every kick bursts the withstanding casements the chassys lanterns and all the brittle vitreous ware the noise of blows and outcries fills the whole neighborhood and the ruins of glass cover the stony pavements till the bloated battering engine subdued by force of foot and fist and yielding up its breath at many a fatal cranny becomes lank and harmless sinks in its flight and can no longer uphold the spirit of the contending parties misc i c     not content with these severe strokes of raillery the noble writer prepares a more deadly blow at the clergy even no less than ruining their fortunes among the fairsex and here the discerning reader will readily guess that his ridicule must be needs levelled at their persons he introduces or drags in the story of othello and desdemona represents the one as a miraculous storyteller the other as a credulous hearer he then adds but why the poet amongst his greek names should have chosen one which denoted the lady superstitious i cannot imagine unless as poets are sometimes prophets too he should figuratively under this dark type have represented to us that about a hundred years after his time the fair sex of this island should by other monstrous tales be so seduced as to turn their favor chiefly on the taletellers and change their natural inclination for fair candid and courteous knights into a passion for a mysterious race of black enchanters solil part ii     i cannot think this elegant passage deserves a particular reply it is supposed the noble writer designed it only as a proof that the saintauthor of all men least values politeness as a proof how incapable he was of violating his own rule or exercising any degree of that gross sort of raillery which is so offensive in good company wit and h part i     indeed all the delicate paragraphs here cited are much of the same nature and afford an undeniable proof how great a master his lordship was in the true refined manner of attic wit i shall only add that if according to the noble writers projected scheme of confutation the english clergy should ever be baited in the way of puppetshow at bart l mewfair i would recommend the above passages with many parallel ones in the characteristics to the managers of the drama as being admirably suited to the genius of their wooden drole whether he should choose to swagger in the sock or strut in the buskin  were the clergy disposed to return these compliments in kind it may be questioned whether his lordships admirers would acquit them of coarse manners but however some of that body may blindly hate and others as blindly admire the author of the characteristics yet the best and wisest of the profession so far as i have been able to learn from their conversation would probably rather choose to return his salutations in the following manner  notwithstanding the superior airs of contempt which on all occasions yourlordship is pleased to assume we cannot think you of such ability as you seem to appear in your own eyes neither can we think this overweening opinion of your self this disdain of all who adopt not your peculiar tenets is any proof of real wisdom since yourself have taught us to believe that as we grow wiser we shall prove less conceited though we scorn to revile you yet we judge ourselves well entitled to tell you the truth on every subject we regard therefore a fine imagination an extensive knowledge and a commanding judgment as three qualities independent of each other in the first we think you eminent in the second considerable in the last we must be excused if we think you neither eminent nor considerable and on this account we can allot you no high rank in the scale of true genius suitable to this your taste in arts is much superior to your talents for philosophy the only chain of reasoning you have exhibited is found in your enquiry concerning virtue nor is even this fastened to the throne of truth but hangs trembling from a shadowy and aerial fabric blown up by a sportive imagination you have indeed obtained the character of an original writer in philosophy how little you deserve this must needs be known to all who are versed in the greek schools for thence the rational part of your system is chiefly drawn what you borrow you often embellish sometimes disguise never strengthen but when you attempt to become original you only convince us how ill qualified you are for such a task accordingly we find in the general turn of your writings meagre sentiments studiously adorned by a glare of words and a waste of imagery with these you amuse the common reader like the unqualified painter who unable to reach the beauties of a just and vigorous expression covers a lifeless figure with gaudy draperies and we cannot but think that had you studied the writings of that great and excellent man whom you so weakly deride mr lock see advice etc part iii    your volumes whatever they had lost in bulk would have gained in weight and splendour  with regard to the buffoonries which you have occasionally exercised on christianity in what you call your random essays they are so much below the character of the philosopher that it is matter of surprise to us that you could think they can become the man of wit it is true among those whom you most despise the mere vulgar they have gained you the character of an inimitable author among readers of that rank who are ready to swallow any low drollery or jest among those whom you have elsewhere described who while they pretend to such a scrutiny of other evidences are the readiest to take the evidence of the greatest deceivers in the world their own passions mor p ii    but whatever these passages may be in their consequences we cannot but think them in their own nature even contemptible for to use your own attic phrase to twitch snap snub up or banter to torture sentences and phrases and turn a few expressions into ridicule is not sufficient to constitute what is properly esteemed a writer misc v c    on this account we look upon these boasted passages in your book to be of that kind which are calculated only  to create diversion to those who look no further misc i c    and in which as you elsewhere observe the most confused head if fraught with a little invention and provided with commonplacebook learning may exert itself to as much advantage as the most orderly and wellsettled judgment ibid  we cannot therefore express any esteem either for the scurrilities of the coarse jester or the trim delicacy and selfadmiration of the literary narc issus  but my lord there lies a heavier charge against you than that of bad writing we mean the indecency and immorality of your conduct in your manner of attacking christianity you would be thought a lover of your country yet you pour contempt upon its laws and institutions you allow the propriety of a religious establishment yet you take every occasion to deride it you contend for a public leading in religion yet you perpetually insinuate that mankind are led by the nose you say the public ought not to be insulted to its face yet your writings are one continued insult upon its opinions our excellent and unrivaled constitution allows a perfect freedom of enquiry had you then argued ingennously and fairly against christianity without attempting ridicule whatever opinion we might have entertained of your head we might at least have thought favorably of your heart but in direct opposition to this rule you always ridicule scarce ever argue you endeavor to instill illegal opinions without bringing any evidence to support either their usefulness or truth you give these crude buffoonries to the world in print and is not this insulting the public to its face  in this instance we must think you a bad citizen and to be ranked among those whom a writer by no means prejudiced in favor of religion thus justly stigmatizes who i hardly know for what end have written against the religion of their country and without pretending to substitute any thing better or more practicable in its place would deprive us of our happy establishment merely as it should seem for the pleasure of pulling down and doing mischief enquiry into homers life and writings    besides this my lord we must take the liberty to say that you betray such frequent marks of insincerity and designed misrepresentation in your treatment of christianity as but ill consists with that reverence which you owe to truth and to yourself such as becomes not a man much less a man whom the public consent has distinguished by the title of right honorable  what your particular motives may have been to this treatment of christianity you best know the most excusable temptation to this strange conduct that we can assign must have been the natural prevalence of spleen for as you observe all splenetic people have a necessary propensity to criticism and satire  the spirit of satire rises with the ill mood and the chief passion of men thus diseased and thrown out of good humor is to find fault censure unravel confound and leave nothing without exception and controversy misc ii c     far be it from us to derogate from your private virtues though we cannot but wish that in your treatment of christianity you had given better proofs of that universal charity which you so warmly profess even while you are reviling that religion where alone it is to be found  there is another circumstance that sure the more humane part of your admirers would hesitate upon we mean that extreme contempt you express for those you call the mere vulgar your regard seems solely centered in establishing your peculiar system among those you call men of fashion and breeding while you give up the vulgar that is to speak with due reverence of the works of god the bulk of your fellow creatures as a proper prey to the supposed delusions and tyranny of those whom you brand as the enemies of mankind how this contempt for the greatest part of your species can consist with true virtue or charity we are at a loss to comprehend it is certain christianity would have taught you otherwise nay my lord a great roman as much your superior in station as in genius and active virtue would have told you that true goodness extends itself to the multitude that virtue is not disdainful or proud but regards all ranks of men and consults their welfare which it could not do if it despised the vulgar cicero lael  christianity has nobly heightened this principle and recommends the weak the poor the ignorant as the proper objects not only of our charity but instruction and however mortifying it may be to proud minds we must say that we frequently meet with men in the lower ranks of life sometimes even in cities often in cottages who when instructed in the principles of true christianity are superior in knowledge worth and happiness to those who hold them in contempt  with regard to your treatment of ourselves it gives us no concern for in one word calumnies thrown on whole bodies of men are unmeaning and selfconfuted you may therefore proceed in your invectives bestowing as free language of that kind as your charity and superior breeding will permit you may liberally deal your courtly compliments and salutations in what dialect you think fit since for our own part neither the the names of bigots impostors pedants formalists gladiatorian penmen flaming champions of the faith black tribe or black enchanters names bestowed on the english clergy throughout the characteristics  will in the least scandalize us while the sentence comes only from the enemies of our master on the contrary we rather strive with ourselves to suppress whatever vanity might naturally arise in us from such favor bestowed for whatever may in the bottom be intended us by such a treatment it is impossible for us to term it other than favor since there are certain enmities which it will be ever esteemed a real honor to have merited see misc v c     you have indeed wisely and artfully endeavored to intimidate us from exposing the folly of your insults on religion and christianity by representing such an attempt as being in itself contemptible for thus you are pleased to speak it must be owned that when a writer of any kind is so considerable as to deserve the labor and pains of some shrewd heads to refute him in public he may in the quality of an author be justly congratulated on that occasion it is supposed necessarily that he must have writ with some kind of ability or wit misc i c    to obviate this remark is the only further trouble we shall give your lordship on the present occasion and here without any particular application to yourself we must beg leave to offer the plain reason why we think your observation however plausible and commonly received is yet entirely groundless indeed with regard to writings of mere speculation or criticism which affect not the happiness of mankind if authors write ill they are despised and forgotten at least as the satirist observes they ought to be so quel demon vous irrite and vous port a medire un livre vous deplait qui vous force a le lire laissiz mourir un fat dans son obscurite un auteur ne peut il pourrir  surete boileau sat ix  and on this account many parts of the characteristics will probably pass for ever uncensured by us  but there are other kinds of bad writing which will ever bid fair to live and be admired we mean such as minister to the low passions and vices of mankind among which ridicule on religion is of all others the most favorite topic and even where these affections do not prevail the generality of men through the weakness of nature are easily misled in matters even of the nearest concernment by sophistry or buffoonry by a hint a sarcasm or an allusion now in this case it is surely a proper and rational though perhaps no easy task to detect misrepresentation and lead mankind back again to the paths of truth and happiness for the effects of ridicule on the mind resemble those of venom on the body which though struck into the blood by a puny reptile may yet demand nay even baffle the power of the strongest medicines how then can you affirm that an effect of this kind  implies either ability or wit if buffoonry and sophistry can do the business and that they may we have your lordships full acknowledgment for to adopt and conclude with your own expression in the same manner as a malicious censure craftily worded and pronounced with assurance is apt to pass with mankind for shrewd wit so a virulent or a visionary maxim in bold expressions though without any justness of thought is readily received for true philosophy moralists p ii     finis errata page    l   for emerge read immerge p     l penult for enjoying read enjoining
