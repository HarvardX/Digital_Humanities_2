the maid of the oaks a new dramatic entertainment as it is performed at the theater royal in drury lane   nec dulces amores sperne puer neque tu choreas donec virenti canities abest morosa hor london printed for t becket the corner of the adelphi in the strand bookseller to their royal highnesses the prince of wales bishop of osnabrug prince william and prince edward mdcclxxiv price one shilling and sixpence  preface the author of the following scenes fully sensible how much he owes to the talents of the actor the musician and the painter can derive no confidence from the success of the representation when he delivers them over to the judgment of the closet but deficient as he may be in the execution of this essay he cannot submit to be thought ignorant in the principles of dramatic writing and would willingly premise the origin and progress of his design as an explanation if not a justification of some of its imperfections  every one may remember how much the fete champetre given by a noble lord last summer engaged the public curiosity it was thought that to preserve for a more general display an entertainment of so singular and elegant a kind would be not only pleasing to the public but serviceable to the polite arts accordingly permission having been obtained to employ the music and to copy some of the decorations a plan was projected for adapting them to the stage  the fable by the means of which they were to be introduced being only the secondary object and the intention then to confine the representation to two acts a plot of the utmost simplicity was judged the most proper and in that decision the author rests upon the example of moliere and many of the best critics of perhaps the best age in theatrical history who in pieces of this nature though they introduced characters of comedy purposely avoided in several instances those intricacies and combinations of incidents which generally but perhaps falsely are supposed essential to a regular drama  it is not the business of this preface to draw a parallel between the english and french stages but it may not be out of place just to touch the characters of each provided it be permitted to lay shakespeare out of the question he stands single and inimitable his excellencies cannot be weighed because it is impossible to counterballance the scale without appeal therefore to his almost supernatural powers we may pronounce the properties of our stage whether considered in tragedy or comedy to consist in energy spirit sublimity force of character and of expression  like the hercules of farnese all is muscle and nerve  with equal truth it must be confessed that a few examples excepted and those not much in the course of acting at present we must turn to france to find the graces of the apollo  art regularity elegance delicacy touches of sentiment adapted only to the most polished manners distinguish their theaters in literary warfare we call their compositions insipid they describe ours as barbarous  both are unjust  all will agree that to blend strength and refinement would be to attain perfection  no candid reader will suppose the author of this piece means to infer that he has in any degree accomplished this union in the part which has fallen to his share but he will be bold to say it is the only part which has been wanting to complete a species of entertainment new to this country elegant in its principle and innocent if not beneficial in its tendency he will be amply rewarded even in the failure of his specimen if it excites others who may be better qualified to pursue the same ideas  they who suppose an english audience because used to plain entertainment are incapable of relishing the most refined are greatly mistaken it is true there will ever be spectators in the two extremes of the house who are tasteless and despicable  to the honor of the town be it said they are but few  and whether they bawl for a hornpipe from the upper gallery or yawn in the weariness of dissipapation in the boxes they equally betray stupidity prejudice or caprice but the middle class and bulk of the assembly like that of the kingdom at large will ever be on the side of nature truth and sense let the piece be founded upon those principles and applause will follow every circumstance of elegance and decoration that can accompany them  a sincere zeal for the improvement of the stage has prompted this digression it is requisite now to return for a moment to the history of the undertaking  mr garrick after perusing the outlines of the two original acts thought he discovered in the writer some talents for the higher species of comedy and encouraged him to extend his plan the scenery also which in the first sketches promised a brilliant effect the composition of the music and the names of the dancers who were engaged all seemed to require more distinction than could be given to them in an afterpiece but the most prevalent incentive to the author was the promise of mr garricks assistance his judgment pervaded the whole and though it may diminish the poet it is the pride of the friend to make a public acknowledgement to that gentleman in the words of horace to melpomene quod spiro et placeo si placeo tuum est   prologue spoken by mr king unlike to ancient fame all eyes tongues ears see modern fame dressed capapee appears in ledgers

enter sir harry groveby and mr dupeley meeting sir harry dear charles welcome to england and doubly welcome to oldsworths oaks  friendship i see has wings as well as love  you arrive at the moment i wished i hope in your haste you have not forgot a fancy dress   dupeley no no i am a true friend and prepared for all your whimsies amorous and poetical your summons found me the day after my arrival and i took post immediately  next to my eagerness to see you was that of being in time for the fete champetre  novelty and pleasure are the beings i pursue  they have led me half the world over already and for ought i know they may sometime or other carry me to the otaheite   sir harry you have pursued but their shadows  here they reign in the manners of this new arcadia and the smiles of the sweet maid of the oaks   dupeley who in the name of curiosity is she that bears this romantic title for your letter was a mere eclogue the devil a thing could i make out but a rhapsody upon rural innocence and an invitation from a gentleman i did not know to an entertainment i never saw  what are we to have a representation of the pastorfido in a garden   sir harry the pastorfido is before you in propria persona the business of the day is a wedding and charles dupeley is invited to see his friend sir harry grovebey united to the most charming of her sex   dupeley the devil it is what a young fellow of your hopes and fortune sacrificed to a marriage of romance but prithee relieve my impatience and tell me who she is   sir harry an orphan ward of the worthy old gentleman at whose seat you now are his character is singular and as amiable in its way as here is inheriting a great estate and liberally educated his disposition led him early to a country life where his benevolence and hospitality are boundless and these qualities joined with an imagination bordering upon the whimsical have given a peculiar turn to the manners of the neighborhood that in my opinion degrades the polish of courts  but judge of the original   enter oldworth mr oldworth i present you my friend he is just arrived from abroad i will not repeat how much he is worthy of your friendship   oldworth to be worthy of yours sir harry is the best recommendation to dupeley  sir your friend is going to receive from my hands a lovely girl whose merit he has discerned and loved for its own sake such nuptials should recall the ideas of a better age he has permitted me to celebrate them upon my own plan and i shall be happy to receive the judgment of an accomplished critic   dupeley sir by what i already see of oldworths oaks and know of the character of the master i am persuaded the talent most necessary for the company will be that of giving due praise   enter hurry hurry lord sir come down to the building directly  all the trades are together by the ears  it is for all the world like the tower of babylon  they have drove a broadwheel wagon over two hampers of wine and it is all running among lilies and honeysuckles  one of the cooks stumbled over one of the clouds and threw a ham and chickens into a tub of white wash  a lamplighter spilt a gallon of oil into a creamd appletart and they have sent for more roses and there is not one left within twenty miles   oldworth why honest hurry if there is none to be had you need not be in such haste about em  mercy on us my fete has turned this poor fellows head already he will certainly get a fever   hurry get a favor sir  why there has not been one left these three hours all the girls in the parish have been scrambling for them and i must get a hundred yards more  lord a mercy there is so much to do at once and nobody to do it that it is enough to moider ones head  oldworth and hurry talk together dupeley ha ha ha is this one of the examples you produce sir harry to degrade the polish of courts   sir harry if i did have you never met with a courtier in your travels as busy as important and as insignificant upon yet more trifling occasions  why my friend hurrys is the true bustle of an antichamber with this difference that there is rather more attachment and fidelity to the master at the bottom of it  during this speech hurry is expressing by his action his impatience for oldworth to go hurry law sir if you loiter longer i tell you they will all be at loggerheads  they were very near it when i came away  exit oldworth mr dupeley you will excuse me  hurry convinces me my presence is necessary elsewhere  this is a busy day   dupely the greatest compliment you can pay me is not not to look upon me as a stranger   oldworth i forgot to tell you sir harry that lady bab lardoon is in the neighborhood and i expect her every moment  she promised to be with us long before the hour of general invitation   dupely who is she pray   sir harry oh she is a superior  a phoenix  more worthy your curiosity than any object of your travels  she is an epitome or rather a caricature of what is called very fine life and the first female gamester of the time   oldworth for all that she is amiable  one cannot help discerning and admiring the natural excellence of her heart and understanding though she is an example that neither is proof against a false education and a rage for fashionable excesses  but when you see her she will best explain herself  this fellow will give me no rest   hurry returns rest sir why i have not slept this fortnight come along sir pray make haste  nothings to be done without it   oldworth nor with it honest hurry  exit with hurry dupeley a cunning old fellow i warrant  with his ward and his love of merit for its own sake  ha ha ha  prythee how came your acquaintance in this odd family   sir harry dont sneer and i will tell you  by mere chance in a progress of amusement to this side the country the story is too delicate for thy relish suffice it that i came saw and loved  i laid my rank and fortune at the fair ones feet and would have married instantly but that oldworth opposed my precipitancy and insisted upon a probation of six months absence  it has been a purgatory   dupeley all this is perfectly en regle for a man of home education  i should like to see the woman that could entangle me in this manner   sir harry there is not a fellow in england has a more susceptible heart you may have learnt in your foreign tour to disguise it but if you have lost it put all your acquisitions together and the balance will be against you   dupeley i have learned at least not to have it imposed upon show me but a woman from an italian princess to a figurante at the french opera or change the scene and carry me to the rural nymphs from a vintage in burgundy to a dance round a may pole at oldsworths oaks  and at the first glance i will discover the whole extent of their artifice find their true lure and bring them to my hand as easily as a tame sparrow   sir harry and pray my sagacious friend upon what circumstances have you formed your suspicions that i am more likely to be imposed upon than yourself   dupeley upon every one i have seen and heard but above all upon that natural propensity of every true homebred englishman to think one woman different from another  now i hold there is but one woman in the world   sir harry i perfectly agree and maria is that charming one   dupeley ay but maria and lady bab and pamela andrews and clarissa harlowe and the girl that steals a heart in a country church or she that picks your pocket in covent garden are one and the same creature for all that  i am always too quick for them and make fools of them first  oh do but try them by the principle i have laid down you will find them as transparent as glass   sir harry my own principle will answer my purpose just as well with that perspective i have looked through the woman and discovered the angel and you will do the same when you see her or never brag of your eyesight more   dupeley rhapsody and enthusiasm  i should as soon discover mahomets seventh heaven but what says your uncle old groveby to this match   sir harry faith i have asked him no questions and why should i when i know what must be his answer   dupeley oh he can never disapprove a passion that soars above the stars   sir harry he has all the prejudices of his years and wordly knowledge the common old gentlemans character  you may see it in every drama from the days of terence to those of congreve though not perhaps with quite so much good humor and so little obstinacy as my uncle shows he is ever most impetuous when most kind and i dare trust his resentment will end with a dramatic forgiveness should it not i may have pride in the sacrifice of his estate but no regret  so much for fortune charles  are there any other means to reconcile me to your approbation   dupeley gad i know but one more  have you laid any plan for succeeding at the divorceshop next winter it would be some comfort to your friends to see you had a retreat in your head   sir harry charles i have listened to your raillery with more patience than it deserves and should at last be out of humor with such an importation of conceit and affectation if i was not sure your good sense would soon get the better of it this is called knowing the world  to form notions without perhaps ever seeing a man in his natural character or conversing with a woman of principle and then for fear of being imposed upon be really dupd out of the most valuable feelings in human nature confidence in friendship and esteem in love   enter hurry lord sir i am out of breath to find you why almost every thing is ready except yourself and madam maria is gone to the grove and she is so dressed and looks so charming   sir harry propitious be the hour  here hurry find out this gentlemans servant and show him where he is to dress  exit dupeley oh take care of yourself corydon the first i shall be time enough hurry shall first show me a little of the preparation  what is going forward here approaching the side scene   hurry hold sir not that way my master lets no body see his devices and figaries there   dupeley why what is he doing there hurry   hurry doing  as you are a gentleman i will tell you what he is doing  i hope no body hears us looking about why he is going to make the sun shin at midnight and he is covering it with a thousand yards of sailcloth for fear the rain should put it out  lord such doings  here this way your honor   dupeley but harkee honest hurry do stand still a moment to oblige me   hurry stand still sir  lord sir if i stand still every thing stands still and then what a fine shampeter should we make of it always restless   dupeley you seem to know every thing here   hurry to be sure i do  i am no fool i believe  what think you sir   dupeley he that takes you for a fool is not over wise i warrant him therefore let me ask you a question or two   hurry tomorrow sir with all my heart but i have so many questions to ask myself and so many answers to give that i have not five minutes to spare   dupeley three minutes will do my business who is this maid of the oaks friend hurry   hurry a young lady sir   dupeley i thought as much smiling you are a courtier friend hurry   hurry i court her  heaven forbid  she is going to be married sir   dupeley well said simplicity if you will not tell me who she is tell me what she is   hurry she is one of the most charmingest sweetest delightfulest mildest beutifulest modestest genteelest never to be praised enough young creature in all the world   dupeley true courtier again who is her father pray   hurry it is a wise child that knows its own father lord bless her she does not want a father   dupeley not while mr oldworth lives   hurry nor when he is dead neither every body would be glad to be her father and every body wishes to be her husband and so sir if you have more questions to ask i will answer them another time for i am wanted here and there and every where bustles about   dupeley show me my chamber to dress and i will desire no more of you at present   hurry bless your honor for letting me go i have been very miserable all the while you were talking to me  this way this way sir  exit dupeley what a character  yet he has his cunning though the simplest swain in this region of perfect innocence as sir harry calls it  ha ha ha  exit scene ii an outside building workmen of all sorts passing toandfro architect as speaking to persons at work behind the sidescene come bustle away my lads strike the scaffold and then for the twelve oclock tankard up with the rest

if you want more here you may make them of paper  any thing will go off by candlelight   first lamplighter running they want above a hundred more lamps yonder for the illumination of the portico   second lamplighter then they may get tallowcandles i shall not have enough to make the sky clear in the saloon  that damned irish painter has made his ground so dingy one might as soon make his head transparent as his portico   enter irish painter painter arrah what is that you say of my head mr lamplighter   second lamplighter i say you have spoiled the transparency by putting black where you should have put blue   painter dabbing his brush across his face there is a black eye for you and you may be thankful you got it so easily  trot away with your ladder upon your shoulder or the devil fire me but you shall have black and blue both my dear   architect returning good words good words gentlemen no quarrelling  your servant mr odaub upon my word you have hit off those ornaments very well  the first painter we have here could not have done better   painter no faith i believe not for all his hard name sure odaub was a scene painter before he was born though i believe he is older than i too   architect you a scene painter   painter ay by my soul was i and for foreign countries too   architect where was that pray   painter faith i painted a whole set for the swish who carries the temple of jerusalem about upon his back and it made his fortune though he got but a halfpenny apiece for his show   architect ironically i wish we had known your merits you should certainly have been employed in greater parts of the work   painter and by my soul it would have been better for you if you had  i would have put out mr lanternbugs stars with one dash of my pincil by making them five times more bright  ho if you had seen the sign of a setting sun that i painted for a linendraper in breadstreet in dublin  devil burn me but the auroree of oguide was a fool to it   architect oguide  who is he guido i suppose you mean   painter and if he has an o to his name what signifies whether it comes before or behind  faith i put it like my own of odaub on the right side to make him sound more like a gentleman  besides it is more melodious in the mouth honey   enter carpenters etc first carpenter well sir the scaffolds down and we are woundy dry  we have toiled like horses   architect rest you merry master carpenter  take a draught of the squires liquor and welcome you shall swim in it when all is over   painter fait let me have one merry quarter of an hour before we at it again and it will be no loss of time neither  we will make the next quarter after as good as an hour  and so his honor and the shampater will gain by the loss   first gardener well said odaub and if you will give us the song you made the quarter of an hour will be merrier still   architect can you rhyme odaub   painter yes fait as well as paint  all the difference is i do one with a brush and the other with a pen i do one with my head and both with my hands  and if any of the poets of em all can produce better rhymes and raisins too within the gardens i will be content to have one of my own brushes rammd down my throat and so spoil me for a singer as well as a poet hereafter   architect well said master painter   enter the several tradesmen song by the irish painter to an irish tune then away to champetre champetre come all away to work at champetre is nothing at all but play as i know nothing of it no more my dear will i say but champetre for ever for ever and ay i say ii you may guess what a sight for it never has yet been seen heaven bless her sweet face it is a sight for the lovely queen for lords and for earls and for gentlefolks too and the busy beau monde who have nothing to do then away to champetre etc iii while it is light you will see nothing when darker o then you will see that the darker it is the more light it will quickly be the moon and the stars they may twinkle and go to bed we can make better sunshine than such as they ever made then away to champetre etc iv such crowds and confusions such uproar and such delight with lamps hung by thousands to turn the day into night there will be russians turks prussians and dutchmen so bright and gay and they will all be so fine they will have nothing at all to say then away to champetre etc v then let us take a drink to the squire of the jolly oaks may no crabbed critics come here with their gibes or jokes if they did i could make the dear craters soon change their notes with my little black brush i could sweep clean their noisy throats then away to champetre etc exeunt singing end of the first act act ii scene the oaks maria sitting under a great tree sings come sing round my favorite tree ye songsters that visit the grove twas the haunt of my shepherd and me and the bark is a record of love ii reclined on the turf by my side he tenderly pleaded his cause i only with blushes replied and the nightingale filled up the pause da capo come sing etc  enter oldworth oldworth joy to my sweet maria may long succeeding years resemble this her bridal hour may health and peace and love still inspire her song and make the harmony of her voice an emblem of her life but come my girl if there is a wish remaining in your heart within my power to gratify i hope in this last hour of my cares i shall not be a stranger to it   maria if i have a wish you have not indulged sir i fear it must be an improper one or it would not have escaped you   oldworth you seem disconcerted maria be more explicit   maria my mind is incapable of reserve with you the most generous of men is on the point of giving his hand to your  what shall i call myself i am almost nameless but as the creature of your bounty and cares this title gives me a value in my own eyes but i fear it is all i have to boast the mystery you have kept makes me apprehensive there is something in my origin ought to be concealed  what am i to interpret from your smiles   oldworth every thing that is contrary to your surmises be patient sweet maid of the oaks before night all mysteries shall be cleared it is not an ordinary wedding i celebrate i prepare a feast for the heart  lady bab lardoon as i live  the princess of dissipation catch an observation of her while you can maria for though she has been but three days out of london she is as uneasy as a mole in sunshine and would expire if she did not soon dive into her old element again   enter lady bab lady bab dear maria i am happy to be the first of your company to congratulate you  well mr oldworth i am delighted with the idea of your fete it is so novel so french so expressive of what every body understands and nobody can explain then there is something so spirited in an undertaking of expense where a shower of rain would spoil it all   oldworth i did not expect to escape from so fine a lady but you and the world have free leave to comment upon all you see here  laugh where you must be candid where you can i only hope that to celebrate a joyful event upon any plan that neither hurts the morals or politeness of the company and at the same time sets thousands of the industrious to work cannot be thought blame worthy   lady bab oh quite the contrary and i am sure it will have a run a force upon the seasons and the manners is the true test of a refined taste and it holds good from a cucumber at christmas to an italian opera   maria is the rule the same among the ladies lady bab is it also a definition of their refinement to act in all things contrary to nature   lady bab not absolutely in all things though more so than people are apt to imagine for even in circumstances that seem most natural fashion prompts ten times where inclination prompts once and there would be an end of gallantry in this country if it was not for the sake of reputation   oldworth what do you mean   lady bab why that a woman without a connection grows every day a more awkward personage one might as well go into company without powder  if one does not really despise old vulgar prejudices it is absolutely necessary to affect it or one must sit at home alone   oldworth indeed   lady bab yes like lady sprose and talk morals to the parrot   maria this is new indeed i always supposed that in places where freedom of manners was most countenanced a woman of unimpeachable conduct carried a certain respect   lady bab only fit for sheepwalks and oakeries  i beg your pardon mr oldworth  in town it would just raise you to the whistparty of old lady cipher mrs squabble and lord flimzey and at every public place you would stand among the footmen to call your own chair while all the maccaronies passed by whistling a song through their toothpicks and giving a shrug  them it it is pity that so fine a woman should be lost to all common decency   maria smiling i believe i had better stay in the oakery as you call it for i am afraid i shall never procure any civility in town upon the terms required   lady bab oh my dear you have chose a horrid word to express the intercourse of the bon ton civility may be very proper in a mercer when one is choosing a silk but familiarity is the life of good company i believe this is quite since your time mr oldworth but it is by far the greatest improvement the beau monde ever made   oldworth a certain ease was always an essential part of good breeding but lady bab must explain her meaning a little further before we can decide upon the improvement   lady bab i mean that participation of society in which the french used to excel and we have now so much outdone our models  i maintain that among the superior set  mind i only speak of them  our men and women are put more upon a footing together in london than they ever were before in any age or country   oldworth and pray how has this happy resolution been effected   lady bab by the most charming of all institutions wherein we show the world that liberty is as well understood by our women as by our men we have our bill of rights and our constitution too as well as they  we drop in at all hours play at all parties pay our own reckonings and in every circumstance petticoats excepted are true lively jolly fellows   maria but does not this give occasion to a thousand malicious insinuations   lady bab ten thousand my dear  but no great measures can be effected without a contempt of popular clamor   oldworth paying of reckonings is i confess new since my time and i should be afraid it might sometimes be a little heavy upon a ladys pocket   lady bab a mere trifle  one generally wins them  jack saunter of the guards lost a hundred and thirty to me upon score at one time i have not eat him half out yet  he will keep me best part of next winter but exclusive of that the club is the greatest system of economy for married families ever yet established   oldworth indeed but how so pray   lady bab why all the servants may be put to board wages or sent into the country except the footmen  no plunder of housekeepers or maitres de hotel no long butchers bills  lady squander protests she has wanted no provision in her family these six months except potatoes to feed the children and a few frogs for the french governess  then our dinnersocieties are so amusing all the doves and hawks together and one converses so freely there is no topic of whites or almacks in which we do not bear a part   maria upon my word i should be a little afraid that some of those subjects might not always be managed with sufficient delicacy for a ladys ear especially an unmarried one   lady bab bless me why where is the difference miss must have had a strange education indeed not to know as much as her chapron i hope you would not have the daughters blackballd when the mothers are chose why it is almost the only place where some of them are likely to see each other   enter sir harry groveby sir harry i come to claim my lovely bride  here at her favorite tree i claim her mine  the hour is almost on the point the whole country is beginning to assemble every preparation of mr oldworths fancy is preparing  and while the priest accuse the brides delay roses and myrtles shall obstruct her way  maria repugnance would be affectation my heart is all your own and i scorn the look or action that does not avow it   oldworth come sir harry leave your protestations which my girl does not want and see a fair stranger   lady bab sir harry i rejoice at your happiness  and do not think me so tasteless maria as not to acknowledge an attachment like yours preferable to all others when it can be had  filer le parfait amor is the first happiness in life but that you know is totally out of the question in town the matrimonial comforts in our way are absolutely reduced to two to plague a man and to bury him the glory is to plague him first and bury him afterward   sir harry i heartily congratulate lady bab and all who are to partake of her conversation upon her being able to bring so much vivacity into the country   lady bab nothing but the fete champetre could have effected it for i set out in miserable spirits  i had a horrid run before i left town  i suppose you saw my name in the papers   sir harry i did and therefore concluded there was not a word of truth in the report   maria your name in the papers lady bab for what pray   lady bab the old story  it is a mark of insignificance now to be left out have not they begun with you yet maria   maria not that i know of and i am not at all ambitious of the honor   lady bab oh but you will have it  the fete champetre will be a delightful subject  to be complimented one day laughed at the next and abused the third you cannot imagine how amusing it is to read ones own name at breakfast in a morning paper   maria pray how long may your ladyship have been accustomed to this pleasure   lady bab lord a great while and in all its stages they first began with a modest inuendo  we hear a certain lady not a hundred miles from hanoversquare lost at one sitting some nights ago two thousund guineas  o tempora o mores   oldworth laughing pray lady bab is this concluding ejaculation your own or was it the printers   lady bab his you may be sure a dab of latin adds surprising force to a paragraph besides showing the learning of the author   oldworth well but really i dont see such a great matter in this why should you suppose any body applied this paragraph to you   lady bab none but my intimates did for it was applicable to half st georges parish but about a week after they honored me with initials and italicks it is said lady b ls ill success still continues at the quinze table it was observed the same lady appeared yesterday at court in a ribband collier having laid aside her diamond necklace diamond in italicks as totally bourgeoise and unnecessary for the dress of a woman of fashion   oldworth to be sure this was advancing a little in familiarity   lady bab at last to my infinite amusement out i came at full length  lady bab lardoon has tumbled down three nights successively a certain colonel has done the same and we hear that

half a maccaroni   lady bab and very possibly the worst half it is a vulgar idea to think foreign accomplishments fit a man for the polite world   sir harry lady bab i wish you would undertake him he seems to have contracted all the commonplace affectation of travel and thinks himself quite an overmatch for the fair sex of whom his opinion is as ill founded as it is degrading   lady bab o is that

you   lady bab if he dont i will begin with him there are two characters under which one may say any thing to a man that of perfect assurance and of perfect innocence maria may be the best critic of

or is she one of the natives of this extraordinary region  oh i see now it is all pure arcadian her eyes have been used to nothing but daisy hunting they are as awkward to her when she looks at a man as her elbows would be in a french berline   lady bab aside my spark does not seem to want observation he is only deficient in expression but i will help him to that presently now to my character settles herself   dupeley aside what a neck she has how beautifully nature works when she is not spoiled by a damned town staymaker what a pity she is so awkward i hope she is not foolish  during this observation he keeps his eye fixed upon her neck lady bab looks first at him then at herself unpins her nosegay and with an air of the most perfect naivete presents it to him lady bab you seem to wish for my nosegay sir it is much at your service  offers the flowers and curtseys awkward dupeley oh the charming innocent  my wishes extend a little further a thousand thanks my fair one i accept it as

for i have seen few or none of the sort before but my dear girl what is your name and situation   lady bab situation   dupeley ay what are you   lady bab i am a bride maid   dupeley but my sweet image

comical in all my life  ha ha ha and this is a fine gentleman of which i have heard so much   dupeley what is the matter my dear is there any thing ridiculous about me that makes you laugh what have you heard of fine gentlemen my sweet innocence   lady bab that they are as gaudy as peacocks as mischievous as jays as chattering as magpies as wild as hawks    dupeley and as loving as sparrows  my beauteous delia do not leave out the best property of the feathered creation   lady bab no no i did not mean to leave out that i know you are very loving  of yourselves ha ha ha you are a sort of birds that flock but never pair   dupeley why you are satirical my fairest and have you heard any thing else of fine gentlemen   lady bab yes a great deal more  that they take wives for fortunes and mistresses for show squander their money among tailors barbers cooks and fiddlers pawn their honor to sharpers and their estates to jews and at last run to foreign countries to repair a pale face a flimzy carcass and an empty pocket  that is a fine gentleman for you   dupeley surprised heyday where has my arcadian picked up this jumble   lady bab i am afraid i have gone to far aside   dupeley still surprised pray my dear what is really your name   lady bab resuming her simplicity my name is philly   dupeley philly   lady bab philly nettletop of the vale   dupeley still suspicious and pray my sweet philly where did you learn this character of a fine gentleman   lady bab o i learnt it with my catechism  mr oldworth has it taught to all the young maidens here about   dupeley aside o the glutton  have i found at last the clue  i will be hanged if old slyboots has not a rural seraglio and this is the favorite sultana   lady bab aside i fancy i have put him upon a new scent  why a real fool now would not have afforded half this diversion   dupeley significantly so it is from mr oldworth is it my charming innocence that you have learnt to be so much afraid of fine gentlemen   lady bab no not at all afraid i believe you are perfectly harmless if one treats you right as i do our young mastiff at home   dupeley and how is that pray   lady bab why while one keeps at a distance he frisks and he flies and he barks and tears and grumbles and makes a sad rout about it  lord you would think he would devour one at a mouthful but if one does but walk boldly up and look him in the face and ask him what he wants he drops his ears and runs away directly   dupeley well said rural simplicity again  oh damn it i need not be so squeamish here  well but my dear heavenly creature dont commit such a sin as to waste your youth and your charms upon a set of rusticks here fly with me to the true region of pleasure  my chaise and four shall be ready at the back gate of the park and we will take the opportunity when all the servants are drunk as they certainly will be and the company is gone tired to bed   lady bab fondly and would you really love me dearly now saturdays and sundays and all   dupeley aside oh this will do without an annuity i see   lady bab you will forget all this prittleprattle gibberish to me now as soon as you see the fine strange ladies by and by  there is lady bab larpoon i think they call her from london   dupeley lady bab lardoon indeed  oh you have named a special object for a passion  i should as soon be in love with the figure of the great mogul at the back of a pack of cards  if she has any thing to do with hearts it must be when they are trumps and she pulls them out of her pocket  no sweet philly thank heaven that gave me insight into the sex and reserved me for a woman in her native charms  here alone she is to be found and paradise is on her lips struggling to kiss her thus let me thank you for my nosegay   during the struggle enter hurry hurry oh lady bab i come to call your ladyship pauses lord i thought they never kissed at a wedding till after the ceremony but they cannot begin too soon  i ask pardon for interruption going  dupeley stares lady bab laughs dupeley stay hurry who was you looking for   hurry why i came with a message for lady bab larder and would have carried her answer but you stopped her mouth   dupeley

innocent mr oldworths mistress or the great mogul equally grateful for your favorable opinion slowly and with a low curtsey   enter oldworth and sir harry laughing mr oldworth give me leave to present to you a gentleman remarkable for second sight he knows all women by instinct   sir harry from a princess to a figurante from a vintage to a may pole  i am rejoiced i came in time for the catastrophe   lady bab mr oldworth there is your traveled man for you and i think i have given a pretty good account of him pointing at dupeley who is disconcerted   oldworth i hope the ladies are not the only characters in which mr dupeley has been mistaken   lady bab upon my word mr dupeley considering you have not been two hours in the house you have succeeded admirably to recommend yourself to your company why you look as if you had gone your va toute upon a false card   dupeley the devils in her i believe she overbears me so that i have not a word to say for myself   lady bab well though i laugh now i am sure i have most reason to be disconcerted for that blundering fellow spoiled my fortune   sir harry how so   lady bab why i should have had an annuity   oldworth come come my good folks you have both acquitted yourselves admirably mr dupeley must forgive the innocent deceit and you lady bab like a generous conqueror should bear the triumph moderately   dupeley i own myself her captive bound in her chains and thus i lay all my former laurels at her feet kneels   lady bab the laurels have been mostly poetical  gathered in imagination only he he he   dupeley quarter quarter my dear invincible   sir harry now this scene is finished let me open another to you  marias charms have been as much signalized as her ladyships wit  my old uncle groveby    lady bab of gloomstockhall   sir harry the same and full primed with the rhetoric of sixtyfive against a marriage of inclination but such a conversion such a revolution   oldworth your uncle here i must chide you sir harry for concealing from me that you had a relation so well entitled to be consulted  which way is he   sir harry i left him all in transport with my bride he kisses her and squeezes her hand  gad i shall not get her away from him without your help   dupeley poor sir harry   lady bab if she has sweetened that old crab that his sourness will not set our teeth an edge she has worked miracles indeed   sir harry there you totally mistake his character lady bab  no  he has the heart of an oldworth addressing himself to mr oldworth though i confess with very different manners his expression often puts me in mind of the harsh preparation of instruments your ear is jarred before it is delighted  but attend to his sentiments and as hamlet says he will discourse most excellent music he never said or did an illnatured thing in his life   lady bab i wish i had him in town to contrast with some smooth successful characters of my acquaintance who will smile upon you even though you affront them and always flatter your judgment when they mean to pick your pocket  but here he is i declare and looks if he was quite in tune   enter groveby with maria under his arm sir harry running to her i was coming to seek you my maria   groveby your maria sir my maria  she will own me if you will not  there sir let her teach you your duty  quitting maria who retires with sir harry to the bottom of the stage oldworth sir i have many pardons to ask of you but sir harry will be my witness that my fault was in my ignorance had i known your name and situation i should have paid you my respects months

acre of it taking maria by the hand   sir harry i ever found your kindness paternal and you now give me the best proof of it   groveby no sir had i been your father and you had surprised me with a match like this i should have taken another method   sir harry what would that have been my dear uncle   groveby i would have loaded you with all the rents and you should have been forced to keep me at your own expense for the rest of my life sirrah   lady bab there is a sort of humor about this old fellow that is not unpleasant i must have a little laugh with her before the day is over   groveby
