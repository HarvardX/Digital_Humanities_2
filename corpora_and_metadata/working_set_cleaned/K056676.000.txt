our trade with france for the last  0 or    years and because some period of time is proper in all such cases to take a rise from it shall be placed at the year    0 if any think that time is not sufficiently remote they shall be fairly followed let them go back as far as they please in the mean while i must take notice to the reader that the particulars are too copious and extensive and especially their numbers so pressing that no time or room can be spared for preambles and introductions  about the year    0 the general book of rates was made in england according to an act of parliament whereby a subsidy of tonnage was laid on wines and brandies and a subsidy of poundage after the rate of   l per cent upon all goods and merchandises imported  in imitation of this in the year      the french made a general tariff or book of rates wherein they followed us in rating all goods and merchandises at a tax of about   l per cent ad valorem except that for the encouragement of their own people to improve in trade and manufactures all the manufactures of silk gold silver hair thread and wool were rated at  0 per cent according to their value this tariff was eseemed by all the nations in these parts of europe to be very easy and not the least interruption to their trade with france  that the reader may see at once what was paid upon our english manufactures by that tariff and what has been laid on in france since that time the foregoing table is placed at the beginning of this paper and also as what there will be occasion often to mention and refer to out of which the whalebone fins and oil might have been omitted because we have no share of that trade but as it may be useful for the information of some people the whole is above incerted  all our woollen manufactures exported from england to france are reduced to the old duties payable by the tariff of      except broadcloth and serges which are to pay as by the tariff of      that also being capable of being moderated by commissioners thus  broadcloth which from the year      paid  0 livres will now pay only    livres  milled serges which paid    livres now    livres  all other woollen goods pay after the tariff of      as aforesaid when their wines paid duty here but   l  0 s per ton and brandy but   l  0 s  this part being thus stated let us turn the tables and view the other side of the trade viz our import from france where the particulars will be very surprising and this following conclusion is most natural there from viz that if we traded with france to our advantage before much more must we do so now for the state of the trade between england and france stands thus  an account of the several duties which were payable upon french goods imported into england from france at the

every true britain whose concern is for his countries interest  must look upon this table of duties with great satisfaction  the setting this account against the former clears up the treaty of commerce so effectually that farther enlargements must seem unnecessary nevertheless since matters of fact concur it shall next be showed what regard her majesty has had to the other tradinginterest of her subjects how the ports of france are opened to them upon equal terms with the french subjects themselves and that even in some things prejudicial so themselves as in the levant trade in particular  the hudsons bay company pray that the french may surrender all the forts and settlements in hudsons bay and straight and be obliged to renounce all right and pretensions thereto for the future  granted  and that they make restitution of damages to the value of  0      l sterling  granted the quantum only being referred to commssioners  the turkey or levant company pray that they may have the ameierty of trade in france as the french themselves and not to pay higher duties than by the tariff of       granted  and that they be allowed to carry goods to all parts of france from the levant directly or the goods of the levant viz raw silks etc from great britain  granted as in       the east india company pray that the prohibitions and high duties laid in france on east india goods sent from england may be taken off and to be on the same foot as in the first of king charles reign  granted and yet the prohibition in england of east india goods from any place but the east indies continues  the virginia merchants pray that the tobacco of the english plantations be imported into france under a reasonable duty and the importers to sell it without subjection to the farmers  granted under the sameduty which other nations pay as to the farm referred to the commissioners  lyme regis prays the prohibition of woollen manufactures and the high duties laid in france may be taken off and the said goods be imported into france as formerly  granted  the merchants of bristol pray the same as above from lyme as also that tonage of ships be abolished on both sides  granted  and that all our merchants be permitted to buy and sell tobacco in france under moderate customs without being subjected to the farmers  referred to the commissioners  that nothing might be wanting to secure to great britain a complete freedom of their trade to france all the advantages of the treaties france has made with other nations are contained in this treaty and all the privileges stipulated for them are by her majestys care for her subjects profit made our own as by the eighth and other article whereby it is stipulated that her majestys subjects shall be treated in france in the same manner as the nations they most favored and even as the french kings own subjects  the ninth article adds and all prohibitions tariffs edicts declarations decrees made in france since the said tariff of      contrary thereunto in respect of the goods and merchandises of great britain shall be repealed  as to this it is objected that it is not said goods and merchandises of the subjects of great britain but goods and merchandises of great britain which implies say they the manufactures of great britain only but the absurdity here is so gross that it is strange the wisdom of the turkey company should fall into it for   if it had been meant of the manufactures of great britain only it would have been said the growth and produce not the goods and merchandises by growth and produce indeed the manufactures had been understood but by the goods and merchandises of great britain must be understood the goods and merchandises which the subjects of great britain trade in but   it is out of question that if the taking off the prohibitions etc of the goods and merchandises of great britain was meant only of the manufactures then was the whole levant trade prohibited still which the gentlemen do not pretend to  thus it appears that the construction the company would have put on the words of the  th article viz goods and merchandises of britain would be the ruin of that very trade which they petition to support and would prohibit all their levant goods in france such people like children must be dealt with by the nature of things and must have given them not always what they do ask but what they would ask  some considerations might be offered here upon the turkey companies desiring the liberty to carry their raw silk from england to france and yet at the same time petition that the silk manufctures here should receive encouragement as if carrying the silk abroad which is a means to keep up the price of silk should at the same time be a means to encourage the weavers and manufacturers of silk in this kingdom this mystery is referred to them to unfold also the consistency of their desiring to supply france with raw silk at the same time that they desire the silk manufactures of france should not be encouraged  in general all the memorials petitions and representations given in as well from public bodies of men as from private merchants do allow that if the privileges advantages abatements of duties etc which they request or represent as needful may be obtained there will be a great and beneficial trade driven from england to france  to make it plain then that all those privileges advantages abatements etc are really obtained by the treaty the contents of those memorials are here sumd up the memorials themselves being too long and most of them demanding the same thing with but little variation  all they petition for may be reduced to these heads   reduction of duties in france upon our goods especially the woollen manufactures to the tariff of        obtained with a reserve only to cloths and clothserges which is to be debated by commissioners and at most to pay but as in        liberty of carrying all our manufactures into france and the taking off all prohibitions   obtained   abolishing the  0 sol per ton and the droit au bein   obtained generally though the dutch pay it coastway as also the droit au bein which was a cruel custom that gave all the estates of english merchants who died in france to the king   liberty of importing tobacco into france and of selling it there free from the farm   obtained only as to the farm referred   liberty of importing levant goods either directly from the levant or from england   obtained   liberty of importing east india goods into france   obtained   british merchants to be free from the papier timbree or stamped paper   obtained and which was not asked a freedom of religion and christian burial things the petitioners showed little concern about   that ships may trade coastways in france without double demands of customs etc ships may deliver part of the cargo in france and proceed with the rest without paying duties   obtained   surrender of hudsons bay and straight newfoundland and the fishery annapolis and nova scotia   obtained together with the island of st christophers which was not asked  0 reparation of damages to merchants  0 obtained the quantum only being referred  it would be reasonable here to desire those people who insist so much upon this reserve of cloths and serges out of the tariff of      to consider what the exception amounts to and how far it may hurt the trade that they may judge whether the damage is equal to the complaint to this purpose the difference in the serges is set down again here viz that the serges which paid  0 livres in      and were afterward brought to    and then to    and after that prohibited may now be freely imported into france paying only    livres that is to say one livre advance upon a piece of    else and the difference upon cloths is that the piece which paid  0 livres before in      must pay now    being    livres upon about    yards english measure  to make this estimate more plain it is to be noted that the ell mentioned in all these cases is to be understood the french ell containing   quarters of the english yard and so the account of the exception of cloths and cloth serges may be read thus  cloths per piece containing    else that is    english yards and a quarter to pay    livres more than by the tariff of       cloth serges per piece containing    else that is    yards and   quarters to pay   livre more than by the tariff of       considering men when they come to weigh this will be apt to wonder what it is the trading part of this nation have been so much alarmed at in the treaty with france and will hardly be brought to believe that the complaints which have been made of ruining our manufactures and encouraging the french should all be raised from these small differences  would these people turn the tables and make the case of france here ther own what loud complaints would they make in england if any manufactures which our own people were endeavoring to make at home should have been admitted by the treaty from france with alike small advance on the french goods more than they paid in      whereas every body is sensible that the french are to pay here upon all their goods       or  00 l per cent higher duties than they paid in      and in some goods much more had these advanced duties been taken off how would they allege that foreigners were encouraged that the bread was taken out of the mouths of our own people that the importing manufactures from abroad which we could make at home was taking away the employment from our own poor to give to the french yet this is the case here the french have given all the encouragment they could to their people to fall upon the making the woollen manufactures of great britain it is supposed none can blame them for that some steps they have taken in it which promised them success while the duties of  0 livres and   0 livres were laid on english cloths and yet even then great quantities of english cloth were carried into france which obliged the king of france at last to make a prohibition of english woollon manufactures in general viz in the year   0   but after all these advances in the woollen manufactures the french king being obliged by the necessity of his affars to make a peace has yielded to such a peace as opens the door into france for the woollen manufactures of great britain at the same rate of custom and duties as they paid    years ago long before his own people mde any considerable attempt that way having excepted or reserved but two species of manufactures and upon them has only advanced about   or   per cent  there is hadly a manufacture erected by us in britain in the memory of man but that if the high duties laid upon foreign goods of the same kind were taken off or within   or   per cent of what they were before would be ruined and the undertakers thereof must lay them down if the manufacturers of paper linen cloth canvas or sail cloth and many other things were heard to this it is believed they would all acknowledge the truth of it  but the french king is obliged by this treaty what discouragement soever it may be to his own subjects and their manufacture to take off all his prohibitions and high duties and give all the english manufactures a free entrance into his country upon the same easy duties they paid in the year      except two sorts only viz cloth and cloth serges  that this may admit of no dispute the affirmative leads to the particular sorts of our woollen manufactures which by this treaty may be carried into france by the rule of the tariff of      viz  spanish cloths serges not clothserges double bays single bays says perpetuanas spanish draggets all sorts of norwich stuff linseywoolseys kiderminster stuffs shalloons chenys penyes half thicks cottons plain double and single dozens i e yorkshire cloths kersies duffels tammies plaids blankets rugs lannels worsted hose woollen hose knitcaps knitwacats knitpetticoats friezes camtalogns and whatever other things are made of wool and wrought in great britain all are reduced by this tariff to the duties payable in       what has been said of the liberty of commerce obtained by the treaty with france the reduction of the duties in france to the tariff of      and the reserve or limitation of two species of our manufactures only viz of broad cloths and serges to a small advance of duty has been more than sufficient to explain those things to any mens understandings which are not politically dull unless these people expected that her majesty should have made a condition with the french king that his subjects should make no woollen cloth or that when they had made it they should not export it to turkey for fear of prejudicing our levant trade  if the french merchants in turkey hold their cloths up to equal price with the english no buyer will take them except when a sufficient quantity of english cloth cannot be had to supply the market  the french cloths being inferior to the english in quality are for that reason and no other sold in turkey at a lower price  it is evident that the french want the materials viz the wool especially in those parts of france where their cloths for the turkey trade are made and whither the english or irish wool which they get by stealth cannot be carried without very great expense and that the wool they make use of instead thereof and to mix with the spanish wool is of an inferior quality to the english wool they themselves will not deny but if these were not so and they were to make cloth wholly of spanish wool or of english and spanish wool mixed yet the general way of workmanship of the french nation is known to be slighter and looser in all their manufactures than the manufactures of the like kind made here and that our workmen perform almost all kinds of workfirmer and more subantial not only than the french but also than any other people so that our cloths and even all our woollen manufactures will sell for a better price than manufactures of the same denomination from other countries  as to the silk manufactures they have such a sufficient provision made for them and such encouragement given them already by the high duties on foreign wrought silks as well of france as of any other country that as they stood in no need of prohibitions during the war so they stand in need of no farther assistance during the peace  for this reason as they have nothing to ask but that those duties should remain so the treaty of commerce has taken none of them away and if the silk manufacture cannot subsist with that difference upon them which those duties have laid neither would they subsist with a total prohibition  it is observable that during the said high duties particularly upon alamodes and lustrings none of them have been imported here that is legally imported as for clandestine importation or running of goods that can be no argument because neither can the quantity be great or is it possible entirely to prevent those things either in this country or in any other the difference between the manufactures of silk at home and those imported stands thus  foreign wrought silks of all kinds pay for every  0 pound weight l        netts duty  alamodes and lustrings pay for every  0 pound weight l         nett duty  now if the foreign wrought silks pay above    shillings per pound weight duty upon importation all discounts taken off the disadvantage which they must lie under must exceedingly lessen that importation and seems sufficient not only to encourage but to quicken the industry of our own weavers  but since the encouragement of the silk trade and employment of the weavers is spoken of as a thing of such extraordinary weight it may be very necessary to state the case of manufacturing in general that our opinion of things may be rightly balanced  it is an undoubted rule of trade that the employment of our own poor and consumption of our own growth is the first principal of commerce and should be the last end of all our national improvement  as great britain is stated in matters of trade this concern for the general interest of that trade centers upon our woollen manufacture there is a just concern due to every branch of trade but to that most which most contributes to and is most essential in the two great ends of trade abovementioned viz employment of the people and consumption of the produce this the woollen manufacture is so far superior in to all other branches of our commerce as admits of no comparison and therefore the principal concern of the nation is and ought to be the woollen manufacture  it is true prudence may so guide as that this concern for the woollen manufacture though it be with a preference to all our other goods yet may not be in opposition to them there being a manifest difference between showing a peculiar regard to one and injuring the other as a man having many children may show a peculiar affection to his eldest without injuring the rest but then on the other hand neither must any of the other branches of trade claim or expect such a regard or concern to be shown to them as should be injurious to the woollen manufactures  the silk trade is useful and advantageous but silk is a modern manufacture and is useful and advantageous as it is a return for and encourages the exportation of the woollen manufactures and no otherwise the woollen manufacture is the eldest child of the nations commerce the silk trade is a fosterchild taken into the family made useful and meriting to be encouraged but always with a subserviency to the good of the heir  if the turkey merchants drive any considerable trade to france with raw silk whether from england by reexportations or from the levant directly the silk they carry it is allowed must be the product of english manufactures so that by that method not only our own silks but even the french silks also as to the materials they are made of are the product and return of the english woollen manufactures the next difference is the workmanship which lies thus that one is performed by the french whom we ought to have no regard to in trade the other is performed by our own people whom we ought to support  but granting this if on the other hand a bale of wrought silks should be brought from france bought there with a bale or bales of spanish cloth or other woollen goods it is easy to prove that it is more our interest to bring over that bale of wrought silk and that the said wrought silks are more our own manufacture than if they had been wrought in spittlefields because the woollen manufactures which were first sent to turkey to purchase the raw silk which this bale of silks was wrought from and the spanish cloths or other woollen goods sent to france to purchase the said silks when wrought not only consumed the growth of england but employed above sixteen times the number of people in their making etc more than the bale of wrought silks would have done if they had been made in spittlefields  on the other hand this implies no danger at all to the english manufactures of silk because though the humors and fancies of some expensive people may run them upon buying foreign wrought silks yet while the high duties here remain as they are to do by the treaty the difference of price will be always such as will lessen the demand of foreign silks restrain the humor aforesaid to a few people and preserve the bulk of the manufacture in our hands  it is objected by some that the difference is not sufficient that notwithstanding    l   s   d to be paid upon the importation for every  0 pound weight of wrought silks yet that the french will bring in their silks but this amounts to no more than this viz that they will bring in some few which is what as above may be to our advantage but they will not pretend that the difference of the said duty shall not lessen that importation and reduce it to a small quantity and that the gross of the trade shall remain in our own hands  the substance of the petitions of the silk weavers and of others who pretend to appear in their behalf is in short this that the importation of french wrought silks may be prevented the pretense to make their petitioning national is the danger they say appears that french wrought silks will now by virtue of the treaty of commerce be imported in great quantities into britain and the french being able to underwork us will also undersell us and the weavers thereby be ruined  what foundation there is to support these things will appear upon making a few enquiries into matters of fact and some just calculation of the proportions of one to the other  the affairs of the high duies upon wrought silks imported is given in answer to the weavers and seems to make their apprehensions appear very irrational above    s per pound duty on the importation must be paid upon alamodes and lustrings and above    s per pound upon all other wrought silks except italian silks imported in english ships which pay duty  0 s   d  the force of reason prevailed in the first and the weavers have given it up owning at the bar of the house of commons that the difference is sufficient in the alamodes and lustrings and that the french can do them no harm there but it seems they think    s or  0 s   d per pound too little upon the other wrought silks but they either did not know or omitted to take notice that the raw silk which those french goods are made of pays sixteen livres per pound duty at the first importation into france that the wrought silks when shipped again to be brought hither pay   l per cent custom ad valorem upon their exportation both by the tariff of      and that the other charges such as transportation by landcarriage to the ports they are shipped at commission for buying freight risque of the sea etc cannot be so little as   per cent more so that here is about    per cent more upon the value of the goods to be added to the difference of   s or  0s   d per pound all which put together makes such a weight upon the foreign wrought silks and gives such an advantage to the english weavers that it is wonderful to think they should complain  to add to the conviction of these things it shall be a little examined what effect this difference has already had upon the silk trade from whence may be estimated some thing of what may be expected for the time to come  the weavers said themselves at the committee of the house of commons that they make to the value of three hundred thousand pounds every year in black silks only whether it be truth or not is not easy to be examined but in this case if they allow it we are not to question it for if it be an error it is against themselves their quantity of other silks they spoke of as prodigiously great it cannot be amiss to observe then what quantity of foreign wrought silks have been imported here from all parts of europe under our high duties and see what proportion they bear to the quantity which these people say they make at home whether these foreign wrought silks have been french or no is not the case the duties are near the same and as they are imported from countries to which france had an open trade it is not improbable many french silks have been among them and if more has not come in the difference made by the duties have been the apparent and only reason and the same reason must hold good still as long as the same duties remain  an account of the quantities of wrought silks imported annually from all parts of europe distingushing the countries viz the several countries and species from christmas   0  to christmas   0  to christmas   0  to christmas    0 total of the three years l l l l germany  dutch wrought         italian wrought                    holland  dutch wrought                      italian wrought                   0 italy  italian wrought       0         0 0

all that can be alleged against this is to beg the question and say that there will be more imported now but before that can be allowed they should show a good reason why more was not imported in these years abovestated being the quantity from italy was always much greater before the raising the duties here and that reason which is good for preventing the importation from italy will be good for preventing it from any other country  what has been said against the reason of this is so little to the purpose and with such little force that it is worth no notice the facts are so clearly made out that they amount even to demonstration the high duties have effectually checked the importation of wrought silks and will do so still if the french had their raw silks cheaper than we have it how comes it to pass that so much weight has been put upon the levant companys obtaining a liberty of exporting raw silk from england to france which is obtained for them by the treaty and which the company are now fully satisfied is settled to their advantages if the french had raw silks cheaper than the english it would be absurd to spoke of our sending raw silks from england to france goods are shipped from port to port to mend their market not to lessen their value if our merchants did not advance the price they would never send their goods abroad  not only the french have not their raw silk cheaper than england but on the contrary england has their raw silks cheaper than all the world those countries excepted who have it of their own and this will appear by the great quantity of raw silk exported from england to other countries as also of mohair yarn which is equally concerned in the argument and the following abstract of one year may give a specimen  an account of raw silk and mohairyarn exported into foreign parts from christmas   0  to christmas    0 viz raw silk mohairyarn pounds weight pounds weight              it would be an unaccountable trade if it should be true that other nations had raw silk cheaper than we have it when at the same time they should buy such quantities of it every year from us  if any nation in the world can have raw silk cheaper than england italy may be thought to be the place because they have great quantities  sicily included of silks of their own growth it will be hard to assign a reason why italy who have silk of their own and with whom our trade has been always open should by our high duties be obstructed from sending their wrought silks to england and france who buy great quantities of silk from us should not  as the like arts have been made use of to possess the people with an opinion that the interest of britain has been neglected with respect to the portugal trade which were before employed in that of the french so it will easily be made appear it has been done with the like weakness and it is hoped it shall be with the like success  it is alleged that the treaty with france and the treaty formerly made with portugal and no subsisting are inconsistent with one another that the effect of the treaty with france will be the essing the importation of portugal wines by lowering the duties on the french that this will lessen the consumption of our woollen manufactures in portugal that our trade there will be enirely lost by a prohibition of all our woollen manufactures in portugal as it was before the war and the like  it is needful to go back and look into the former state of the portugal trade before the late treaty and enquire into the nature and reason of the alterations additions and increases which have been accidents to that trade and which have brought it from what it was to what it now is in which if the causes assigned for it is increase are mistaken the notions we entertain of such and such things endangering its decrease will appear equly groundless  two general and vulgar errors or mistakes are entertained among us relating to the first part of the portugal trade viz what it was before the treaty with portugal and two more relating to what it now is or will be by reason of the peace the mistakes about what it was are   that the portuguese had prohibited all our woolllen manufactures   that the increase of our trade or export to portugal was occasioned by and depended upon the increase of our demand for their wines our mistakes about what the portugal trade is now or is like to be are   that upon our reducing the duties of french wine by the treaty of commerce with france to an equality with the portuguese wines the wine trade from portugal will be ruined and we shall import no more   that upon this the portuguese will immediately prohibit our woollen manufactures and so that great trade which it is alleged though falsely too exports two millions yearly in the growth and manufacture of great britain will be lost  if every one of these may be clearly proved to be mistakes and that neither the things suggested or the consequences drawn from them can be supported by truth or reason then all our uneasiness about this portugal trade will appear causeless and ill grounded to do this there needs no more than to state matters of fact and give such proofs of every thing as the case will admit    that all our woolen manufactures were prohibited before the war is a mistake and truly this is a mistake of such a nature so obvious and so easy to be confuted that it is wonderful it should be expected by any body to do their arguments any service it is well known upon the exchange and no portugal merchants of any long standing can be ignorant that the prohibition was only of our medley cloths which were forbidden not only to be imported there but to be worn the reasons whereof also were assigned viz not that they set about the making them there as some alleged but because they found their people forward to run into the french way of clothing and dressing themselves which the court for many reasons thought fit to prevent but no man who has any competent knowledge of the portugal trade will pretend that the bays says perpets serges stuffs stockings cotions plains kerseys etc which were always the gross of the english exportations to portugal were ever under any prohibition there or any other of our woollen manufactures the woollen cloths as above only excepted  that what is said here may as it is resolved all things in this paper shall carry it is evidence along with it the words of the late treaty with portugal may be produced for proof in the second articles after the proportion between the customs of portuguese wines and the custom of french wines is settled follow these words butt if this abatements of customs as is presumed to be made shall be after any manner prejudiced or abolished shall be just and lawful for his sacred royal majesty of portugal again to forbid the woollen cloths  from hence may be noted also that this part of the agreement was not so absolutely and  laid down as an essential of the treaty between england and portugal without which the peace of the two nations could not subsist but provision was expressly made in the very article that if it should be abolished yet the peace should rmain entire only the king of portugal would then be at liberty if he thought  make himself amend upon england by prohibiting the english woollen cloths  the next vulgar error or mistake which we are led into about the portugal trade is that the increase of our exports of the woollen manufactures of great britain to portugal is occasioned by and depends upon the increase of our demand for their wines this however absurd and in its nature contrary to the truth of fact is the thing on which the argument is made to turn from which they would infer that as our demand for portugal wine decreased so will their demand for our manufactures decline and in short that if by the coming in of french wines the portugal wine shall be wholly left off as they vainly suggest so will also the demand for our woollen manufactures in portugal cease and that trade be lost  the people who argue thus confute themselves in their own calculations for first to magnify the portugal trade they tell us that we export thither annually the value of two millions sterling most of it in the woollen manufactures of great britain against this give them leave to make their own estimates of the wine we import from thence and take the largest year and the highest price they can reasonably suppose the quantity will not amount to above   or  000 ton which account there will in the pursuit of this article appear reason to make great abatement of too but were it so and account the wines prime cost one with another at    l per ton or to please them at  0 l per ton which is much above the true cost in in portugal they will not amount to  00000 l which by their own account is less than one tenth part of the demand for our manufactures this will very ill make it out that their demand for our manufactures is occasioned by and depends upon our demand for their wines by which they must make it appear that the nine parts of the trade depend upon the tenth and the greater is occasioned by the less which is an absurdity in the very nature of the thing  but the matter of fact is evident and known to all that have any tolerable knowledge of the portugal trade viz that the increase of the trade to portugal has been occasioned by the discovery within these few years of the gold mines of st paul in the brazils by which an immense treasure is gained yearly to the portugueze nation as well as to their king that by ths means the people in brazil are so increased in weath and the trade to brazil are so increased as a consequence that the leets which about twelve years ago were usually twentythree to twentyeight sail of ships from lisbon to brazil are now seventy eighty to a hundred sail and the exports of english goods to portugal are increased in proportion  this is the true and the only reason of the increase of their demand for english manufactures and ths has no more dependence upon or is occasioned by our demand for their wines than it depends upon any thing that has no relation at all to it  it is very strange to find the opposers of any argument lay the whole stress and weight of what they have to say upon any thing which they are not very sure they can support the truth of but it is perfectly surprising to see men value themselves and their cause upon accounts and calculations which are fraudulent and erroneous known by themselves to be so and which they might be sure in an age like this when men take nothing upon trust would by inquiring heads be soon detected and exposed  nothing of this kind can be more wonderful than what we see practiced just now by some people in handing about a paper called a scheme of the trade between england and france in order to make the trade between england and france look with an aspect to please them and to answer all the romantic things they have said of it which paper or scheme was printed in      and said to be signed by several eminent merchants of the city of london  something might be said to the design of that paper when it was first published and to the persons who signed it viz that it was calculated for a design then on foot to expose the public management and divide the people against the court  it may be proper than for the detecting the fraud of this scheme to enter into an examination of some of the particulars wherein it differs from the true account of that year which shall be done by giving a brief abstract of the said scheme and likewise of the true account from the custom house as it is now laid before the honorable house of commons by the commissioners  by both which it will appear that the design of this paper called a scheme was then and the making it public is now to lessen in the public opinion the value of our exprtations to france and to increase or heighten the value of our importations from france a design in it self dishonest but much more so from the manner of doing it as will appear by what follows  our exportatons to france from michaelmas to michaelmas       are made by the scheme to amount to l     0   0  0  and all the species of goods are restrated to these few viz woollen cloths dozens kerseys rashes pennystones cottns flannels hose bays stuffs serges and perpets with some petties which are crowded together at the value of  0000 l  two observations shall contain what is sufficient to say to this part of it and nothing can be desired to expose it more    that here is not half of the species of goods named which are every year exported to france and which as appears by the customhouse books were actually exported to france that year    that of the species of goods which they have named they have not set down the true quantities which were really exported to france that very year  these are such tokens of a designed collusion and prevarication that nothing of that kind can be more corrupt  but to descend to a few particulars of this fraud that the people may see in how gross a manner they are imposed upon    take a few of the articles mentioned by the scheme of goods exported to france       as aforesaid and when compared with the real entries of that year in the customhouse books from the port of london according to the account given in by the commissioners and now lying before the house of commons  and any one upon casting up the following particulars will see to what a magnitude this part will amount  the difference stands thus exported as by the scheme really exported as by the customhouse books spanish cloths      0   long cloths         short cloths       northern dozens double     0  ditosingle        devon dozens and cloth rashes         pennystones       kersies        0  norwich stuffs       0  serges and perpets              add to this that to lessen the appearance of our trade to france they have wholly omitted all the fish such as herrings pilchards salmon and white fish all our plantation goods and all the goods of other countries reexported by us to france of which the quantities exported that very year were very great and are so every year the particulars are too long to set down here but may be guessed at by these few  cotton wool and yarn       l goats hair or wool  0    indico      sugar brown  0 000 pepper        tobacco   0    callicoes      pieces oil  0  ton drugs    0  l  besides prodigious quantities of other goods exported to france that year as may be seen by the said account from the customhouse now lying before the house of commons  the remaining particulars are so many as makes it plain that the value of our exportations to france for that year exceeded the value of our importations from france very considerably as by the customhouse books will appear  the errors in the account of the importations are no less unfairly stated than these and the fraud is extended to a much greater value nay even the manner of stating it discovers a design of imposing upon the public for first the export is confine to the port of london only with an allowance of one third more for the out ports whereas the import is said to be for the whole kingdom let them take it which way they please  if their imports are for the ports of london only then they have committed a fraud in the quantities to the value of above        pounds as will be proved by the customhouse books  if their imports take in the whole kingdom then they have committed two frauds instead of one   in the quantities and   in offering to state the debtor side of the account upon the port of london with a guess at one third more of the outports against all that they say was imported in the whole kingdom  if they had designed a fair and just account they ought to have stated the exports and imports exactly for the port of london and have made the addition of one third for the out ports equal to both sides and have stated both sides upon the imports and exports of the whole kingdom for if the exports exceed the imports for the port of london only as appears by the customhouse books it would have been much more so for the outports because many of our outports which lie in or near those countries where the woollen manufactures are made fish cured etc export much greater quantities to france than they could consume the value of in french goods as exeter colchester yarmouth and many other ports  but the prevarications are yet more gross and the value greater as one part makes the exportations to france seem less so the other as dexterously makes the importations from france seem more nor will their making a guess or wholsale allowance of one third for the outports on one side answer for it unless they had either made the same allowance serve on both sides or extended the account to the same period of time on both sides without it but acting fairly did not seem to suit the design  those who would support the paper called a scheme produce a paper said to be signed by the farmers of the customs containing an account of the importations of wines brandies and linen from france from michaelmas      to michaelmas      which they make to be very large and from whence they would argue that one half thereof must be the rule of the year      had this been a mere guess or had it been at any other time the calculation might have been less suspected but there lies so just an exception against the year      and it was so well known to them that it cannot be any thing but a mere design  it is well known the plague had in the year      put an universal stop to all trade except such as necessity forced the people to for mere provisions the next year the fire of london happened and as the fire began near the water side and among the warehouses and cellars of the merchants the quantities of wines as well as of other goods which were spoiled or destroyed were very great add to this a war with france and holland by which the trade with both was stopped and which war was not ended till the treaty at breda in july       these things might well suppose england to be so exhausted of french goods as that the importation of the next year viz      must be prodigious great and no rational judgment can be made of the trade to or from france by the accounts of that year this is farther demonstrated by the article of the brandies which the account of the farmers aforesaid makes for the said two years to be but      ton but by an account of the same farmers for the last five quarters of the said two years viz from michaelmas      to michaelmas      the whole quantity of brandy imported amounts to no more than   0 ton and yet the scheme affirms there was  000 ton of brandy imported from michaelmas      to michaelmas      and this is offered as one undeniable evidence of the fraud of that scheme  there may be a parallel case found out to illustrate this and that is of the exportation of lead from england to france in the year      which amounts to as by the customhouse books a most prodigious and unusual quantity viz from michaelmas      to michaelmas      there was exported from england to france       fodder of lead which at    l per fodder as the scheme allows the price to be amounts to    0   l it would be acknowledged very unfair that this should be given in as an article of our usual export of lead to france for as an extraordinary year is no just rule to take a medium of calculation from so no more is the year      to be taken as a proper time to calculate our importation of wine from france the preceding accidents of a plague the fire and the war joining together to make the demand for wines that year extraordinary great  perhaps it is a fate upon us that the inconveniences and illconsequences of rejecting a trade so evidently beneficial to england must be discovered by our experience and must be felt before they will be known in which case this paper will have occasion not only to mention those inconveniences before hand but to remind you of them when they happen  this paper shall also in its course be adapted to the several trading counties and towns of great britain to make appear that now the war is ended all the goods and commodities of france may be imported into this kingdom especially such as are to be reexported as brandies linens silks paper laces etc since upon such reexportation all the additional duties are drawn back when at the same time not one yard of the woollen manufacture of great britain which are all prohibited in france nor of our fish and other material commodities can be imported into france the articles not being made effectual  the instances of this shall be hereafter especially applied to the particular trading places of great britain who will thereby be able to judge whether this is not the true state of their case and whether the dutch or flemings will now have the importation of our manufactures into france as they have had for above  0 years last past and reserve to themselves the dressing dying and finishing of those goods whereby the manufacturers of great britain will become slaves to foreigners who will either set their own price upon our manufactures or set up fabrics of their own in imitation of them all which might have been avoided by having an open and direct trade with france  this paper shall not suggest so much unhappiness to great britain whose general good it is designed to promote as to propose that the articles of commerce shall not in time to come be farther considered the parliament of britain who are the true judges of their countries good cannot be supposed to omit any thing that shall be apparently for the public advantage and therefore when it shall appear to them which we will not question that these articles are proper to be reconsiderd they will no doubt act therein as reason and justice requires  in the mean time seeing we are to carry on our trade without the advantages which were expected from the treaty let us enquire upon what terms we are to carry it on and how we shall trade with france for the time coming  the tariff of      is now no more to be mentioned in this affair the low duties which our goods would have paid in france are out of the question the edict of   0  must now be the rule of our trade in france and that this may be understood without any difficulty and be as little subject to mistakes as possible the edict it self may be its own exposior of which the following is a faithful abstract  an arrest of the kingscouncil of state containing a rule for the importation of goods and merchandises of the manufactures of england scotland and ireland and the dominions thereunto belonging september  th   0   his majesty continuing his application for the profit and advantage of his subjects in matters of trade etc and being in his council has forbidden and prohibited and does hereby forbid and prohibit from the day of the publication of these presents the importation into

specified coming from the said countries of england scotland or ireland or the dominions thereunto belonging in whatsoever ships or vessels they shall come upon their importation into his majestys dominions shall pay the following duties that is to say  live sol rock alum per c weight  0 00 glassbottles double or single per c  0 00 english beer per bottle 00  0 beeswax yellow per c 0  00 ditto

00  this is a strict view of the present state of the english commerce in france and these are but part of the burdens and encumbrances of our trade there which her majesty by the treaty of commerce with france and in her just concern for the good of her kingdoms had procured to have her subjects delivered from but the articles being not made effectual they are now to continue so that our trade is to remain in general prohibited there till some act shall be passed here to render effectual the provisions made for a freedom of commerce and till two months after all which time the profits of an advantageous trade are lost to this nation  it is also to be observed that while all these high duties and prohibitions remain upon our trade into france most of the french goods are still at liberty to be imported here paying the high duties the case of which will be that for all of those which may be reexported whither to our plantations the spanish west indies or other parts those high duties will be all drawn back and the french goods be so far prejudicial to our manufactures without our having any share of the advantage from the trade to france  in like manner the wines and brandies which may be used at sea or in foreign parts will draw back all the high duties and for the other part viz the home consumption they will be brought in as spanish and portugal wines and brandies or else smuggled upon the coast the silks linen paper etc will come in as dutch and flemmish by which means the french will have the benefit of the peace as to their part of the trade and britain will be entirely shut out or be subservient to foreigners who shall carry it on for their own benefit as they have done for  0 years last past  there have been diverse representations made to the king of france himself by his own subjects as well merchants and manufacturers as others all against the treaty of commerce with great britain and especially against the eighth and ninth articles the same which our people are offended with complaining and with great earnestness too against admitting the english woollen manufactures into france upon the low duties of      as what will be ruinous to the manufactures set up with so great success in france for that the english will now bring in all their woollen manufactures upon them in such great quantities that those made in languedoc in porton in picardy and other places will be ruined that the english make those goods so much better than they can be made in france and they will be so cheap the high duties which his majesty had laid on not so much to enrich his treasury as to encourage the industry of his own subjects being taken off even as far back as the tariff of      that the french goods will find no sale but that the english goods will in proportion to their goodness be sold much cheaper than any can be made in france farther these representations go on in very pressing though humble terms it being spoken to their king to complain that an open trade with england will always be to the great damage and loss of the french for say they the french nation has very few goods to send to the english but whereof other nations have the like kinds and do also import the same into england but the english have diverse goods to send to france of which no other nation can send the like that is to say lead tin leather alum coal pilchards salmon and several other kinds whereas the wines of france are supplied to the english by portugal the brandy by spain the wrought silks by genoa and the duchy of milan the fruits and perfumes by italy and the linen and paper by hamburgh and holland  for these reasons they represnt that the treaty of commerce with great britain as it is now fixed would be distuctive and an entire ruin to the trade of the french nation concluding that france can never recover it is wealth and greatness if such a treaty of commerce should be permitted to take place and unless some way be found out to continue the high duties and thereby to keep out the english manufactures from being permitted to come into france  these representations seem to rally the english for what they call a stupidity incredible that they prohibit trading with france at the beginning of the first war by which  say they the manufactures of france have arrived to a great height which it was impossible should have been if the english woollen manufactures had continued to have been sent into france and insinuate that it should have been the most christian king not the late king william who should have caused a prohibition of trade to have been published for that the english trade was the only destructive thing to the industry of the french nation  these arguments are so pungent and carry with them so much weight that it makes a most pointed satyr upon the french king that he should not comply with their desires but it must be acknowledged that if their reasons are just on the french side it will be hard to find that our complaints of this trade can be reasonable on the other side for it is hardly rational to suggest that the trade between these two nations can be to the disadvantage and loss on both sides  many delusions have been spread about to amuse and deceive the people in this matter of the treaty of commerce with france some of which have been detected and duly exposed and many who have been deceived by them begin to recover their judgments and to find that the treaty which they have been prevailed upon to reject and contemn is really a foundation of the most advantageous commerce that britain can be engaged in that the french must trade with us under the most disadvantageous conditions imaginable that our export will be easy to us their imports here hard and laden with burdens to them and we begin to see these people now repent the opposition they have all along made to their countries good and would undo what others have done if it was in their power to do so  but there are still mistakes behind which must be removed and objections which however they may be illgrounded yet require some notice of them as especially this viz that there are but three ports in france at which our manufactures are admitted to be imported viz st vallery on the soame roan and bourdaux it is wonderful to reflect how much this prevails in the minds of the people considering it is evident that the limiting the ports for entry concern only the two species viz the cloths and clothserges which is plain by the specifications of the treaty and not all the rest of our woollen manufactures but as to all our other woollen manufactures bays says serges perpets stuffs druggets dozens kersies stockings etc all our reexported goods such as cottons indicoes sugars east india and turkey goods and all other they are feely allowed by the treaty to be imported into all the ports of france and before this treaty the said two species of manufactures were confined to but two ports viz calais and st vallery on the same  it has been said that the reason why the french confined our said woollen manufactures to certain ports for their importations was that the land carriage and local duties of the said goods should rise so hgh upon them that the price should thereby be made too great for the buyer and give the advantage to their own manufactures let such people but look back upon their own arguments they are not only false in themselves but inconsistent with one another for if this were true then it must be true also that their own manufactures stood in need of those helps that their own manufactures were so inferior to the engish that if the utmost discouragements were not put upon the english goods the french manufactures would not be told that the english manufactures so excelled the french in the real intrinsic value that if these were admitted though upon the hardest terms to be imported into france yet they would gain ground there and to be brief would sell before the french albeit the difference made by the burden of duties there was at that time above  0 per cent and these things they will not allow having on many occasions published that the french manufactures are as good as ours and if permitted to come into england would ruin our own  but on the other hand this suggestion cannot in general be true for had it been so that the limiting the importation of the woollen manufactures of britain to a few certain ports was contrived to load the said goods with the farther burdens of landcarriage etc why then should the ports they were limited to be chosen out upon the greatest navigable rivers in france nearest to the place where the center of their trade lay and where the chief consumption of our manufactures was to be expected for example roan and bourdeaux the city of roven lies on the river sein and is to paris as gravesend is to london from thence the navigation of the sein conveys every thing by water upon five great rivers viz by the oyse and the aisne into the isle of france and the lower champain to the city of rhiemes the rhetelois and the edge of the duchy of bar by the river maza through the whole province of champain by the yonne into burgundy and nivernois and by the river loyng and the canal de briare into the great river loyre to the cities of orleans nevers blais tours angers etc even down to the occean and through the very heart of france again the city of bourdeaux is the center of the english commerce in france and where the greatest number of our ships resort for the wine and brandies which are brought from thence therefore appointing bourdeaux as one of the ports for the import of our manufactures was rather making the trade easy than difficult to the english and so far from a design of making our goods dear and increasing the charges upon them that it was rather giving ease to it by opening that only port to which the english could bring them upon the easiest terms of freight and where the greatest demand for those goods was to be found where the principal consumption of them might be excepted and where the greatest convenience of ireland navigation was to be had in order to convey the said manufactures to all parts of the kingdom of france for the city of bourdeaux stands on the garonne from whence they have a navigation by other rivers viz the dordonne quite through perigott and limosin into auvergne by the river lot through quercy and rovergne even to the sevennes and by the royal canal from the city of thoulouse on the garonne quite through the province of languedoc to narbonne and into the mediterranean sea supplying the whole provinces of gascoign guienne and languedock with british manufactures by water carriage  this rather seems to intimate to us that the french king finding it convenient on other accounts to limit the importation of these goods to certain ports yet appointed those ports so as that his subjects might have the goods brought with the greatest ease and the least charge that could be to those markets where the greatest consumption of them was and where the principal traders in those goods were settled who from thence supplied the whole kingdom by the convenience of watercarriage as to the reason of naming particular ports and places for the importation of these goods it is known to those who are acquainted with the affairs of france that it was occasioned by the differing circumstances of the contracts with the farmers and was a thing practiced in other cases in france as well as in this of the woollen manufactures as particularly the drugs and spices which are limited in almost the same manner  also this limiting the importation of goods to certain ports is not a new practice or peculiar to france only the like is done in england particularly the alamodes and lustrings are confined to the port of london and the importation of wool from ireland is limited to three or four ports only but however is so ordered not that the irish wool should by reason of landcarriage be made dearer to our manufactures than the english in order to discourage the importation of it but for other particular reasons drawn from the circumstances of the thing it self and therefore the towns to which the importations of irish wool is limited are such as are not only nearest and most convenient by their situation for the coming from ireland but nearest and most convenient to those parts of england where the manufacturers live who make use of irish wool and are the principal buyers and consumers thereof as mieead for the sergemakers of taton are biddiford or bastable for the sergemakers of exeter tiverton etc at lverpool for the clothiers of yorkshire and lancashire and the like  had not the convenience of the manufacturers been consulted in this limitation but on the contrary had it been contrived or appointed on purpose to add the burden and expense of landcarriage to the price of the wool bristoll might have been named milfordhae or any port in wales which though lying as wel for the navigation of the irish vessels would yet have greatly increased the price of the wool to the manufacturers by the charges of carrying it on horseback after it was landed in like manner had the king of france limited the importation of the english manufactures with design as it is alleged to enhance the price by landcarriage he would have chosen such ports for their importation as were most remote from those parts where the principal consumptions of them was known to be and most remote from the conveniences of watercarriage this was very easy for him to have done had he amed the cities of rochell and st mall for example instead of roan and bourdeaux the case had been quie altered there being no river navigable near them and then it would have been difficult to have assigned any other reason for such limitation than that of discouraging and burthening the trade but as it is now there is no room for any supposition of that kind  further it might be demanded why the french king should not rather lay still higher dties on the said woollen manufactures than study to raise their price by the difficulties of their importation the former being the readiest method of discourging their market and which would at the same time have brought in some gain to the crown which is an article they are far from being forgetful of in france  much has been said in discoursing on this subject about the balance of the french trade being against england that the balance formerly against england has been disputed and that with good reason the contrary in many particulars evidently appearing but that the balance will be against england now is too evident for it is impossible to be otherwise the nature of the trade will not permit it to be otherwise the french will bring in great quantities of their goods here of which some will always be consumed at home what price soever they cost and all that we want for reexportation whether to our own colonies or other parts will go abroad drawing back the high duties which as it is alleged are to hinder our trading in them so that still all our foreign commerce so far as these kind of goods are demanded will be french  against this it is demanded how must payment be made all our trade to france is in some respect prohibited as has been shown by the edict of   0  published mercator no    and what is not prohibited is loaded with such high duties as are almost equal to a prohibition we have been told that we pay for all the goods we buy in france with ready money whether we did or no before may be debated another time but it is evident that we shall buy now the articles not being made effectual must be paid for with money or not paid for at all for the french will take nothing of us so that they having formerly shut the door of commerce against england we have bolted it now on the wrong side and will not suffer them to open it again although they are willing to do it  if the balance of trade by this means runs against britain which before always ran against france we cannot blame them but must blame our selves who have been willing to have it so and have so blamed our partyinterest with our tradinginterest as to ruin the one in order to carry on the other  the objection upon which all this matter seemed to turn has been that the french have now all kinds of woollen manufactures of their own making and have no need of our trade this is carried such a length by some that they insist that the french make all the sorts of our woollen manufactures as good as the english and much cheaper than they can be made here that they are able not only to supply themselves but other countries nay all countries says one author and britain too says another author but it would be asked of these warm people why then do they so strictly and carefully exclude prohibit or load with duties all the english woollen manufactures if their own are better and cheaper than the english their quality would be a prohibition as effectual as an edict or arrest du conseil and much more and other prohibitions would be needless  but whatever we are pleased to say the french know better and as they have good reason to be most sensible of the defects of their own manufactures so they are very careful to keep the english goods out that the goodness of one against the meanness of the other may not be discovered by the trade it self nothing can be a more undeniable proof of the mistake of those people who talk so warmly of the goodness and cheapness of the french manufactures than the french king laying such repeated burdens upon the english goods and after this was done and several times increased yet when the manufacturers there found that notwithstanding their high duties and burdens the english goods would be bought by their people whatever they cost being recommended so effectually by their own worth and goodness that all the french could do in the mere way of trade would be of no signification to it they petitioned the french king to grant a total prohibition of woollen manufactures which he did and this was all done during a time of peace so that the war is not the reason of this case but the mere nature of the trade and it is easy to be discovered that it had been to small purpose to go about making woollen manufactures in france if the english woollen manufactures were not effectually prohibited  her majesty on the other hand has so effectually secured to her subjects all the advantages of the french trade that she has not only obtained the revocation of all that the king of france had been doing for  0 years for the encouragement of his subjects in the woollen manufactures by which she gives her own people a full opportunity to extend their trade into all parts of france with advantage but on the contrary has continued upon the french importations hither all those inequalities and extraordinary duties which were needful to exclude them from any prejudicial excesses in england to the disadvantage of her own people by both which the balance of that trade is effectually secured to be on the english side and we are in a fair way to recover all the injury done to our commerce by the last impungent prohibitions  would these people turn the tables and make this case their own what may we suppose they would say if the queen of great britain had in her majestys treaty of commerce consented to take off the high duties laid on the importation of those french manufactures which our people have been encouraged by those high duties to make here and given permission by this new treaty to the french to import the said goods upon the low duties which the same goods paid here before the year      for example should the duties on french alamodes and lustrings have been reduced to   s per l which they paid before the war instead of    s  0 d which they are to pay now should the duties on french brandy which by this treaty is to remain at above    l per ton have been reduced to  0 s as it was before the revolution may we not suppose the distiller of corn and mollasses the weavers of alamodes and lustrings and the dealers under them all would have made representations and complaints of their trade being ruined and given up to the french their families impoverished etc like as we find the french merchants and manufactures in france have done on their side to their king and for which we must acknowledge they have very good reason  it is scarcely worth while to mention here much less to give an answer to a report very confidently spread about and which some people are weak enough to take upon trust viz that by the treaty of commerce leave was to be given to export our wool unwrought into france but as it is certain that such a rport is industriously spread about where it is thought there is ignorance enough to suffer so great a desion it is reasonable to observe from it what endeavors are used by some among us to impose upon the people of this nation in the grossest manner for the carrying on other designs equally destructive to the public safety  but to return to what was mentioned viz of the real abatement of duties which is obtained by this treaty it may be a profitable explanation of the present treaty of commerce and may prevent the prejudices which some entertain against this treaty should a brief account be given them of the difference between the present state of our trade with france and what it has been at several times when it has nevertheless been carried on by us to advantage and what it was to have been by the treaty or would have been had the articles been made effectual and as this shall be done in brief tables referring to the several heads of our exportation as they now lie before us so they may afterward be brought down one by one to the particular trading towns and counties of britain where those branches of our manufactures are carried on  to begin with our woollen manufactures all which now stand prohibited and must do so till the said articles are made effectual the following table will show what duties are taken off by this treaty and upon what low duties they would have been admitted into france by this treaty had it been made effectual as well as what prohibitions and high duties the trade now labors under  the following is an account of several goods and woollen manufactures of great britain now prohibited in france the time when the high duties were laid upon them before the said prohibition with what they were to pay by the tariff of      which was to take place if the eighth and ninth articles of the treaty had been made effectual  anno

concerned for those who are or for the woollen manufactures of britain in general who can read this table without being sensible of the disadvantage our trade lies under in the present situation of our commerce with france when they shall read the word prohibited continually before every article of our woollen manufacture and shall remember that for twelve years past none of all those goods have been admitted into france but by way of holland whereas very great quantities of woollen manufactures were yearly exported thither before besides other goods of the growth and production of our own country or of our plantations which is the same thing and ought so to be esteemmed  when the queen who always had the good of her subjects and the prosperity of their commerce at her heart found it was in her power to open such a door of trade to her people on terms so much to the loss and disadvantage of france and so evidently to the advantage of her own kingdoms it could not but be with great satisfaction that her majesty gave in charge to her ministers and plenipotentiaties to conclude a treaty which took off all the burdens and prohibitions which the mistakes of former years had brought upon the trade and by which her enemies were obliged to make deep wounds in their own trade to comply with those demands  but it must be very disobliging to the queen as well as very surprising to her faithful subjects to see in what manner some people receive and how disingeniously they construe all her majestys endeavors to show her affectionate concern for the welfare of her subjects and the prosperity of their commerce as if that very care which her majesty has so eminently expressed for their good was a contrivance of her and their enemies to betray us to the french and to give up the british interest in trade to the most dangerous rivals they have in the world  certainly mankind cannot be so far carried away with the stream of their passions as to deny this general maxim that nothing ought to be believed in such public debates as these but what is proved this paper has from its beginning taken this for a rule and therefore brings authentic proofs with it of every thing it says yet these men say it is all lies on the contrary they bring no proof at all of what they say and yet they expect to be believed  to shorten the dispute the mercator shall as modestly as the case will allow make a fair challenge to all opposers which if they do not answer they can but ill justify any of their future objections against the truth of what is alleged in this paper  the challenge is that whereas they charge this paper with lying they ought to descend to particulars and stating it truly let the world know what one thing it is the mercator has affirmed asserted made public as truth which is not so if this cannot be done the charge of lying will turn back upon them with great disadvantage to themselves  one condition only must be desired of them viz that they will not expect any thing should be taken upon trust on one side more than on the other and therefore that they will be careful as the mercator has always done to quote their authorities for all they shall say the validity of which when confronted with those of this paper may be easily examined and the readers may judge whether are in the right if they do not think fit to do this as the mercator will not think it worth while to take any notice of them so neither can they expect it of any one else  that their scheme of which they oasted is it self one general complication of fraud and false representations has been made appear even to both houses of parliament the mercator in that as in every other case of like nature says nothing from himself but spakes the language of the custom house books gives exact copies of the commissioners reports signed under their hands and proves every thing in particular by authentic papers if these are false the mercator would be very willing to see the proof of it if any mistake has happened whether wilful or by the negligence of clerks the books are remaining and may be referred to why do not these people tell us where these mistakes lie why do they not prove that the mercators has made false draughts of those accounts and reports omitted any thing or added any thing to make his arguments appear the better as on the other hand has been proved to be their practice even in a most scandalous manner in their late scheme under the hands of the commissioners of the customs and by them laid before both houses of parliament  all the use this paper shall make of this unfair usage is only to proceed with the same caution in all that it shall make public still taking care to offer nothing but what is sufficiently confirmed by such authorities as shall always stand the test of the strictest examination taking no notice of any thing which shall be said in opposition to it unless it comes likewise supported by such proofs as may give a due weight and make it reasonable to be inquired into  but to return to the subject of trade from which as few digressions as possible shall be made in this paper  the last mercator gave a true prospect of the state of one branch of our trade in france as it now stands and as it might now have stood had the treaty taken place that is to say the branch of trade which concerns our woollen manufactures in particular the manufacturers of great britain may there see what circumstances they are now in as to trade and what their unnatural joy is built upon which they have so publicly shown at the delay of the advantages which they might by this time have rafted of in their trade  next to the said exportation of our woollen manufacture the fishing trade is our immediate concern and that more especially since our union with scotland the northern parts of britain have a peculiar interest in the fishery and the securing a market in france for the great quantities of fish that are or may be cured in scotland and in the north and west parts of england is of so great consequence to this nation that it cannot be omitted in a treaty of commerce  the french had not forgotten this part or to encourage their own subjects to launch into the fishery as well as into the other branches of our trade the high duties in france laid upon fish from great britain were an effectual support to the french projects of fishing and a bar to the fishing of great britain for scotland by the union being brought into the same prohibitions and being esteemed as the same nation came thereby also under the same inconveniences of trade and lost the advantage of their trade to france which before was very considerable especially in fish scotland having always before the union exported to france yearly a very great quantity of herring salmon and white fish  it cannot but be grateful to all those parts of britain which are sensible of the benefit of the fishery and who depend upon the exportation of the fish when taken to understand that the importation of our fish into france is now by this treaty left open upon very easy terms and particularly upon the same terms with the dutch which could never be obtained before  the just care and concern which her majesty has shown for the interest of her own subjects and the extent of their commerce has been seen in removing that inequality and providing that our fishery shall now be upon the same foot with that of the dutch and have the same encouragement of an open trade to france a thing which however the dutch have taught us to reject here they always took care to secure for themselves and found no little advantage in it  the merchants and gentlemen of the northpart of britain and of the west also have frequently expressed to the government their great concern for the obtaining this liberty of commerce and the great advantages which it would be to them if obtained as may be seen by the representation of the royal buroughs in scotland formerly sent up to the lords commissioners of trade and of others also and unless we could suppose them to act in contradiction to themselves it must be a particular satisfaction to them all to see what provision her majesty has made for the said fishingtrade by this treaty and it must be impossible without an infatuation which it would be rude to suggest that the merchants and trading people of scotland of the north of england of the coasts about ymouth and loestff or the counties of cornwall and devon can be drawn into say they are pleased that the articles of this treaty remain ineffectual  having thus often mentioned scotland and the fishingtrade it is proper also to take notice how by the present treaty her majesty made it her especial care in behalf of her scots subjects as well as english to have all those new burdens which were laid upon the british fishing trade only and which gave that trade away from us to the dutch taken away in france and as it is very surprising that the power of any partyinfluence should make us in england insensible of such advantages so the next paper shall let you see what those advantages are and that they are not equally disregarded in scotland as they are here  finis
