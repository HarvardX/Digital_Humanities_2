it maam there is a club of us all young batchelors the sweetest society in the world and we meet three times a week at each others lodgings where we drink tea hear the chat of the day invent fashions

intentions    biddy ha ha ha   frib go you wild thing pats her the devil take me but there is no talking to you  how can you use me in this barbarous manner if i had the constitution of an alderman it
