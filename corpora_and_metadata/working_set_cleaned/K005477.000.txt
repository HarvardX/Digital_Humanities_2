an essay toward a definition of animal vitality read at the theater guys hospital january          in which several of the opinions of the celebrated john hunter are examined and controverted  by john thelwall member of the physical society etc  felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas virgil london printed by t rickaby and sold by g g j and j robinsons paternosterrow debrett piccadilly and cox st thomass street borough        entered at stationers hall  to henry cline esquire lecturer on anatomy and surgery and surgeon to st thomass hospital sir it is with no small degree of diffidence that i presume to dedicate this first effort at scientific investigation to you nor could i ever so far have prevailed upon myself had not my desire to testify the gratitude i feel for the many obligations i owe to yourself and family been considerably stronger than my hopes that any thing contained in this essay could be worthy of your attention  i do not sir approach you with the venal breath of panegyric nor can i have the presumption to hope that any laurels can be added to your reputation by one who has yet all his own to gather but as i am now hastening in a new character to the bar of the public i am actuated by a feeling natural enough to mankind  the desire of appealing first to that decision which is likely to have the strongest bias toward lenity and indulgence you sir need not be told the disadvantages under which i have attempted to form an opinion upon an abstruse physiological question which has always even to the most learned professors appeared to be involved in so much obscurity and doubt and you will perhaps be kind enough if my definition should ever engage so much attention as to be the object of conversation in those respectable medical circles you frequent to apologize for the imperfections of a young theorist whose information upon the subject has almost entirely been derived in the few hours he could steal from other studies and other pursuits from the lectures to which yourself mr haighton and mr ashley cooper have been so kind as to invite me it is an act of justice due to the celebrated lecturer on comparative anatomy to confess that i never was personally at his lectures and that except in the instance where i have mentioned the authority of the encyc brit my quotations are taken from the manuscript copy belonging to a very ingenious pupil who a few years ago was a constant and diligent attendant  i am aware sir that to this the illnatured critic might reply but why then intrude his puerile speculations on the world to this i must reply for myself that the reception of this little essay in the society the essay was disenssed for six successive nights to a theater particularly thronged and the following letter of thanks was officially addressed to the author theater guyshospital march         sir i am desired by the members of the physical society to return you their most sincere thanks for your excellent and very valuable essay toward a definition of animal vitality the abilities you displayed during the discussion and the instruction which this institution has received from your assistance in the debates  i am sir with the greatest respect your most obedient humble servant george johnson secretary j haighton praeses mr thelwall westen street borough   where it had the honor to be read was by far too flattering for a young man like myself to be insensible to and the solicitations of some of the most respected and intelligent members appeared a sufficient justification in the eye of prudence for hazarding its publication i have therefore committed it to the press in the assurance that if these gentlemen have leaned too far on the side of partiality i shall not fail to be set right again by the kind severity of some who will incline with sufficient force the other way among these however will not i am sure be enumerated the gentleman whose  with the utmost gratitude and esteem i have the honor to remain john thelwall maze pond southwark  an essay etc read to the physical society introduction mr president as my sole motive for becoming a member of this society was the pleasure i always derived from the enlightended conversation of gentlemen of the medical profession and as i have hitherto attended to the science only as a matter of entertaining curiosity and not as a pursuit to which i have any present intention of devoting myself i might perhaps without encountering the censure of the candid and considerate have endeavored to excuse myself from the execution of a talk to which the nature of my pursuits must necessarily render me so inadequate but as i am no friend to privileges and would have every member of society endure his proportion of the public burdens and as above all i would wish to exclude the idle drone from the hive of science i felt myself called upon to perform the part allotted by our institutions and to give every gentleman that opportunity of canvassing and controverting my opinions which with respect to theirs i have occasionally exercised myself  i have discarded therefore as far as possible the timidity naturally attendant upon the many disadvantages under which i labor and launching into a new and untried region have brought my little tribute of physical knowledge or rather speculation to the general fund confident only in the hope that the smallness of its value will in some degree be compensated by the cheerfulness with which it is contributed  my theory will no doubt be found in many respects defective from the want of more general information in the sciences of anatomy and physiology and may perhaps be erroneous in others from the misapprehension of scattered facts imperfectly collected without the concatenation of circumstances by which they might be elucidated and explained but such as it is i am sure the society would pardon its imperfections if they knew the numerous avocations among which it has been digested and the small proportion of time i have been enabled to devote to its composition  i make these observations not to abate the ardour of controversy or restrain the keenness of investigation it is from that ardour from that keenness and not from any vague conjectures in this essay that edification is to be expected by the society and so far am i from wishing to shelter my hypothesis behind the screen of any personal consideration that i should neither be displeased at being convinced that i am wrong nor backward in acknowledging my conviction reputation is not to be expected from so transient an attention as i have been enabled to pay to this subject nor can there be any disgrace in the failure of an attempt which is the result rather of necessity than of choice  in short candor of judgment and not indulgence in investigation is what i solicit from the society and for that i shall not solicit in vain  it is necessary however before i proceed to my subject to premise one remark i do not here profess to delineate a perfect system i have entitled my paper an essay and as such only i wish it to be considered i shall not therefore be expected to demonstrate every proposition or to draw out every part of my theory with amplitude and perspicuity  this i believe is what has never yet been done nor from the limits of our present knowledge can it rationally be expected of any hypothesis upon this subject the anatomical physiologist himself is frequently left to wander in the regions of conjecture the functions of almost every organ may be traced farther than the existence of such organs can be detected by the minutest enquiry analogy therefore is often called upon to supply the place of demonstration or the more easy expedient is appealed to of passing over in silence what cannot be readily accounted for many of the conjectures it is true which the imperfection of the senses or the deficiency of observation has rendered necessary to professors have gathered confidence from the great authorities by which they have been sanctioned yet let it not be forgotten that it is not in the nature of authorities to change conjectures into proofs let us remember also that reason is the greatest authority of all and that when systems clash and demonstrations are not to be had we ought not to consider who is the author of this or who of that opinion but which it is that involves the fewest absurdities or is best supported by analogy and the correspondence of the general laws of nature  an essay toward a definition of animal vitality it is an apparent paradox but it is not therefore the less true that those ideas or phenomena that are most familiar to us should frequently be the most difficult to explain this is particularly the case with the subject of the present essay  life is a term so constantly recurring and indeed as one would at first suppose an image so perpetually presenting itself to our senses  and the difference is so striking between the pale insensate corpse and a living being with all the expressions actions and attributes with which in the higher scale of animals he generally offers himself to our eyes or our imaginations that a vulgar observer would sneer at the philosopher who should suggest the difficulty of ascertaining in what vitality consists yet where is the student who upon serious examination has found himself satisfied with any thing that has been said upon the subject  does not the greatest anatomical philosopher even of the present enlightened age tacitly confess the confusion of his ideas in this respect when he declares that from an examination and survey of animal matter when dead only we gain an idea of living animal matter and that as from life only we gain an idea of death so from death only we gain an idea of life  before we can possibly derive any sort of information from this antithesis it is necessary that we should be instructed how life and death may be accurately discriminated for how are we to make comparisons between objects which we are unable to separate from each other but even this has never successfully been attempted for though there are certain signs as putrefaction etc by which the death of the animal may be demonstrated yet as it is not even pretended that putrefaction is the act of vital dissolution  or in other words that the body which is not putrid is necessarily alive  death must have taken place independently of any such change and we are therefore just as much in the dark as ever with respect to the ultimate test by which the presence of life may be ascertained  treatise after treatise has been written on the vital principle theory has pulled down theory without end and the gross contradictions which have marked the opinions of the greatest characters upon the subject might induce one to think that even with respect to the general idea we are still entirely at a loss that we are seeking for an imaginary something  a phantom of the brain which perhaps has no real existence and indeed if the term is to be literally understood  if this vital principle is to be considered as a distinct or independent essence separable from the effects and actions by which the state of vitality is to be ascertained i am not sure that this conclusion will be found to involve as much absurdity as is included in the contrary opinion  i am well aware that there are some who from the first blush of this observation may be inclined to smile and consider it as the ne plus ultra of skepticism but the philosopher will do well to keep the distinction between a vital principle and the state of vitality constantly in his mind the former properly meaning a living cause  the latter simply a modification or effect to which the name of life is given and which may be the result of a cooperation of other causes neither of which need in themselves of necessity be alive  in other words to contend for the existence of a vital principle is to contend that there is superadded to organized matter a distinct something in itself alive by which the vital functions are carried on while on the other hand the state of vitality need not of necessity be construed as meaning any thing more than the condition of the animal body during the continuance of those functions  now  that there is a state of animal existence that may properly be called the state of life and be put in direct contradistinction to that of death and that upon the previous induction of this state depend all the higher functions of the sensitive being are certainly among the most selfevident of all simple propositions nor is it less certain that there must be an exact and precise moment nay fraction or if i may so express myself mathematical point of a moment in which this state of life ceases and that of death begins though whether that moment can ever be ascertained by any sensible and positive mark of discrimination is matter of considerable doubt but if this vitality is to be considered ab origin as a principle by which physically or philosophically speaking i conceive is always to be understood a simple elementary and first natural cause and not as itself an effect of the cooperation of other principles or natural and preexisting causes i own for my own part i must be rather slow in yielding my assent and while i bow with respect to superior judgments must claim the prerogative of exercising my own  egypt greece and rome are it is true against me  the ancients and the moderns  aristotle and plato plutarch moses and john hunter and yet against this host of giants i presume to lift my pigmy lance and brave the unequal combat  the most ancient of the opinions transmitted to us upon this subject i believe is that of the egyptians which considers the soul or living principle as a kind of shadow or aerial substance diffused through every part of the body animating every limb and partaking of all its proportions  man according to them consists of three parts  a gross perishable body  an intellectual principle or intelligent mind by which he is elevated above the brute creation  and an image or soul exactly resembling the body in shape in magnitude and feature upon which animation and all the functions of the animal frame depend and in which also they conceive the intellectual principle to be enshrined  that these were considered in the proper meaning of the word as distinct principles is evident since they are treated as being capable of independent existence  the soul or vital principle continuing many of its functions after its separation from the body and the mind or intellectual power after the final separation being sometimes consigned to a different residence from the soul  this opinion which still with some slight variations continues to be popular among divines and moralists and has been mangled and metamorphosed even by our philosophers themselves was adopted by the greeks was infused into the subtle and intricate philosophy of aristotle dilated upon by the divine genius of plato beautified by the sublime invention of that most ancient of their poets and philosophers the immortal homer and at length was taught by plutarch to the roman world in the following manner  man says he is a compound subject but not of two parts as is commonly believed because the understanding is generally accounted a part of the soul whereas it as far exceeds the soul as the soul is diviner than the body now the soul when compounded with the understanding makes reason and when compounded with the body makes passion whereof one is the source or principle of pleasure or pain  the other of vice or virtue man therefore properly dies two deaths the first makes him two of three and the second makes him one of two  this hypothesis has certainly beauty and ingenuity to recommend it to our imaginations and is also to my conceptions at least somewhat more comprehensible than those systems which refer the operations of gross matter to immaterial agency it is however like all the speculations of the ancients upon these subjects unfounded in experimental enquiry and unsupported by facts or observation yet st paul who derived much of his inspiration from the ancient poets and philosophers has given it the sanction of his authority by dividing in distinct terms the triune man into body soul and spirit  this being the case it is not at all surprising that modern philosophy should have been more anxious to frame such systems as were reconcilable with this tripartite division than such as might be consistent with known facts or maintainable on the grounds of reason and that we should accordingly find this theory so stoutly defended to the present hour with the slight alteration only of transposing the soul into the place of mind or spirit and substituting vital principle in the place of soul some philosophers however by considering the immaterial essence as the animating principle and others by considering the animating principle as the only medium of intelligence have reduced human existence to a twofold nature i for my part shall simplify the subject still farther  and regarding man as differing from other animals rather in the extent than in the nature of his powers shall consider him together with the inferior tenants of creation in an individual point of view only as consisting of a simple organized frame from the susceptibility and presence or the nonsusceptibility or absence of stimuli in which arises the whole distinction between the living body and the dead wherever there is a perfect organization of the animal substance there i conceive we have the susceptibility or as it may perhaps not improperly be called the predisposing cause of life whatever may be that specific stimulus by which such susceptibility may be disposed to be excited that i conceive must be admitted to be the remote cause or agent by which life is to be produced from the intimate combination of these results that meliorated or altered state of the organized frame which may be considered as the proximate cause and the vital action as it may properly be called or the power by which the vital functions are performed being the ultimate effect of these cooperating causes is in reality as i humbly presume to be considered as that life or animal vitality for which under so many denominations and imaginary forms the philosopher and the medical professor have so long been seeking  such is the general idea which upon the simple principles of materialism i have formed of life and so to define this idea as to account for the phenomena without appealing to the fanciful creations of the visionary brain or abstruse and unmeaning terms of pretended science is the task i have undertaken  but before i enter more particularly into the subject it will be necessary to bestow some consideration on another theory that has lately very much amused and according to my judgment misled the scientific world  the theory i mean of the vital principle being resident in the blood  this doctrine in all probability had its origin in the remotest antiquity since the fatal consequences that result to the animal frame from the spilling of this important fluid must have been frequently observed especially in the ages of barbarism and violence long before the faculties of man were sufficiently improved for refined speculations or philosophical researches into nature but the prejudices of ignorance have sometimes been ascertained and more frequently adopted by the luminaries of science and the world and this hasty opinion for such to me at least it appears has not wanted supporters among those who will long continue to claim the applause and admiration of mankind  and first i must particularize that this doctrine has received the direct sanction of the great jewish lawgiver or whoever was the author of the five books of sacred history generally ascribed to him in the following among a variety of texts of a similar nature  for it is the life of all flesh the blood of it is the life thereof therefore i said unto the children of israel ye shall eat of the blood of no manner of flesh for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof whosoever eats it shall be cut off  i am very well aware that the sublime language of revelation is not always to be interpreted with philosophical precision  the enthusiasm of divine inspiration frequently elevating the style of the holy penman to a degree of poetical hyperbole which would be perfectly unintelligible to the cold perceptions of reason and enquiry if it were not for the friendly appeals of the commentator to mystical allegory and metaphorical elucidation but as the doctrine here quoted is merely illustrative of the simple mandate that the jews should not eat of the blood of animals slain for their sustenance there can be no doubt of its being intended to be literally understood as the opinion of moses that the blood is absolutely the vital principle  for this opinion i am very much inclined to suspect that no better foundation will be discovered than the acknowledged fact that when the blood or any very considerable portion of it is drawn away the vital functions of the animal will cease but unfortunately for this theory these functions will also cease without the proportion of this fluid being at all diminished and as there are also several other parts entering into the composition of the animal which if subtracted even in part resign the body to inevitable destruction we might as well say that the stomach thereof or the kidneys or the liver thereof is the life thereof as that the blood is to be so considered nay from what we are now acquainted with concerning the nervous system there would be much better reason to suppose with some later philosophers that the life of the animal is in the brain rather than in the blood since so much of the latter may be lost without essential injury while the former cannot receive the slightest wound without bringing on immediate dissolution and though upon serious reflection there is every reason to believe that the fatal catastrophe is produced as much at least by the consequent extravasation of the blood as by any immediate susceptibility of injury in the substance of the brain yet this does not weaken the argument since it is evident that it is not the loss of blood from the vessels which is the real cause of the mischief for much larger quantities may be drawn from the same part by mere external wounds without any alarming consequences but that the injury produced by the extravasation results from the consequent oppression on the organ by which its active energy is restrained and benumbed and of course its vital functions will be stopped  from this and a variety of other considerations it is evident that the brain is at least more vital than the blood since the compression of the former is more dangerous than even a very considerable deduction of the latter  but it might perhaps be objected to the whole of this reasoning that many animals have life which have neither brain nor kidneys nor liver nor strictly speaking even stomachs for i know not how the simple cavities of the leech or polipus can in strict propriety be considered as stomachs  this objection being founded in truth it is necessary that we should give it its utmost force and admit it as a demonstration that animal life neither consists in nor is absolutely dependant upon any one of these particular organs but as it will be admitted that though they have not these they have some other organs which as far as is necessary for the performance of their functions supply the place of these the cases will still be found to be in some degree parallel  for strictly speaking many of the most imperfect animals have no blood at least according to the general idea which is given of it in the descriptions of anatomists there being perhaps as much difference between the ichor which supplies its place in several classes of insects and reptiles and the compound fluid which in the more perfect animals we call by the name of blood as between this ichor and the sap of vegetables and a variety of other simple juices of animal or vegetable substances if therefore the vital principle is to be sought in the circulating fluids we ought rather to say that the serum thereof is the life thereof than the blood  but as i am informed that the immortal harvey upheld a doctrine similar to that i am combating and as so great an authority as john hunter has thought proper in some degree to sanction the opinion it is necessary to treat it more at large and to abandon the cursory observation of the jewish lawgiver for the more elaborate and practical researches of the british anatomical philosopher  i have said that john hunters theory sanctions in some degree the opinion of moses for i think it very doubtful whether he means to carry it to the full extent and to assert that the vital principle is peculiarly or originally in the blood the editors of the encyc brit it is true  title blood vol iii p     evidently understood him in this manner as will appear from the following quotation the uses of this fluid are so various and of such an important nature that some have not scrupled to affirm the blood to be actually possessed of a living principle and that the life of the whole body is derived from it this opinion was first broached by the celebrated harvey  this i have already shown to be a mistake vide p    of this essay where it is shown to have been the opinion of moses etc  the discoverer of the circulation but in this he was never much followed and the hypothesis itself indeed has been pretty much laid aside and neglected till of late that it was revived by mr j hunter after which are quoted the six arguments which i shall presently endeavor to examine as advanced by that great professor to support this broad and unqualified opinion but in the manuscript copy of his lectures which i have principally made use of he begins the subject with the simple assertion only that the blood is endowed with a principle of life in itself equally with the solid parts  now whether all or any either of the particular fluid or solid parts i treat the word parts here not as alluding to limbs or proportions but as referring to the separate and different species of substance of which the body is constituted  as bone in contradistinction to muscle muscle in contradistinction to nerve nerve to membrane and the like possess in themselves that is to say either separately or absolutely a principle of life i do not at present enquire because it seems to involve the general question which must be referred to its proper place in my essay namely  whether life itself is to be considered as a distinct and positive essence or simply as the result of a particular harmony and correspondence of the whole or aggregate combination preserved and acted upon by a particular stimulus on this subject indeed it is sufficiently evident that i have the misfortune to differ from the illustrious authority before me but as i am now examining the doctrine only of the vitality of the blood it is but necessary for me just to observe that as nothing more is directly asserted in the proposition than that the blood of the living body is equally alive with the bones and ligaments and muscular fibers etc of which such living body is composed it does not seem to lie considerably in the way of my theory because if in other respects i can but substantiate my opinion the difference will not be very great whether we admit the blood as participating in the vitality produced as i shall endeavor to show or consider it as nothing more than a specific fluid giving nourishment to the various substances and conveying to the different organized parts the necessary stimuli by which life or the vital action is to be produced or sustained nay when he afterward proceeds to assert that blood is not only alive itself but also by circulation through every part of the body becomes the means of and carries life to the other parts i do not yet perceive the absolute necessity of entering the lists upon this part of the subject because he does not palpably assert that the life to be conveyed is sui generis or originally in the blood but only that this fluid is the agent by which the vitality is communicated to the respective parts and it is my intention to admit that the blood in the more perfect and the serous fluid substituted in its place in the less perfect animals is the appropriate medium by which alone the stimuli necessary for the production and sustainment of life can be absorbed and properly diffused through the organized frame and indeed several passages might be produced to countenance the suspicion that this justly admired lecturer so far agrees with the theory i mean to enforce as to admit that the vital principle is at least sustained and reinvigorated if not absolutely generated not independently by the blood itself but from something imbibed in its passage through the lungs for he acknowledges that before blood is capable of giving life in other words according to his own theory before it is alive it must have circulated through the lungs where it undergoes some essential change perhaps continues he it is then in its second state or vivification  it is obvious to remark that if the blood is not in its state of vivification till it has passed through the lungs vitality cannot be the property of the blood itself but only a consequence of some action or superaddition acquired in its passage through that organ and consequently that the vital principle to use the language of those philosophers who consider life as a separate essence is to be sought not in the blood but in that subtle element or whatever it is which is imbibed by means of the respitory system  but if it is not presumption for me to say so there seems to be some degree of obscurity  perhaps if i were speaking of any man but john hunter i should venture to say contradiction in the doctrines of the lecturer upon this subject for he immediately afterward denies that the blood derives its vitality from its passage through the lungs in the following words perhaps it might be thought that life is given to the blood in the lungs in consequence of the heat applied there as heat is supposed to act upon the egg but it must be remembered that life is not given to the egg by heat only action produced by it by which it should seem that he means to be understood as considering the vital principle to be a property of the blood itself so long as it continues in its perfect state independent of respiration and that this action of the lungs is only necessary for the purposes of circulation and the production of action in the other parts of the frame by the distribution of this principle  and yet if the egg be alive which let it be remembered i do not positively admit how can this be since previous to the alteration taking place from the application of heat during the period of incubation it contains no blood whatever and consequently if the vital principle be in the blood must be alive without the principle of life  a paradox which perhaps it would be a little entertaining to hear the advocates of this doctrine explain  not however to dwell upon so ambiguous a passage there are in the lectures of this truly great man sufficient foundations for the opinion apparently entertained by the editors of the work above quoted as well as by several of his pupils and admirers  namely that he means to represent vitality or according to his own expression the vital principle as residing originally and in an emphatic sense in the blood and derived from it to the other parts of the system he even in the clearest manner affirms its superior vivification over the nerves in particular for while these according to one of his aphorisms on the vitality of the blood are not concerned in conveying life to parts but only direct the motions of the parts the blood is explicitly affirmed not only to convey life to the other parts but to be absolutely the living support of the nerves themselves by which it is evident that we must understand not only that the nourishment of these sensitive organs but even their vitality is derived not from their organization and the stimuli of which they are perhaps the important repositories or reservoirs but from the vital principle peculiarly resident in the blood and deposited there for the purpose of being communicated and diffused to other parts  these other parts then being dependant according to this theory upon the blood not only for their support and enlargement but also in an immediate view for their vitality it is clear that if the system of the lecturer does not go the whole length with moses of saying that the blood of the animal is the life thereof at least that he supposes life of itself and independent of any particular action or stimulus to belong to or be a property of the blood while to the rest of the animal substance it only belongs in a secondary signification as being imparted by the blood and this perhaps we are the more bound to consider as his real meaning as he maintains the doctrine of its vitality even after coagulation and even delivers it as his opinion that this phenomenon is owing to an action of selfpreservation in the blood or to an effort for its continuance so that according to this position and the arguments that follow upon the circumstance of coagula becoming vascular under particular circumstances we are not to consider the vitality of the blood as the consequence of its state condition and harmony with the other parts vide note page    of the body but to look upon it as a principle inherent in it and equally a property of it whether in one state and situation or another  whether in its vessels or in a state of extravasation  whether in a fluid or a solid form  a circumstance attributed to no other of the component parts of the animal frame these being considered as having no other principle of life but what they immediately derive either from the blood or from their harmony with the system in general whose resources must cease before any material change in their nature and substance can take place and yet if this argument is properly sifted i question whether it will make much for the vitality of the blood in any point of view whatever for as no similar change in any other fluid was ever brought forward as an evidence of a vital principle in such fluid i cannot see that any phenomenon that would not be considered as a proof of vitality or of an effort of selfpreservation in any other instance should have such stress laid upon it for such purposes in the case before us  with respect to the generality probably to all of the fluids capable of congelation it might perhaps be objected that they afford no parallel example of permanent change of structure as they are capable of resolution to their original form which blood is not but petrified substances in which the change is permanent and entire might at least be said in this respect to have as good a claim to the attributes of a vital principle and action of selfpreservation as the blood which is here said to metamorphose itself into something else in order to continue its existence besides if the coagulation of the blood be an action of its vitality and an effort of its vital principle for its preservation how comes it that it will coagulate after having been frozen for john hunter admits that what he calls the vital principle of the egg is destroyed by freezing and indeed nothing is more injurious to vitality of every kind than the frigorific process and yet mr hewson informs us that blood may be completely frozen and preserved in that condition as other dead animal substances may for a considerable time and yet after it is again reduced by an increase of temperature to its fluid form it will coagulate just as usual  having thus examined the general state of the question i shall preceed to review the six arguments brought forward upon the authority of the lecturer in the encyclopedia in support of the opinion previously quoted   vide page    of this essay for the more ample statement of these however not to swell my essay to an unnecessary length by quotations from a book which is in the hands of every body i shall refer to the work itself  with respect to the first of these derived from the power which the blood possesses of uniting living parts it is to be remembered that this is only the case in those instances where blood is immediately supplied by the parts to be united and where consequently from its temperature its assimilitude to the parts with which it is to enter into combination its glutinous texture and a variety of obvious reasons it may naturally be supposed to form the best cementing medium and the healing of wounds by other applications which have evidently no vital principle appears to me sufficient to show that this is no proof of vitality all that is requisite in either instance being to keep the living parts in contact and exclude the air and other injurious extraneous particles till nature has a sufficient opportunity of exerting her restoring powers  the blood yet warm and fluid from the wound may naturally enough be expected to enter intimately into the different portions of the severed parts and all further injuries being thus prevented it is neither singular nor strange that the separated vessels should again unite from the attraction of similar particles so frequently observed when circumstances are favorable to the experiment and that the stream of blood driving toward its usual course should at last find its way again through the coagulum formed by the blood thus bound up with the injured parts and complete their restoration    and   exactly upon the same principle i account for the phenomenon from which the second argument is drawn namely  that coagula of extravasated blood will become vascular for this i believe is never the case except when the coagula come in contact or nearly in contact with arteries previously formed this therefore seems to prove nothing more than that coagulated blood when preserving a proper degree of temperature from its situation is the proper medium or soil into which the arteries may strike and ramify  all living parts perhaps having a tendency to grow and enlarge so long as sufficient stimuli are supplied and the proper medium is presented for my own part i cannot but observe that all the preparations i have seen intended to support this argument have only suggested a process similar to that observable in vegetation where the moist earth in contact with the roots of plants or trees supplies the proper medium into which the fibers are stimulated to extend their growth and hence it is that i find no difficulty in accounting for the junction of the testicle of the cock to the liver of the hen into whose abdomen it had been introduced as mentioned in illustration of the first argument or for the vascular appearance of the coagulum found between the separated parts of the fractured os humeri upon which the sixth or rather the reiteration of the second argument is founded    as for the third argument drawn from the power of the blood to preserve an equal degree of temperature in the living body during the prevalence of different temperatures of the atmosphere  i shall at present make no other answer to this than by observing that if the theory i am about to suggest is well founded that will be sufficient to account for this phenomenon without appeal to any other hypothesis for if the air may be admitted to be sufficiently impregnated with the same specific stimuli in the coldest as well as in the hottest day there can be no reason why the blood should be expected to have a lower degree of temperature on the former than on the latter  whether it be admitted to be possessed of a vital principle independent of such stimuli or not    as for the blood being capable of being acted upon by a stimulus  this is saying no more than may be proved of a variety of things that have confessedly no pretensions to life whatever and as the only particular effect which is instanced as produced by the stimulating influence on the blood namely coagulation would never be admitted as a proof of life in any other fluid whatever it cannot as far as i am able to discover be made any use of in illustration of the point in question   the fifth argument that the blood preserves life in different parts of the body is equally applicacable to the theory of the lecturer and to my own for whether it be considered as retaining in itself the vital principle or being the sole medium through which vitality can be produced we must equally admit its importance not only in preserving but in diffusing life i shall therefore only observe that the collateral part of the argument which asserts that when the nerves going to a part are tied the part becomes paralytic is i believe overthrown by later experiments and that sensation only and not the power of acting the muscles is interrupted by the ligature of nerves upon this however as i certainly do not mean to rob the blood of its vital honors to bestow them on the brain and nerves i shall not at present enlarge but shall conclude what i have to say upon this subject by observing that perhaps the whole doctrine of the vitality of the blood in whatever point of view it may be taken originated in the mind of the lecturer from observing the important offices it performs in the fustainment and reproduction of parts confessedly and palpably alive now that the nerves for example as well as every other part of the animal body are nourished by the blood is sufficiently evident and that but for such nourishment these parts must by exhaustion lose their vitality is equally obvious but that the fluid nourishing and sustaining a living part must of necessity be itself alive is what i cannot readily admit because it seems to contradict the known laws and phenomena of nature air and water are the proper and necessary nourishment of plants without which vegetation must quickly be exhausted and expire but no one will therefore contend that air and water are alive nor will the difficulty be removed by objecting that air and water are only the food of plants and that the nourishment of the vegetable is immediately derived from the circulating sap as that of the animal from the blood for as no digestive process can be assigned to the plant air and water must be the immediate nourishers of the sap and consequently the conclusion must either be that the living sap is nourished by air and water which are not alive or that the sap which is not alive nourishes the living plant which with respect to the argument before us is just the same in short it might as well be maintained that whatever supports a sensitive part must itself be sensitive or that nothing but nerve should nourish a nerve or muscle but muscle etc which would drive us back to the obsolete opinion of those philosophers who maintained that all things contain the component parts of all things and in short would even compel us to appeal to the doctrine of an ancient sect of atheists who to get rid of the necessity of a deity insisted upon the original and eternal vitality of matter and accounted for the growth and nourishment of living things by arguing that the particles that nourished them were themselves possessed of a living principle if however we abide by the mode of reasoning suggested by the known phenomena of nature a much more simple theory will present itself in the evident tendency of small accumulations of matter when placed under favorable circumstances to assimilate and even identify themselves with the larger masses to which they adhere or with which they enter into combination which will sufficiently account for the nourishment and growth of the living body without attributing vitality to the blood by which it is sustained  having thus taken as brief a survey as the nature of the subject would permit of some of the principal opinions that have at different times commanded the attention of the scientific world i shall proceed to the professed object of my essay namely  to consider of the definition of this undertaking the difficulty must be readily admitted or should pride or petulance be inclined to deny it the subterfuges to which the most ingenious ornaments of medical science have been driven would furnish a sufficient reply some have given it up entirely and satisfied themselves with a negative test instead of a positive definition asserting that the only criterion of its absence is putrefaction but these cautious maxims though they may be adopted for security by the practitioner employed in the benevolent labor of snatching from premature dissolution the pale victims of accident or despair will not satisfy the spirit of the philosophical enquirer he indeed may frequently be compelled to wander in the gloom of doubt and negation but his active mind will scorn such sullen darkness and pant for the glorious prospects of truth and certitude to which however i have not the arrogance to profess that i shall conduct him  by some it has been contended that life consists in action or excited irritability by others simply in organization but both of these would admit a variety of instances that can lay no claim to any sort of vitality much less to that sort of vitality which is the subject of the present paper with respect to the former i need only instance that parchmen leather thread etc may be excited to considerable action by either heat or moisture as may also a variety of light bodies by the application of electricity and as for organization this i consider to be no other than that arrangement of dissimilar parts by which a harmony and communication of the whole is produced so as to enable it to preserve itself in a given state and resist its own dissolution this therefore is very inadequate to our idea of life for matter will continue to be organized when life has ceased as it also i conceive must be organized before life begins in illustration of which i should rather be inclined to quote the instance of the egg which with all the deference due to the high authority of john hunter appears to me to be organized though not alive previous to incubation i conceive also that many bodies may be considered as organized that were never intended to live at all to those however who wish to consider life as entirely dependant on organization i submit the following definition that perfect harmony of organized parts by which the animal frame is rendered so far susceptible of the proper stimuli as to have its functions or any of them induced upon such stimuli being applied and this the society will be kind enough to keep in their minds as what i mean when i come hereafter to speak of specific organization  others have considered animal life as consisting in the performance of the animal functions but this definition would exclude from all pretensions to vitality many beings which common sense must admit to be alive for an animal may certainly live when it neither does nor can perform all its functions and as for ascertaining which may be dispensed with and which may not this i believe has never been successfully attempted  the definition of john hunter appears to me particularly vague and unsatisfactory life says he does not consist in any modification of matter it either is something superadded to matter or else it consists in a peculiar arrangement of certain fine particles of matter which being thus disposed acquire the properties of life the disciples of this justly celebrated man must pardon me if i am inclined to smile at this definition or rather indefinite description of life and to declare that i never in my life met with any thing more completely incomprehensible life does not consist in any modification of matter and yet perhaps it consists in a peculiar arrangement of certain fine particles of matter which being thus disposed acquire the properties of life what is the fineness of these particles of matter but a modification of matter  what is the peculiar arrangement  what the disposition of these particles but a modification of matter in short is not this telling us in other words that life positively is not a modification of matter but that yet perhaps it is a modification of matter as for the other position that life consists in something superadded to matter i had once occasion to controvert this incomprehensible axiom at the lyceum when all of a sudden a sneer went round the theater and a hundred mouths were filled with fury against me as though i had stood up in the presence of the pope and his cardinals to deny the doctrine of the trinity i shall venture however once more to assert that the spiritual allusions of this sentence are too fine for the gross conceptions of my material organs according to my dull comprehensions matter and vacuum stand precisely in the same degrees of contradistinction as something and nothing and in the former case as in the latter it is impossible for me to admit the negation of the one without at the same time acknowledging the affirmation of the other  where there is not matter there there is vacuum  where vacuum is not there there must be matter those effects which are not produced by the operations of some modification of matter or in other words of something must of course be produced by some modification of vacuum or in other words of nothing and how vacuum or nothing can be so modified as to produce life i leave to the consideration of the metaphysicians it is evident however that this is not what the lecturer means because though he denies the modification of matter he admits the superaddition of something  but what is this something that is not matter  is it spirit i certainly do not think it the part of a philosopher absolutely to deny the existence of every thing that he cannot demonstrate but as contradictions are not to be admitted i must for my own part maintain that if there is any such thing entering into the animal composition though our senses have never yet been capable of taking cognizance of it as spirit having an existence separate and distinct from organization and that gross perishable kind of substance we call body that such spirit however subtle however refined must still be material and then indeed the absurdity vanishes  because that more subtle matter can act upon that which is more gross and inert we have sufficient evidence in the action of air and of the electric fluid and that this a fine and subtle or aeriform essence is the real and genuine meaning of the term spirit about which divines and philosophers have so long been contending is i conceive sufficiently demonstrable not only from its etymology but also from the common application of the word in the other senses in which it is still retained as for example  by the spirit of any distilled or fermented fluid we always mean to express that more subtle and volatile principle the alkohol of the chemists mixed with and diffused through such fluid and whose materiality notwithstanding its superior subtility is no more to be questioned than that of the grosser parts of the fluid with which it enters into combination in short it will perhaps be found that all nouns immediately or arbitrarily derived from verbs the natural mode of derivation seems to be of the verb from the noun this being evidently likely to precede in the first rude attempts at language but there are many words now in use which must have come to us in the contrary direction  as heaven for example which still retains simply and absolutely the meaning that which is heaved or lifted up which it brought from the parent verb to beave whether of the same or any other language still retain in a considerable degree their paternal signification and spirit must perhaps be admitted to bear no other meaning than the latin spiro to breathe from which it is confessedly taken or if we must needs make a distinct living existence of it then can it possibly mean no other than a vital aeriform substance diffused though the frame and giving animation to the respective parts so that at any rate this something superadded to matter can only be a more refined species of matter added to that which is more gross and of course it constitutes that very modification which the lecturer denies  it has been stated in defense of this passage that by some thing superadded no more is meant than some quality but this would by no means mend the matter since nothing can be added but what has a previous and separate existence two things brought together may it is true occasion the existence of a third different from both but this third is not added but produced now qualities have no separate existence nor can they even be conceived in the imagination otherwise than as connected with the things of which they describe the shades or attributes they are in fact solely and purely modifications of matter and consequently this interpretation involves all the absurdity and contradiction of which i have before complained  but it is much more easy to find fault with the definitions of others than to frame such as are not faulty i shall proceed therefore to my task with caution and beginning with a general proceed to a particular definition  life then in the animal we will say is that state of action by which the functions or any of the functions of the animal are carried on this definition it is true neither points out how the action is supposed to be induced nor the state of the animal previous to the induction i proceed therefore to add that previous to the existence of life the body must have attained a specific organization and that life or in other terms the vital action is induced by the application of proper stimuli thus then life in the animal is that state of action induced by specific stimuli upon matter specifically organized by which the animal functions or any of them are carried on to the whole of this i know may be objected the assertion of that great man whom with such repeated arrogance i have ventured to oppose namely  that life may exist without matter being in a state of action and the property of selfpreservation may alone be present life being at the same time present in its full force to the solitary instance however brought in support of this assertion i must reply that the life of the egg is by no means obvious to my understanding for although the egg be so far organized as to be endowed with the principle of selfpreservation so also are various fruits etc whose vitality i suppose after they are plucked will not be contended for some perhaps will contend for the life of the kernels seeds etc i however should content myself with contending for their specific organization by which upon the application of proper stimuli they are rendered susceptible of life  in short it does not appear to have any one property or attribute which in any other substance would be deemed a sufficient test of vitality till the stimulus of heat being properly applied so meliorates the arrangement of particles as to induce the specific organization essential to the susceptibility and production of vital action  by this then it will appear that i consider the preliminary principles of life to be a specific organization and a specific stimulus the perfect contact of these to be the immediate cause and life itself to be the state of action produced by this union  it will now only be expected that i should give an opinion upon the nature of the stimulus required but in order to do this i must first premise that i consider the blood independent of its nutritive power as the specific medium by which the stimuli must be conveyed to the different parts of the organized frame so as to produce the vital action this blood then in its passage through the lungs collects a something which generates a specific heat for it is evident that heat unless thus generated will not answer the purpose which it diffuses through the whole vascular system and then exhausted of its vivifying power returns again to the lungs to exhale whatever noxious particles it may have collected and to inhale a fresh portion of the same vivifying principle but what is this something  this vivifying principle  is it atmospheric air itself  certainly not the coats of the arteries and the membranous linings of the cells of the lungs forbid the access of such an element besides it has been proved by experiment that in the arteries of the living body there is no air something however it must be that is contained in the atmosphere and something of a powerful and exquisitely subtle nature  if then we look upon the component parts of our atmosphere what can we discover so competent to the task  so subtle so powerful so nearly approaching to that idea of an ethereal medium which some philosophers have supposed necessary to complete the chain of connection between the divine immortal essence and the dull inertion of created matter as the electrical fluid  that principle whose presence under such a variety of forms is constantly presenting itself to the researches of the philosopher  whose agency in so many of the phenomena of nature we are daily detecting and which perhaps will one time be discovered to be the real principle by which all heat and action are originally generated and
