a short treatise on the english tongue  a short treatise on the english tongue  being an attempt to render the reading and pronunciation of the same more easy to foreigners  london printed for r horsfield in ludgate street and i allix in glanville street rathbone place  mdcclxvii  introduction it is generally allowed that the most easy method of attaining any living language is to associate and converse with those who speak it nevertheless when a foreigner has by this means so far acquired the english tongue that he shall be able to speak it and understand it when spoken tolerably well he will yet find himself greatly at a loss when he attempts to read because the manner of expressing sounds by letters in his own language is so very different from ours that many english words which he is well acquainted with by ear will not appear to him to be the same when he sees them in writing  for not only various sounds are expressed in the english language by the same vowels but also in many particular words a kind of arbitrary pronunciation is used which cannot easily be reduced to rule and is therefore most commonly taught merely by ear or imitation  this latter difficulty i am afraid cannot be removed but i think it may be relieved in some degree by separating all such words from those which are capable of being taught by rule this i have attempted and have accordingly collected all or the greatest part of such kind of words under their proper heads as exceptions to the several rules given in the following pages together with a short explanation of their sound  by this means a learner may have his task before him and may easily refer to any particular word as he shall have occasion which will greatly relieve his memory  i have not taken notice of all the derivatives and compounds which properly belong to the several exceptions but for the most part of primitive words only for the sake of brevity which i hope will be thought sufficient the others being naturally comprehended therein many words indeed are varied according to the different position of the accent which not only shortens the articulation of the succeeding syllables but in some words causes them to be so indistinctly pronounced that it is sometimes difficult to determine what vowels are sounded therein yet if the learner is but careful to give the accented syllable its proper pronunciation according to the following rules he will naturally fall into the customary utterance of the other syllables which as they are pronounced quick need not be studied so particularly  the rules treat only of the general power of the vowels and diphthongs because in these consist the most material differences between the english pronunciation and that of foreigners but i have added thereto by way of appendix a short treatise drawn up and communicated by a friend for the explanation of such particularities also of the other letters as are peculiar to the english tongue  all which together i flatter myself will be sufficient to enable a foreigner to read and pronounce any english words with ease and certainty when the syllables of the same are properly divided according to the learned dr lowths excellent rule for spelling given in the  th page of his english grammar viz the best and only sure rule for dividing the syllables in spelling is to divide them as they are naturally divided in a right pronunciation without regard to the derivation of words or the possible combination of consonants at the beginning of a syllable  mr john gignoux likewise particularly recommends and explains this method in the preface to his spellingbook entitled the childs best instructor in spelling and reading a title which it seems well to deserve on account of the division of the several syllables according to the manner abovementioned by which it is rendered in my opinion at least the most useful book of the sort that has hitherto been published  i must however observe that the author in his table of words written very different from their pronunciation at page    has too much followed the common london pronunciation which though perhaps in general the best yet has some very exceptionable particularities among which are potticary for apothecary athist for atheist awkurd for awkward riccolas for auricolas belcony for balcony carrin for carrion sirket for circuit crowner for coroner gorjus for gorgeous hankerchur for handkerchief iurn for iron ilan for island spanel for spaniel stummuch for stomach sound for swoon thusty for thirsty vawt for vault venzun for venison verdit for verdict etc  also in page    he signifies that the terminations tial cial cian tious cious tient and cient make each of them but one sound or syllable but however common such pronunciation may be it ought not by any means to be taught or laid down as a rule because the english language loses much of its elegance when it is expressed in so careless a manner that any of the abovementioned terminations shall seem but one syllable  the i in all these terminations has the sound of the english e and though it is pronounced quick yet it ought to be distinctly expressed as in partial social grecian captious gracious quotient ancient etc there fore i hope that the author in his next edition of that useful book will make some alteration in his explanation of these particulars  others besides mr gignoux have been misled by the indistinct manner in which some particular syllables are sometimes uttered even by good speakers mr james buchanan in particular has given himself much unnecessary trouble and has carried his refinements a great deal too far concerning syllables of this kind which in quick pronunciation have seemed to him to partake of an articulation different from the real spelling this has unfortunately not only added great difficulty to his an essay toward establishing a standard for an elegant and uniform pronunciation of the english language as practiced by the most learned and polite speakers performance but rendered it almost incapable of answering the good purposes intended by it for he has frequently substituted an imaginary articulation of one vowel for the inarticulation or rather the short and indistinct sound of another not considering that the expressing of an accented syllable in many particular words does almost unavoidably cause the succeeding syllable or syllables to be so indistinctly pronounced that it is sometimes difficult to determine what vowels are sounded therein as i have before observed  but when words are so pronounced that instead of the short or indistinct sound of one vowel a manifest articulation of another different vowel may be distinguished it then becomes a fault in speech which howsoever common it may be ought by no means to be imitated much less taught because the generality of people are naturally too liable of themselves to acquire it without being led thereto by written instructions  the following examples taken from mr buchanans book will illustrate what has been said viz he has substituted l for the terminations al ial and el as naivl neutrl komkl joodeshl spshl quarl etc for naval neutral comical judicial special quarrel etc mr peytons new vocabulary or grammar of the true pronunciation of the english is not less liable to censure for the same words are there rendered naivel niutrel djoudchiel spechiel couarril etc in for an as heumin orgn etc for human organ etc nss for ance and ence and nt for ant and ent as abundinss rvrinss contentmnt commandmint etc instead of abundance reverence contentment commandment etc fool for full as faithfool etc iss for ess as heedlss happnss and a great abundance of such other syllables equally distant from the true pronunciation  as i have no other motive for giving my opinion so freely concerning this gentlemans performance than the desire of removing all unnecessary difficulty from the learning of english i hope he will excuse me even though my remarks should not have sufficient weight to convince him  he may likewise assure himself that though i think an uniformity of pronunciation throughout the british dominions is more to be wished than hoped for yet i should have as much real satisfaction as himself in the completion of that great moral end which as he supposes in his preface would be promoted thereby viz the removal of national prejudice an effect equally to be desired by all lovers of their country whether south or north britons  it would be much to the advantage of all those who learn the english tongue if the syllables in all future editions of english dictionaries were divided according to the a very useful little dictionary on this plan was printed in      for j nourse and s hooper in the strand entitled the complete english spelling dictionary upon an entire new plan the author mr j carter method recommended by dr lowth and mr gignoux before mentioned and likewise if the words which are not properly english were distinguished by an asterisk or some other particular mark placed before them that foreigners may not conceive our language to be unnecessarily copious and difficult  the coining of new words from other languages to express any thing which might as concisely and elegantly be explained in proper english words is a kind of pedantry which all writers should endeavor to avoid unless we be allowed to except those who treat of natural philosophy medicine surgery or such other subjects as are supposed to be read by none but those who are acquainted with other languages or at least have some knowledge of the latin tongue for it ought to be the study of every writer to make his meaning as plain and intelligible in the proper language in which he writes as he possibly can yet so many of our most eminent writers have occasionally been guilty of the fault above mentioned that the ingenious mr johnson has thought himself obliged to insert a great abundance of such coined words into his excellent english dictionary and the reverend mr entick likewise into his very useful new pocket dictionary but i cannot suppose that such kind of words were admitted by these gentlemen as proper english words but merely that they might explain them to english readers who without the knowledge of other languages cannot otherwise possibly understand them which is a sufficient proof that they are not at all entitled to the name of english words  for how should an english reader i mean a reader merely of english be supposed to understand that ablepsy signifies blindness acetosity sourness anhelation panting arcanum a secret obesity fatness papilio a butterfly neoterick modern paranymph a brideman rugose wrinkled squalor nastiness terreous earthy tenebricose dark tripudiation dancing tumefy to swell turm a troop and a thousand other such words which are found in both dictionaries  it is much to be wished that all such new coined words which have only been used by a few authors were distinguished by some mark from the common and proper english words as i have hinted above in all future editions of these useful dictionaries lest so many uncouth and pedantick expressions should be adopted into the english tongue by dictionary authority because when a person sees them ranged with other words in an english dictionary he may be induced to make use of them as proper english words in his writing and discourse which would at first cause no small impediment to the understanding of his ordinary readers and hearers  the accents used in these dictionaries are particularly useful for keeping up an uniformity in pronunciation and it would be well if the double accents were also added to some particular words as in mr gignouxs spelling book for the purpose mentioned in page   of his preface viz to denote that the consonant that begins the next syllable must be also sounded at the end of the syllable where the double accent is as atonement mangle intangle which words must be sounded as if written attonement manggle intanggle so in conqueror concubine etc the same would also be particularly useful in words wherein g and c are softened by the vowels e and i following them in the next syllable as in negligent voracity etc   in my search for such words as are independent of the following rules i made use of the rev mr enticks new spelling dictionary and though i examined the same so carefully that i believe i have not made many omissions yet the whole number of particular exceptions exclusive of their compounds and derivatives amount to no more than there are indeed    foreign words besides see page    which are not included in this number because as they still retain their original pronunciation or nearly so they cannot properly be accounted exceptions to english rules   0  which number bears a very small proportion to the number of words in that dictionary which i compute to be upwards of   000 this i think ought to prove that the english pronunciation is not so very irregular as it is generally thought to be which a careful examination of the following pages will more particularly show  a short treatise on the english tongue the english vowels a e i o and u have each of them the vowels may indeed be said to have more sounds than   because a different pronunciation from the   sounds here spoken of is given to each of the vowels in a few particular cases which are hereafter noted but at present i am only speaking of their general power   sounds commonly called long and short  the sounds of the three first vowels a e and i when long seem to be peculiar at present to this nation wherefore they may properly be called the english sounds  and the short sounds of these three vowels may for the sake of distinction be called the foreign sounds because they are uttered with scarcely any difference except that a and i are pronounced short from the french articulation of the same vowels which shall be more fully explained by see the examples to the  d rule examples hereafter  i think it necessary to observe in this place that the english sound of the following vowels diphthongs and terminations cannot easily be expressed in foreign letters and should therefore be learned by ear viz  i long there are   ways of sounding the long i and y though both long the one a little different from the other and requiring a little more extension of the mouth as may be seen by comparing the following words viz i and aye high and highho by it or by it and bite sighed and side strive and strife etc but this difference being so nice is not to be attained but by much practice neither is it very material  as in bible mitre nitre pirate etc  o and u short before a consonant in the same syllable as in odd nod lord etc and in mud strut stun urn etc  oi and oy which have both the same sound as in oil boil coil boy coy hoy etc  ou and ow not like the french ou in the pronunciation of which the lips are almost closed but with an open articulation as in pound our gown power etc  also the following terminations viz ire tion cious tious as in dire fire salvation delicious fictitious etc  the english or long sound is given to the vowels a e rule i and i and the other vowels are also sounded long when they are alone or when there is not a consonant following them in the same syllable also before silent e in the end of a word see the  d rule examples a like the french e in beat as in cable fable sable etc e like the french i in mill as
