undoubtedly of all others have the best of claims to a work of this nature whose generosity and benevolence have been conspicuous in so promoting the welfare of their country and the good of mankind  and such gentlemen are you the incouragers of learning and the rewarders of merit there are numbers to witness the one and your clergy may witness the other  for not to mention you in your private capacities as promoters of common learning as the helpers and supporters of schools of charity one great blessing of your community you in your public stations uphold a nobler literature and assist a more generous education you not only lay the groundworks here but you help to the top of arts and sciences in the greater schools of learning  nor is it less certain that you have always been eminent and that not only in your own country but in distant parts for the support of an orthodox and learned clergy your fame for maintaining them and your regard to merit in choosing them being every where spoken of  justly therefore are you entitled to performances of this nature but in a more especial manner to this in particular it being the genuine offspring of your generosity as i am sensible that you have blessed me with the most inestimable favors so i am bound in duty and by all the ties of gratitude to lay the first fruits of my labors at your feet hoping that as you have been very instrumental in occasioning them so you will receive them under your care and protection  and this i also hope for not as they are a work of merit or worthy of being dedicated to such patrons for i am justly sensible of the meanness of their desert and their unworthiness of that honor but as they are an indication of the sincerest thankfulness and gratitude of  gentlemen your most obliged most obedient and most humble servant henry bourne  the preface the following sheets are a few of that vast number of ceremonies and opinions which are held by the common people such as they solely or generally observe for though some of them have been of national and others perhaps of universal observance yet at present they would have little or no being if not observed among the vulgar  i would not be thought a reviver of old rites and ceremonies to the burdening of the people nor an abolisher of innocent customs which are their pleasures and recreations i aim at nothing but a regulation of those which are in being amongst them which they themselves are far from thinking burdensome and abolishing such only as are sinful and wicked  some of the customs they hold have been originally good though at present they retain little of their primitive purity the true meaning and design of them being either lost or very much in the dark through folly and superstition to wipe off therefore the dust they have contracted to clear them of superstition and make known their end and design may turn to some account and be of advantage whereas observing them in the present way is not only of no advantage but of very great detriment  others they hold are really sinful notwithstanding in outward appearance they seem very harmless being a scandal to religion and an encouraging of wickedness and therefore to aim at abolishing these will i hope be no crime though they be the diversions of the people  as to the opinions they hold they are almost all superstitious being generally either the produce of heathenism or the inventions of indolent monks who having nothing else to do were the forgers of many silly and wicked opinions to keep the world in awe and ignorance and indeed the ignorant part of the world is still so awed that they follow the idle traditions of the one more than the word of god and have more dependence upon the lucky omens of the other than his providence more dread of their unlucky ones than his wrath and punishment  the regulating therefore of these opinions and customs is what i proposed by the following compositions whatever has been suggested to the contrary and as to the menaces of some and the censures of others i neither fear nor regard them i shall be always ready to own any mistake and in what i justly may to vindicate my self  the

 the antiquities of the common people chap i of the soulbell its antiquity the reason of its institution the benefit and advantage of it an exhortation to the use of it according to its first institution the ceremony of tolling the bell at the time of death seems to be as ancient as the having of bells themselves we are told binghams orig eccl lib   it was about the seventh century when bells were first in the church and that venerable bede is the first that mentions them if this be true then it is as true that the tolling of the bell was instituted about that time for where our countryman mentions the word campana or bell there it also is that we find a bell made use of for the dead haec tunc in dormitorio sororum pausans exaudivit subito in aere notum campanae sonum quo ad orationes excitari vel convocati solebant cum quis eorum de seculo uisset evocatus bed eccl hist lib   cap    for at the death of the abbess st hilda he tells us that one of the sisters of a distant monastery as she was sleeping thought she heard the well known sound of that bell which called them to prayers when any of them had departed this life but be that as it will it is evident that the bell was tolled upon this occasion about bedes time and consequently that the ceremony is as ancient as his days  the reason why this custom was instituted was not as some seem to imagine for no other end than to acquaint the neighborhood that such a person was dead but chiefly that whoever heard the noise of the bell should put up their prayers for the soul thus the father abovementioned tells us again quod cum illa audisset suscitavit cunctas sorores and in ecclesiam convocatas orationibus and psalmis pro anima matris operam dare monuit ibid that she who presided in this monastery had no sooner heard this than she raised all the sisters and called them into the church where she exhorted them to pray fervently and sing a requiem for the soul of their mother cassalion also upon this place of bid says that et talis ritus etiam de praesenti servatur in anglia ut cum quis decessit statim campana propriae illius parochiae speciali quodam modo sonat per aliquod temporis spatium  quamvis angli negent modo orationes and suffragia defunctis proficua non aliam tamen in hoc ab illis rationem potui percipere quam quod talis sonus sit ritus antiquae ecclesiae anglicanae cassali de vet sac christ rit p     the same custom is still observed in england that as soon as any has departed this life the bell belonging to the parish he lived in was immediately tolled and for some time  and though says he the english now deny that prayers are of any service to the dead yet i could meet with no other account of this ceremony than that it was a custom of the old church of england  and for this reason it is that this custom was first observed and should be still retained among us viz that the prayers of the faithful may be assisting to the soul and certainly it might be more profitably retained were it so ordered that the bell should be tolled before the persons departure as was undoubtedly designed when this ceremony was continued that good men might give him their prayers was this always so observed there might be some moses amongst the number of the faithful whose prayers could prevail upon god to beat back the amalekites of darkness some whose faith might remove a mountain of sins and some whose tears procure a multitude of mercies o the comfort of the forgivenness of sins of being guided safely through the shadow of death of arriving securely at the heavenly country what is it that prayer cannot obtain  but though the wickedness and impenitency of the dying person be such as that the prayers of the faithful will not be sufficient to avert the wrath and punishment of a justly incensed god yet as this can be only known to god it will not discharge men from recommending him to the divine mercy in the most passionate and affectionate manner they thereby express the most laudable zeal the most disinterested charity and whilst they are so sollicitous for the happiness and welfare of other mens souls they cannot but be thereby influenced to have the greatest concern for their own and be both encouraged and directed to proceed with an holy emulation from strength to strength and endeavor as the heb vi   apostle advises to go on to perfection  but alas we are fallen into times of such irreligion and prejudice such contempt of antiquity and such too great reformation that what with indolence on one hand and ignorance on the other what with no zeal on this side and too among the many objections of the brownists it is laid to the charge of the church of england that though we deny the doctrine of purgatory and teach the contrary yet how well our practice suits with it may be considered in our ringing of hallowed bells for the soul bish hall cont brown false a one on that we either neglect the most decent ceremonies of religion or we think it is religion to have no ceremonies at all no wonder then that in the midst of such a crooked and perverse generation when the most of men are negligent of themselves they are also negligent of others no wonder that when there is such a general contempt of religion and men are careless of their own souls they are not careful for the souls of their friends  but it is called in a vestrybook belonging to the chapel of all saints in newcastle upon tyne it is observeable that the tolling of the bell is not mentioned in the parish accounts from the year      till      when we find it ordered to be tolled again at a vestry holden january   st      whereas for some years past the collecting of the duty for bell and tolling has been forborne and laid aside which has much lessened the revenue of the church by which and such like means it is brought into dilapidations and having now taken the same into serious consideration and fully debated the objections made by some against the same and having had the judgment of our ministers concerning any superstition that might be in it which being made clear it is this day ordered that from henceforth the church officer appointed thereunto do collect the same and bring the money unto the churchwardens and that those who desire to have the use of the bells may freely have them as formerly paying the accustomed fees it is certain they laid it aside because they thought it superstitious and it is probable if they had not wanted money they had not seen the contrary popish and superstitious for what true reason i know not did we indeed imagine with the papists that there is any we call them soulbells for that they signify the departure of the soul not for that they help the passage of the soul bish hall cont brown p     virtue or extraordinary power in a bell that it is item ut daemones tinnitu campanarum christianos ad preces concitantium terreantur formula vero baptizandi seu benedicendi campanas antiqua est durant lib c    s   hallowed by baptism and drives away the spirits of darkness then it might justly be called superstition and therefore justly abolished but when we retain the custom only to procure the prayers of the faithful for a departing soul it would surely be of advantage to observe it if the prayers of a righteous man avail any thing at all which if we may believe an inspired apostle are of very great efficacy and validity  art thou then attending a friend in his last moments art thou careful for his soul and sollicitous for his salvation do thou wish him safe through the valley of death to the everlasting hills would thou have the good angels protect him and be his shield against the powers of darkness in short would thou have him crowned with the joys of paradise be assured then that the prayers of good men will very much contribute to the gaining of these things but how shall they then pray for him if they know not of his departure and how can they know that without the tolling of the bell do thou therefore put in practice this decent and profitable custom not as our age generally does after the death of thy friend but before it before he leave the world when the prayers of good men can assist him and facilitate his journey into the other life  or art thou working in the field or grinding at the mill remember then when thou hear the sound of the bell for one departing that thou put up thy prayers for him be thy business what it will it will always permit thee to say at least lord now let thou thy servant depart in peace or to use the words of st oswald when he and his soldiers were ready to be slain lord have mercy on the soul of thy oravit ad dominum pro animabus exercitus sui unde dicunt in proverbio deus miserere animabus dixit oswaldus cadens in terram bed eccl l   c    it is used says bid even to a proverb that he died praying for when the enemy had surrounded him and he saw himself about to be slain he prayed unto the lord for the souls of his army hence it is that the proverb comes lord have mercy upon the soul as st oswald said when he fell to the earth which proverb in all probability has been the original of this present national saying when the bell begins to toll lord have mercy on the soul  servant it will not be long till thou thy self shall have occasion for such prayers till thou come to die and enter on thy journey to the other state if then thou have been merciful thou shall obtain mercy if by thy prayers thou have assisted the souls of thy brethren thou shall either be remembered in the prayers of good men or surely these thy prayers for others will be of service to thy self also at that dreadful hour  but now it may be objected that as the bell is seldom tolled till after the persons departure it is to no purpose to pray for the soul nay to pray for it would be praying for the dead and since that is repugnant to the doctrine of our church our prayers at that time had much better be omitted  indeed it is too true this custom is not so common as it should be but however it is so much observed as will be able to vindicate the putting up of constant prayers i know several religious families in this place and i hope it is so in other places too who always observe it whenever the melancholy season offers and therefore it will at least sometimes happen when we put up our prayers constantly at the tolling of the bell that we shall pray for a soul departing and though it be granted that it will oftener happen otherwise as the regular custom is so little followed yet that can be no harmful praying for the dead we believe that the soul is but departing and it is charitably done to offer up our prayers and therefore when it proves otherwise our psalm xxxiv    prayer shall turn into our own bosom and like as that peace which the disciples wished to an unworthy house returned to the disciples again so though our prayers at that time may be of no service to the soul yet they will be of no disservice to us they will return to us again but it will be no fault to have misplaced them  prayers upon this occasion from bishop tailor i o holy and most gracious jesu we humbly recommend the soul of thy servant into thy hands thy most merciful hands let thy blessed angels stand in ministry about thy servant and defend him from the violence and malice of all his ghostly enemies and drive far from him all the spirits of darkness amen  ii lord receive the soul of this thy servant enter not into judgment with him spare him whom thou have redeemed with thy most precious blood and deliver him for whose sake thou did suffer death from all evil and mischief from the crafts and assaults of the devil from the fear of death and from everlasting death amen  iii lord impute not unto him the follies of his youth nor any of the errors and miscarriages of his life but strengthen him in his agony and carry him safely through his last distress let not his faith waver nor his hope fail nor his charity be disordered let him die in peace and rest in hope and rise in glory amen  iv lord we know and believe assuredly that whatsoever is under thy custody cannot be taken out of thy hands nor by all the violences of hell robbed of thy protection preserve the work of thy hands rescue him from all evil and let his portion be with the patriarchs and prophets with the apostles and martyrs and all thy holy saints in the arms of christ in the bosom of felicity and in the kingdom of god for ever amen  v o savior of the world who by thy cross and precious blood have redeemed us save and help this thy departing servant we beseech thee o lord amen  vi o almighty lord who art a most strong tower to all them that put their trust in thee to whom all things in heaven in earth and under the earth do bow and obey be now and evermore his defense and make him to know and feel by a powerful sense of thy goodness that there is no other name under heaven given to man in whom and through whom we may receive health and salvation but only the name of our lord jesus christ amen  vii o lord unto thy gracious mercy and protection we commit him o god the father bless him and keep him o god the son make thy face to shine upon him and be gracious unto him o god the holy ghost lift up thy countenance upon him and give him thy peace both now and evermore amen  chap ii of watching with the dead watching with the corpse was an ancient custom of the church and every where practiced they were wont to sit by it from the time of its death till its exportation to the grave either in the house it died in or in the church it self agreeable to this we read in st austin that as they watched his mother monica psalterium arripuit euodius and cantare caepit psalmum cui respondebamus omnes domus miserecordiam and judicium cantabo tibi domine aug lib   confess c    euodius took the psalter and began to sing a psalm which the whole family answered with that of the psalmist david i will sing of mercy and judgment unto thee o lord will i sing and we are told ad ecclesiam antelucana hora qua defunctus est corpus ipsius portatum est ibique eadem fuit nocte quam vigilavimus in pascha greg turon de gloria confess c  0  that at the death of st ambrose his body was carried into the church before day the same hour he died it was the night before easter and they watched with him there  how unlike to this ancient custom of watching is the modern one of locking up the corpse in a room and leaving it there alone how unlike to this decent manner of watching is that watching of the vulgar which is a scene of sport and drinking and lewdness watching at that time with a dear friend is the last kindness and respect we can show him and how unfriendly is it to change it into negligence and too great resignation how unchristian instead of a becoming sorrow and decent gravity to put on an unbecoming joy and undecent pastime  chap iii of following the corpse to the grave what it is an emblem of of carrying greens in our hand what it signifies what use it may be of of psalmody its antiquity the advantage and use of it it has been observed among all nations both in the heathen and the christian world as a becoming and profitable ceremony to follow the corpse to the grave the heathens observed it praecedenti pompa funebri vivi sequuntur tanquam handmulto post morituri al ab alex lib   p    t pol vir lib   c  0 p  0  because it presented to them what would shortly follow how they themselves should be so carried out and laid down in the grave the going of the corpse before showed that their friend was gone before them to the state of death and their following after was as much as to say that they must also in a short time follow him thither for this reason the christian also observes the custom and may if he pleases as he follows the body to the grave entertain himself with a pious meditation upon it in such like thoughts as these of the psalmist psalm xc  thou art god from everlasting and world without end thou turnest man to destruction again thou say come again ye children of men for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday seeing that is past as a watch in the night as soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a sleep and fade away suddenly like the grass in the morning it is green and grows up but in the evening it is cut down dried up and withered do thou therefore o lord psalm xxxix let me know my end and the number of my days that i may be certified how long i have to live behold thou have made my days as it were a span long and mine age is nothing in respect of thee and verily every man living is altogether vanity and now lord what is my hope truly my hope is even in thee deliver me from all mine offenses and o spare me a little that i may recover my strength before i go hence and be no more seen such thoughts as these of our friends and of our own mortality would excite us to prepare for our own change  and as this form of procession is an emblem of our dying shortly after our friend so the carrying of ivy or laurel or rosemary or some of those evergreens is an emblem of the souls immortality it is as much as to say that though the body be dead yet the soul is evergreen and always in life it is not like the body and those other greens which die and revive again at their proper seasons no autumn nor winter can make a change in it but it is unalterably the same perpetually in life and never dying  the romans and other heathens upon this occasion made use of cypress which being once cut will never flourish nor grow any more as an emblem of their dying for ever and being no more in life but instead of that the ancient christians used the things before mentioned they hadera quoque vel laurus and hujusmodi quae semper servant virorem in sarchophago corpori substernuntur ad significandum quod qui moriuntur in christo vivere nec desinunt nam licet mundo moriantur secundum corpus tamen secundum animam vivunt and reviviscunt deo durand rit lib   c    de offic mort laid them under the corpse in the grave to signify that they who die in christ do not cease to live for though as to the body they die to the world yet as to their souls they live to god  and as the carrying of these evergreens is an emblem of the souls immortality so it is also of the resurrection of the body for as these herbs are not entirely plucked up but only cut down and will at the returning season revive and spring up again so the body like them is but cut down for a while and will rise and shoot up again at the resurrection for as the prophet isaiah says  lxiii    our bones shall flourish like an herb  it was customary greg c     among the ancient jews as they returned from the grave to pluck up the grass two or three times and then throw it behind them saying these words of the psalmist they shall flourish out of the city like grass upon the earth which they did to show that the body though dead should spring up again as the grass thus by these two ancient ceremonies we have placed before our eyes our mortality and immortality the one speaks the death of the body the other the life of the soul nay and the life of the body too for like that herb we carry it is not quite plucked up but shall one day be alive again when it has laid in the earth the winter season the continuance of this world and the warmth and influence of the spring is come the joyful spring of the resurrection it shall be enlivened and shoot up and eternally flourish greg c     for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ cor i      there is another custom used in some places at the procession of funerals which pays a due honor to the dead and gives comfort and consolation to the living and that is the carrying out the dead with psalmody this was an ancient custom of the church for in some of the earliest ages they carried out their dead to the grave with singing of psalms and hymns thus socrates tells us that when the body of babylas the martyr was removed by the order of julian the apostate the christians hoi kata etc soc lib   c     with their women and children rejoiced and sung psalms all the way as they bore the corpse from dauphne to antioch thus was epitaphlum  hierom ep     paula buried at bethlehem thus did st anthony bury paul the hermit and thus were the generality of men buried after the three first centuries when persecution ceased in imitation of this it is still customary in several parts of this nation to carry out the dead with singing of psalms and hymns of triumph to show that they have ended their spiritual warfare that they have finished their course with ibid in vit paul joy and are become conquerors which surely is a matter of no little consolation for the loosing of our friend and how becoming is it to pay such honor to the body how is it imitating the blessed angels who rejoiced at meeting of the soul and carrying it to heaven for as they rejoice at her conversion on earth so most certainly they rejoice at her going to heaven and as they rejoice at the carrying of the soul thither so we in imitation of them at the carrying out the body to the grave they rejoice that the soul has got out of a world of sin we that the body out of a world of trouble they that the soul can sin no more we that the body can no more suffer they that the soul enjoys glory and happiness we that the body rests from its labors  when therefore we attend the corpse of a neighbor or relation and this decent ceremony is performed let it also have a share of our thoughts and excite in us joy and comfort and thanksgiving and praise and when these customs are so observed they will be of great advantage to us making us still fitter for the heavenly life and surely a thing of this good and profit is much to be preferred to what has in it nothing but undecency and irreverence such is our laughing and jesting and telling of news when we accompany a neighbor to the grave there is indeed a mean to be observed as in all other things so in this we must neither be too sad nor too merry we must not be so merry as to throw off all the signs of affection and love all the tokens of esteem and humanity nor must we   thessalonians i       sorrow even as others which have no hope but we must jam v    be so merry as to be able to sing psalms and so afflicted as to be excited to pray  chap iv of garlands in country churches of strawing flowers on the grave the antiquity of these customs the innocence of them in some country churches it is customary to hang a garland of flowers over the seats of deceased virgins as a token of esteem and love and an emblem of their reward in the heavenly church  this custom perhaps may be looked upon as sprung from that ancient custom of the heathens of crowning their corpse with garlands in token of victory but mr bingham tells us that we find not this custom used by the ancients in their funeralrites for as he observes the heathen in minutius makes it one topic of accusation against them min p    coronas etiam sepulchris denegatis bing vol  0 p    that they did not crown their sepulchers  but if they did not crown them after the manner of the heathens they had a custom of using crowns of flowers if we may believe cassalion who tells us fuit quoque mos ad capita virginum apponendi florum coronas etc cass de vet sacr christ p     it was a custom of the ancient christians to place crowns of flowers at the heads of deceased virgins for which he quotes damascen gregory nyssen st jerome and st austin and this has probably been the original of this custom among the vulgar  that other custom of strawing flowers upon the graves of their departed friends is also derived from a custom of the ancient church for it was usual in those times for the common sort of people to straw the graves of their friends with various flowers of this there are two notable instances taken notice of by cassalion and several other ritualists the one is that of st ambrose in his funeral oration on the death of valentinian nec ego floribus tumulum ejus aspergam sed spiritum ejus christi odore perfundam spargant alii plenis lilia calathis nobis lilium est christus hoc reliquias ejus sacrabo ambros orat funebri de obitu valentin i will not sprinkle his grave with flowers but pour on his spirit the odor of christ let others scatter baskets of flowers christ is our lilly and with this will i consecrate his relics  the other is that of st jerome in his epistle to pammachius upon the death of his wife caeteri mariti super tumulos conjugum spargunt violas rosas lilia floresque purpureos and dolorem pectoris his officiis consolantur pammachius noster sanctam favillam ossaque veneranda eleemosynae balsamis rigat hieron epist ad pammachium de obitu uxoris whilst other husbands strawed violets and roses and lillies and purple flowers upon the graves of their wives and comforted themselves with such like offices pammachius bedewed her ashes and venerable bones with the balsom of alms  now these instances though they justly commend these other actions and wisely prefer them to the ceremonies of adorning graves with flowers yet they no way decry these ancient customs these lower marks of esteem and honor which the vulgar paid to the remains of their friends were in themselves harmless and innocent and had no censure and as they were so so should the present customs be without any being full as harmless and innocent as the other  chap v of bowing toward the altar at the first coming into the church a custom generally observed by ignorant people its meaning and antiquity we may observe the generality of old people among the commonalty as they enter into the church to turn their faces toward the altar and bow or kneel that way this no doubt is the remains of that ancient custom of the church of worshipping toward the east for in the ancient church they worshipped that way upon several accounts first that by so worshipping they might lift up their minds to god who is called the light and the creator of light and therefore st austin says cum ad orationem stamus ad orientem covertimur unde caelum surgit etc ut admoneatur animus ad naturam excellentiorem se convertere id est ad dominum aug de sermon domini in mont lib   cap   when we pray standing we turn our faces to the east from whence the day springs that we might be reminded of turning to a more excellent nature namely the lord secondly that forasmuch as man was driven out of paradise which is toward the east he ought to look that way which is an emblem of his desire to return thither st damascen therefore tells us that st damasc lib   c    orthod fid because the scripture says that god planted paradise in eden toward the east where he placed the man which he had formed whom he punished with banishment upon his transgression and made him dwell over against paradise in the western part we therefore pray says he being in quest of our ancient country and as it were panting after it do worship god that way thirdly it was used when any were baptized they first turned their faces to the west and so renounced the devil and then to the east and made their covenant with christ lastly they prayed that way believing that our savior would come to judgment from that quarter of the heavens for as the lightning comes out of the east and shines unto the west so shall the coming of the son of man be and he is to come in like manner as he ascended and that he ascended up eastward from mount olivet st damasc lib   c    orthod fid damascen assures us for says he when he ascended into heaven he was taken up eastward and his disciples worshipped him that way and therefore chiefly it was that in the ancient church they prayed with their faces to the east and that many of our own church at this day turn their faces to that quarter of the world at the repetition of the creed  what may more confirm this and speak it to have been the universal opinion of the church is the ancient custom of burying the corpse with the feet to the east and the head to the west which custom is continued to this day in the whole church of england this was observed for the same reason that at the coming of christ to judgment from the oriental part of heaven our bodies might be found in a praying posture with their faces toward the east  our learned countryman gregory tells us that the holy men of jerusalem hold a tradition generally received from their ancients that our savior himself was buried with his face and feet toward the east it is affirmed by the geographers of the holy land and bid says introeuntes ab orient in domum illam rotundam quae in petra excisa est viderunt angelum sedentem ad meridianam partem loci illius ubi positum fuerat corpus jesu hoc enim erat in dextris quod nimirum corpus quod supinum jacens caput habebat ad occasum dexteram necesse est habere ad austrum bed in dic sanct paschae tom   that as the holy women entered at the eastern part into the roundhouse which is hewn out in the rock they saw the angel sitting at the south part of the place where the body of jesus had lain that is at his right hand for undoubtedly his body having its face upwards and its head to the west must have its right hand to the south cassalion says adeo tenaces fuere prisci illi fideles in hoc ritu respiciendi in orientem ut non folum ipsi viventes hoc in eorum precibus exact servarent verum etiam mortui eorum corpora supina in sepulchris facie orientem respicerent cass de vet rit christ p  0 the faithful of old were so observing of this ceremony of looking toward the east that they not only strictly observed it in their prayers when living but even when they were dead their bodies were placed with their faces upwards in the sepulcher looking toward the east  the learned dr comber in his discourse of the solemn interment has these words upon this subject we may note the positure and position of the corpse which among the christians has always been to turn the feet to the east with the head to the west that so they may be ready to meet the lord whom the ancients did believe should appear in the oriental part of heaven durand rat lib   cap    or as our ingenious mr gregory believes that they might be in the posture of prayer with their faces to the east as soon as they were raised there are some ancient authors tell us that the old inhabitants of attica buried thus before the days of solon who as they report convinced the athenians that the island of salamis did of right belong to them by showing them dead bodies looking that way and sepulchers turned toward the east as they use to bury diog laert vit solon etc and the scholiast upon thucidides says it was the manner of all the greeks to bury their dead thus though a learned modern writer supposes these authors mistaken and cites plutarch and elian to prove that the athenians turned their dead toward the west however it is certain that all nations had one certain way of placing the corpse from which they would not vary and we christians have so great antiquity for our custom that we ought not out of singularity to alter it  no doubt but this learned man had great reason for this conclusion as well knowing that this ancient rite was struck at by the whole herd of sectaries as a silly fancy and an idle dream who never would observe it were it not that they are sometimes obliged but would with those who are not obliged act the very reverse and bury north and south i wish there were no powerfuller enemies to it than them now a days but as a mans enemies are too often those of his own household so it is to be lamented that some who pretend to be of our own church are upon all occasions secret advocates against this ceremony when therefore there is such opposition without and such treachery within it is high time to be on the guard against our enemies least a ceremony so venerable for its antiquity and so useful in its observation be laid aside was it but for this one thing that it speaks the hope of the whole christian church since the earliest times of christianity about the resurrection of the same body it is too true that there are some at this time of the day as well as were in the days of the apostle who think it a thing incredible that god should raise the dead some really disbelieving the resurrection of any body and others that of the same body but as long as this ceremony is in being it will always be a ready proof that the whole christian church did not only believe the resurrection of the body but of that very body which was laid down in the grave for they observed it that they might be ready with their faces to meet their savior at his coming to judgment which certainly implies that they believed that very body should rise again  chap vi of the time of cockcrow whether evil spirits wander about in the time of night and whether they fly away at the time of cockcrow reflections upon this encouraging us to have faith and trust in god it is a received tradition among the vulgar that at the time of cockcrowing the midnight spirits forsake these lower regions and go to their proper places they wander say they about the world from the dead hour of night when all things are buried in sleep and darkness till the time of cockcrowing and then they depart hence it is that in countryplaces where the way of life requires more early labor they always go cheerfully to work at that time whereas if they are called abroad sooner they are apt to imagine every thing they see or hear to be a wandering ghost shakespeare has given us an excellent account of this vulgar notion in his tragedy of hamlet  ber it was about to speak when the cock crew   hor and then it started like a guilty thing upon a dreadful summons i have heard the cock that is the trumpet to the day does with his lofty and shrill sounding throat awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or air the extravagant and erring spirit hyes to its confine and of the truth herein this present object made probation  mar it faded at the crowing of the cock some say that ever against that season comes wherein our saviors birth is celebrated the bird of dawning sings all night long and then they say no spirit does walk abroad the nights are wholesome then no planet strikes no fairy takes no witch has power to harm so gracious and so hallowed is that time  now to show what truth there is in this vulgar opinion i shall consider first what truth there is in the roaming of spirits in the night and secondly whether they are obliged to go away at cockcrow  i believe none who assent to the truth of divine revelation deny that there are good and evil angels attending upon men the one to guard and protect them and the other to harm and work their ruin that the one are those heb i     ministering spirits which are sent out to minister to the heirs of salvation the other the roaring lion and his instruments job ii    who wander to and fro in the earth these mat xii    unclean spirits who wander through dry places seeking rest and finding none  nor i believe will it be questioned that there have been apparitions of good and evil spirits and that many with our saviors disciples have been affrighted and cried out not only with supposing they had seen but really with seeing a spirit of this the testimony of all ages and scripture it self are a sufficient demonstration  what then could these have ordinarily been but the appearances of some of those angels of light or darkness for i am far from thinking that either the ghosts of the damned or the happy either the soul of a dives or a lazarus returns here any more for as st athanasius observes hai n tois nois etc athan tom   p    these visions and shades of the saints which appear in the temples and at the tombs are not the souls of the saints themselves but the good angels appearing in their shapes not that god could not remand the ghost of samuel and order it again to visit the earth as he made moses and elias to appear at our saviors transfiguration but that a thing of this nature was very uncommon and seldom happened  taking it therefore for granted that there have been apparitions of angels i believe it will also be owned that these apparitions have frequently happened in the night and truly was there no direct proof of this yet the notion of their appearing in the night being as it were linked and chained to our idea of an apparition would almost persuade us that the night is the most proper time for such appearances whether it is that the fables of nurses lock human underst as an ingenious author imagines have so associated the idea of spirit to the night that the one never appears without the other or whether there is something in the presence of night some awfulness and horror which naturally dispose the mind of man to these reflections i am indeed very inclinable to believe that these legendary stories of nurses and old women are the occasion of much greater fears than people without them would generally have of these things but i cannot help thinking that the presence of night would naturally lead a man to some reflection of spirits without any such cause as that learned author mentions there are some particular times which will naturally raise some particular thoughts thus on a bright sunny day we are naturally disposed to mirth and gaiety when the day overcasts or the weather is hazy we then turn indolent and dull and sooth our selves in melancholy if it thunder and lighten we think of the day of judgment and sudden death and thus also the night as it inclines us to grave and serious thoughts raises in us horror and dismay and makes us afraid even when our judgment tells us there is no fear so it may of it self be looked upon as a natural cause of such reflections  but however this be we must necessarily own that spirits have frequently appeared in the night or we must give the lie to the traditions of all ages to historians profane and sacred and the wisest and best in the generations of men  in the heathen world there are many instances of which i shall only mention this one out of plutarch in vit mar brut trans duke one night before brutus passed out of asia he was very late all alone in his tent with a dim light burning by him all the rest of the army being hushed and silent and musing with himself and very thoughtful as he turned his eye to the door he saw a strange and terrible appearance of a prodigious and frightful body coming toward him without speaking brutus boldly asked him what art thou man or god or upon what business do thou come to us the spirit answered i am thy evil genius thou shall see me at philippi to which brutus not at all disturbed replied then i will see thee there  in the sacred writings we have job job  terrified with visions of the night when deep sleep falls upon men fear came upon him and trembling which made all his bones to shake then a spirit passed by before his face and the hair of his flesh stood up in the night genesis xxxii  jacob wrestled with the angel in the night an angel delivered acts xii peter out of prison etc  but though it be true from scripture that there have been nightly apparitions yet these are chiefly of good angels whereas this opinion principally means the appearances of evil spirits it must be owned indeed that the appearances of evil spirits if literally are yet but very seldom mentioned in the night in scripture but however that they wander and appear at night is very deducible from if not literally mentioned in it theirs is the land of darkness and the shadow of death they are reserved under chains of darkness to the judgment of the great day and we know that every one that does evil naturally hates the light they therefore love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil the night therefore in a more especial manner seems to be their hour and the power of darkness  this was the opinion of the jews as may be learned from the fear of the apostles when they saw our savior about the fourth watch of the night coming to them upon the waters mat xiv    they were affrighted and cried out supposing they had seen a spirit doctor whitby upon this place says that the jews had then an opinion of hurtful spirits walking in the night is evident from the seventy who rendered from the pestilence walking in darkness apo pragmatos diaporeuomenou en skotei from the fear of the devils that walk in the night  and that this was also the opinion of the ancient christians is evident not only from their dividing the night into four watches the evening midnight cockcrowing and the morning which were the military divisions of the night and which si quidem and in nocte stationes and vigiliae militares in quatuor parts divisae ternis horarum spatiis secernuntur isidore lib   de eccle offici cap    they observed to guard their souls from the silent incursions of evil spirits as the others did those of the enemy but also from their many relations of such appearances cassian in giving an account of the watching of the ancient monks and their being assaulted with midnight spirits tells us that at the beginning of the monkish life tanta namque erat eorum feritas ut vix pauci  tolerare habitationem solitudinis possent  ita eorum atrocitas grassabatur and frequentes ac visibiles sentiebantur aggressus ut non auderent omnes pariter noctibus obdormire sed vicissim aliis degustantibus somnum alii vigilias celebrantes psalmis and orationibus seu lectionibus in haerebant cassian coll   cap    the rage of the midnight spirits was so great that but few and these too men of age and unshaken resolution were able to endure the life in the desert for such was their fierceness that where eight or ten had been together in a monastery they would have made frequent and visible incursions insomuch that they never all slept at the same time but took it by turns some watching the rest and exercising themselves in singing psalms in praying and reading and st athanasius in his life of anthony the hermit tells of many conflicts that good man had in the night with the powers of darkness whilst they endeavored to batter him from the strong holds of his faith and what can our church chiefly mean in the collect for aid against perils but that god would send us protection from all the spirits of darkness these midnight wanderers of the world and for this reason every good man when he lies down to sleep at night desires the great keeper of israel who never slumbereth nor sleeps to send his holy angels to pitch their tents round about him and banish from him the spirits of the night  so far then this tradition is just and good that there are midnight spirits who wander about the world going too and fro in the earth seeking whom they may devour let us now in the next place enquire what truth there is in the other part of it namely that they always fly away at cockcrow  this opinion whatever truth there may be in it is certainly very ancient we have it mentioned by the christian poet prudentius who flourished in the beginning of the fourth century as a tradition of common belief his words are these ferunt vagantes daemones laetos tenebris noctium gallo canente exterritos sparsim timere and cedere invisa nam vicinitas lucis salutis numinis rupto tenebrarum situ noctis fugat satellites hoc esse signum praescii norunt repromissae spei qua nos soporis liberi speramus adventum dei they say the wandering powers that love the silent darkness of the night at cockcrowing give over to rove and all in fear do take their flight the approaching salutary morn the approach divine of hated day makes darkness to its place return and drives the midnight ghosts away they know that this an emblem is of what preceeds our lasting bliss that morn when graves give up their dead in certain hope to meet their god   cassian also who lived in the same century giving an account of a multitude of devils who had been abroad in the night says aurora itaque superveniente cum omnis haec ab oculis evanisset daemonum multitudo cass coll   c    that as soon as the morn approached they all vanished and fled away by this we see that this was a current opinion at this time of day but what reason they had for it except some relations of the disappearing of evil spirits at that hour i never yet have met with but there have been produced at that time of night things of very memorable worth which might perhaps raise the pious credulity of some men to imagine that there was something more in it than in other times it was about the time of cockcrowing when our savior was born and the angels sung the first christmascarol to the poor shepherds in the fields of bethlehem now it may be presumed that as the savior of the world was then born and the heavenly host had then descended to proclaim the news that the angels of darkness would be terrified and confounded and immediately fly away and perhaps this consideration has partly been the foundation of this opinion for as this may easily be supposed so perhaps it has been imagined that the spirits of darkness having always in memory that fatal hour are startled and frighted away as the cock proclaims it  it was also about this time when he rose from the dead and when the great sun of righteousness was risen upon the world no wonder that all the clouds of darkness and wickedness were dispelled no wonder that the conquered powers of hell were not able to show their heads and this perhaps has been another reason of their imagining that spirits go away at that time  a third reason is that passage in the book of genesis where jacob wrestled with the angel for a blessing where the angel says unto him genesis xxxii let me go for the day breaks  but indeed this tradition seems more especially to have risen from some particular circumstances attending the time of cockcrowing and which as prudentius seems to say above are an emblem of the approach of the day of the resurrection for when we leave the world we lie down in our graves and rest from our labors sleep and darkness lay hold upon us and there we abide till the last day appear when the voice of the archangel shall awake us that we may meet the lord of light and day and when we leave the common business and care of life we lie down in our beds as in a grave buried as it were in sleep and darkness till the cock crow the welcome messenger of the news of day  the circumstances therefore of the time of cockcrowing being so natural a figure and representation of the morning of the resurrection the night so shadowing out the night of the grave the third watch being as some suppose the time our savior will come to judgment at the noise of the cock awakening sleepy man and telling him as it were the night is far spent the day is at hand representing so naturally the voice of the archangel awakening the dead and calling up the righteous to everlasting day so naturally does the time of cockcrowing shadow out these things that probably some good wellmeaning men have been brought to believe that the very devils themselves when the cock crew and reminded them of them did fear and tremble and shun the light  now in answer to the first of these conjectures it is very likely the evil spirits did fly away in the morning of the nativity and because of our saviors birth and that company of the heavenly host might be afraid and retire into thick darkness yet it will not hence follow that it always happens so at the time of cockcrowing for if they did fly away that morning the circumstances of our saviors birth the heavenly glory of the angelick quire their music and their presence were the occasion of it and why only the bare remembrance of what happened at that time should always at the time of cockcrowing drive them away rather than when they remember it at another no reason seems to be given  as to the second conjecture namely that it was the time of our saviors rising from the dead i answer in the same manner that though it be allowed that the evil spirits might have returned to the land of darkness upon our saviors rising from the dead yet why it should occasion them always to do so at that time no reason can be given  as to the third conjecture it is easy to observe that this was a good angel whereas they that shun the light are bad ones this was the angel of the covenant the creator of light and the lord of the day we may therefore as well imagine that it was not in his power to get out of the arms of jacob without saying let me go as to suppose he was obliged to go because he said the day breaks the meaning of which words according to willet is not that the angel was gone to the blessed company of the angels to sing their morning hymn to god as the hebrews imagine for the angels not only in the morning but at other times are exercised in praising god but the angel thus speaks according to the custom of men having now taken the form and shape of a man as though he had have to other business and leaving jacob also to his affairs  the last conjecture of the rise of this tradition seems to carry greater probability than the others for as these things are a representation of the circumstances of the morning of the resurrection so they must sure enough bring that last day into remembrance and they never can do so but as surely they must create terror and confusion in all the devils and ghosts of the night whilst they assure them they shall never any more enjoy the realms of bliss but be hurried into that matthew xxv    everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels but that these things are the occasion of their flying away at the approach of day is not to be supposed on the contrary the devil and his angels ramble over the world in daylight and are midday devils as well as midnight ones for the devil is incessant in his temptations and therefore he is abroad in the day as well as the night though perhaps has seldom appeared but in darkness thus st austin in one of his meditations et ideo deus meus ad te clamamus libera nos ab adversario nostro quotidiano qui sive dormiamus sive vigilemus  die ac nocte fraudibus and artibus nunc palam nunc occulte sagittas venenatas contra nos dirigens ut interficiat animas nostras aug sol cap    we implore thee o god that thou would deliver us from our daily enemy who by his wiles and cunning is always watching us day and night sleeping and waking and both openly and in secret shooting at us his poisoned arrows that he may destroy our souls  and now what though this be true as it most certainly seems to be so that at the cheerful hour of cockcrowing the wandering ghosts are not driven away but still continue going too and fro what though then their power be still the same and their intentions as fully bent to do evil consider but that gods care and providence govern the world and there will be found as much safety for us in the midst of evil spirits as if they absented at that time the almighty power of god is the same then as at other times nothing but that preserved us continually and that will always be able to preserve us however great may be the malice of devils however desirous of working our ruin though they watch all opportunities and are unwearied in tempting us yet the loving kindness of the lord endures for ever and his mercy is over all his works he will not suffer our foot to be moved he that keeps us will not sleep we shall not be afraid of the sun by day nor the moon by night for the pestilence that walks in darkness nor for the sickness that destroys in the noonday  are we then afraid of darkness and the presence of night let us remember the creator of them and have but faith in him and we shall find our night turned into day in his light shall we see light we shall be as secure as if there was no darkness about us as well knowing that that god which protects us sees through the thickest mediums and the darkest night for with him the darkness is no darkness but the night is as clear as the day the darkness and light to him are both alike or are we afraid of that old serpent the devil that nightly rambler of the world who is a lover of night and darkness let us trust in god and no harm shall happen to us if we will but fear no evil his rod and his staff shall comfort us though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death for god has reserved the devil and his angels in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day though therefore he is permitted to wander the world yet he is so chained up that without gods particular order or permission he is not allowed to touch the sons of men and he is so reserved and kept in darkness that it is not in his power even barely to appear and be visible to them without the permission of god so little reason has every good man to fear the spite and malice of all the devils in hell  when then the night pours out her terrors covers all things with darkness and strikes thee with horror lift but up thy eyes to the hills from whence comes thy help and thou shall clearly see that our lord god is a light and defense to thee  quia filiis lucis and in noctibus dies est quando enim sine lumine est cui lumen in cord est aut quando sol ei and dies non est cui sol and dies christus est cyprian de orat dom for to those who are the children of the light the day shines in the night they are never without light whose hearts are illuminated never without sunshine whose sun is christ in short then if thou fear darkness look up to christ and thou have eternal day if the angels of darkness look but up with the eye of faith and thou shall see the mountains full of chariots and horses of fire thou shall see as did the servant of the prophet elisha that they who be with us are more than they who are against us no matter then whether the spirits of the night go away or only tremble at the time of cockcrowing for sure we are that the angel of the lord tarrieth round about them that fear him and delivers them nay that god himself will arise and scatter his enemies and make them that hate him to fly before him and if god be for us who can be against us  chap vii of churchyards why the vulgar are generally afraid of passing through them at night the original of this fear that there is nothing in them now more than in other places to be afraid of the most of ignorant people are afraid of going through a churchyard at nightime if they are obliged upon some hasty and urgent affair they fear and tremble till they are beyond its bounds but they generally avoid it and go further about it would no question be better if there were fewer pathways through churchyards than there are both as it would prevent several abuses committed in them and also cause the ashes of the dead to be in greater quiet and more undisturbed peace we should not then see churchyards changed into common dunghils nor should we tread so frequently upon the bones of our friends but when for the convenience of neighborhood or other reasons there are allowed public ways it is a very great weakness to be afraid of passing through them  the reason of this fear is a notion they have imbibed that in churchyards there is a frequent walking of spirits at the deadtime of night indeed there is at that time something awful and horrible every where and it must be confessed something more solemn in a churchyard than in the generality of other places but that it is then more frequented with apparitions and ghosts than other places are is at this time of day entirely groundless and without any reason  the original of this timorousness may be deduced from the heathens for they believed that the departed ghosts came out of their tombs and sepulchers and wandered about the place where the body lay buried thus maerin saepe animas imis excite sepulchris  vidi  bucol   virg virgil tells us that maeris could call the ghosts out of their sepulchers and nunc animae tennes  sepulchris  errant  ovid fast ovid that ghosts came out of the sepulchers and wandered about and clemens alexandrinus in his admonitions to the gentiles upbraids them with the gods they worshipped which poos oun etc admonit ad gent p    says he are wont to appear at tombs and sepulchers and which are nothing but fading specter and airy forms and the learned mr mede observes from a passage of this same ancient father mede lib   p     de cultu demon that the heathens supposed the presence and power of demons for so the greeks called the souls of men departed at their coffins and sepulchers as though there always remained some natural tie between the deceased and their relicts agreeable to this dr scot scot christ life p    part   in his discourse of the christian life speaks of gross and sensual souls who appeared often after their separation in churchyards or charnelhouses where their bodies were laid the plat phaed p      soul that is infected with a great lust to the body continues so for a great while after death and suffering many reluctances hovers about this visible place and is hardly drawn from thence by force by the demon that has the guard and care of it by the visible place he means p     ibid their monuments and sepulchers where the shadowy fantasms of such souls have sometimes appeared  it having therefore been a current opinion of the heathens that places of burial and churchyards were frequently haunted with specter and apparitions it is easy to imagine that the opinion has been handed from them among the ignorant and unlearned throughout all the ages of christianity to the present day and indeed though now there may be no such things yet that there have been need not be disputed not that they were the real souls of men departed for i cannot see for what reason it should be supposed  scot christ ibid  however unacquainted such souls might be with the pleasures of spirits that they are permitted to wander to hover about and linger after their bodies it seems rather to be true what is mentioned of such apparitions in st athanasiuss questions to antiochius that athan tom   p   0 these apparitions of the saints which appear at tombs and temples are not the souls of the saints themselves but the good angels appearing in their likeness and i imagine it must be so too with the souls of bad men they appear not themselves but they are represented by the evil angels for the soul upon the departure returns to god that gave it who alots it its station in the world of spirits where it is kept till the day of judgment in happiness or misery when it shall receive its compleation of the one or the other however whatever these apparitions were they are a certain proof that such appearances have been in such places and indeed to add no more it is the whole voice of antiquity  but now with us god be thanked the scene is changed we live not in the darkness of error but in the light of truth we worship not demons but the god of the whole earth and our temples are not the temples of idols but the temples of the holy god if among the heathens such delusions were permitted it was because god had forsaken them but when he vouchsafes to have his residence in his holy temple we are the further from harm the nearer we approach it psalm lxxxiv there the sparrow has found her an house and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young and there shall no harm happen to good men but they shall be rather protected because they are so near their fathers house the house of prayer  chap viii of visiting wells and fountains the original of this custom the naming of them of great antiquity the worship paid them by the papists was gross idolatry in the dark ages of popery it was a custom if any well had an awful situation and was seated in some lonely melancholy vale if its water was clear and limpid and beautifully  viridi si margin clauderet undas  herba  juven sat   margind with the tender grass or if it was looked upon as having a medicinal quality to gift it to some saint and honor it with his name hence it is that we have at this day wells and fountains called some st johns st mary magdalens st marys well etc  to these kind of wells the common people are accustomed to go on a summers evening to refresh themselves with a walk after the toil of the day to drink the water of the fountain and enjoy the pleasing prospect of shade and stream  now this custom though at this time of day very commendable and harmless and innocent seems to be the remains of that superstitious practice of the papists of paying adoration to wells and fountains for they imagined there was some holiness and sanctity in them and so worshipped them in the canons of st anselm made in the year   0  we find this superstitious practice in some measure forbid johnson consti st anselm can    let no one attribute reverence or sanctity to a dead body or a fountain or other things as sometimes is to our knowledge without the bishops authority and in the   th of the canons made in the reign of king edgar in the year     it is ordered johnson consti   0  that every priest industriously advance christianity and extinguish heathenism and forbid the worshipping of fountains etc mr johnson says upon this canon that the worshipping of wells and fountains was a superstition which prevailed in this nation till the age before the reformation nay i cannot say it is extinguished yet among the papists in the ages of dark popery it was thought sufficient to forbid the honoring of wells and fountains without the bishops approbation  the giving of names to wells is of great antiquity we find it a custom in the days of the old patriarchs abraham observed this custom and therefore the well which he recovered from the servants of abimeleck he genesis xxi    called beersheba or the well of the oath because there they swear both of them thus also isaac when his herdsmen had found a well and the herdsmen of gerar had a contest with them about the right of it genesis    called the name of the well eseck that is strife because they strove with him and he dug another well and strove for that also and he called the name of it sitnah that is hatred and he removed from thence and dug another well and for that they strove not and he called the name of it rehoboth that is room and he said for now the lord has made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land and we read it was at jacobs well where jesus talked with the woman of samaria to give names therefore to wells is of an ancient standing but to pay homage and worship to them was never heard of among the people of god till they sunk into gross idolatry and became worshippers of stocks and stones when the creature became worshipped instead of the creator then was this custom first introduced in the ages of popish ignorance and idolatry  there need be no question but as this custom is practically heathenish so it is also originally for the heathens were wont to worship streams and fountains and to suppose that the nymphs whom they imagined the goddesses of the waters presided over them as the papists have borrowed many of their silly and superstitious ceremonies from the religion of the heathens so this in particular a sottish stupid and abominable custom they could borrow no where else for we had no such custom neither at any time the churches of god  chap ix of omens their original the observation of them sinful omens and prognostications of things are still in the mouths of all though only observed by the vulgar in country places especially they are in great repute and are the directors of several actions of life being looked on by them as presages of things future or the determiners of present good or evil if lepus quoque occurrens in via infortunatum iter praesagit and ominosum alex ab alex lib   c    p     a hare cross their way it is an omen of ill luck if saepe sinistra cava praedixit ab ilice cornix virg bucol   a crow cry it portends something evil if maxim vero abominatus est bubo tristis and dira avis voce funesta and gemitu qui formidolosa dirasque necessitates and magnas moles instar portendit alex ab alex lib   c    p   0 an owl which they reckon a most abominable and unlucky bird sends forth its hoarse and dismal voice it is an omen of the approach of some terrible thing that some dire calamity and some great misfortune is near at hand if salt fall toward them to be sure something has happened to one in the family or is shortly to happen to themselves such also is the chattering of a magpye the cry of ravens the deadwatch crickets etc  this is a copy of the omens of the heathens deinde anguribus and reliqui reges usi et exactis regibus nihil public fine auspiciis nec domi nec militiae gerabatur cic de divin lib   who never went upon any enterprise nor undertook any business of moment without consulting the augurs and wisemen and being guided by omens and presages of things hence it was that they consulted the intrails of beasts the flights of birds and several other things and that the very things abovementioned as the authorities there declare have been observed by them yea they have observed them even in the remotest ages beyond the days of the oldest records the heathen world therefore was full of them and without all doubt they have been handed down to us from these times  and as it is not to be questioned but we had them from the heathens so in all probability the heathens have taken them from the people of god and built many of their folies and ominous superstitions on a custom which they alone were indulged in for in the earliest ages of the world when a matter of any great consequence was depending and the servants of god would know what the event would be they asked a sign of god by desiring that such a thing might happen if they were to succeed and god was sometimes so condescending as to grant them their desire thus we read that sam i    iii  0 jonathan accompanied only by his armorbearer not fearing the steepness of the rocks nor multitudes of enemies attempted the garrison of the philistines and conquered through a token of this nature if they say says he to his armorbearer tarry until we come up then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them but if they say come up unto us then we will go up for the lord has delivered them into our hands and this shall be a sign unto us and so indeed it came to pass god who had inspired jonathan with this thought directing the tongues of the others according to his wishes in like manner when the good old servant of abraham had arrived at the city of nahor to find a wife for his masters son we have him desiring of god that the sign of the woman he should pitch upon might be her saying drink and i will give thy camels drink also genesis xxiv    and he said o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master abraham behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou have appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou have showed kindness unto my master this happened according to his prayer by which he knew that the lord had prospered his journey now this custom we know the philistines imitated when they would know whether they had been afflicted by the god of israel for keeping the ark sam i     they took the ark of the lord and laid it on a cart and sent it away and they said if it goes by the way of his own coast to bethshemoth then he has done us this great evil  in these early ages of the world god permitted such things upon extraordinary occasions to be asked by his own people but they were only peculiar to those times we have no warrant for doing the like it becomes not us to prescribe means to god by which we may judge of our future success but to depend on his power and wisdom his care and providence the observation of omens such as the falling of salt a hare crossing the way of the deadwatch of crickets etc are sinful and diabolical they are the inventions of the devil to draw men from a due trust in god and make them his own vassals for by such observations as these they are the slaves of superstition and sin and have all the while no true dependence upon god no trust in his providence  chap x of the country conversation in a winters evening their opinions of spirits and apparitions of the devils appearing with a cloven foot of fairies and hobgoblins of the walking places of spirits and of haunted houses nothing is commoner in county places than for a whole family in a winters evening to sit round the fire and tell stories of apparitions and ghosts and no question of it but this adds to the natural fearfulness of men and makes them many times imagine they see things which really are nothing but their own fancy from this and seldom any other cause it is that herds and shepherds have all of them seen frequent apparitions and are generally so well stocked with stories of their own knowledge some of them have seen fairies some spirits in the shapes of cows and dogs and horses and some have seen even the devil himself with a cloven foot all which is either hearsay or a strong imagination not that there have not been or may not be apparitions we know that there have undoubtedly been such things and that there still are upon particular occasions but that almost all the stories of ghosts and spirits are grounded on no other bottom than the fears and fancies and weak brains of men  in their account of the apparition of the devil they always describe him with a cloven foot that is always his distinguishing badge whatever shape he appears in whether it be in beauty or deformity he never appears without it such is the old tradition they have received of his appearing and such is their belief of it  indeed it must be confessed that this is not so improbable and ridiculous as many things they hold for though perhaps few of them have ought else for this opinion but old wives fables or the picture of the devil which they have always observed drawn with a cloven foot yet there seems to be some truth in it for in the times of frequent apparitions the devil was wont to appear so if we may believe antiquity and there is also some reason for it considering the circumstances of the fallen angels  the brown s vulg err author of the vulgar errors upon this same subject has these words the ground of this opinion at first might be his frequent appearing in the shape of a goat which answers this description this was the opinion of the ancient christians concerning the apparitions of panites fauns and satyrs and of this form we read of one that appeared to anthony in the wilderness the same is also confirmed from expositions of holy scripture for whereas it is said thou shall not offer unto devils the original word is seghnirim that is rough and hairy goats because in that shape the devil most often appeared as is expounded by the rabbis as tremellius has also explained and as the word ascimah the god of emath is by some conceived he observes also that the goat was the emblem of the sin offering and is the emblem of sinful men at the day of judgment  and of this opinion was also the learned mr mede dis  0 mede he says that when spirits converse with men it is under some visible shape and that there is a law given them that that shape they assumed should be of something which more or less resembled their condition for as in nature we see every thing has a several and suitable physiognomy or figure as a badge of their inward nature whereby it is known as by a habit of distinction so it seems to be in the shapes and apparitions of spirits and as in a well governed commonwealth every sort and condition is known by a differing habit agreeable to his quality so it seems it should be in gods great commonwealth concerning the shapes which spirits take upon them and he that gave the law that a man should not wear the habit of a woman nor a woman the habit of a man because that as he had made them diverse so would he have them so known by their habits so it seems he will not suffer a good and a bad spirit a noble and ignoble one to appear unto man after the same fashion  now from this it will follow that good angels can take upon them no other shape but the shape of man because their glorious excellency is resembled only in the most excellent of all visible creatures the shape of an inferior creature would be unsuitable no other shape becoming those who are called the sons of god but his only who was created after gods own image and yet not his neither as he now is but according as he was before his fall in his glorious beauty of his integrity age and deformity are the fruits of sin and the angel in the gospel appears like a young man his matthew xxviii countenance like lightning and his raiment white as snow as it were resembling the beauty of glorified bodies in immutability sublimity and purity  hence also it follows on the contrary that the devil could not appear in humane shape whilst man was in his integrity because he was a spirit fallen from his first glorious perfection and therefore must appear in such shape which might argue his imperfection and abasement which was the shape of a beast otherwise no reason can be given why he should not rather have appeared to eve in the shape of a woman than of a serpent for so he might have gained an opinion with her both of more excellency and knowledge but since the fall of man the case is altered now we know he can take upon him the shape of man and no wonder since one falling star may resemble another and therefore he appears it seems in the shape of mans imperfection either for age or deformity as like an old man for so the witches say and perhaps it is not altogether false which is vulgarly affirmed that the devil appearing in humane shape has always a deformity of some uncouth member or other as though he could not yet take upon him humane shape entirely for that man himself is not entirely and utterly fallen as he is  thus far has this great and learned man given his opinion of this matter and that with such strength of reason and argument as leaves at least a probability behind it of the truth of this opinion  another part of this conversation generally turns upon fairies these they tell you have frequently been heard and seen nay that there are some still living who were stolen away by them and confined seven years according to the description they give of them who pretend to have seen them they are in the shape of men exceeding little they are always clad in green and frequent the woods and fields when they make cakes which is a work they have been often heard at they are very noisy and when they have done they are full of mirth and pastime but generally they dance in moonlight when mortals are asleep and not capable of seeing them as may be observed on the following morn their dancing places being very distinguishable for as they dance hand in hand and so make a circle in their dance so next day there will be seen rings and circles on the grass  now in all this there is really nothing but an old fabulous story which has been handed down even to our days from the times of heathenism of a certain sort of beings called lamiae which were esteemed so mischievous and cruel as to take away young children and slay them these together with the fauns the gods of the woods seem to have formed the notion of fairies  this opinion in the benighted ages of popery when hobgoblins and sprights were in every city and town and village by every water and in every wood was very common but when that cloud was dispelled and the day sprung up those spirits which wandered in the night of ignorance and error did really vanish at the dawn of truth and the light of knowledge  another tradition they hold and which is often talked of is that there are particular places allotted to spirits to walk in thence it was that formerly such frequent reports were abroad of this and that particular place being haunted by a spirit and that the common people say now and then such a place is dangerous to be passed through at night because a spirit walks there nay they will further tell you that some spirits have lamented the hardness of their condition in being obliged to walk in cold and uncomfortable places and have therefore desired the person who was so hardy as to speak to them to gift them with a warmer walk by some well grown hedge or in some shady vale where they might be sheltered from the rain and wind  the stories that apparitions have been seen oftener than once in the same place have no doubt been the rise and spring of the walking places of spirits but why they are said sometimes to cry out for places that are more comfortable is not so certainly known it is however highly probable that when the ignorance and superstition of the romish church had filled the world with apparitions and ghosts that this also was invented among them for they seem to have the most right to an invention of this nature whose brains were so fruitful of folly as to invent that fullers chapter hist cen  0 dunstan took the devil by the nose with a pair of hot tongs till he roared again for if the devil may be burnt he may also be starved if he took such pains to get his nose out of the pincers without doubt in a frosty night he would wish to be as warm as possible he that believes the one must necessarily believe the other and therefore it very near amounts to a demonstration who were the authors of this opinion viz the monks we are sure they invented the one and need little question but they invented the other  there is a story in the book of tobit which they may believe that will of the evil spirits flying into the utmost parts of egypt tob vi for as tobias went in unto his wife he remembered the words of raphael and took the ashes of the perfumes and put the heart and liver of the fish thereupon and made a smoke therewith the which smell when the evil spirit had smelled he fled into the utmost parts of egypt and the angel bound him now from this it is evident that the spirit was obliged to forsake his good old quarters and warm lodgings for inhospitable deserts and open air and from this perhaps some of those doting monks have persuaded themselves into a belief of these things  when it is proved to us that this book of tobit is the word of god we may entertain more veneration for this vulgar opinion but till then we must be iudulgd in wondering how a spirit that is an immaterial substance can be affected with our heat or cold or any power or quality of material beings  the last topic of this conversation i shall take notice of shall be the tales of haunted houses and indeed it is not to be wondered at that this is never omitted for formerly almost every place had a house of this kind if a house was seated on some melancholy place or built in some old romantic manner or if any particular accident had happened in it such as murder sudden death or the like to be sure that house had a mark set on it and was afterward esteemed the habitation of a ghost in talking upon this point they generally show the occasion of the houses being haunted the merry pranks of the spirit and how it was laid stories of this kind are infinite and there are few villages which have not either had such an house in it or near it  and indeed there are men of good learning and knowledge who are as far as others from superstition who are inclinable to believe that such things have been upon particular emergencies though among the stories that are told they believe not one in a thousand they know that spirits have frequently appeared to men out of houses and they can see no reason why they may not have appeared in them they know nothing in an house more than in another place to prevent an apparition but an equal help to its visibility the air which a ghost is supposed to be wrapped in when it becomes visible to men is there to be found and they know of nothing else that may be an argument against it an author of good credit tells us cum romae aegra valetudine oppressus forem jaceremque in lectulo speciem mulieris eleganti forma mihi plane vigilanti observatam fuisse quam cum inspicerem diu cogitabundus etc  cum meos sensus vigere and figuram illam nusquam a me dilabi etc alex ab alex lib   c   that when he was at rome he was taken with illness and obliged to keep his bed as he lay in this condition he observed as he was once awake a woman of a very beautiful person coming toward him upon this he was silent for some time and very thoughtful weighing all the while with himself whether it was not rather a deceptio visus than a real being but when he perceived his senses sound and entire and that the object still continued he asked what she was in answer to which she repeated the very words he had spoke to her in a sneering and disdainful manner after she had taken a good view of him she departed  the commentator upon this place says sed haec semper mera somnia esse putavi ibid he looks upon this story and the rest which are mentioned along with it to be nothing but dreams and fancies and for ought that i know to the contrary they may be so but however it must be confessed this story in particular is well attested being told by the man himself who was a great and a learned man and who if we may believe himself seems to be as sure that he had his eyes open as the commentator can be of the contrary  but whatever truth there may be in it it is certain that in the church of rome they are persuaded of the truth of it to a fault for they are so sure of it that they have particular forms of exorcising such houses which because they have often been heard of but seldom seen and are those very things which raised in the vulgar formerly such an opinion of their ignorant priests as to make them be esteemed men of the greatest faith and learning and because also the opinion has reached even our days and it is common for the present vulgar to say none can lay a spirit but a popish priest it shall be the business of the next chapter to give one of those forms of exorcising an house not that they are envied for their art of conjuring but that it may be seen how well they deserve the character they go under  chap xi postexer citatio septima f valerii polidori patavini quae ordo

little regarded it for under the table they had made a privy entrance whereby they entered in continually and consumed those things so when they were gone forth the king set meats before bell now daniel had commanded his servants to bring ashes and those they strewed throughout all the temple in the presence of the king alone then went they out and shut the door and sealed it with the kings signet and so departed now in the night came the priests with their wives and children as they were wont to do and did eat and drink up all in the morning betime the king arose and daniel with him and the king said daniel are the seals whole and daniel said yea o king they be whole and as soon as he had opened the door the king looked upon the table and cried with a loud voice great art thou o bell and with thee there is no deceit at all then daniel laughed and told the king that he should not go in and said behold now the pavement and mark well whose footsteps are these and the king said i see the footsteps of men women and children and then the king was angry and took the priests with their wives and children who showed him the privy doors where they came in and consumed such things as were upon the table therefore the king slew them and delivered bell into daniels power who destroyed him and his temple  v blessed are they that dwell in thy house  r they will be always praising thee

has placed himself in one of the largest and most sumptuous parts of the house he shall direct this exorcism to the demons that haunt it saying  i exorcise you o ye demons who have thus boldly presumed to invade this habitation of men and give such disquietude to its inhabitants by the triune god whose is the earth and the fullness thereof the round world and they that dwell therein by our lord jesus christ who continuing what he was made himself man conceived by the holy ghost and born of a virgin and who for our sakes when he had undergone many sufferings underwent also the torment of the cruel cross upon which he bowed his head and gave up the ghost that he might obtain for us abundant grace in the present life and in the world to come life everlasting by all the grace acquired for us by the grace of faith conferred in baptism of fortitude in confirmation of charity in the eucharist of justice in penance of hope in extreme unction of temperance in matrimony and of prudence in holy orders and by all holy men and women the saints of god who now inherit eternal glory and by all their merits that you remove this your presumptuous power from this house and continue here no

omnipotent god who built the house of the whole world for man and put all things in it in subjection under his feet and by christ our lord who is the fountain of all grace and the origin of all virtue by his unparalled poverty of which he truly said the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man has not where to lay his head by his meekness he himself saying of it learn

the will of my father which is in heaven by his mercy which excited him to say i will have mercy and not sacrifice by his purity of heart of which he could say be ye holy for i am holy by the peace which he always loved as at the last he showed when he said peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you and by that persecution which he suffered for righteousness sake which he himself attests saying if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you and by the holy apostles and by the effusion of their blood and by all holy men and holy women that thou may be blessed and obtain from god above such virtue by our ministry that thou may become to the evil spirits a new hell and a burning furnace of eternal horror so that they may flee from every corner and leave thee entirely free that thou may become a comfortable habitation for men and that god may ever be glorified  after that let him bless the house in the following manner v o lord hear my prayer  r and let my cry come unto thee  v he has blessed the house of israel  r he has blessed the house of aaron  mac b   c    thou o lord of all things who have need of nothing wast pleased that the temple of thine habitation should

sanctified of thee by our ministry that the evil angels may abdicate it and it may be a protection for the faithful a pure habitation for the holy angels and a possession always worthy of thy care through our lord jesus christ thy son who lives and reigns with thee in the unity of the holy spirit god who shall come to judge the quick and the dead and the world by fire amen  then let the image of our savior upon the cross be erected in an open part of the principal room in the house and let the priest sprinkle the whole house with holy water from top even to the bottom saying the lesson st luke chap xix and jesus entered and passed through jericho and behold there was a man named zaccheus which was the chief among the publicanes and he was rich and he sought to see jesus who he was and he could not for the press because he was little of stature and he ran before and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him for he was to pass that way and when jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zaccheus make haste and come down for to day i must abide at thy house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be a guest with a man that is a sinner and zaccheus stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken any thing of any man by false accusation i restore him fourfold and jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house forasmuch as he also is the son of abraham for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost  when all these things are done let abyssum which is a kind of an herb be procured and after it is signed with the sign of the cross let it be hung up at the four corners of the house i suppose the reason of proceeding after this manner day by day is that the devil may be gradually banished and to be sure what is observed on the last of the days viz the ordering of the crucifix the holy water the abyssum tied to the four corners of the house is to keep the devil out when he is out  st austin tells us a story of one vir  hesperitius  ubi  domum suam spirituum malignorum vim noxiam perpeti comperisset rogavit nostros me absente presbyteros ut aliquis eorum illo pergeret cujus orationibus cederent perrexit unus obtulit ibi sacrificium corporis christi orans quantum potuit ut cessaret illa vexatio deo protinus miserante cessarit aug de civit dei lib    cap   hesperitius whose house was troubled with evil spirits who came once in his absence to his presbyters and begged their assistance upon which one of them went along with him and when he had offered the sacrifice of the body of christ and prayed in a most fervent manner the house by the mercy of god was no longer troubled  here is indeed an account of a house being haunted but not a word of any such order in the dispossessing it the priest goes immediately over the threshold into the troubled apartment and expells the spirits by his prayers had such forms been customary in the days of st austin had the crucifix holy water and abyssum been used no question but here or somewhere else we should have had some account of it but these ages were unacquainted with such whimsical forms of exorcising and if the story be true it was nothing but prayer that quieted the house it is ridiculous to suppose that the prince of darkness will yield to such feeble instruments as water and herbs and crucifixes these weapons are not spiritual but carnal whereas in resisting this potent enemy we must put on the whole armor of god that we may be able to resist him which is such a composition as is entirely free from the least allay or mixture of any such superstitions  chap xii of saturday afternoon how observed of old by the ancient christians the church of scotland and the old church of england what end we should observe it for an exhortation to the observation of it it is usual in country places and villages where the politeness of the age has made no great conquest to observe some particular times with some ceremonies which were customary in the days of our forefathers such are the great festivals of christmas easter and several others which they observe with rites and customs appropriated to them  among these we find a great deference paid to saturday afternoon above the other worky days of the week then the labors of the plough ceast and refreshment and ease are over all the village  this seems to be the remains of a laudable custom once in this land but now almost buried in that general contempt of religion and love of the world which prevail so much every where of attending the evening prayers on saturday and laying aside the concerns of this life to be fitter for the duties of the day following for baily prac piety p     it was an holy custom among our forefathers when at the ringing to prayer the eve before the sabbath the husbandman would give over his labor in the field and the tradesman his work in the shop and go to evening prayer in the church to prepare their souls that their minds might more cheerfully attend gods worship on the sabbath day  and indeed it was the custom both of the jewish and the christian church they neither of them entered upon the sabbath without some preparation for it moses exodus xvi  taught the jews to remember the sabbath over night from whence in all probability it comes to pass that the eve of the jewish sabbath is called the preparation the preparation mentioned by the evangelists begun at three a clock on friday afternoon it was proclaimed with the noise of trumpets and horns that they might be better put in mind of the sabbaths drawing on and of that preparation which was requisite for it  among the primitive christians the lords day was always ushered in with a pernoctation or vigil they assembled in the house of god and sung psalms and praises to him a great part of the night that they might be better prepared to serve him on his own day following mark xiv   in the year of our lord   0  william king of scotland called a council of the chief men of his kingdom at which also was present the popes legate and it was then determined that saturday after the twelfth hour should be kept holy that no one should follow their business nor callings but desist as on other holy days that they should be put in mind of it by the tolling of the bell and then mind the business of religion as on holy days be present at the sermon and hear vespers that this should be the practice till monday morning and whoever acted otherwise should be severely punished  and this as is said before was also the custom of our own country long before this ordered in scotland for in the year     when in scotia anno salutis   0  gulielmus rex primorum regni sui concilium cogit cui etiam interfuit pontificius legatus in quo decretum est ut saturni dies abhora    meridiei sacer esset neque quisquam res profanas exerceret quemadmodum aliis quoque festis diebus vetitum id erat idque campanae pulsu populo indicaretur ac postea sacris rebus ut diebus festis operam darint concionibus interessent vesperas audirent idque in diem lunae facerent constituta transgressoribus gravi paena boet lib    de scot ex hospin p     king edgar made his ecclesiastical laws we find one made to this very purpose in which it is ordered that dies sabbati ab ipsa diei saturni hora pomeridiana tertia usque in luminarii diei diluculum festus agitator etc seld analect angl lib   cap   the sabbath or sunday shall be observed from saturday at mr johnson upon this law says that the noontide signifies three in the afternoon according to our present account and this practice i conceive continued down to the reformation in king winfreds time the lords day did not begin till sunset on the saturday see     numb  0 three in the afternoon was hora nona in the latin account and therefore called noon how it came afterward to signify midday i can but guess the monks by their rules could not eat their dinner till they had said their noon song which was a service regularly to be said at three a clock but they probably anticipated their devotions and their dinner by saying their noon song immediately after their midday song and presently falling on i wish they had never been guilty of a worse fraud than this but it may fairly be supposed that when midday became the time of dining and saying noon song it was for this reason called noon by the monks who were the masters of the language during the dark ages in the shepherds almanac noon is midday highnoon three a clock johnson constable part   ann     noon till the light appear on monday morning  now hence has come the present custom of spending a part of saturday afternoon without servile labor and that our forefathers when the bell was heard attended the evening prayer not fearing the loss of time nor the necessities of poverty happy would it be for us would we so banish the care of the body for the care of the soul would we leave to converse about secular business and mind then the business of religion would we remember that it is luke xxiii     the preparation and that the sabbath draws on  when jacob was going to worship god at bethel he ordered his family to genesis xxxv   put away the strange gods that were among them and be clean and change their garments and arise and go to bethel he knew that the god of purity and holiness was to be approached with the utmost purity they could possibly cloth themselves with and would we before we enter into the presence of god on his own day endeavor to purify our selves from the filth of the world we have contracted in the days before would we disperse these busy swarms of things which so attract our minds and prepare our selves for the following day we should appear before god less earthly and more heavenly less sinful and more holy our psalm cxliv    prayers would be set forth in his sight as the incense and the lifting up of our hands be an evening sacrifice and like the smell of jacobs garment in the nostrils of his father the smell of our prayers would genesis xxvii    be like the smell of a field which the lord has blessed  and now what is this preparation but the trimming of our lamps against we meet the lord on the next day our bodies should be refreshed by ceasing early from their labor that they may be active and vigorous and our souls washed with sobriety and temperance and the private or public prayer of the evening thus should we meet the lord at bethel and obtain those mercies we sought of him there  art thou then blessed with an affluence of things and has providence placed thee above the careful stations of life what reason then can be sufficient for thy neglect of this custom for neither can thou plead the want of time neither do thou dread the straits of poverty  or art thou involved in the cares of business do thou earn thy bread by the sweat of thy face and the labors of thy hands o well is thee and happy may thou be would thou dedicate this small time to the service of god it would be like the widows mite which was more than all that was thrown into the treasury but perhaps thou will say thou art under the yoke subject to servitude and obliged to work even to the latter end of the day it may be so but yet as god is every where present so would thou remember that it is the preparation and put up an ejaculation at thy work god would accept it and it would prove to thee an equal good with the other preparation cassian haec officia  per totum dici spatium jugiter cum operis adjectione spontanea celebrantur cassian instit lib   cap   tells us that the ancient monks whilst they were working in the private cells repeated their religious offices and st jerome when he is commending the pleasing retirement of the village of bethlehem in christi villa tuta rusticitas est extra psalmos silentium est quocunque te verteris arator stiuam retinens alleluia decantatur sudans messor psalmis se advocat etc hierom ep    ad marcel says that in the village of christ there is a secure rusticity no noise is heard there but the singing of psalms wheresoever you go you have either the ploughman singing hallelujahs as he is holding the plough or the sweating mower pleasing himself with hymns or the vinedresser singing davids psalms these without doubt were acceptable to god and thine undoubtedly will be acceptable also  but if thou art not tied down by necessity do not say that the common necessaries of life require then thy labor for this is not losing but redeeming the time what thou spendest in the care of thy soul is not lost in the care of thy body never was man poorer for observing the duties of religion if thou lose any thing of the wages of the day to do the service of god he will take care to supply it thou shall be no loser  why then art thou fearful o thou of little faith why do thou take so much thought for thy life behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feeds them art thou not much better than they and why take thou thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto thee that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these and shall he not much more cloth thee o thou of little faith therefore take no thought for what thou shall eat or what thou shall drink or where withal thou shall be clothed but seek thou first the kingdom of god and his righteousness prefer the care of these to the care of all other things and all these things shall be added unto thee  let not then the busy cares of this life be any hinderance to thy care of the other set apart this small time for the time of preparation and look on it as an emblem of the whole time of life which is our day of preparation for the eternal sabbath the everlasting rest the undesturbed quiet of the other life  chap xiii of the yuleclog and christmascandle what they may signify their antiquity the like customs in other places in the primitive church christmas day was always observed as the lords day was and was in like manner preceeded by an eve or vigil hence it is that our church has ordered an eve before it which is observed by the religious as a day of preparation for that great festival  our forefathers when the common devotions of the eve were over and night was come on were wont to light up candles of an uncommon size which were called christmascandles and to lay a log of wood upon the fire which they termed a yuleclog or christmasblock these were to illuminate the house and turn the night into day which custom in some measure is still kept up in the northren parts  it has in all probability been derived from the saxons forbid tells us that this very night was observed in this land before by the heathen saxons they incipiebant autem annum ab octavo calendarum januarii die ubi nunc natale domini celebramus and ipsam noctem nunc nobis sacrosanctam tunc gentili vocabulo maedrenack i e matrum noctem appellabant ob causam ut suspicamur ceremoniarum quas in ea pervigiles agebant beda de rat temp cap    began says he their year on the eight of the calends of january which is now our christmas day and the very night before which is now holy to us was by them called maedrenack or the night of mothers because as we imagine of those ceremonies which were performed that night the yuleclog therefore has probably been a part of that nights ceremonies the very name seems to speak it and tells its original to every age  it seems to have been used as an emblem of the return of the sun and the lengthening of the days for as december guili eodem quo januarius nomine vocatur  guili a conversione solis in auctum diei nomen accipit beda ibid both december and january were called guili or gehol or geol anglsax jol vel jul dan sax and to this day in the north yule you will signifies the solemn festival of christmas and were words used to denote a time of festivity very anciently and before the introduction of christianity among the northern nations learned men have disputed much about this word some deriving it from julius caesar others from the word gehtheol a wheel as bede who would therefore have it so called because of the return of the suns annual course after the winter solstice but he writing de rat temp speaks rather as an astronomer than an antiquary the best antiquaries derive it from the word ol ale which was much used in their festivities and merry meetings and the i in iol iul cimbr as the ge and gi in gehol geol giul sax are premised only as intensives to add a little to the signification and make it more emphatical ol or ale as has been observed did not only signify the liquor they made use of but gave denomination likewise to their greatest festivals as that of gehol or yule at midwinter and as is yet plainly to be discerned in that custom of the whitsunale at the other great festival elstob sax hom birth daygreg append p     bishop stilingfleet has also taken notice of this and says that some think the name of this feast was taken from iola which in the gothic language signifies to make merry but he seems not inclinable to this opinion and therefore tells us that olaus rudbeck thinks the former  viz its being called so from the joy that was conceived at the return of the sun more proper not only from bedes authority but because in the old runick fasti a wheel was used to denote that festival stilling orig britan   yule upon account of the suns returning and the increase of the days so i am apt to believe the log has had the name of the yulelog from its being burnt as an emblem of the returning sun and the increase of its light and heat  this was probably the reason of the custom among the heathen saxons but i cannot think the observation of it was continued for the same reason after christianity was embraced for bishop stillingfleet observes in his origines britanicae that though the ancient saxons observed twelve days at that time and sacrificed to the sun in hopes of his returning yet when christianity prevailed all these idolatrous sacrifices were laid aside and that time of feasting was joined with the religious solemnity of that season which in other parts of the world were observed by christians and in like manner as these days of feasting were joined with the religious solemnities of that season so the keeping up of this custom seems to have been done with another view than it was originally if a conjecture may be allowed it might have been done on account of our saviors birth which happened that night for as the burning of it before christianity was an emblem of the coming of the sun which they worshipped as their god so the continuing it after might have been for a symbol of that light which was that night born into the world the light that shines in darkness the light that lightened the gentiles that turned them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god  and indeed it will be some strengthening of the conjecture that light has been the emblem of several things both in scripture and in the ancient church for the scripture makes use of it and the church in imitation of the scripture as a lively representation of several things thus light is the emblem of god for god is light says the apostle st john john the baptist was a burning and a shining light and therefore in some places it feruntur quoque brandae seu faces ardentes and fiunt ignos qui significant sanctum joannem qui fuit lumen and lucerna ardens and praecedens and praecursor verae lucis quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in hunc mundum durand rational lib   cap    nu    is customary to carry torches on st john the baptists eve to represent st john baptist himself who was a burning and a shining light and a preparer of the way for the true light that lighteneth every man that comes into the world the apostles were the light of the world and as our savior was frequently called light so was this his coming into the world signified and pointed out by the emblems of light it was then says our countryman gregory the longest night in all the year and it was the midst of that and yet there was day where he was for a glorious and betokening light shined round about this holy child so says tradition and so the masters describe the night piece of the nativity if this be called in question as being only tradition it is out of dispute that the light which illuminated the fields of bethlehem and shone round about the shepherds as they were watching their flocks was an emblem of that light which was then come into word what quid est quod apparenti angelo divinae quoque claritatis splendour eos circumdedit quod nunquam in tota testamenti veteris serie and reperimus cum tam innumeris vicibus angeli prophetis and justis apparuerunt nusquam eos fulgore divinae lucis homines circumdedisse legimus nisi quod hoc privilegium recte huius temporis dignitati servatum est etc bed hyem de sanct in gal cant can be the meaning says venerable bede that this apparition of angels was surrounded with that heavenly light which is a thing we never meet with in all the old testament for though angels have appeared to prophets and holy men yet we never read of their appearing in such glory and splendour before it must surely be because this privilege was reserved for the dignity of this time for when the true light of the world was born in the world it was very proper that the proclaimer of his nativity should appear in the eyes of men in such an heavenly light as was before unseen in the world and that supernatural star which was the guide of the eastern magi was a figure of that star which was risen out of jacob of that light which should lighten the gentiles god says bishop tailor sent a miraculous star to invite and lead them to a new and more glorious light the light of grace and glory  in imitation of this as gregory tells us the church went on with the ceremony and hence it was that for the three or four first centuries the whole eastern church called the day which they observed for our saviors nativity the epiphany or manifestation of the light and cassian tells us intra egypti regionem mos iste traditione antiqua servatur ut peracto epiphaniorum die etc cassian coll  0 c  0 that it was a custom in egypt handed down by tradition as soon as the epiphany or day of light was over etc hence also came that ancient custom of the same church taken notice of by st jerome of absque martyrum reliquiis per totas orientis ecclesias quum legendum est evangelium accenduntur luminaria jam sole rutilante non utique ad fugandas tenebras sed ad signum laetitiae demonstrandum etc jerome cont vigil cap   lighting up candles at the reading of the gospel even at noonday and that not to drive away the darkness but to speak their joy for the good tidings of the gospel and be an emblem of that light which the psalmist says was a lamp unto his feet and a light unto his paths  light therefore having been an emblem of so many things and particularly of our lord jesus christ both in the sacred history and in the practice of the church it is no way improbable that after their conversion the saxons used it as an emblem of him who that night came into the world and was the light thereof in the city of constantinople on the eve of easter there was a custom practiced much like this of ours on christmaseve for then the whole city was illuminated with tapers and torches which continued all the night turning the night into day till almost the day appeared the reason of this custom was to represent that light which the next day arose upon the world the difference between these two customs is that of the time the reason of their observation is much the same the one illuminated the eve of easter that there might be an emblem of the sun of righteousness who the next day arose upon the world the other the eve of yule to give an emblem of that light which eus vit constan cap    lib   was the day spring from on high nay this eve of yule as gregory tells us was illuminated with so many tapors among the ancients as to give to the vigil the name of vigilia luminum and the ancients says he did well to send lights one to another whatever some think of the christmascandle  chap xiv of adorning the windows at christmas with laurel what the laurel is an emblem of an objection against this custom taken off another custom observed at this season is the adorning of windows with bay and laurel it is but seldom observed in north but in the southernparts it is very common particularly at our universities where it is customary to adorn not only the common windows of the town and of the colleges but also to bedeck the chapels of the colleges with branches of laurel  the laurel was used among the ancient romans as an emblem of several things and in particular of laurus and pacifera habetur quam praetendi inter armatos hosts quietis sit indicium romany praecipue laetitiae victoriarumque nuntia polyd virg de rer invent lib   cap   p     peace and joy and victory and i imagine it has been used at this season by christians as an emblem of the same things as an emblem of joy for the victory gained over the powers of darkness and of that peace on earth that good will toward men which the angels sung over the fields of bethlehem  it the general defense of the three articles of the church of england d  0  has been made use of by the nonconformists as an argument against ceremonies that the second council of bracara non liceat iniquas observantias agere kalendarum and ociis vacare gentilibus neque lauro neque viriditate arborum cingere domos omnis enim haec observatio paganismi est bracc can    instell can    forbad christians to deck their houses with bay leaves and green boughs but the council does not mean that it was wrong in christians to make use of these things but only at the same time with the pagans when they observed and solemnized their paganish pastime and worship and of this prohibition they give this reason in the same canon omnis haec observatio paganismi est all this kind of custom does hold of paganism because the outward practice of heathenish rites performed jointly with the pagans themselves could not but imply a consent in paganism  but at present there is no hazard of any such thing it may be an emblem of joy to us without confirming any in the practice of heathenism the time the place and the reasons of the ceremony are so widely different that though formerly to have observed it would unquestionably have been a sin it is now become harmless comely and decent  chap xv of the christmas carol an ancient custom the common observation of it very unbecoming as soon as the morning of the nativity appears it is customary among the common people to sing a christmascarol which is a song upon the birth of our savior and generally sung with some such are the new years songs and that whose burden is hagmena the word hagmena is the same as hagiameene or the holy month angli says hospinnian halegmonath quasi sacrum mensem vocant hosp de orig eth p    others from the nativity to the twelvethday the continuance of christmas it comes they say from cantare to sing and rola which is an interjection of joy for in ancient times the burden of the song when men were merry was rola rola  this kind of songs is of an ancient standing they were sung early in the church it self in memory of the nativity as the many hymns for that season manifestly declare tertullian says ut quisque de scripturis sanctis vel de proprio ingenio potest provocatur in medium deo cantare tertul advers gent c    it was customary among the christians at their feasts to bring those who were able to sing into the midst and make them sing a song unto god either out of the holy scripture or of their own composing and invention and as this was done at their feasts so no doubt it was observed at the great feast of the nativity which song no question of it was to them what the christmascarol should be to us in after ages we have it also taken notice of for durand tells us in quibusdam quoque locis  in natali praelati cum suis clericis ludant vel in domibus episcopalibus ita ut etiam descendant  ad cantus durand rat lib   c    s   that on the day of the nativity it was usual for the bishops of some churches to sing among their clergy in the episcopal house which song was undoubtedly a christmascarol  the reason of this custom seems to be an imitation of the gloria in excelsis or glory be to god on high etc which was sung by the angels as they hovered over the fields of bethlehem in the morning of the nativity for even that song as the learned bishop tailor observes was a christmascarol as soon says he as these blessed choristers had sung their christmascarol and taught the church a hymn to put into her offices for ever in the anniversary of this festivity the angels etc  was this performed with that reverence and decency which are due to a song of this nature in honor of the nativity and glory to our lord it would be very commendable but to sing it as is generally done in the midst of rioting and chambering and wantoness is no honor but disgrace no glory but an affront to that holy season a scandal to religion and a sin against christ  chap xvi of newyearsdays ceremonies the newyearsgift an harmless custom wishing a good newyear no way sinful mumming a custom which ought to be laid aside as the vulgar are always very careful to end the old year well so they are also careful of beginning well the new one as they end the former with a hearty compotation so they begin the latter with the sending of presents which are termed newyearsgifts to their friends and acquaintances the original of both which customs is et sic quidem annum veterem terminamus novumque auspicamur inauspicatis prorsus dirisque auspiciis hosp de orig fest christ p    superstitious and sinful and was observed that the succeeding year might be prosperous and successful  bishop orig brit p     stilling fleet tells us that among the saxons of the northren nations the feast of the newyear was observed with more than ordinary jollity thence as ollaus wormius and scheffer observe they reckoned their age by so many iola in the gothic language signifies to make merry stilling ibid jolas and snorro sturleson describes this new years feast just as buchannan sets out the british saturalia by feasting and sending

hospin ibid hospinian tells us was an ancient custom of the heathens and afterward practiced by the christians  and no doubt those christians were highly worthy of censure who imagined as the heathens did that the sending of a present then was any way lucky and an omen of the success of the following year for this was the very thing that made both several holy men and some general councils take notice of and forbid any such custom because the observance of it out of any such design and view was superstitious and sinful we are told in a place of st austin citatur locus ex augustino in quo praecipitur ne observentur calendae januarii in quibus cantilenae quaedam and commessationes and ad invicem dona donentur quasi in principio anni boni fati augurio hosp de orig fest christ in fest jan the observation of the calends of january is forbid the songs which were wont to be sung on that day the feastings and the presents which were then sent as a token and omen of a good year but to send a present at that time out of esteem or gratitude or charity is no where forbid on the contrary it is praise worthy for though the in calendas januarias antiqui patres vehementius invehebantur non propter istas missitationes adinvicem and mutui amoris pignora sed propter diem idolis dicatum propter ritus quosdam profanos and sacrilegos in illa solennitate adhibitos mountacut orig eccles pars prior p     ancient fathers did vehemently invey against the observation of the calends of january yet it was not because of those presents and tokens of mutual affection and love that passed but because the day it self was dedicated to idols and because of some profane rites and ceremonies they observed in solemnizing it if then i send a new years gift to my friend it shall be a token of my friendship if to my benefactor a token of my gratitude if to the poor which at this time must never be forgot it shall be to make their hearts sing for joy and give praise and adoration to the giver of all good gifts  another old custom at this time is the wishing of a good newyear either when a new years gift is presented or when friends meet or when a new years song is sung at the door the burden of which is we wish you a happy newyear  this is also a custom among the modern jews who on the first day of the month the month tisri was the seventh month according to the jews sacred computation and therefore it is commanded to be celebrated the first day of the seventh month lev xxiii    but according to their civil computation it was their first month so that feast may be termed their new years day goodw antiq lib   cap   tisri have a splended reperiunt mensam dulcissimis cibis instructam e cum assederint quivis partem de cibis illis sumit and annus inquit bonus and dulcis

were a wish for a good year and it was customary among the heathens on the calends of january to go about and sing a new years song hospinian therefore tells us that discurrunt namque noctu tam senes quam juvene promiscui sexus cantantes prae foribus divitum quibus faelicem annum cantando precantur and optant hospin  orig fest jan when night comes on not only the young but also the old of both sexes run about here and there and sing a song at the doors of the wealthier people in which they wish them a happy newyear this he speaks indeed of the christians but he calls it an exact copy of the heathens custom  but however i cannot see the harm of retaining this ancient ceremony so it be not used superstitiously nor attended with obscenity and lewdness for then there will be no more in it than an hearty wish for each others welfare and prosperity no more harm than wishing a good day or good night than in bidding one god speed or than in wishing to our friend what abrahams servant did to himself o genesis xxiv    lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day  there is another custom observed at this time which is called among us mumming which is a changing of clothes between men and women who when dressed in each others habits go from one neighbors house to another and partake of their christmascheer and make merry with them in disguise by dancing and singing and such like merriments  this hoc prorsus fit ad imitationem ludorum sigillarium oscillarium and occillatorum qui pars erat saturnaliorum and circa mensem januarium passim in domibus privatim

is unknown macrobius assuring us that it was celebrated in italy long before the building of rome the story of saturn in whose honor it was kept every body is acquainted with as to the manner of the solemnity besides the sacrifices and other parts of public worship there were several lesser observations worth our notice as first the liberty now allowed to servants to be free and merry with their masters so often alluded to in authors it is probable this was done in memory of the liberty enjoyed in the golden age under saturn before the names of servant and master were known to the world besides this they sent presents to one another among friends no war was to be proclaimed and no offender executed the schools kept a vacation and nothing but mirth and freedom was to be met with in the city they kept at first only one day the fourteenth of the kalends of january but the number was afterward increased to three four five and some say seven days kennet romans antiq p    saturnalia and observed by the heathens in january which was a going in disguise not publicly or to any indifferent place but privately and to some well known families  this kind of custom received a deserved blow from the church and was taken notice of in the synod can trull    bal     of trullus where it was decreed that the days called the calends should be entirely stripped of their ceremonies and the faithful should no longer observe them that the public dancings of women should cease as being the occasion of much harm and ruin and as being invented and observed in honor of their gods and therefore quite averse to the christian life they therefore decreed that no man should be clothed with a womans garment no woman with a mans  it were to be wished this custom which is still so common among us at this season of the year was laid aside as it is the occasion of much hoc autem quum noctu fiat nemini dubium esse debet quin sub hoc praetextu multa obscaena and turpia perpetrantur simul

garment for all that do so are abomination unto the lord thy god  chap xvii of the twelfth day how observed the wickedness of observing the twelve days after the common way on the epiphany or manifestation of christ to the gentiles commonly called the twelfthday the eastern magi were guided by the star to pay their homage to their savior and because they came that day which is the twelfth after the day of the nativity it is therefore called the twelfthday  the twelfthday it self is one of the greatest of the twelve and of more jovial observation than the others for the visiting of friends and christmasgambols the rites of this day are different in diverse places though the end of them is much the same in all namely to do honor to the memory of the eastern magi whom they suppose to have been kings in in gallia unus ex ministris etc  idem in germania etc hospin in epiphan france one of the courtiers is chosen king whom the king himself and the other nobles attend at an entertainment in germany they observe the same thing on this day in academies and cities where the students and citizens create one of themselves king and provide a magnificent banquet for him and give him the attendance of a king or a stranger guest now this is answerable to that custom of the saturnalia of masters making banquets for their servants and waiting on them and no doubt this custom has in part sprung from that  not many years ago this was a common christmasgambol in both our universities and it is still usual in other places of our land to give the name of king or queen to that person whose extraordinary luck hits upon that part of the divided cake which is honored above the others with a bean in it  but though this be generally the greatest of the twelve yet the others preceding are observed with mirth and jollity generally to excess was this feasting confined within the bounds of decency and moderation and gave more way than it does to the exercises and the religious duties of the season it would have nothing in it immoral or sinful the keeping up of friendship and love and old acquaintance has nothing in it harmful but the misfortune is men upon that bottom act rather like brutes than men and like heathens than christians and the preservation of friendship and love is nothing else but a pretense for drunkenness and rioting and wantonness and such i am afraid has been the observation of the christmasholydays since the holiest times of the christian church and the generality of men have rather looked upon them as a vide bishop blackalls sermon on the lawfulness and the right manner of keeping christmas and other christian festivals time of eating and drinking and playing than of returning praises and thanksgivings to god for the greatest benefit he ever bestowed upon the sons of men  gregory nazianzen in that excellent oration of his upon christmas day says let us not celebrate the feast after an earthly but an heavenly manner let not our doors be crowned let not dancing be encouraged let not the crosspaths be adorned the eyes fed nor the ears delighted etc let us not feast to excess nor be drunk with wine etc from this we may clearly see what has been the custom in these days and in all probability it has been much the same among us from the beginning of christianity however fabulous that story may be taken notice of by origin britan stilling bishop stilling fleet from hector boethius that king arthur kept with his nobles at york a very profane christmas for christmas day is said to be none of the twelve days but one of the twenty for if it was added it would make thirteen days which are the thirteen days here mentioned it is said to be one of the twenty days because as i imagine it was reckoned among those twenty days in which the church forbad fasting for in the laws of canutus it is ordered atque ab ipso natali jesu christi die ad octavam ab epiphania lucem jejunia nemo observato nisi quidam judicio ac voluntate fecerit sua aut id ei fuerit a sacerdote imperatum seld analect lib   p  0  that no man shall fast from christmas day till after the octave of the epiphany except he do it out of choice or it be commanded him of the priest thirteen days together and that such jollity and feasting then had its original from him but however these words if true may be a testimony of the too great antiquity of the abuse of this festival yet they will by no means justify buchannans comment upon them for as the learned bishop goes on buchannan is so well pleased with this notable observation that he sets it down for good history saying upon it that the old saturnalia were renewed only the days increased and saturns name changed to caesars for says he we call the feast julia but why should the name of saturn be changed into caesars was he worshipped for a god among the british christians as saturn was among the old pagans but the name julia imports it by no means for buchannon does not prove that this name was ever used for that festival among the britains and the saxons who brought in both the name and the feast give another vide chap christ candle reason for it  buchannan seems therefore to have a great deal more malice than truth on his side but however such revellings and frolicks and extravagances whether or not derived from the old saturnalia as are customary at this season do come very near to if not exceed its liberties in particular what commoner at this season than for men to rise early in the morning that they may follow strong drink and continue until night till wine inflame them as if christ who came into the world to save us and was manifested to destroy the works of the devil was to be honored with the very works he came to destroy  with some christmas ends with the twelve days but with the generality of the vulgar not till candlemass till then they continue feasting and are ambitious of keeping some of their christmasschear and then are as fond of getting quit of it durand tells us hanc quadragessimam cum gaudio celebramus quia christi incarnatio fuit gaudium angelorum and hominum durand lib   c    they celebrated this time with joy because the incarnation of christ was the occasion of joy to angels and men but the lengthening of the time from twelve to forty days seems to have been done out of honor to the virgin mary s lyingin under the old law the time of purification was forty days which was to women then what the month is to women now and as during that time the friends and relations of the women pay them visits and do them abundance of honor so this time seems to have been calculated to do honor to the virgins lyingin  there is a canon in the council of trullus can  0 trul bal against those who baked a cake in honor of the virgins lyingin in which it is decreed that no such ceremony should be observed because it was otherwise with her at the birth of our savior than with all other women she suffered no pollution and therefore needed no purification but only in obedience to the law if then the baking of a single cake was faulty how much more so many feasts in her honor  chap xviii of st pauls day the observation of the weather a custom of the heathens and handed down by the monks the apostle st paul himself is against such observations the opinion of st austin upon them the observation of the weather which is made on this day is altogether ridiculous and superstitious if it happen to be unclouded and without rain it is looked upon as an omen of the following years success if otherwise that the year will be unfortunate thus the old verse clara dies pauli bona tempora denotat anni si fuerint venti denarrant praelia genti si nix aut pluviae pereunt animalia quaeque   the interpretation of which is very well known to be this if st pauls day be fair and clear it does betide a happy year if blustering winds do blow aloft then wars will trouble our realm full often and if it chance to snow or rain then will be dear all sorts of grain   such also is the observation of st swithins day which if rainy is a token that it will rain for forty days successively such is the observation of si sol splendescat maria purificante major erit glacies post festum quam fuit ante  candlemasday such is childermasday such valentinesday and some others  how st pauls day came to have this particular knack of foretelling the good or evil fortune of the following year is no easy matter to find out the monks who were undoubtedly the first who made this wonderful observation have taken care it should be handed down to posterity but why and for what reason this observation was to stand good they have taken care to conceal in church affairs indeed they make free with handing down traditions from generation to generation which being approved by an infallible judgment are to be taken for granted but as far as i hear they never pretended to an infallible spirit in the study of the planets one may therefore without the suspicion of heresy or fear of the inquisition make a little inquiry into this affair and see whether it be true or false whether it is built upon any reason or no reason whether still to be observed or only laughed at as a monkish dream  now as it is the day of that saint the great apostle st paul i cannot see there is any thing to be built upon he did indeed labor more abundantly than all the apostles but never that i heard in the science of astrology and why his day should therefore be a standing almanac to the world rather than the day of any other saint will be pretty hard to find out i am sure there is a good number of them have as much right to rain or fair weather as st paul and if st andrew st thomas etc have not as much right to wind or snow let the reader judge  as it is the twenty fifth day of january one would think that could be no reason for what is that day more than another indeed they do give some show of reason why rain should happen about the time of st swithin which is this about the time of his feast which is on the fourteenth of july there are two rainy constellations which are called praecepe and asellus which arise cosmically and generally produce rain and to be sure in the course of the sign aquarius there may be both rain and wind and fair weather but how these can foretell the destiny of the year is the question  as then there is nothing in the saint or his day to prognosticate any such thing i mean as it is the day of st paul or the twenty fifth of january so i must confess i cannot find out what may be the ground of this particular observation but however thus much is very obvious that this observation is an exact copy of that superstitious custom among the heathens of observing one day as good and another as bad for among them were lucky and unlucky days some were dies atri and some dies albi the atri were pointed out in their calendar with a black character the albi with a white the former to denote it a day of bad success the latter a day of good thus have the monks in the dark and unlearned ages of popery copied after the heathens and dreamed themselves into the like superstitions esteeming one day more successful than another and so according to them it is very unlucky to begin any work upon childermassday and what day soever that falls on whether on a monday tuesday or any other nothing must be begun on that day through the year st pauls day is the years fortune tellers st marks day is the prognosticator of your life and death etc and so instead of persuading the people to lay aside the whims and fancies of the heathen world they brought them so effectually in that they are still reigning in many places to this day  but of all the days of the year they could not have chosen one so little to the purpose for the very saint whose day is so observed has himself cautioned them against any such observation for in the fourth chapter of his epistle to the galations he tells them how dangerous it was to observe days and months and times and years which is not as some would persuade us to caution us against the observation of any day but the lords day but only that we should not observe the abolished feasts of the jews nor the abominable feasts of the gentiles nor their superstitious observation of fortunate and unfortunate days st austin upon this place has these words non itaque dies observemus and annos and menses and tempora ne audiamus ab apostolo timeo vos ne forte sine causa laboraverim in vobis eos enim culpat qui dicunt non profisiscar quia posterus est aut quia luna sic fertur vel profisiscar ut prospera cedant quia ita se habet positio siderum etc beda ex augustine in loc let us not observe years and months and times least we hear the apostle telling us i am afraid of you least i have shown on you labor in vain for the persons he blames are those who say i will not set forward on my journey because it is the next day after such a time or because the moon is so or i will set forward that i may have luck because such is just now the position of the stars i will not traffic this month because such a star presides or i will because it does i shall plant no vines this year because it is leapyear etc  the learned mr bingham has among several others a quotation from the same st austin on these superstitious observations with which i shall conclude this chapter to this kind says he belong all ligatures and remedies which the school of physicians reject and condemn whether in enchantments or in certain marks which bingham    l c   antiq eccl p  00 aust de doct christ l   c  0 they call characters or in some other things which are to be hanged and bound about the body and kept in a dancing posture not for any temperament of the body but for certain significations either ocult or manifest which by a gentler name they call physical that they may not seem to affright men with the appearance of superstition but do good in a natural way such are earrings hanged upon the tip of each ear and rings made of an ostriches bones for the finger or when you are told in a fit of convulsions or shortness of breath to hold your left thumb with your right hand to which may be added a thousand vain observations as if any of our members beat if when two friends are talking together a stone or a dog or a child happens to come between them they tread the stone to pieces as the divider of their friendship and this is tolerable in comparison of beating an innocent child that comes between them but it is more pleasant that sometimes the childrens quarrel is revenged by the dogs for many times they are so superstitious as to dare to beat the dog that comes between them who turning again upon him that smites him sends him from seeking a vain remedy to seek a real physician indeed hence proceed likewise these other superstitions for a man to tread upon his threshold when he passes by his own house to return back to bed again if he chance to sneeze as he is putting on his shoes to return into his house if he stumble at his going out if the rats know his clothes to be more terrified with the suspicion of some future evil than concerned for the present loss he says cato gave a wise and smart answer to such an one who came in some consternation to consult him about the rats having knawed his stockings that said he is no great wonder but it would have been a wonder indeed if the stockings had knawed the rats st austin mentions this witty answer of a wise heathen to convince christians the better of the unreasonableness and vanity of all such superstitious observations and he concludes that all such arts whether of triffling or more noxious superstition are to be rejected and avoided by christians as proceeding originally from some pernicious society between men and devils and being the compacts and agreements of such treacherous and deceitful friendship the apostle forbids us to have fellowship with devils and that he says respects not only idols and things offered to idols but all imaginary signs pertaining to the worship of idols and also all remedies and other observations which are not appointed publicly by god to promote the love of god and our neighbor but proceed from the private fancies of men and tend to delude the hearts of poor deluded mortals for these things have no natural virtue in them but owe all their efficacy to a presumptuous confederacy with devils and they are full of pestiferous curiosity tormenting anxiety and deadly slavery they were first taken up not for any real power to be discerned in them but gained their power by mens observing them and therefore by the devils art they happen differently to different men according to their own apprehensions and presumptions for the great deceiver knows how to procure things agreeable to every mans temper and ensnare him by his own suspicions and consent  chap xix of candlemassday why so called the blasphemy of the church of rome in consecrating wax candles this day goes under several denominations it is called the day of christs presentation because on it christ was presented in the temple it is called the holy day of st simeon because it was on it that he took our savior up in his arms and it is called the purification because then the holy virgin was purified it is generally a day of festivity and more than ordinary observation among women and is therefore called the wivesfeastday the feasting seems to be observed in honor of the virgin mary for as on the day of a womans being churchd there is no common entertainment so it seems that this feasting was begun in the times of popery by way of compliment to the churchingday of the virgin mary  it has the name of nos anglica the purification of our lady vel communi sermon potius candlemasday a distributione and gestatione cereorum ardentium vel etiam quod per illum diem cereorum usus in vespertinis precibus and litaniis per totam hyemem adhibitus cessare solet usque ad sanctorum omnium festum anni insequentis montag orig eccl pars pri p     candlemassday because lights were distributed and carried about in procession or because also the use of lighted tapers which was observed all winter at vespers and litanies were then wont to cease till the next allhallowmass  these lights so carried about were blessed of the priest as hospinian tells us who made use of the following prayers at their consecration rogamus te per invocationem sancti tui nominis and per intercessionem mariae beatae virginis matris filii tui etc ut consecrare velis has candelas ad utilitatem and commodum hominis etc and mox domine jesu benedicas obsecro hanc creaturam ceream and concede illi caelestem  malignus spiritus contremescat and ita territus aufugiat etc hospin de fest purific p    we implore thee by the invocation of thy holy name and by the intercession of the blessed virgin mary the mother of thy son whose feast we this day celebrate with the highest devotion and by the intercession of all thy saints that thou would sanctify these candles to the good and profit of men and the health of his soul and body whether in earth or sea and again o lord jesu i beseech thee that thou would bless this thy creature of wax and grant it thy heavenly benediction by the power of thy holy cross that as it was a gift to man by which the darkness might be driven away so now it may be endowed with such virtue by the sign of the holy cross that wheresoever it is lighted and placed the evil spirit may tremble and with his servants be in such terror and confusion as to fly away from that habitation and no more vex and disturb thy servants  after this he adjures the wax candles in words like these adjuro te creaturam ceream in nomine domini nostri and sanctae trinitatis ut sis extirpatio and depulsio diaboli and spectrorum ejus etc hospin ibid i adjure thee o thou waxen creature in the name of our lord and the holy trinity that thou repel and extirpate the devil and his sprights etc and therefore all christians says eccius tom   hom de purificat ought to use these lights with an holy love having a sincere dependence that thus they shall be freed by the power of the word and this prayer from all the snares and frauds of the devil  our author upon this says that this is manifest blasphemy and idolatry for as on the one hand they take the name of god and the holy trinity in vain so on the other they attribute to a wax candle what should be ascribed to christ alone and the quickening power of the holy ghost  chap xx of valentineday its ceremonies what the council of trullus thought of such customs that they had better be omitted it is a ceremony never omitted among the vulgar to draw lots which they term valentines on the eve before valentine a presbyter of the church was beheaded under claudius the emperor valentineday the names of a select number of one sex are by an equal number of the other put into some vessel and after that every one draws a name which for the present is called their valentine and is also looked upon as a good omen of their being man and wife afterward  there is a rural tradition that on this day every nature the vicare of the almighty lord that hot cold hevie light moist and dry has knit by even number of accord in easy voice began to speak and say  fowls take heed of my sentence i pray and for your own ease in fordring of your need as fast as i may speak i will me speed  ye know well how on st valentines day by my statute and through my governaunce ye do chese your makes and after fly away with hem as i prick you with pleasaunce  chaucer bird chooses its mate from this perhaps the youthful part of the world has first practiced this custom so common at this season  in the trullan council we have lots and divinations forbid as being some of those things which provoked the lord to anger against king   lib kings chap    manasses who used lots and divinations etc upon which the scholiast has these words can    in syn trull in bals p   0 the custom of drawing lots was after this manner on the   rd day of june which is the eve of st john baptist men and woman were accustomed to gather together in the evening by the seaside or in some certain houses and there adorn a girl who was her parents firstbegotten child after the manner of a bride then they feasted and leaped after the manner of bacchanals and danced and shouted as they were wont to do on their holy days after this they poured into a narrow neckd vessel some of the seawater and put also into it certain things belonging to each of them then as if the devil gifted the girl with the faculty of telling future things they would enquire with a loud voice about the good or evil fortune that should attend them upon this the girl would take out of the vessel the first thing that came to hand and show it and give it to the owner who upon receiving it was so foolish as to imagine himself wiser as to the good or evil fortune that should attend him  this custom as he tells us a little after is altogether diabolical and surely it was so being used as a presage of what was future was the custom of the lots now mentioned used as among the heathens they would no doubt be as worthy of condemnation but as far as i know there is but little credit given to them though that little is too much and ought to be laid aside but if the custom was used without any mixture or allay of superstition as i believe it is in some places yet it is often attended with great inconveniences and misfortunes with uneasinesses to families with scandal and sometimes with ruin  chap xxi of shrovetide what it signifies the custom of the papists at this season that our present customs are very unbecoming shrovetide signifies the time of confessing sins as the word tide which signifies time and the saxon word shrive or shrift which signifies confession plainly show the reason why this time is so denominated is because it was set apart by the church of rome for a time of shriving or confessing sins for then people were wont to confess their sins and receive the sacrament that they might be better prepared for the religious observation of the following season of lent thus in the constitutions of simon of sudbury archbishop of canterbury was made at lambeth a d      in the second year of richard the second in the first year of urban the fifth pope and clement the seventh antipope this most eloquent man who was wise incomparably beyond the rest of the kingdom sat about six years and at last was beheaded at london by command of the rebels tyler and stravo a d      johnson constable      i have seen in a church at sudbury in suffolk a skull which is shown to strangers for the skull of this bishop and probably it is the true one simon sudbury it is ordered that laymen should be admonished to confess in the very beginning of lent and in theodolphuss capitula it is ordered that on the week next before lent every man should go to his shrift and his shrift should shrive him in such a manner as his deeds which he had done required and that he should charge all that belong to his district that if any of them have discord with any he make peace with him if any one will not be brought to this then he shall not shrive him but then he shall inform the bishop that he may convert him to what is right if he be willing to belong to god then all contentions and disputes shall cease and if there be any one of them that has taken offense at another then shall they be reconciled that they may more freely say in the lords prayer lord forgive us our trespasses etc and having thus purified their minds let them enter upon the holy fast tide and cleanse themselves by satisfaction against holy easter etc johnson       constitut  this custom of confessing to the priest at this time was laid aside by our church at the reformation for sins are to be confessed to god alone and not to the priest except when the conscience cannot otherwise be quieted then indeed the grief is to be opened to the spiritual guide in private exhort to the com that by the ministry of gods word he may give the benefit of absolution together with ghostly council and advice to the quieting of the conscience and the avoiding of all scruple and doubtfulness but how this other worse custom came to be retained of indulging all manner of luxury and intemperance i know nothing but that the flesh was too powerful for the spirit the duties of religion how justly soever enjoined us are tamely dispensed with but what will not we rather do than give up the pleasures of life surely the church never designed when she so justly took away the public confessions of this season that rioting and gaming and drunkenness should continue amongst us are these a fit preparation for so solemn a season will they qualify us for the hearing of the history of our lords passion will they prepare us for the reception of his body and blood and fit us to meet him in the morning of the resurrection will they not rather speak us heathens than christians and lead us to hell than on the way to heaven such customs as these may in some measure be excusable among them whose vid seldon table talk c of christmas church has too much led them into those things but it is scandalous and sinful and abominable in those who pretend to be the enemies of error and superstition to continue the observation of such sinful customs  chap xxii of palm sunday why so called how observed in the popish times what it is truly to carry palms in our hands on this day the sunday before easter which is denominated palm sunday is so called dicitur enim dominica in ramis palmarum quod illo die rami palmarum in processionibus deportentur in significationem illorum quos filii israel statuerunt in via christo jam veniente belith     p    cap durand lib   p     in ram because as the ritualists say on that day the boughs of palm trees were wont to be carried in procession in imitation of those which the children of israel strawed in the way of christ for they cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way which according to the consent of antiquity were the branches of the palm tree it being very common in that country and used as an emblem of victory and a doctor of our own church in his discourse upon this festival says dr sparks feasts and fasts from the story as described by st luke and st matthew some of the ancient church took occasion as on this day to go in procession with palms in their hands and to denominate it palm sunday  but however harmless this custom might have been in the times of its first institution it is certain that in after ages it sunk into superstition and gross idolatry thus the rhemists in their translation of the new testament describe the ceremony themselves these offices of honor done to our savior extraordinarily were very acceptable and for a memory hereof the holy church makes a solemn procession every year upon this day specially in our country when it was catholic with the blessed sacrament reverently carried as it were christ upon the ass and strawing of bushes and flowers bearing of palms setting up boughs spreading and hanging up the richest clothes the quire and queristers singing as here the children and the people all done in a very godly ceremony to the honor of christ and the memory of his triumph upon this day the like service and the like duties done to him in all other solemn processions of the blessed sacrament and otherwise be undoubtedly no less grateful dr fulk in loc mat fulke upon this gives this answer your palm sunday procession was horrible idolatry and abusing of the lords institution who ordained his supper to be eaten and drunken not to be carried about in procession like a heathenish idol but it is pretty sport that you make the priests that carries this idol to supply the room of the ass on which christ did ride thus you turn the holy mystery of christs riding to jerusalem to a may game and pagent play and yet you say such service done to christ is undoubtedly exceeding grateful yea no less grateful than that was done by his disciples at the time mentioned in the text your argument and proof is none but your bare asseverations that which the disciples did had the warrant of the holy scripture but who has regarded these theatrical pomps at their hands or what word of god have you to assure you that he accepts such will worship who detesteth all worship which is according to the doctrines and traditions of men and not after his own commandment  from this superstitious and idolatrous custom without all doubt it comes to pass that we now and then on a palm sunday see the young people carrying branches of palms in their hands which they seem fond of having that day and which they as little regard at other times it is true indeed it is a relick of the ancient superstition of the papists but as it is now entirely stripped of any superstiton and is an emblem of the season and the transactions of that day so i see no harm in so innocent an observation  but how much better would it be to carry in our hands this day ramos debent fideles portare id est bona opera  opera miserecordiae sunt vestire nudos colligere hospites errantes revocare visitare infirmos etc bed tom   p     the palm of good works the graces of humility and kindness and charity to feed the hungry to give drink to the thirsty to clothe the naked to entertain the strangers to visit the sick and in prison etc by such actions as these should we truly carry palms in our hands by these we should truly straw the way for our lord and so follow his steps to the heavenly jerusalem  chap xxiii of rising early on easter day what is meant by the sun dancing that morn the antiquity of rising early on this day the end and design of it the great advantage of it it is a common custom among the vulgar and uneducated part of the world to rise before the sun on easter day and walk into the fields the reason of which is to see the sun dance which they have been told from an old tradition always dances as upon that day we read indeed that the sun once josh x stood still but whether the sun danced upon the very day our savior rose on we cannot tell it is very probable it did not because the scriptures are silent and that it never did so since i think we may be well assured forasmuch as never any that we have heard of have seen any such thing since that time if therefore this tradition has any meaning it must be a metaphorical one that when the morning proves clear there is a seeming smile over the face of nature and earth and heaven show tokens of joy for as the earth and her valleys by standing thick with corn are said to laugh and sing so on account of the resurrection the heavens and the sun may be said to dance for joy or as the psalmist words it psalm xcvi    caeliquidem digni laetentur terra autem exultet damasc in dominican pascha p     the heavens may rejoice and the earth may be glad  there is then really speaking nothing in the dancing of the sun upon easter day but yet it is a very ancient and commendable custom to be up early at this holy time and therefore damascen in his paschal hymn sings vigilemus mane profundo and pro unguenti hymnum afferamus domino and christum videamus justitiae solemn omnibus vitam exorientem ibid let us watch very early in the morning and instead of ointment let us bring an hymn to our lord and let us see our christ the sun of righteousness who is the life that rises to all men and indeed it is the most seasonable time for meditating on our lords resurrection and it is pleasing circumstances for as the place where any notable thing has been transacted seldom or never fails to raise the idea of the transaction so the particular time when it was done does generally produce the same effect and as the truth of the former was the occasion of many holy and religious men going fulk test cont rhem matthew cap    in annot to visit the place of the sepulcher and hear it as it were say what the angel did to the women come see the place where the lord lay so the truth of the latter was the reason why devout and holy men did in the best ages of the church rise early in the morning of the resurrection the primitive christians spent the night preceding it in prayers and praises till the time of cockcrow the supposed hour of our saviors rising for as latinorum concors est sententia christum non media nocte verum mane in aurora canentibus vice gallorum angelis devicta morte and confractis portis inferi surrexisse durant de rit lib   cap   durant tells us it is universally assented to by the latin church that after our savior had conquered death and broken the gates of hell he arose from the dead not at midnight but in the morning at the time of cockcrow which not the cocks but the angels themselves proclaimed and when these pernoctations were laid aside it was the custom to rise early and spend the morning in such a manner as was suitable to the nature of the time the salutation of the eastern church anestese or the lord is risen and the usual answer the lord is risen indeed were no doubt the common salutation of that morning and if this present custom of the vulgar has had at any time any laudable custom for its original it was no doubt this of rising early to contemplate the more seasonably on the resurrection of christ  and now was this the end of rising early at that holy time it would be very advantageous but to rise with the view of the vulgar is foolish and ridiculous would we rise before the sun and prevent the dawn of day our meditations would be strong and vigorous and almost persuade us that the real actions of that morn were presented to our view for when at that time all things are hushed in silence and warped in darkness or but illuminated with the friendly moon the devotae christi faminae quae illum and vivum dilexerant and mortuum desiderabant per noctem ambulantes juvante luna venerunt ad monumentum rupert de divin officiis lib   c    guide of mary magdalene and the other women to the sepulcher it is easy and natural to meditate on these things to see our saviors tomb to see the angels sit as guardians on it and the trembling watch fled into the city and now the lord is risen indeed and they that seek him early shall find him maria magdalena cujus domus erat bethaniae  prima ante alias una sabbati juxta joannem valde diluculo venisset dum adhuc tenebrae essent ad monumentum rupert ibid behold then mary magdalene on the first day of the week coming from her own house at bethany before the other women very early in the morning when it was as yet dark abit a loco volens consolationem quandam invenire theophlact in loc to find ease and consolation at the sepulcher behold she and the other women bringing the prepared spices to embalm their lord behold peter and john running to the sepulcher and returning whilst mary continues in sorrow and tears and as she weeps ye may see her look into the sepulcher but he is not there he is risen behold then the guardians of the tomb saying john xx    etc woman why weepest thou nay behold the lamb of god himself with the very same words wiping away the tears from her eyes and jesus said unto her woman why weepest thou whom seek thou she supposing him to be the gardener says unto him sir if thou have born him hence tell me where thou have laid him and i will take him away jesus said unto her mary with what joy now does she run to his feet willing and desirous and eager to embrace them but he bids her not to touch him but go to his brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father to my god and your god behold a little after this his apparition to her and the other women and how he suffers them to kiss his feet taylors antiq christ de resurrect he appeared also about the same time to peter  these and the other accidents at our lords resurrection would afford us a satisfactory and comfortable meditation would inflame our hearts with a burning love and melt us into tears of joy in our eager wishes and warm desires we should with the holy women kiss the feet of our savior and be almost partakers of equal happiness with them or sure we are that we should have our savior in our hearts and not fail of seeing him in his kingdom he whom we have so carefully sought for will vouchsafe to be found of us in his grace at the sepulcher and in his glory in heaven happy they who so early seek their savior who long after him as the heart does after the waterbrooks who seek him among the sol song ii    lilies until the day break and the shadows flee away happy they their conversation is now in heaven and their happiness hereafter will be the joys of eternity where they shall no more be absent but ever present with the lord  chap xxiv of easter holy days a time of relaxation from labor how observed in the dark ages of popery that our customs at this time are sprung from theirs on the holy days of easter it is customary for work to cease and servants to be at liberty which is a resemblance of the practice of the primitive church which set apart the whole week after easter for to praise and glorify god for our saviors resurrection in which servos autem and ancillas ac omnes qui nostro servitio sunt addicti profecto ab omni servitutis severitate eos hoc tempore laxare debemus  ut libere and secure omnes possint ad audiendum divinum officium convenire and communicare belith cap     time all servile labor ceased that servants as well as others might be present at the devotions of the season but other customs so frequently observed at this time such as public shows gamings horseraces etc were forbidden as being foreign to the holiness of this season  in after ages when the church fell into corruption and the substance of religion decayed into the shadow of ceremonies the usual prayers and praises of the season were either much neglected or but superficially observed for belithus a ritualist of those times tells us sunt enim nonnullae ecclesiae in quibus usitatum est ut vel etiam episcopi and archiepiscopi in caenobiis cum suis ludant subditis ita ut etiam ad lusum pilae demittant etc belith c   0 that it was customary in some churches for the bishops and archbishops themselves to play

libertas ideo dicta est decembrica etc belith ibid the liberty of december because that formerly it was customary among the heathens in that month to indulge their servants with a certain time of liberty when they were on the level with their masters and feasted and banqueted with them  why they should play at handball at this time rather than any other game i have not been able to find out but i suppose it will be readily granted that this custom of so playing was the original of our present recreations and diversions on easter holy days and in particular of playing at handball for a vid seld table talk of christmas tanzycake which at this season is generally practiced and i would hope practiced with harmlessness and innocence for when the common devotions of the day are over there is nothing sinful in lawful recreation but for the governors of churches to descend to such childish exercises and that even on the great sunday of the year was not only unbecoming their gravity and reservedness but was also a downright breach of the fourth commandment but these were ages of ignorance and darkness when the world was taught for the doctrines of god the commandments of men  chap xxv of may day the custom of going to the woods the night before this the practice of other nations the original of it the unlawfulness on the calends or the first day of may commonly called may day the juvenile part of both sexes are wont to rise a little after midnight and walk to some neighboring wood accompanied with music and the blowing of horns where they break down branches from the trees and adorn them with nosegays and crowns of flowers when this is done they return with their booty homewards about the rising of the sun and make their doors and windows to triumph in the flowery spoil the afterpart of the day is chiefly spent in dancing round a tallpoll which is called a maypoll which being placed in a convenient part of the village stands there as it were consecrated to the goddess of flowers without the least violation offered it in the whole circle of the year and this is not the custom of the british common people only but it is the custom of the generality of other nations particularly of the italians where polydore virgil tells us the est autem consuetudinis ut juventus promiscui sexus laetaebunda call maii exeat in agros and cantitans inde virides reportet arborum ramos eosque ante domorum fores ponat praesertim apud italos  etc poly virg  0  youth of both sexes were accustomed to go into the fields on the calends of may and bring thence the branches of trees singing all the way as they came and so place them on the doors of their houses  celebrabantur autem hae feriae atque ludi lactantio test cum omni lascivia verbis and moribus pudendis ad placandam deam quae floribus and fructibus praeerat nam per tubam convocabantur omnis generis meretrices unde juvenalis  digissima prorsus florali matrona tuba ex in theatro denudatae etc hosp de orig eth     this is the relick of an ancient custom among the heathen who observed the four last days of april and the first of may in honor of the goddess flora who was imagined the deity presiding over the fruit and flowers it was observed with all manner of obscenity and lewdness and the undecent sports and postures of naked women who were called together with the noise of trumpets and danced before the spectators  from this custom of the heathens has ours undoubtedly come and though for that reason barely it need not be laid aside yet forasmuch as many country people are of opinion sic nos tunc eo anni tempore cum virent omnia quasi per hunc modum fructuum ubertatem ominamur ac been precamur polyd virg  0  that the observation of this ceremony is a good omen and a procurer of the success of the fruits of the earth which is entirely a piece of superstition and because also much wickedness and debauchery are committed that night to the scandle of whole families and the dishonor of religion there is all the reason in the world for laying it aside  chap xxvi of parochial perambulations their antiquity the benefit and advantage of them it was a general custom formerly and is still observed in some country parishes to go round the bounds and limits of the parish on one of the three days before holy thursday or the feast of our lords ascension when the minister accompanied with his churchwardens and parishoners were wont to deprecate the vengeance of god beg a blessing on the fruits of the earth and preserve the rights and properties of their parish  the original of this custom is dated from the times of the heathens for refert plutarchus in problem    numam popilium cum finitimis agri terminis constituisse and in ipsis finibus terminum deum quasi finium praesidem amicitiaeque ac pacis custodem posuisse festa ei dicata quae terminalia nuncupantur quorum vice nos quotannis ex vetustissima consuetudine parochiarum terminos lustramus spelm gloss in verbo perambulat from the days of numa popilius they worshipped the god terminus whom they looked upon to be the guardian of fields and landmarks and the keeper up of friendship and peace among men upon this account the feast called terminalia was dedicated to him instead of which it is a very ancient custom to surround the bounds of parishes every year and instead of heathenish rites and sacrifices to an imaginary god to offer praises and prayers to the true god the god of the whole earth the custom was the people accompanied the bishop or some of the clergy into the fields where litanies were made and the mercy of god implored that he would avert the evils of plague and pestilence that he would send them good and seasonable weather and give them the fruits of the earth in due season  the litanies or rogations which were it is called rogationweek because of that prayer and fasting that was then used for to supplicate god for his blessing on the fruits of the earth it is also in some places called crossweek because in ancient times when the priest went into the fields the cross was carried before them in the northern parts it is called gangweek from to gang which in the north signifies to go then made use of and gave name to the time of rogationweek were first observed by mamertus bishop of vienna in the year   0 dum civitas viennensium crebo terrae motu subrueretur and bestiarum desolaretur incursu sanctus mamertus ejus civitatis episcopus eas legitur pro malis quae praemissimus ordinasse walifred stral c    de reb ecclesiast on account of the frequent earthquakes that happened and the incursions of wild beasts which laid in ruins and depopulated the city not that litanies and rogations were not used before but that before this time they were not affixed to these days and since that they have been observed of the whole church at this season except the church of hispani autem propter hoc quod scriptum est non possunt filii sponsi lugere quamdiu cum illis est sponsus infra quinquagessimam paschae recusantes jejunare litanios suos post pentecosten posuerunt walaf strab ibid spain who chusd rather to have them after pentecost than before it because from easter day to the feast of pentecost it was the custom of the church not to fast for as they themselves reasoned the children of the bridechamber cannot fast so long as the bridegroom is with them and therefore they held their rogations after pentecost  what now remains among us is the relick of this ancient and laudable custom which was always observed in the old church of england and has been also in some measure since the reformation too  in council cloveshoviae sub cuthbert arch cant an     cap    ut litaniae i e rogationes a clero omnique populo his diebus cum magna reverentia agantur id est septimo kalendarum maiarum juxta ritum romanae ecclesiae quae and litania major apud eam vocatur et item quoque secundum morem priorum nostrorum tertiae dies ante ascentionem domini nostri in caelos cum jejunio etc spelman gloss     the canons of cuthbert archbishop of canterbury which were made at cloveshoo in the year     it was ordered that litanies that is rogations should be observed of the clergy and all the people with great reverence on these days viz the seventh of the kalends of may according to the rites of the church of rome who terms this the greater litany and also according to the custom of our forefathers on the three days before the ascension of our lord into the heavens with fasting etc and in the injunctions made in the reign of queen elizabeth it is ordered injunct    eliz that the curate at certain and convenient places shall admonish the people to give thanks to god in the beholding of gods benefits for the increase and abundance of his fruits upon the face of the earth with the saying of the  0  psalm etc at which time the minister shall inculcate these or such sentences cursed be he which translateth the bounds and doles of his neighbor or such orders of prayers as shall be hereafter  agreeable to this we read in the life of the pious hooker walt in vit hookeri that he would by no means omit the customary time of procession persuading all both rich and poor if they desired the preservation of love and their parish rites and liberties to accompany him in his perambulation and most did so in which perambulation he would usually express more pleasant discourse than at other times and would then always drop some loving and facetious observations to be remembered against the next year especially by the boys and young people still inclining them and all his present parishioners to meekness and mutual kindnesses and love because love thinks not evil but covers a multitude of infirmities  we may also observe that the particular office ordered by our church for rogationsunday is exactly suited to the nature of the season that the three days following are appointed fasts by our church and that one of our church homilies is composed particularly for the parochial perambulation all which shows the custom and intention of the church and that the practicing of it would be serviceable to the sons of men would save their lives from destruction and crown them with mercy and loving kindness would send them springs into their rivers and make them run among the hills would bring forth grass for the cattle and green herb for the service of men  chap xxvii of midsummereve of kindling fires their original that this custom formerly was superstitious but now may be used with innocence on the eve of st john baptist commonly called midsumnereve it is usual in the most of country places and also here and there in towns and cities for both old and young to meet together and be merry over a large fire which is made in the open street over this they frequently leap and play at various games such as running wrestling dancing etc but this is generally the exercise of the younger sort for the old ones for the most part sit by as spectators and enjoy themselves and their bottle and thus they spend the time till midnight and sometimes till cockcrow  belithus tells us consuetum item hac vigilia ardentes deferri faculas quod joannes fuerit ardens lucerna and qui domini vias praeparaverit belith explicat div offic c     p     and durand cap    lib   that it was a custom to carry lighted torches on midsummereve as an emblem of st john baptist who was a burning and a shining light and the preparer of the way of christ but if this was the reason of this custom formerly as it is probable it was it having been a common thing to shadow out times and seasons by emblems yet the custom still continued among us was originally instituted upon another bottom  and indeed the habent hoc a gentibus antiquitus enim dracones hoc tempore ad libidinem propter calorem excitati volando per aerem frequenter in puteos and fontes spermatizabant ex quo etc hoc animadvertentes medici ignes frequenter and passim circa fontes fieri and quaecunque magnum and immundum redderint fumum ibi cremari etc et quia talia hoc tempore maxim fiebant ideo hoc adhuc ab aliquibus observatur durand l   c    and belith in eodem fest original of this custom is heathenish for in ancient times the dragons being incited to lust through the heat of the season did frequently as they flew through the air spermatize in the wells and fountains by this means the water became infected and the air polluted so that whoever drank the waters was either tormented with a grievious distemper or lost his life as soon as the physicians perceived this they ordered fires to be made every where about the wells and fountains and those things which occasioned the noisomest smell to be burnt knowing that thereby the dragons would be driven away and forasmuch as this custom was observed about the time we now celebrate st john baptists feast it is therefore still observed among some people and agreeable to this it is that mr cambden tells us that barnwell a village near cambridge got its name from the children playing about a well on st john baptists eve  the custom of kindling such fires was severely censured by the church and therefore in the council of trulius this canon was made against it can    in synod trull ex bals p   0 that if any clergyman or layman observed the rite of making on fires on the new mood which some were wont to observe and according to an old custom to leap over them in a mad and foolish manner he should be deposed if the former if the latter he should be excommunicated  the scholiast upon this canon has these words the new mood was always the first day of the month and it was customary among the jews and greeks to hold then a feast and pray that they might be lucky during the continuance of the month of these it was that god spoke by the prophet my soul hates your new mons and your sabbaths and not only this but they also kindled fires before their shops and houses and leaped over them imagining that all the evils which had befallen them formerly would be burnt away and that they should be more successful and lucky afterward now about the sitting of this synod there were some of the christians who observed this custom upon the same accounts that the heathens did which occasioned it is being forbid by the council and that if a clergyman was guilty of it he should be deposed if a layman excommunicated he also tells us that on st john baptistseve the vulgar were wont to make on fires for the whole night and leap over them and draw lots and divine about their good or evil fortune  but whatever reason the heathens had for kindling these fires whether as durandus thinks that the lustful dragons might be driven away or as the canon that their evil fortune might be burnt it is certain that the custom was invented and practiced by them and because of the superstion attending the observation of it was very justly forbidden by the council and undoubtedly was the making of such fires now attended with any such superstition it would be equally criminal to observe them but rogos  quos nos angli bonefires vocamus and in publica laetitia and gaudiis adhibemus non obstante isto canone mountag p   0 when they are only kindled as tokens of joy to excite innocent mirth and diversion and promote peace and good neighborhood they are lawful and innocent and deserve no censure and therefore when on midsummereve st peterseve and at some other times we make i suppose they were called bonefires because that generally they were made of bones for as belithus tells us adversus haec ergo hujusmodi inventum est remedium ut videlicet rogus ex ossibus construeretur and ita fumus hujusmodi animalia fugaret belith in vigil s joan that to prevent the infection before mentioned they were wont to make on fires of bones that the smoke might drive away the dragons bonefires before shops and houses there would be no harm in doing so was it not that some continue their diversion to too late hours and others are guilty of excessive drinking  chap xxviii of the feast of sheepshearing an ancient custom the feast of sheepsheering is generally a time of mirth and joy and more than ordinary hospitality indeed it is but little observed in these northern parts but in the southern it is pretty common for on the day they begin to sheer their sheep they provide a plentiful dinner for the sheerers and for their friends who come to visit them on that occasion a table also if the weather permit is spread in the open village for the young people and children  after what manner soever this custom reached us it is certain it may boast of great antiquity it is mentioned in the second book of samuel as a feast of great magnificence both for grandeur of entertainment and greatness of company no less a person than absalom the kings son was the master of this feast and no less persons were the guests than the kings sons the brethren of absalom nay it was a feast that might entertain the king himself or surely the king would never have been so importuned never would have received the compliment so kindly for it is said it came to pass after two full years that absalom had sheepsheerers in baalhazor which is beside ephraim and absalom invited all the kings sons and absalom came to the king and said behold now thy servant has sheepsheerers let the king i beseech thee and his servants go with thy servant and the king said nay my son let us not all go lest we be chargeable unto thee of this kind also was the feast which nabal made for his sheerers when david was driven to straits in the wilderness and sent his servants to ask a present of him he calls the day it was held on a good day that is a day of plentiful eating and drinking and therefore nabal answered the servants of david shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i have killed for my sheerers and give it unto men whom i know not whence they be and further it is said in the same chapter that so grand and magnificent was this feast that he had a feast in his house like the feast of a king we find also in the book of genesis that laban went to sheer his sheep in which time jacob made his escape which laban heard not of till the third day of such great antiquity then is this custom and though its antiquity is not of such force as to palliate luxury and profusness in these entertainments yet no doubt it will vindicate the harmlesness of a moderate feast upon this occasion  chap xxix of michaelmass guardian angels the discourse of country people at this time that it seems rather true that we are protected by a number of angels than by one particular genius the feast of this season is celebrated in commemoration of st michael and all the orders of angels it is called the dedication of st michael because of a church being dedicated to him on this day in mount garganus  at this season of the year it is a general custom to elect the governors of towns and cities to promote peace among men and guard them against harm from their malicious fellow creatures whether this particular time of the year has been chosen for electing them because then is the feast of angels the guardians and protectors of men and of their communities and daniel c  0 provinces is not so certain it is certainer that when ever it comes it brings into the minds of the people that old opinion of tutelar angels that every man has his guardian angel that is one particular angel who attends him from his coming in till his going out of life who guides him through the troubles of the world and strives as much as he can to bring him to heaven  now that good angels attend good men is without dispute they guide them in the mazes of the wilderness of life and bring them to their desired homes they surround them in the seas of afflictions and lead them to the shores of peace and as when the israelites passed through the red sea the cloud became light to them but darkness to their enemies so in the troublesome seas of this life the angels are both the guides of good men and their protectors from evil from the devil and his angels and therefore the psalmist says the angel of the lord tarrieth round about them that fear him and delivers them and that he will give his angels charge over good men they are also supposed to be that hedge which god placed about job which the devil so much complains of and sure we are that when the eyes of elishas servant were opened he saw the mountain full of chariots and horses of fire round about elisha that therefore good men are guarded and protected by angels the scripture shows very clearly but that every man has his particular genius seems to be founded more upon tradition than any certainty from scripture thus the egyptians believed that every man had three angels attending him the pythagoreans that every man had two the romans that there was a good and an evil genius and hence it is that the roman poet says quisque suos patitur manes every man has his evil genius and if we may believe the authority of plutarch the evil genius of brutus appeared to him the night before the battle of philippi and told him he was his evil genius and that he would meet him there  but there are greater authorities then these in vindication of this opinion casalion observes it may be proved from scripture and not only from the tradition of the unicuique deus custodem apposuit and asserimus indubitanter nos ex scripturis illam fidem non gentium nugibus cassal     p de vet christ rit heathens and of this opinion was justin martyr theodoret st basil st jerome and st austin  there are indeed two places in the new testament which have a view to this opinion the first is in the   th of st matthew the  0th verse take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven now because this place takes notice of the angels of these little ones some have therefore concluded that every man has his good angel at least that good men have but now this conclusion does not certainly follow from these words for when it is said their angels it does indeed certainly infer that the angels do protect good men but not that every man has his particular angel and hence therefore as one observes st chrisostom makes use of these words enteuthen delon etc it is manifest that the saints at least if not all men have their angels but he does not hence conclude that every man has one the other place is in the acts of the apostles where it is said that when peter was delivered out of prison they would not believe the maid it was he but said it was his angel it must be owned indeed from this that it seems the opinion of those in the house that every man had his guardian angel but this is no proof of the things being so it only proves that it was their opinion but not that this opinion is true the jews had such a tradition among them and what was here spoken was perhaps only according to that tradition besides we read on the contrary that sometimes one and the same angel has been sent to different persons thus gabriel was sent to daniel zacharias and the blessed virgin sometimes the scripture tells us of many angels protecting one man for so was elisha protected and as we wrestle not only against flesh and blood but against all the powers of darkness so we have many angels to assist and defend us i shall not dare to determine positively against this opinion which has traveled down through so many ages which has been held by so many wise and learned men and which has such scriptures brought to its defense this i shall only say that of the two opinions the latter seems to be the more probable that it seems more consonant to scripture that we are attended by a number of angels than by a particular tutelar angel but this i mention not as necessary to be believed for i am persuaded there is no fault in believing either the one or the other as it appears more probable for whether soever we believe we believe in the protection of angels and that seems to be all which the scripture requires  chap xxx of the country wake how observed formerly a custom of the heathens and regulated by gregory the great in the southern parts of this nation the most of country villages are wont to observe some sunday in a more particular manner than the other common sundays of the year viz the sunday after the day of dedication i e the sunday after the day of the saint to whom their church was dedicated then the inhabitants deck themselves in their gaudiest clothes and have open doors and splendid entertainments for the reception and treating of their relations and friends who visit them on that occasion from each neighboring town the morning is spent for the most part at church though not as that morning was wont to be spent not with the commemoration of the saint or martyr nor the grateful remembrance of the builder and endower the remaining part of the day is spent in eating and drinking and so is also a day or two afterward together with all sorts of rural pastimes and exercises such as dancing on the green wrestling cudgelling etc  agreeable to this we are told that formerly die dominica post encaeniam seu festum dedicationis cujusvis villae convenire solet in aurora magna hominum iuvenumque multitudo and canora voce holywakes holymakes exclamando designare etc spelm gloss in verb wak on the sunday after the encaenia or feast of the dedication of the church it was usual for a great number of the inhabitants of the village both grown and young to meet together about break of day and cry holywakes holywakes and after mattens to go to feasting and sporting which they continued for two or three days  in the northren parts the sundays feasting is almost lost and they observe only one other day for the whole which among them is called the hopping i suppose from the dancing and other exercises then used the ancient name and which is still common in the southern parts is the wake which according to sir h spelman are sunt celebritates bacchanales sub fructuum temporibus ab occiduiis and borealibus anglis pagatim habitae bacchanales dixi ex nomine nam wak sax est temulentia spelm ibid bacchanal feasts observed about fruit time and which were in villages by turns among the northern and western english he calls them bacchanals because as he observes the saxon word wak signifies drunkenness this custom our forefathers did in all probability borrow from their fellow heathens haec eadem sunt quae apud ethnicos paganalia dicebantur etc spelm ibid whose paganalia or country feasts were of the same stamp with this of the wake  at the conversion of the saxons by austin the monk it was continued among the converts with some regulations by an order of pope gregory the great to mellitus the abbot who accompanied austin in his voyage his words are these ut die dedicationis vel natalitiis sanctorum martyrum quorum illic reliquiae ponuntur tabernacula sibi circa easdem ecclesias quae ex fanis commutatae sunt de ramis arborum faciant etc bed lib cap  0 on the day of dedication or the birthday of the holy martyrs whose relics are there placed let the people make to themselves booths of the boughs of trees round about those very churches which had been the temples of idols and in a religious way to observe a feast that beasts may no longer be slaughtered by way of sacrifice to the devil but for their own eating and the glory of god and that when they are full and satisfied they may return him thanks who is the giver of all good things  this then is the beginning of our country wakes but they continued not in their original purity for the feasting and sporting got the ascendant of religion and so this feast of dedication degenerated into drunkenness and luxury at present there is nothing left but the very refuse and dregs of it religion having not the least share in it which till these latter ages always had some rioting and feasting are now all that remain a scandal to the feast in particular and to christianity in general  chap xxxi of the harvest supper a custom of the heathens taken from the jewish feast of tabernacles when the fruits of the earth are gathered in and laid in their proper receptacles it is common in the most of country places to provide a plentiful supper for the harvestmen and the servants of the family which is called a harvestsupper and in some places a mellsupper a churn supper etc at this the servant and his master are alike and every thing is done with an equal freedom they sit at the same table converse freely together and spend the remaining part of the night in dancing singing etc without any difference or distinction  there antiquitus consuetudo fuit apud gentiles quod hoc mense servi pastores and ancillae quadam liberate fruerentur et cum dominis suis dominarentur and cum eis facerent festa and convivia post collectas messes durand rat lib   cap    was a custom among the heathens much like this at the gathering in of their harvest when servants were indulged with liberty and being on the equality with their masters for a certain time  now the original of both these customs is jewish and therefore hospinian tells us et pro collectis frugibus deo gratiae agebantur quem morem ethnici postea abiis mutuati sunt hospin de orig fest jud stukius antiq convival p    that the heathens copied after this custom of the jews and at the end of their harvest offered up their first fruits to the gods for the jews rejoiced and feasted at the getting in of the harvest  theophylact in talking of this feast is undoubtedly mistaken when he says scenopegia quod celebrant in gratiarum actionem propter convectas fruges in mense septembri tunc enim gratias agebant deo convectis omnibus fructibus etc theophylact in   cap joan that the feast of tabernacles was celebrated that thanks might be returned for the getting in of the fruits of the earth for god himself tells his own people it was instituted levit     that their generations might know that he had made the children of israel to dwell in booths but however it is certainly true that it was a time of returning thanks to god for the success of the harvest a time of festivity and joy and gladness thus the scripture deuteronomy    thou shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days after thou have gathered in thy corn and thy wine and thou shall rejoice in thy feast thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and thy maidservant and the levite the stranger and the fatherless and the widow that are within thy gates  now as the heathens have imitated the jews in this custom so it is not improbable that we have had it from the heathens there being a very great likeness between the custom now and that of the heathens formerly for macrobius tells us that patres familiarum and frugibus and fructibus jam coactis passim cum servis vescerentur cum quibus patientiam laboris ia colendo rure toleraverant macrob saturnal die pim cap  0 the masters of families when they had got in their harvest were wont to feast with their servants who had labored with them in tilling the ground which is exactly answerable to the custom now amongst us but whatever truth there is in this it is certain this custom was practiced by the saxons and is at least as ancient amongst us as their days for among their holy days we find a estob append p  0 week set apart at harvest of
