elegance of form strength of body freedom of movement nor other external qualities constitute the principal dignity of animated beings in man we prefer genius to figure courage to strength and sentiment to beauty and therefore we are induced to think that the chief excellence of an animal consists also of internal qualities by these he differs from an automation rises above the vegetable tribes and approaches the human species it is sentiment which ennobles governs and gives activity to all his organs and propensities hence the perfection of an animal depends on sentiment alone and in proportion to its extent his faculties resources and relations with the rest of the universe are augmented when his sentiment is delicate and improved by education he is then fit to associate with man to concur with his designs to aid to defend and to caress him by a frequent performance of these services he conciliates the favor of his master and from a tyrant converts him into a friend and protector  the dog independent of the beauty of his figure his strength vivacity and nimbleness possesses every internal excellence which can attract the regard of man a passionate and even a ferocious and sanguinary temper renders the wild dog formidable to all animals but in the domestic dog these hostile dispositions vanish and are succeeded by the softer sentiments of attachment and the desire of pleasing he runs with cheerfulness and alacrity to his masters foot where he lays down his courage his strength and his talents he attends for orders which he is always solicitous to execute he consults he interrogates he supplicates his master a single glance of the eye is sufficient for he knows the external signs of our intentions and wishes without being endowed like man with the faculty of thinking his feelings are extremely delicate and he has more fidelity and steadiness in his affection he is not corrupted by ambition by interested views or by a desire of revenge and he has no fear but that of displeasing he is all zeal ardour and obedience more apt to recall benefits than outrages he is not discouraged by blows or bad treatment but calmly suffers and soon forgets them or he remembers them only to increase his attachment instead of flying or discovering marks of resentment he exposes himself to torture and licks the hand from which he received the blow to the cruelty of his master  only opposes complaint patience and submission  more tractable than man and more plaint than any other animal the dog is not only soon instructed but even conforms himself to the manners movements and habits of those who govern him he assumes the very tone of the family in which he lives like other servants he is haughty with the great and rustic with the peasant always eager to obey and to please his master or his friends he pays no attention to strangers and furiously repels beggars whom he distinguishes by their dress their voice and their gestures when the charge of a house or garden is committed to him during the night his boldness increases and he sometimes becomes perfectly ferocious he watches goes the rounds smells strangers at a distance and if they stop or attempt to leap any barrier he instantly darts upon them and by barking and other marks of passion alarms the family and neighborhood equally furious against thieves as against rapacious animals he attacks and wounds them and forces from them whatever they have been attempting to carry off but contented with victory he lies down upon the spoil and will not touch it even to satisfy his appetite exhibiting at the same time an example of courage temperance and fidelity  to conceive the importance of this species in the order of nature let us suppose that it never existed without the assistance of the dog how could man have conquered tamed and reduced the other animals into slavery how could he still discover hunt down and destroy noxious and savage beasts for his own safety and to render him master of the animated world it was necessary to form a party among the animals themselves to conciliate by caresses those which were capable of attachment and obedience in order to oppose them to the other species hence the training of the dog seems to have been the first art invented by man and the result of this art was the conquest and peaceable possession of the earth  most animals are superior to man in agility swiftness strength and even in courage nature has fortified and armed them better their senses and particularly that of smelling are likewise more perfect to have brought over to our interest a bold and tractable species like that of the dog was to acquire new senses and faculties the machines and instruments we have invented to improve or to extend our other senses are not nearly so useful as those presented to us ready made by nature which by supplying the defects of our smelling have furnished us with great and permanent resources for conquest and dominion the dog ever faithful to man will always maintain a portion of this empire he will always preserve a degree of superiority above the other animals he reigns at the head of a flock and is better heard than the voice of the shepherd safety order and discipline are the fruits of his vigilance and activity sheep and cattle are a people subjected to his management whom he prudently conducts and protects and never employs force against them but for the preservation of peace and good order  but in war against his enemies or wild animals he makes a full display of his courage and intelligence here his natural and acquired talents are united as soon as the din of arms is heard as soon as the horn or the voice of the hunter gives the alarm the dog sparkling with redoubled ardour demonstrates his joy by the most lively emotions he announces by his movements and cries his impatience for the combat and his passion for victory sometimes he moves silently along reconnoitres the ground and endeavors to discover and surprise the enemy at other times he traces the animals steps and by different accents indicates the distance the species and even the age of the fugitive pushed intimidated and despairing of safety from flight alone the poor animal likewise exerts its faculties and opposes craftiness to sagacity see below article deer  the resources of instinct are now worthy of admiration to make him lose the scent the creature doubles returns on its former steps bounds and wishes to detach itself from the earth at one leap it often clears a highway or a hedge and swims over brooks and rivers but always pursued and being unable to conceal or annihilate its body the animal endeavors to start another of less experience and after running together till the former imagines that the two scents or traces are confounded it then suddenly separates in order to let the other fall a victim to the deceived enemy  but the dog by the superiority he has acquired from habit and education and from the peculiar fineness of his sensations loses not the object of his pursuit by the acuteness of his scent he unravels all the windings of the labyrinth all the false routs which were intended to deceive him and instead of abandoning the enemy for an indifferent animal he redoubles his ardour he overtakes attacks slays and extinguishes his thirst and his rage in the blood of the victim  the propensity to hunting or to war is equally strong in man as in other animals the whole knowledge of the savage is confined to fighting and hunting all carnivorous animals which have weapons and strength hunt naturally the lion and the tiger whose strength is so great as to insure them of victory hunt alone and without artifice wolves foxes and wild dogs hunt in packs assist each other with much art and mutually share in the prey when the natural talents of the dog have been improved by education when he has learned to repress his ardour and to regulate his movements he then hunts artificially and is always certain of success  in desert and depopulated countries there are wild dogs which in their manners differ not from wolves excepting by the facility with which they may be tamed they unite in troops and attack wild boars and bulls and even lions and tigers the wild dogs of america are of the domestic race and were transported thither from europe some of them have been abandoned in these deserts where they have multiplied so prodigiously that they spread over the inhabited countries in great packs and attack the domestic cattle and even insult the natives who are obliged to disperse and kill them like other ferocious animals wild dogs though they have no knowledge of man when approached with gentleness soon soften become familiar and remain faithfully attached to their masters but the wolf though taken young and brought up in the house is only gentle when a mere cub never loses his taste for prey and sooner or later indulges his inclination for rapine and destruction  the dog may be said to be the only animal whose fidelity is unshaken who always knows his master and the friends of the family who distinguishes a stranger as soon as he arrives who understands his own name and the voices of the domestics who confides not in himself who calls on his lost master by cries and lamentation who in long journeys which he has traveled but once remembers and finds out the roads in fine the dog is the only animal whose natural talents are conspicuous and whose education is always successful  of all animals the dog is also most susceptible of impressions most easily modified by moral causes and most subject to alterations occasioned by physical influence his temperament faculties and habits very prodigiously and even the figure of his body is by no means constant in the same country one dog differs greatly from another and in different climates the very species seems to be changed from these causes the number and mixture of races are so great that it is almost impossible to recognize or enumerate them to the same causes must be attributed those remarkable varieties in size figure length of muzzle form of the head length and direction of the ears and tail color quantity of hair etc in a word nothing seems to be permanent in these animals but their internal organization and the faculty of procreating together as those which differ most from each other are capable of intermixing and of producing fertile individuals it is evident that all dogs however diversified constitute but one species  in this numerous variety of races it is difficult to investigate the character of the primitive stock from which they have all sprung how shall the effects produced by the influence of climate food etc be distinguished how shall we perceive the changes introduced by the mixture of different races when in a wild or in a domestic state in the progress of time all these causes alter the most permanent forms and the original stamp of nature never preserves its purity in beings which have been long under the management of man this original impression is best preserved in those animals that have the independent choice both of their climate and food the most ancient of which are still faithfully represented by their descendants but those which man has subdued transported from climate to climate and changed their food their habits and manner of living must necessarily have suffered the greatest alterations in their form and it is a well known fact that there are more varieties among the domestic than the wild animals and of all domestic animals as the dog is most closely attached to man lives as irregularly and is endowed with dispositions which render him docile obedient susceptible of every impression and submissive to every restraint it is not surprising that he should likewise exhibit the greatest variety in figure size color and other qualities  but other causes concur in producing these changes the life of the dog is short his prolific powers are great and as he is perpetually under the eye of man whenever by any accident which is not uncommon in nature some individuals marked with singular characters appeared they would be perpetuated by preventing their intermixture with any other kinds as is done at present when we want to procure new races of dogs or of other animals besides though every species were equally ancient the number of generations from the creation being greater in those whose lives are short their varieties alterations and even degeneration must become more conspicuous because they are farther removed from the original stock than those which live longer man is at present eight times nearer adam than the dog to his first parent because man lives eighty years and the dog only ten if therefore by any cause these two species had an equal tendency to degenerate the alteration would be ten times more strongly marked in the dog than in man  those small animals whose lives are so short that they are succeeded every year by a new generation are infinitely more subject to variations of every kind than those which live longer the same remark is applicable to annual plants some of which may be considered as of an artificial or factitious nature wheat for example has been so greatly altered by man that it is now no where to be found in a natural state it has a similarity to darnel dogsgrass and several other grasses but still we know not to which of these plants it ought to be referred and as it is annually renewed is used as the common food of man and more cultivated than any other vegetable its nature of course has undergone the greatest alterations hence man is able not only to make every individual in the universe answer his own ends but with the assistance of time he can change modify and improve their species this is the chief power he possesses over nature to have transformed a barren herb into wheat is a kind of creation of which however we have no reason to boast since it is only by the sweet of our brows and reiterated culture that we are able to extract from the earth a scanty and often a bitter subsistence  hence both in the animal and vegetable kingdoms the species which have received the highest culture from man have undergone the greatest changes from their original condition and as we are often unable to recognize their primitive form as in the example of wheat and other grain it is not impossible that among the numerous varieties of dogs which at present subsist not one of them should resemble the first animal of the species that virtually gave birth to the whole  nature however when not restrained never fails to resume her rights wheat when sown on uncultivated ground degenerates the very first year and if sown for a succession of ages upon the same ground this degeneration would gradually proceed till the plant acquired its original from by an experiment of this kind the time required by nature for destroying the effects of art and resuming her pristine state might be discovered this experiment might be easily performed on plants but in animals there is little hope of its success because it is difficult to manage them with sufficient dexterity or to overcome their invincible repugnance against every thing that restrains or counteracts their natural or acquired habits we cannot therefore expect to learn by this method the primitive race of dogs or of other animals which are subjected to permanent varieties but to supply the place of facts which cannot be ascertained we may collect particular marks and from these draw probable conjectures  the domestic dogs which were abandoned in the deserts of america and have lived in a wild state during   0 or  00 years though originally derived from altered races must during so long a course of time have made greater or smaller approaches toward their primitive form travelers however inform us that they resemble our greyhounds hist des avanturiers flibustiers par oexmelin tom   p      they make the same remark with regard to the wild dogs of congo hist genesis des voyages par labbe prevost tom   p     which like those of america make war in packs against tigers lions etc but others without comparing the wild dogs of st domingo to greyhounds only observe that they have generally a long flat head a slender muzzle a ferocious air and meagre bodies that they are exceedingly swift in the chase hunt in the most perfect manner and easily tame when taken young nonv voyages aux isles de lamerique tom   p      thus these wild dogs are very meagre and fleet and as the common greyhounds differs little in other respects from the irish greyhound or from the shepherds dog it is probable that those wild dogs rather belong to this kind than to the true greyhound race for on the other hand the more ancient travelers tell us that the native dogs of canada had erect ears like the fox and resembled our village or shepherds dog voyage du pays des hurons par sabard theodat p   0  that those belonging to the savages of the antilles had very long heads and ears and approached to the figure of foxes hist genesis des antilles par le p du tertre tom   p  0   that the indians of peru had only a large and a small kind which they called alco hist des incas tom   p     wafers voyage subjoined to those of dampier vol   p      and that those of the isthmus of america were very ugly and had long coarse hair which likewise implies erect ears nouveaux voyages aux isles de lamerique tom   p      hence it is apparent that the original dogs of america before they had any communication with those of europe were all of one race and that they approached most to the dogs with slender muzzles erect ears and coarse hair like the shepherds dog and i am still farther convinced that the wild dogs of st domingo are not genuine greyhounds because the latter is so rare in france that they are brought for the use of the king from constantinople and other parts of the levant and because i never knew of any greyhounds being transported to france from st domingo or any of our american colonies besides by consulting what travelers have said concerning the dogs of different countries we find that all the dogs of cold climates have long muzzles and erect ears that those of lapland are small and have long hair erect ears and sharp muzzles voyage de la martiniere p    ii genio vagante vol   p     that the siberian dogs see plate xxix  and those called wolfdogs are larger than the lapland kind but their ears are still erect their hair coarse and their muzzle sharp that those of iceland see plate xxx are nearly similar to the siberian dog and in the same manner that the native dogs of the cape of good hope description du cap par kolbe part   p  0   and other warm climates have pointed muzzles erect ears long trailing tails and clear but long rough hair that those dogs are excellent for guarding flocks and of course that they resemble the shepherds dog not only in figure but in instinct that in still warmer climates as at madagascar voyage de flacourt p      madura voyage dinnigo de biervillas p      calicut voyage de francis pyrard tom   p      and malabar voyage de jean ovington tom   p      the native dogs have all long muzzles erect ears and have such a resemblance to the shepherds dog that when irish greyhounds spaniels waterdogs bulldogs bloodhounds greyhounds etc were transported thither they degenerated at the second or third generation lastly that in excessive warm countries as in guiney hist genesis des voyages par m labbe prevost tom   p      this degeneration is still quicker for in three or four years they lose their voice bark no more but make a dismal kind of howling noise and their progeny have erect ears like the fox the native dogs of those countries are ugly animals with sharp muzzles long erect ears and long pointed tails there is no hair on their bodies their skin is commonly spotted but sometimes of a uniform color in a word they are disagreeable to the eye and still more so to the touch  we may therefore suppose with some degree of probability that the shepherds dog approaches nearer to the primitive race than any of the other kinds for in every country inhabited by savage or by half civilized men the native dogs resemble this race more than any other besides in the whole of the new continent there was no other variety neither is there any other at the south and north extremities of our own continent and in france and other temperate climates they are very numerous though greater attention has been paid to the rearing of other more beautiful kinds than to the preservation of this race which has no recommendation but its utility and for that reason has been abandoned to the care of the sheepfarmers if it be farther considered that this dog notwithstanding his ugliness and his wild and melancholy aspect is superior in instinct to all others that he has a decided character independent of education that he alone is born fully trained that guided solely by natural powers he applies himself spontaneously to the keeping of flocks which he executes with amazing fidelity vigilance and assiduity that he conducts them with an admirable and uncommunicated intelligence that his talents at the same time astonish and give repose to his master while other dogs require the most laborious instruction to train them to the purposes for which they are destined we will be confirmed in the opinion that the shepherds dog is the true dog of nature that he has been preferably bestowed on us for the extent of his utility that he has a superior relation to the general order of animated beings who mutually depend on each other and lastly that he ought to be regarded as the origin and model of the whole species  in the frozen regions of the north the human species is deformed rustic and diminutive lapland greenland and all countries where the cold is excessive produce only dwarfish and ugly men but in the neighboring and less rigorous regions of finland denmark etc the most beautiful race sudenly appears for in figure color and stature they are perhaps the handsomest of the human kind the same phenomenon is exhibited in the dogspecies the lapland dogs are very ugly and so small that they exceed not a foot in length ii genio vagante vol   p     those of siberia though less ugly have erect ears and a savage aspect but in the neighboring climate where we meet with the handsome men already mentioned see vol   art varieties of the human species  we find also the most beautiful and largest dogs the dogs of tartary of albania of the north of greece of denmar and of ireland are the largest and strongest of the species and are used for drawing carriages the irish greyhounds are of a very ancient race and still exist though their number is small in their original climate they were called by the ancients dogs of epirus and albanian

hist nature lib viii  they are much larger than the mastiff in france they are so rare that i never saw above one of them which appeared when sitting to be about five feet high and resembled in figure the danish dog see plate xxv  but greatly exceeded him in stature he was totally white and of a mild and peaceable disposition we find then in all the temperate climates as in britain france germany spain and italy men and dogs of all races this variety proceeds partly from the influence of climate and partly from the great concourse and intermixture of foreigners with regard to dogs i shall mark with all possible attention the similarities and discrepancies which shelter care food and climate have produced among these animals  the danish dog see plate xxv  the irish greyhound see plate xxiv  and the common greyhound see plate xxvi  though they appear to be different are only the same dog the danish dog is but a more corpulent irish greyhound and the common greyhound is the irish greyhound rendered thinner and more delicate by culture for these three dogs though perfectly distinguishable at first sight differ not more from each other than a dutchman a frenchman and an italian if we suppose the irish greyhound to have been a native of france he would have produced the danish dog in a colder climate and the common greyhound in a warmer one and this conjecture is even verified by experience for the danish dogs come to us from the north and the greyhounds from constantinople and the levant the shepherds dog see plate xxvii  the pomeranian or wolfdog plate xxviii  the siberian dog plate xxix  to which may be joined the lapland dog the canadian dog the hottentot dog and all those which have erect ears constitute but one kind they differ from the shepherds dog only in stature in being more or less gross or in the length coarseness or bushiness of their hair the hound plate xxxi  the harrier plate xxxii  the turnspit plate xxxiv  the waterdog plate xxxvi  and even the spaniel plate xxxvii  may be regarded as one dog their figure and instincts are nearly the same and they differ only in the length of their legs and the size of their ears which however in all of them are long soft and pendulous these dogs are natives of france and i am uncertain whether the dalmatian dog dalmatia i have been informed says mr pennant is the country of this elegant dog as for those of india they are generally small and very ugly or if the european dogs are brought there they immediately degenerate synops of quad p      or as it is called the harrier of bengal ought to be disjoined from them for it differs from our harrier only in color i am convinced that this dog is not an original native of bengal or of any other part of india and that it is not as has been pretended the indian dog mentioned by the ancients and said to have been produced between a dog and a tiger for it has been known in italy above   0 years ago and not considered as a dog brought from india but as a common harrier canis sagax vulgo brachus says aldrovandus an unius vel varii coloris sit parum refert in italia eligitur varius et maculosae lynci persimilis cum tamen niger color vel

little warmer as turkey or persia these dogs degenerate but the spaniels and waterdogs are natives of spain and barbary where the temperature of the climate renders the hair of all animals longer and finer than in any other country the bulldog see plate xlii  what is improperly called the small danish dog for it has no other resemblance to the danish dog see plate xxv than the shortness of its hair the naked or turkish dog plate xli  and the iceland dog plate xxx  constitute but one race which being transported from cold countries where the fur is always strong into the warmer climates of africa and india have lost their hair for the naked dog is improperly called the turkish dog it is not in the temperate climate of turkey that dogs lose their hair but in guiney and the warm regions of india the turkish dog is nothing but the small danish dog which has first been transported to a very warm climate where it cast its hair and then afterward brought to turkey and propagated carefully on account of its singularity the first of them says aldrovandus which appeared in europe were brought into italy in his own time where they could not be propagated because the climate was too cold for them but as he gives no description of these naked dogs we know not whether they were similar to what is now called the turkish nor consequently whether they can be referred to the small danish dog because dogs of every kind lose their hair in very warm climates hist genesis des voyages par m labbe prevost tom   p      and as formerly remarked they also lose their voice in some countries they are perfectly mute in others they lose only the faculty of barking but howl like wolves or yelp like foxes this change seems to make them approach to their natural state for both their figure and instincts are altered they assume an ugly aspect and their ears become erect and pointed voyage de la boullayele gouz p     voyages de jean ovington tom i p     histoire universelle des voyages par du perrier de montfrasier p     et suivantes vie de christophe colomb part i p  0  voyage de bosman en guinee etc p   0 histoire generale des voyages par m labbe prevost tom iv p      it is only in temperate climates that dogs preserve their ardour courage sagacity and other talents they lose every thing when transported to very hot countries but as if nature never made any being perfectly useless in climates where dogs cannot serve the purposes for which we employ them they are in great request for the table and their flesh is preferred by the negroes to that of all other animals they sell dogs in the market as dear as mutton venison or game of any kind a roasted dog being the most luxurious feast to a negro perhaps this remarkable appetite for dogs flesh is owing to a change produced in its quality by the heat of the country for in our climates it is extremely disagreeable but i am inclined to think that this appetite depends more on the nature of man than that of the dog for the savages of canada who inhabit a cold country are equally fond of dogs flesh with the negroes and our missionaries sometimes eat of it without disgust p sabard theodat remarks that dogs are used as we use mutton at feasts i have several times been present at these dogfeasts which at first struck me with a degree of horror but after tasting it twice i found that the flesh was good and had a flavor somewhat resembling that of pork voyage au pays des hurons par le p sabard theodat p       in our climates the wolf and fox make the nearest approach to the dog particularly to the shepherds dog which i consider as the original stock of the species and as their internal structure is almost entirely the same and their external differences very slight i wished to try if they would intermix and produce together i hoped at least to make them copulate and if they produced not fertile individuals i expected to procure mules which would participate of the nature of both animals with this view i reared a shewolf taken in the woods at the age of three months along with an irish greyhound of the same age they were shut up together in a pretty large court to which no other beast could have access and where they were provided with a shelter for their retirement they were equally strangers to any individual of their own species and knew no person but the man who gave them their victuals they were kept in this state three years without the smallest restraint during the first year they played perpetually and seemed to be extremely fond of each other the second year they began to quarrel about their food though they were supplied in a plentiful manner the wolf always began the dispute when meat and bones were given them on a large wooden dish the wolf instead of seizing the meat instantly drove off the dog then laid hold of the edge of the plate so dexterously as to allow nothing to fall and carried off the whole i have seen her run in this manner with the dish in her teeth five or six times round the wall and never set it down unless to take breath to devour the meat or to attack the dog when he approached the dog was stronger than the wolf but as he was less ferocious we began to be apprehensive for his life and therefore furnished him with a collar after the second year these quarrels and combats became more frequent and more serious and a collar was also given to the wolf whom the dog now handled more roughly than before  during these two years not the smallest symptom of desire appeared either in the one or the other at the end of the third year they began to feel all the ardour of passion but discovered no marks of love this condition instead of softening and making them approach each other rendered them more untractable and ferocious nothing now was heard but dismal howlings and cries of resentment in three weeks they were both very meagre but never approached but to tear each other at last they fought so cruelly that the dog killed the wolf the dog was shot some days after because as soon as he was set at liberty he sprung with fury upon poultry dogs and even men  i had at the same time three young foxes two males and a female which were taken with nets and kept in separate apartments one of them was secured by a long light chain and a hut was built for sheltering him i kept him several months and though he had a melancholy air and kept his eyes fixed upon the fields of which he had a view from his hut yet both his health and appetite were good a bitch in season was presented to him but as she would not remain near the fox she was chained in the same place and both were amply provided with victuals the fox neither bit nor maletreated her during ten days that they lived together there was not the smallest quarrel neither night nor day nor during the time of feeding the fox even approached her pretty familiarly but as soon as he had scented her too near the mark of desire disappeared he mournfully returned to his hut and no commixture took place when the ardour of this bitch was gone another and afterward a third and a fourth were successively presented to him he treated them with the same gentleness and the same indifference to ascertain whether this indifference was owing to a natural repugnance or to a state of restraint he was furnished with a female of his own species which he covered more than once the first day the female was dissected some weeks after and four foetuss were found in the uterus the male fox was then let loose in a close court and successively furnished with several bitches in season he discovered neither hatred nor love to them and he died of chagrin and melancholy a few months afterward  from these experiments we learn that the wolf and fox are very different in their natures from the dog that their species are so distinct and remote from each other as to prevent their commixture at least in our climates that consequently the dog derives not his origin from the wolf or the fox and that the nomenclators canis cauda sinistrorsum recurvata the dog canis cauda incurvata the wolf canis cauda recta apice albo the fox linn syst p     who regard these two animals as wild dogs or who imagine the dog to be a wolf or a fox become domestic and give the whole three the common name of dog have deceived themselves by not sufficiently studying nature here the ingenious author seems to have made his conclusion from these experiments too general for mr pennant in his synopsis of quadrupeds p     records a recent instance of a fertile intercourse between a wolf and a bitch his words are mr brook animalmerchant in holborn turned a wolf to a pomeranian bitch in heat the congress was immediate and as usual between dog and bitch she produced ten puppies i have seen one of them that had very much the resemblance of the wolf and much of its nature being slipped at a weak deer it instantly caught at the animals throat and killed it  it is to be regretted that mr pennant gives no information as to the fertility or sterility of these mules  in warm climates there is a ferocious animal which differs less from the dog than the wolf or fox this animal called the jackal has been well described by travelers they are very numerous in asia and africa in the neighborhood of trebisond voyages de gemell carreri tom   p      round mount caucasus in mingrelia chardin p     natolia voyage de dumont tom   p     hyrcania chardin tom   p     persia india guiney and at surat voyage dinnigo de biervillas part   p      goa guzarat bengal congo voyage de bosman p         voyage du p zuchel p      and several other places though this animal is considered by the natives as a wild dog yet as it is doubtful whether they intermix and produce together we shall treat of the jackal the wolf and the dog as separate and distinct species  i pretend not absolutely to affirm that the jackal or even the wolf and fox in no age or country never intermixed with dogs the contrary is asserted positively by the ancients aristotle arist de generat animal lib   cap   remarks that though animals of different species intermingle seldom yet it certainly happens among dogs foxes and wolves he adds that the indian dogs proceed from another similar wild beast and the dog this wild beast to which he gives no name is probably the jackal but he observes in another place idem hist animal lib   cap     that the indian dogs proceed from a commixture between the tiger and the bitch this notion is extremely improbable beeause the tiger both in his form and dispositions differs much more from the dog than the wolf the fox or the jackal aristotle indeed appears to violate his own argument for after telling us that the indian dogs proceeded from a wild beast similar to the wolf or fox he says afterward that they proceed from the tiger without mentioning whether this conjunction was made between the tiger and bitch or between the dog and tigress he only adds that the affair did not succeed till the third trial that the first litter consisted solely of tigers that dogs were chained in the deserts and unless the tiger was in season they were often devoured that the great heat and scarcity of water made the production of monsters and prodigies very frequent in africa because numbers of animals were obliged to assemble in the same place in order to drink where they often grew familiar and coupled together all this seems to be not only conjectural and uncertain but suspicious and unworthy of credit for the more narrowly we examine the nature of animals we perceive that instinct is the most certain criterion for judging of them by the most attentive inspection of their internal parts we discover only slight differences the horse and ass though perfectly similar in their internal structure are very different in their natures the internal parts of the bull the ram and the hegoat are exactly the same yet they constitute three species more remote from each other than the ass and horse the same remark is applicable to the dog the fox and the wolf we derive more light from inspecting the external form but as in species which are not remote there are even externally more resemblances than discrepancies this inspection is not sufficient to determine whether they belong to the same or to different species in a word when the shades are still lighter they must be combined with the information derived from instinct it is from the dispositions of animals that we ought to judge of their natures if we suppose two animals perfectly similar in form but very different in their dispositions they would neither join nor produce together but constitute two distinct species  this mode of judging concerning the differences of neighboring species is the only one that can be employed when we want to distinguish the numerous varieties which take place in the same species we know thirty fixed varieties of dogs though we certainly are not acquainted with the whole of these thirty varieties there are seventeen which ought to be ascribed to the influence of climate namely the shepherds dog the pomeranian dog the siberian dog the iceland dog the lapland dog the irish greyhound the common greyhound the mastiff the great danish dog the hound the harrier the terrier the spaniel the water dog the small danish dog the turkish dog and the bulldog the other thirteen which are the mongrel turkish dog the greyhound with hair like an wolf the shockdog or lapdog the bastard pugdog the pugdog the calabrian burgos and alicant dogs the liondog the small water dog the dog of artois and the king charless dog are nothing but mongrels produced by the commixture of the above seventeen races and by tracing each of these mongrels back to the two races from which they sprung their natures will then be sufficiently ascertained but if we want to know the relations which subsist between the first seventeen races we must attend to their instincts their figure and many other circumstances i have put into one group the shepherds dog the pomeranian dog the siberian dog the lapland and iceland dogs because a stronger resemblance takes place between them than between any of the other kinds and because all of them have sharp muzzles like the fox erect ears and an instinct which induces them to follow and protect flocks the greyhound the large danish dog and the irish greyhound have beside their similarity in figure and length of muzzle the same dispositions they are found of running and of following horses and carriages they have little scent and hunt rather by the eye than the nose the hounds the harriers the spaniels the terriers and the waterdogs are the true hunting dogs though they differ a little in figure they have all thick muzzles and the same instincts and therefore they ought to be ranked together the spaniel for example has been called by some naturalists canis aviarius terrestris and the waterdog canis aviarius aquaticus the only difference in disposition between these two dogs is that the waterdog with his long bushyhair takes the water more cheerfully than the others whose hair is smooth and short lastly the small danish dog and the turkish dog must be joined together since the latter is said to be the same dog with the former only deprived of his hair by the effects of heat there remains only the bulldog which from the shortness of his muzzle resembles the little danish dog but differs from him so much both in figure and instinct as to form a particular variety he seems also to affect a particular climate he comes from britain and it is difficult to preserve the breed in france the mongrels that proceed from him which are the mastiff and the pugdog succeed better all these dogs have very short muzzles little scent and often send forth a disagreeable smell the fineness of scent seems to depend more on the largeness than the length of the muzzle for the greyhound the large danish dog and the irish greyhound have less scent than the hound the harrier the tarrier the spaniel or the waterdog who have all in proportion to their size shorter but broader muzzles than the former  the greater or lesser perfection of the senses forms not in man an eminent or remarkable quality but bestows on the other animals all their merit and produces as a cause all the talents of which they are susceptible i mean not to enumerate all the qualities of hunting dogs the superiority they posses over other animals by the excellence and acuteness of their sense of smelling is well known but details of this kind are remotely connected with natural history besides the artifices and dexterity though derived solely from nature employed by wild animals to conceal themselves or to avoid the pursuit of the dogs are perhaps more worthy of admiration than the most refined methodical exhibitions derived from the art of hunting  the dog like every other animal which produces above one or two at a time is not perfectly formed immediately after birth dogs are commonly brought forth blind the two eyelids are not simply glued together but shut up with a membrane which is torn off as soon as the muscles of the upper eyelid acquire strength sufficient to overcome this obstacle to vision which generally happens about the tenth or twelfth day at this period the bones of the head are not completed the body and muzzle are turgid and the whole figure is ill defined but in less than two months they learn to use all their senses their growth is rapid and they soon acquire strength in the fourth month they lose some of their teeth which as in other animals are soon replaced and never again fall out the number of teeth is fortytwo namely six cutting and two canine teeth in each jaw and fourteen grinders in the upper and twelve in the under but the number of grinders is not uniform being greater or less in particular dogs when very young both males and females squat down a little to void their urine in the ninth or tenth month they begin to raise the thigh when they perform this operation and at the same period they acquire the capacity of procreating the male is ready at all times but the female receives him only at certain fixed seasons which generally happen twice a year and more frequently in winter than in summer the ardour of the female continues ten twelve and sometimes fifteen days and it is known by external signs which appear some days before she admits the male the parts become moist and prominent and this phenomenon is always accompanied with a small flux of blood the male discovers the condition of the female by a peculiar smell but she seldom receives him for the first six or seven days one embrace is sometimes sufficient to make her conceive a great number of young but when not restrained she will admit several dogs every day she seems to have no predilection excepting in favor of the largest dogs without regarding their figure or beauty hence it frequently happens that a small female who has admitted a large male dies in bringing forth her young  but a singularity in these animals arising from the structure of their organs they are incapable of separating after consummation but are obliged to remain united as long as the erection subsists the dog like several other animals has not only a bone in the penis but in the middle of the corpus cavernosum there is a large hollow ring which in time of copulation swells to a considerable size the female on the other hand has a larger clitoris than perhaps any other animal besides in the time of coition a large firm protuberance arises and remains perhaps longer than that of the male and prevents him from retiring till it subsides for immediately after consummation he changes his position in order to repose on his four legs his aspect is melancholy and the efforts for separation never proceed from the female  the time of gestation is nine weeks or    days sometimes    or    but never less than  0 the females produce six seven and sometimes even twelve puppies the largest and tallest are more prolific than the smaller kinds which often produce only four or five and sometimes but one or two especially at the first litters which in all animals are always less numerous than the subsequent ones  dogs though extremely ardent in their amors continue to propagate during life which is generally limited to fourteen or fifteen years though some have been known to live to the age of twenty the duration of life in the dog as in other animals is proportioned to the time of his growth which is not completed in less than two years and he lives fourteen his age may be discovered by his teeth which when young are white sharp and pointed but as he increases in years they become black blunt and unequal it may likewise be known by the hair which turns gray on the muzzle front and round the eyes  these animals which are naturally vigilant active and frolicksome by being overfed in our houses become so heavy and slothful that they pass their lives in sleeping and eating their sleep which is almost perpetual is accompanied with dreams which is perhaps a gentle mode of existing they are naturally voracious and yet they can endure very long abstinence in the memoirs of the academy of sciences we have the history of a bitch that having been forgot in a country house lived forty days without any other nourishment than the wool of a matress which she had torn to pieces hist de lacad des sciences annee   0  p   water seems to be more necessary to dogs than victuals for they drink often and very plentifully it is even a vulgar opinion that when they want water too long they become mad it is also a peculiarity in dogs that they make great efforts and seem to suffer much pain in voiding their excrement this happens not as aristotle alleges arist de partibus animal lib ult  because their intestines become narrower in approaching the anus on the contrary it is certain that in the dog as in other animals the great intestines enlarge as they proceed downward and that the rectum is larger than the colon the dry temperament of this animal and not the strangulations of the colon which are too distant from the rectum is sufficient to produce this effect  to give a clear idea of the different kinds of dogs of their degeneration in particular climates and of the mixture of their races i have subjoined a table or genealogical tree in which all these varieties may be easily distinguished this tree is drawn in the form of a geographical chart preserving as much as possible the position of the different climates to which each variety naturally belongs the shepherds dog is the root of the tree this dog when transported into lapland or other very cold climates assumes an ugly appearance and shrinks into a smaller size but in russia iceland and siberia where the climate is less rigorous and the people a little more advanced in civilization he seems to be better accomplished these changes are occasioned solely by the influence of those climates which produce no great alteration in the figure of this dog for in each of these climates his ears are erect his hair thick and long his aspect wild and he barks less frequently and in a different manner than in more favorable climates where he acquires a finer polish the iceland dog is the only one that has not his ears entirely erect for their extremities are a little inclined and iceland of all the northern regions has been longest inhabited by half civilized men  the same shepherds dog when brought into temperate climates and among a people perfectly civilized as britain france germany whould by the mere influence of the climate lose his savage aspect his erect ears his rude thick long hair and assume the figure of a bulldog the hound and the irish greyhound the bulldog and irish greyhound have their ears still partly erect and very much resemble both in their manners and sanguinary temper the dog from which they derive their origin the hound is farthest removed from the shepherds dog for his ears are long and entirely pendulous the gentleness docility and even the timidity of the hound are proofs of his great degeneration or rather of the great perfection he has acquired by the long and careful education bestowed on him by man  the hound the harrier and the terrier constitute but one race for it has been remarked that in the same litter hounds harriers and terriers have been brought forth though the female hound had been covered by only one of these three dogs i have joined the common harrier to the dalmatian dog or harrier of bengal because they differ only in having more or fewer spots on their coat i have also linked the turnspit or terrier with crooked legs with the common terrier because the defect in the legs of the former has originally proceeded from a disease similar to the rickets with which some individuals had been affected and transmitted the deformity to their descendants  the hound when transported into spain and barbary where all animals have fine long bushy hair would be converted into the spaniel and waterdog the great and small spaniel which differ only in size when brought into britain have changed their white color into black and become by the influence of climate the great and little king charless dog to these may be joined the pyrame this dog though very common in britain has no english name  which is only a king charless dog black like the others but marked with red on the four legs and a spot of the same color above each eye and on the muzzle  the irish greyhound transported to the north is become the great danish dog and when carried to the south was converted into the common greyhound the largest greyhounds come from the levant those of a smaller size from italy and those italian greyhounds carried into britain have been still farther diminished  the great danish dog transported into ireland the ukraine tartary epirus and albania has been changed into the irish greyhound which is the largest of all dogs  the bulldog transported from britain to denmark is become the little danish dog and the latter brought into warm climates has been converted into the turkish dog all these races with their varieties have been produced by the influence of cliamte joined to the effects of shelter food and education the other dogs are not pure races but have proceeded from commixtures of those already described i have marked in the table by dotted lines the double origin of these mongrels  the greyhound and irish greyhound have produced the mongrel greyhound called also the greyhound with wolfs hair the muzzle of this mongrel is less pointed than that of the true greyhound which is very rare in france  the great danish dog and the large spaniel have produced the calabrian dog which is a beautiful animal with long bushy hair and larger than the irish greyhound  the spaniel and terrier have produced the dog called burgos  from the spaniel and little danish dog has proceeded the liondog which is now very rare  the dogs with long fine crisped hair called the bouffe dogs and which are larger than the waterdog proceed from the spaniel and waterdog  the little waterdog comes from the waterdog and small spaniel  from the bulldog and irish greyhound proceeds a mongrel called the mastiff which is larger than the bulldog and resembles the latter more than the irish greyhound  the pugdog proceeds from the bulldog and small danish dog  all these dogs are simple mongrels and are produced by the commixture of two pure races but there are other dogs called double mongrels because they proceed from the junction of a pure race with a mongrel  the bastard pugdog is a double mongrel from a mixture of the pugdog with the little danish dog  the alicant dog is also a double mongrel proceeding from the pugdog and small spaniel  the maltese or lapdog is a double mongrel produced between the small spaniel and little waterdog  lastly there are dogs which may be called triple mongrels because they are produced by two mixed races of this kind are the artois and islois dogs which are produced by the pugdog and the bastard pugdog to which may be added the dogs called streetdogs which resemble no particular kind because they proceed from races which have previously been several times mixed  supplement m de mailly of the academy of dijon well known by several ingenious performances communicated to me a fact which merits a place in the natural history of the dog the following is an extract of his letter upon this subject dated october         the curate of norges near dijon had a bitch which without either having ever been pregnant or delivered of puppies had all the symptoms which characterise these two states she came in season at the usual period but never had any connections with a male when the common term of gestation was finished her paps were distended with milk without being irritated by any particular treatment for it is possible to bring milk into the dugs of animals by frequently chaffing them but in this case every thing was the effect of nature and this bitch suckled some young puppies with which she was furnished and for whom she discovered as much tenderness and attention as if she had been their real mother all this i saw with my eyes but what is still more singular this same bitch about three years ago suckled two young cats one of which participated so much of the nature of its nurse that its cries had more resemblance to the barking of a dog than to the mewing of a cat  if the production of milk without impregnation were more frequent among quadrupeds it would make them analogous to female birds which lay eggs without the assistance of the male  of the varieties of dogs a few years ago at the fair of saint germain there was a siberian dog which appeared to differ so much from that represented in plate xxix as to merit a short description it was covered with long hair hanging almost down to the ground at first sight it resembled a large liondog but its ears were erect and much larger its color was all white and its length from the nose to the extremity of the body was    inches and a half and its height behind was    inches nine lines and    inches three lines before the eye was of a brown chestnut color and the end of the nose as well as round the nostrils and mouth were black the ears were bushy of a whitish yellow within and yellow on the edges and extremities the long hair of its head partly concealed the eyes and fell down upon the nose its toes and claws were also hid by the hair of its legs the tail which turned up like that of the pomeranian dog was covered with hair about seven or eight inches long this is certainly the roughest furred of all dogs  other dogs brought to paris by the russians which they called siberian dogs belonged to a very different race from the preceding both male and female were about the size of an ordinary greyhound the nose was sharp the ears half erect but bended a little in the middle they were not slender like the greyhound but round and full below the belly their tail was about eight or nine inches in length pretty thick and obtuse at the extremity their color was black without any mixture of white hairs but the female had a gray tuft on the middle of the head and the male a tuft of the same color at the end of the tail they were troublesome with their caresses and so voracious that they could never be satiated they were at the same time insufferably dirty and perpetually roaming about in quest of food their legs were tollerably handsome but their feet were large and broad and their toes united by a membrane their voice was very strong they had no inclination to bite they caressed every person indiscriminately and their vivacity was inexpressible extracted from a letter of m pasumot of the academy of dijon to m de buffon dated march         from this description it appears that these pretended siberian dogs are of the same race with that i have called the iceland dog whose figure is engraven plate xxx which exhibits a number of the characters mentioned in the above delineation  i have made some inquiry says mr colinson concerning the dogs of siberia those which draw sleds and carts are of a middle size their nose is sharp and their ears long and erect they carry their tail bended some of them like the wolf and others like the fox and it is certain that they copulate with wolves and foxes i see from your experiments that when these animals are confined they will not intermix but when at full liberty they willingly come together with regard to the dog and wolf i myself have seen them couple in england but i have never met with any person who saw dogs and foxes intermingle however from a kind i saw produced from a bitch which had lived at freedom in the woods i have no doubt that she had been impregnated by a fox the peasants know this species and distinguish it by the name of the foxdogs  most of the greenland dogs are white but some of them are black with very bushy hair they rather may be said to howl than bark and they are stupid and unfit for every species of hunting they serve however for dragging sleds to which they are yoked by fours and sixes the greenlanders eat the dogs flesh and make garments of his skin hist des voyages tom    p      the dogs of kamtschatka are rude and half savage like their masters they are commonly black or white and more nimble and active than our dogs they are great eaters of fish and are used for drawing sleds in summer they have their liberty but are collected together in the month of october for the purpose of drawing the sleds and during winter they are fed with a kind of paste composed of fish which is allowed to ferment in a ditch and given to them half boiled ibid p      from these facts it appears that the greenland and kamtschatkan dogs and perhaps those of other northern regions have a greater resemblance to the iceland dog than to any of the other races for the above description of the two russian dogs as well as the notices concerning those of greenland and kamtschatka correspond very well and may be equally applied to our iceland dog  though we have described all the varieties which we could collect there are still some which could not be procured for example there is a race of wild dogs of which i have seen two individuals but had not an opportunity of either describing or delineating them the ingenious and learned m aubry curate of saint louis has often furnished us with animals of which we had no knowledge he informs us that a few years ago he saw a dog nearly of the size of a spaniel which had long hair and a large beard on its chin this dog was produced from parents of the same race with those which had formerly been sent ot lowis xiv by m le comte de toulouse m le comte de lassai had also some of these dogs but i know not what has become of this singular race  with regard to the wild dogs among which there are different races as well as among the domestic kinds i have little to add to what i have said in my original work m le vicomte de querhoent has been so obliging as to communicate to me a note with regard to the wild dog found in the environs of the cape of good hope he remarks that at the cape there are numerous packs of wild dogs as large as our largest kinds whose skin is marked with various colors they have erect ears run with great swiftness and have no fixed residence they destroy an incredible quantity of deer they are seldom slain and very difficult to take in snares for they have an aversion to approach any thing that has been touched by man as their young are sometimes met with in the woods attempts have been made to render them domestic but they are so large and so ferocious that these attempts have always been

unfaithful domestic and kept only from the necessity we find of opposing him to other domestics still more incommodious and which cannot be hunted for we make no account of those people who being fond of all brutes foolishly keep cats for their amusement though these animals when young are frolicksome and beautiful they possess at the same time an innate malice and perverse disposition which increase as they grow up and which education learns them to conceal but not to subdue from determined robbers the best education can only convert them into flattering thieves for they have the same address subtlety and desire of plunder like thieves they know how to conceal their steps and their designs to watch opportunities to catch the proper moment for laying hold of their prey to fly from punishment and to remain at a distance till solicited to return they easily assume the habits of society but never acquire its manners for they have only the appearance of attachment or friendship this disingenuity of character is betrayed by the obliquity of their movements and the duplicity of their eyes they never look their best benefactor in the face but either from distrust or falseness they approach him by windings in order to procure caresses in which they have no other pleasure than what arises from flattering those who bestow them very different from that faithful animal the dog whose sentiments totally center in the person and happiness of his master the cat appears to have no feelings which are not interested to have no affection that is not conditional and to carry on no intercourse with men but in the view of turning it to his own advantage by these dispositions the cat has a greater relation to man than to the dog in whom there is not the smallest mark of insincerity or unjustice  the form and temperament of the cats body perfectly accord with his temper and dispositions he is jolly nimble dexterous cleanly and voluptuous he loves ease and chooses the softest and warmest situations for repose he is likewise extremely amorous and what is singular in the animal world the female seems to be more ardent than the male she not only invites and goes in quest of him but announces by loud cries the fury of her passion or rather the pressure of her necessities and when the male disdains her or flies from her she pursues tears and though their embraces are always accompanied with the most acute pain compels him to comply with her desires this passionate ardour of the female continues only nine or ten days and it happens generally twice a year though often thrice and even four times the period of gestation is    or    days and four or five are commonly produced at a litter as the male has an inclination to devour the young the female carefully conceals them and when apprehensive of a discovery she takes them up one by one in her mouth and hides them in holes and in places which are inaccessible after suckling them a few weeks she presents them with mice or young birds to learn them to eat flesh but by an unaccountable caprice these same careful tender and affectionate mothers sometimes assume an unnatural species of cruelty and devour their own offspring  young cats are gay vivacious and frolicksome and if nothing was to be apprehended from their claws would afford excellent amusement to children but their toying though always light and agreeable is never altogether innocent and is soon converted into habitual malice as their talents can only be exerted with advantage against small animals they lie in wait with great patience and perseverance to seize birds mice and rats and without any instruction become more expert hunters than the best trained dogs naturally averse to every kind of restraint they are incapable of any system of education it is related however that the greek monks of the island of cyprus had trained cats to hunt and destroy serpents with which that island was much infested descript des isles de larchipel par dapper p     but this hunting must rather be ascribed to their general desire of slaughter than to any kind of tractability or obedience for they delight in watching attacking and destroying all weak animals indiscriminately as birds young rabbits hares rats mice bats moles frogs toads lizards and serpents they have not that docility and fineness of scent for which the dog is so eminently distinguished they hunt only by the eye neither do they properly pursue but lie in wait and attack animals by surprise and after sporting with them and tormenting them for a long time they at last kill them without any necessity and even when well fed purely to gratify their sanguinary appetite  the most obvious physical cause of their watching and catching other animals by surprise proceeds from the advantage they derive from the peculiar structure of their eyes in man and most other animals the pupil is capable of a certain degree of contraction and dilatation it enlarges a little when the light is faint and contracts when the light is too splendid but in cats and night birds as the owls etc the contraction and dilatation are so great that the pupil which is round in the dark becomes when exposed to much light long and narrow like a line hence these animals see better in the night than in the day the pupil of the cat during the day is perpetually contracted and it is only by a strong effort that he can see with a strong light but in the twilight the pupil resumes its natural roundness the animal enjoys perfect vision and takes advantage of this superiority to discover and surprise his prey  though cats live in our houses they are not entirely domestic even the tamest cats are not under the smallest subjection but may rather be said to enjoy perfect liberty for they act only to please themselves and it is impossible to retain them a moment after they choose to go off besides most cats are half wild they know not their masters and only frequent barns offices or kitchens when pressed with hunger  though greater numbers of them are reared than of dogs as they are seldom seen their number makes less impression on us they contract a stronger attachment to our houses than to our persons when carried to the distance of a league or two they return of their own accord probably because they are acquainted with all the retreats of the mice and all the passages and outlets of the house and because the labor of returning is less than that which would be necessary to acquire the same knowledge in a new habitation they have a natural antipathy at water cold and bad smells they are fond of basking in the sun and of lying in warm places they are also fond of perfumes and willingly allow themselves to be taken and caressed by persons who carry aromatic substances they are so delighted with valerian root that it seems to throw them into a transport of pleasure to preserve this plant in our gardens we are under the necessity of fencing it round with a rail for the cats smell it at a distance collect about it in numbers and by frequently rubbing and passing and repassing over it they soon destroy the plant  cats require fifteen or eighteen months before they come to their full growth in less than a year they are capable of procreating and retain this faculty during life which extends not beyond nine or ten years they are however extremely hardy and vivacious and are more nervous than other animals which live longer  cats eat slowly and with difficulty their teeth are so short and ill placed that they can tear but not grind their food hence they always prefer the most tender victuals as fishes which they devour either raw or boiled they drink frequently their sleep is light and they often assume the appearance of sleeping when they are only meditating mischief they walk softly and without making any noise as their hair is always clean and dry it is easily electrified and the sparks become visible when it is rubbed across with the hand in the dark their eyes also sparkle in the dark like diamonds and seem to throw out in the night the light they imbibe during the day  the wild cat couples with the domestic kind and consequently they belong to the same species it is not uncommon to see both males and females quit their houses in the season of love go to the woods in quest of wild cats and afterward return to their former habitations it is for this reason that some domestic cats so perfectly resemble the wild cat the only real difference is internal for the intestines of the domestic cat are commonly much longer than those of the wild cat the latter however is larger and stronger than the domestic kind his lips are always black his ears are also stiffer his tail larger and his colors more constant in this climate there is only one species of wild cat and it appears from the testimony of travelers that this kind is found in all climates without being subject to much variety they existed in america before its discovery by the europeans a hunter brought one of them to christopher columbus vie de christ columb part   p      which was of an ordinary size of a brownish gray color and having a very long and strong tail they were likewise found in peru hist des incas tom   p      though not in a domestic state and also in canada hist de nouvelle france par charlevoix tom   p  0   in the country of the illinois etc they have been seen in many places of africa as in guiney prevot tom   p   0  and the gold coast at madagascar relation de francois cauche p      where the natives keep them in a domestic state and at the cape of good hope descript du cap par kolbe p     where m kolbe says there is likewise a wild kind of a blue color but they are not numerous these blue or rather slate colored cats are also found in asia in persia says pietro della valle voyage tom   p     there is a species of cats which properly belong to the province of chorazan their figure and size are the same with those of the common cat their beauty consists in the color of their hair which is gray and uniformly the same over the whole body excepting that it is darker on the back and head and clearer on the breast and belly where it approaches to whiteness with that agreeable mixture of clareobscure to use the language of the painters which has always a wonderful effect besides their hair is fine shining soft as silk and so long that though not frizled it forms ringlets in some parts and particularly under the throat these cats are among other cats what the waterdog is among other dogs the most beautiful part of the body is the tail which is very long and covered with hair five or six inches in length they extend and turn it upon their backs like the squirrel the point resembling a plume of feathers they are very tame and the portuguese have brought them from persia into india the same author adds that he had four couple of these cats which he intended to bring to italy from this description it appears that the persian cats resemble in color those we call chartreux cats and that excepting in color they have a perfect resemblance to the cat of angora it is probable therefore that the cat of chorazan in persia the cat of angora in syria and the chartreux cat constitute but one race whose beauty proceeds from the particular influence of the climate as the spanish cats which are red black and white owe their beauty to the climate of spain it may be remarked in general that of all climates on the habitable parts of the globe those of spain and syria are most favorable to the production of beautiful varieties in natural objects in spain and syria the sheep the goats the dogs the cats the rabbits etc have the finest wool the most beautiful and longest hair and the most agreeable and variegated colors these climates it would appear soften nature and embellish the form of all animals  the wild cat like most other animals in a savage state has coarse colors and hard hair but when rendered domestic the hair softens the colors vary and in the favorable climates of chorazan and syria the hair grows long fine and bushy all the colors become more delicate the black and red change into a shining brown and the greyish brown is converted into an ashcolored gray by comparing the wild cat with the chartreux cat it will be found that they differ only in this degradation in the shades of color as these animals have always more or less whiteness on the sides and belly it is apparent that to produce cats entirely white and with long hair like the cats of angora nothing farther is requisite than to join those which have the greatest quantity of white as has been done to procure white rabbits dogs goats stags etc in the spanish cat which is only another variety of the wild kind the colors instead of being weakened by uniform shades as in the cat of syria are exalted and have become more lively and brilliant the yellow is changed into red the brown into black and the gray into white these cats though transported into america have not degenerated but preserve their beautiful colors in the antilles says father tertre there are a number of cats which have probably been brought from spain they are mostly marked with red white and black several of our countrymen after eating the flesh carry the skins of these cats into france when we first arrived at guadaloupe the cats were so accustomed to feed on partridges pigeons thrushes and other small birds that they disdained the rats but when the game was much diminished they attacked the rats with great fury hist genesis des antilles par le p du tertre tom   p  0   etc in general cats are not subject like dogs to degeneration when transported into warm climates the european cats bosman remarks when carried to guiney change not like the dogs but preserve their original figure voyage de guinee par bosman p   0   etc their nature is indeed more constant and as their domestic state is neither so complete so universal nor perhaps so ancient as that of the dog it is not surprising that they are also less variegated our domestic cats though they differ in color form no distinct races the climates of spain and syria have alone produced permanent varieties to these may be added the climate of pechily in china where the cats have long hair and pendulous ears and are the favorites of the ladies hist genesis des voyages par m labbe prevot tom   p  0  these domestic cats with pendulous ears of which we have full descriptions are still farther removed from the wild and primitive race than those whose ears are erect  we shall here terminate the history of the cat and at the same time that of domestic animals the horse the ass the ox the sheep the goat the hog the dog and the cat are our only domestic animals we add not to this list the camel elephant raindeer etc which though domestic in other countries are strangers to us and we shall not treat of foreign animals till we have given the history of the wild animals which are natives of our own climate besides as the cat may be considered as only halfdomestic he forms the shade between domestic and wild animals for we ought not to rank among domestics those troublesome neighbors mice rats and moles which though they inhabit our houses and gardens are perfectly wild and free instead of being attached or submissive to man they fly from him and preserve entire in their obscure retreats their manners their habits and their liberty  we have seen in the history of each domestic animal the great influence which education shelter and the careful hand of man have upon the manners dispositions and even the form of animals we have seen that these causes joined to the effects of climate modify and change the species to such a degree as to make them very different from what they are in a natural state and at the same time introduce such changes among individuals of the same species that they would be regarded as different animals if they preserved not the faculty of intermixing and producing fertile individuals which is the only essential characteristic of species we have seen that the different races of domestic animals observe in different climates nearly the same order as the races of the human kind that like men they are stronger larger and more courageous in cold countries milder and more civilized in temperate climates and weaker and more deformed in very warm regions and that in temperate climates and among polished people the varieties of each species are most numerous and diversified and exhibit the most evident marks of the antiquity of their slavery pendulous ears variegated colors fine long hair are effects produced by their long continuance in a domestic state most wild animals have erect ears the ears of the wild boar are erect and stiff but those of the domestic hog are inclined and halfpendulous among the laplanders the savages of america the hottentots the negroes and other unpolished people all the dogs have erect ears but they are generally soft and pendulous in spain france britain turkey persia china and other civilized nations the ears of the domestic cat are not so stiff and erect as those of the wild kind and in china a nation which has been very long in a state of civilization and whose climate is mild there are cats with pendulous ears it is for this reason that the goat of angora whose ears are pendulous should be regarded as a variety farthest removed from the natural state the strong and marked influence of the climate of syria joined to the domestic condition of these animals among a people very anciently civilized would in the progress of time produce this variety which cannot be preserved in any other climate in the goats of angora brought forth in france the ears are neither so long nor so pendulous as in those of syria and would probably after a certain number of generations resume the ears and coarse hair of our common goat  supplement by mistaking some of my expressions in the above history of the cat i find it has been imagined that i had denied him the power of sleeping altogether i always knew that cats slept but not so profoundly as i now find they sometimes do on this subject m pasumot of the academy of dijon an able naturalist communicated to me a letter of which the following is an extract  permit me sir to remark that in your work you seem to deny the cat the power of sleeping i assure you that though he sleeps seldom his sleep is so profound that it is a species of lethargy which i have observed at least ten times in different cats when young a favorite cat lay every night in bed at my feet one night i pushed him from me but i was surprised to find him so heavy and at the same time so immovable that i believed him to be dead i pulled him smartly with my hand but i felt no motion i then tossed him about and by the force of the agitation he began slowly to awake this profound sleep and difficulty of wakening i have frequently observed it generally happened in the night having only once observed it in the day and this was after perusing what you have said concerning the sleep of these animals i know another gentleman who has likewise often seen cats sleeping in this profound manner he tells me that when cats sleep during the day it is always at the time of the greatest heat and particularly before the approach of stormy weather  m de lestree a merchant of chalons in champagne who is accustomed to allow cats to lie in his bed remarks    that when these animals purr when they are tranquil and appear to be sleeping they sometimes make a long inspiration which is followed by a strong expiration and that at this period their breath has an odor which greatly resembles that of musk    that when surprised by a dog or any other object which suddenly alarms them they make a kind of hissing noise which is accompanied with the same odor this is not peculiar to the males for i have remarked the same thing of both sexes and of cats of all ages and colors  from these facts m de lestree seems to think that in the breast or stomach of the cat there are some vessels filled with an aromatic substance the perfume of which issues from the mouth but we discover nothing of this kind from anatomy  i formerly remarked that in china there were cats with pendulous ears this variety is not found any where else and perhaps it is an animal of a different species for travelers when mentioning an animal called sumxu which is entirely domestic say that they can compare it to nothing but the cat with which it has a great resemblance its color is black or yellow and its hair very bright and glittering the chinese put silver collars about the necks of these animals and render them extremely familiar as they are not common they give a high price plate xlviii spanish cat plate xlix chartreux cat plate xlvi wild cat plate xlvii domestic cat plate l cat of angora both on account of their beauty and because they destroy rats journal des savans tom   p       at madagascar there are also wild cats rendered domestic most of them have twisted tails and they are called saca by the natives but these wild cats are of the same species with the domestic kind for they intermix and produce voy de flacourt p       another variety has been observed in our own climate cats are sometimes produced with pencils of hair at the points of their ears m de seve writes me nov         that a young cat was brought forth in his house at paris of the same race with that we have called the spanish cat with pencils at the points of its ears though neither of the parents had any pencils in a few months the pencils of this cat were as large in proportion to its size as those of the canadian lynx  the skin of an animal which greatly resembles that of our wild cat has been lately sent me from cayenne it is called haira in guiana where they eat its flesh which is white and good and hence we may presume that however similar to the cat it belongs to a different species but perhaps the name haira is improperly applied for it is probably the same with taira which is not a cat but a small martin taken notice of in the last volume of this work  of wild animals in the history of man and of domestic animals we have seen nature under restraint seldom persect often changed and deformed and perpetually encompassed with fetters or loaded with foreign ornaments she is now to appear naked and adorned with simplicity alone but her attractions will be heightened by native beauty by the freedom of her demeanor the sprightliness of her movements and other marks of true dignity and independence we are to see her traversing the surface of the earth like a sovereign dividing her empire among the animals assigning to each his proper element climate and subsistence we shall survey her in the forests in the waters and in the plains dictating her simple but immutable laws impressing upon every species indelible characters dispensing her bounty with equity compensating evil with good giving to some strength and courage accompanied with hunger and voracity to others gentleness temperance and agility attended with restlessness and timidity and to all liberty uniform manners and ardour in love which is always easily gratified and always followed with a happy fecundity  love and liberty are the most inestimable gifts which nature has to bestow do these animals we call wild because they are not subject to our caprice require more to render them completely happy but they also enjoy a perfect equality they are neither the slaves nor the tyrants of each other the individual has no occasion like man to dread the rest of his species they have peace among themselves and war never approaches them but from strangers or from man they have therefore great reason to fly from the human race to conceal themselves from our observation to take up their abode in solitudes remote from the habitations of men to provide for their safety by all the resources afforded them by instinct and to withdraw themselves from the power of man using in every manner that liberty bestowed on them by nature at the same time that she has given them the desire of independence  some animals and they are the most gentle innocent and tranquil content themselves with retiring and passing their lives in our fields those which are more fierce and suspicious hide themselves in the deepest recesses of the forest others as if they knew there was no safety on the surface of the earth dig subterraneous abodes take refuge in caverns or gain the summits of the most inaccessible mountains lastly the most ferocious and formidable kinds inhabit only deserts and reign as monarchs in those burning climates where man equally savage as themselves is unable to conquer them  as all beings however free are subjected to physical laws and as the brute animals as well as man feel the influences of the heavens and the earth it appears that the same causes which have softened and civilized the human species in our climates have produced similar effects upon every other species the wolf which is perhaps the most ferocious animal in the temperate zone is not nearly so terrible or so cruel as the tiger the panther and the lion of the torrid zone or the white bear the lynx and the hyaena of the frozen zone this difference as if nature to give more harmony to her productions had adapted the climate to the species or the species to the climate is not only general but in each particular species the climate is formed for the manners and the manners for the climate  in america where the heat under the same latitudes is less and the air and earth softer than in africa the tiger the lion the panther have nothing formidable but the name they are no longer those tyrants of the forest those bold and intrepid enemies of man those rapacious monsters which perpetually thirst for blood and carnage these animals in america generally fly from man and attack not other wilds beasts with open force but lie in wait to surprise them they may even be subdued and almost tamed hence if ferociousness and cruelty were natural to them they must have degenerated or rather felt the influence of climate under a mild climate their nature has been softened every excess of temper has been moderated and those changes have only rendered them more conformable to the quality of the country they inhabit  the vegetables which cover the earth and are more closely connected with it than the animal that feeds upon them participate also more of the nature of the climate every country every degree of temperature has its peculiar plants at the foot of the alps we find the vegetables of france and italy and on their summit those of the northern regions we even meet with the same plants on the frozen ridges of the african mountains on the south side of the mountains which divide the mogul empire from the kingdom of cashmire we see all the indian plants and we are surprised to find on the opposite side nothing but the european kinds intemperate climates likewise produce drugs perfumes poisons and all vegetables whose qualities are highly exalted the productions of temperate climates on the contrary are always mild the softest and most wholesome herbs the sweetest fruits the gentlest animals and the most polished men are peculiar to those happy climates thus the earth produces plants the earth and plants make animals and the earth plants and animals give birth to man for the qualities of vegetables proceed immediately from the earth and the air the temperature and other relative qualities of herbivorous animals are derived from the plants upon which they feed and the physical qualities of man and other creatures which are nourished partly by flesh and partly by plants depend though more remotely on the same causes whose influence extends even to dispositions and manners figure and size which appear to be absolute and determined qualities depend however like the relative qualities upon the influence of climate and concur in proving that every thing is moderate in temperate regions the size of our largest quadrupeds have no proportion to that of the elephant the rhinoceros or hyppopotamus our largest birds are small when compared with the ostrich the condor or the cassawary and what comparison is there between the fishes the lizards and the serpents of our climates with the whale the walrus and manati which people the northern seas or the crocodiles the large lizards and the enormous serpents which infest the land and waters of the south and if we examine each species in different climates we shall find sensible varieties both in size and in figure see the history of the horse vol iii p  0  goat vol iii p  0  hog vol iii p  00 and dog vol iv p    these changes are produced in a slow and imperceptible manner time is the great workman of nature he moves with regular and uniform steps he performs no operation suddenly but by degrees or successive impressions nothing can resist his power and those changes which at first are imperceptible become gradually sensible and at last are marked by results too conspicuous to be misapprehended  wild and free animals without excepting man are of all animated beings least subject to changes or variations of any kind as they are at absolute liberty in the choice of their food and their climate their nature is more permanent than that of domestic animals which are enslaved transported maletreated and fed without consulting their inclination or taste wild animals live perpetually in the same manner they never wander from climate to climate the wood where they are brought forth is a country to which they are faithfully attached and they never depart from it unless they perceive that they can no longer live there in safety they fly not so much from their natural enemies as from the presence of man nature has furnished them with resources against the other animals and put them on a level they know their strength their address their designs their haunts and if unable to avoid them oppose force to force in a word they are species of the same genus but how can they defend themselves against a being who can seize without seeing and kill without approaching them  it is man therefore who disturbs and disperses wild animals and renders them a thousand more savage than they would naturally be for most of them require only tranquillity and a moderate use of the air and earth nature even teaches them to live together to unite into families and to form societies in countries not totally engrossed by man some vestiges of these societies still remain we there perceive common works carried on designs that though not founded on reason appear to be projected upon rational conventions the execution of which supposes union at least and a joint cooperation of labor it is not by force or physical necessity like the ants the bees etc that the beavers labor and build houses for they are neither constrained by space nor time nor number but unite from choice those which agree dwell together and those which do not agree remove and some of them have been remarked which being constantly repulsed by others were obliged to betake themselves to a solitary life it is only in distant and desert countries where they dread not the approach of man that they incline to render their dwellings more fixed and commodious by constructing houses or a kind of villages which have no small resemblance to the feeble and primitive efforts of a nascent republic in countries on the contrary spread over by men they carry terror along with them the society of animals is then at an end all industry ceases and every art is stifled they think no more of building and neglect every convenience perpetually pressed by fear and necessity their only desire is the bare preservation of life and their only occupation is flight and concealment if the human species as is reasonable to suppose shall in the progress of time people equally the whole surface of the earth the history of the beaver in a few ages will be regarded as a ridiculous fable  we may therefore conclude that the talents and faculties of animals instead of augmenting are perpetually diminishing time fights against them the more the human species multiplies and improves the more will the wild animals feel the effects of a terrible and absolute tyrant who hardly allowing them an individual existence deprives them of liberty of every associating principle and destroys the very rudiments of their intelligence what advances they have made or may still make conveys little information of what they have been or might acquire if the human species were annihilated to which of the animals would the scepter of the earth belong  the stag or red deer the deer kind have upright solid branched horns which annually fall off eight cutting teeth in the lower jaw and none in the upper the stag has long upright rounded and much branched horns the brow antlers are slender and sharp the color of the stag is generally a reddish brown with some black about the face and a black list runs down the hind part of the neck

seem to be destined to embellish and animate the solitudes of the forest and to occupy at a distance from man the tranquil retreats of those gardens of nature the elegance and lightness of his figure the commodiousness of his stature the flexibility and nervousness of his limbs his grandeur strength and swiftness and his head which is rather adorned than armed with living branches that like the leaves of trees are annually renewed sufficiently distinguish him from the other inhabitants of the wood as he is also the noblest of these animals he ministers to the pleasure and has occupied the leisure of the greatest heroes the exercise of the chase should always succeed or rather precede the fatigues of war to know the management of horses and arms are talents common to the warrior and the hunter to be accustomed to fatigue address dexterity and quickness of movement so necessary for the support of courage are qualities acquired in the chase and extremely useful in battle hunting is a most delightful school of a necessary art it is the only amusement which entirely divests us of care the only recreation that is not accompanied with effeminacy and gives vivacity and pleasure without languor or disgust  how can men who from their situation in life are perpetually harrassed with company be better employed than in hunting always surrounded with a multitude teased with the importunity of their demands obliged to give their attention to affairs which are foreign to them agitated by the solicitations of men of high rank and constrained and fettered in proportion to their elevation great men would feel only the weight of their own grandeur and exist only for others if they did not occasionally abstract themselves from a crowd of parasites and flatterers to preserve selfenjoyment to recall personal attachments and receive private friendship sentiments a thousand times more precious and interesting than all the ideas of grandeur retirement from the tumult and business of the world is sometimes necessary and what retirement can be more various and animated than the chase what exercise more useful to the body what amusement more agreeable to the mind  perpetual action or intercourse with man is equally painful as perpetual thinking nature never intended man for the contemplation of abstract subjects to be occupied without relaxation in difficult studies to lead a sedentary life and to make the closet the center of our existence is equally unnatural as to pass our days in tumult and agitation continually drawn along by the movements of other men and obliged to keep a jealous and constrained watch over our own conduct looks and gestures whatever ideas we may conceive of the dignity of human nature it is apparent that public exhibition is not existence and that we are less fitted for thinking than for action for reasoning than enjoyment true pleasure consists in the unrestrained use of ourselves our best gifts are those we receive from nature she presents us with the useful and inexhaustible enjoyments which arise from the air the earth the fields and the forests hence a taste for hunting fishing gardening and agriculture is natural to all men and in societies less complicated than ours there are only two ranks both of them connected with this mode of life the nobles whose business is arms and hunting and the vulgar who are occupied in cultivating the earth  in polished societies where every thing is improved and brought nearer perfection to render hunting more delightful and sprightly to ennoble this most beneficial and respectable of all exercises it has been formed into an art the chase of the stag requires a species of knowledge which can only be learned by experience it implies a royal assemblage of men horses and dogs all so trained practiced and disciplined that their movements their researches and their skill must concur in producing one common end the huntsman should know the age and the sex of the animal he should be able to distinguish with precision whether the stag he has harbored to harbor a stag is to go round the place in which he has taken refuge and to learn whether he has not escaped with his hound be a knobber knobber is a stag after he passes his first year till he arrives at the third  a young stag in the third fourth or fifth year of his age  in his sixth or seventh year or and old stag a stag is said to be old from eight years and upwards  the chief marks which convey this intelligence is derived from the foot foot is used for the impression made on the ground by the foot  and the excrement the foot of the stag is better formed than that of the hind or female her leg in the language of hunters leg means the two bones behind the foot which make an impression on the ground along with the foot is more gross and nearer the heel the impressions of his feet are rounder and farther removed from each other he moves more regularly and brings the hind foot into the impression made by the fore foot but the distance between the steps of the hind are shorter and her hind feet strike not so regularly the track of the fore feet as soon as the stag acquires his fourth horns he is easily distinguished but to know the foot of a young stag from that of a hind requires repeated experience stags of six seven etc years are still more easily known for their fore foot is much larger than the hind foot the older they are the sides of their feet are the more worn this mark is equivocal for the wearing of the hoof depends much on the plainness or roughness of the country which the animals frequent  the distance of their steps are more regular than those of young stags they always place their hind foot exactly in the track of the fore foot excepting when they shed their horns the old stags misplace to misplace is to put the hind foot out of the track of the fore foot  at this season nearly as often as the young ones but in this they are more regular than the hind or young stag placing the hind foot always at the side of the fore foot and never beyond or within it  when the huntsman from the dryness of the season or other circumstances cannot judge by the foot he is obliged to trace the animal backwards and endeavor to find his dung this mark requires perhaps greater experience than the knowledge of the foot but without it the huntsman would be unable to give a proper report to the company after the report of the huntsman and the dogs are led to the refuge of the stag he ought to encourage his hound and make him rest upon the track of the stag till the animal be unharboured instantly the alarm is given to uncouple the dogs which ought to be enlivened by the voice and the horn of the huntsman he should also diligently observe the foot of the stag in order to discover whether the animal has started and substituted another in his place but it is then the business of the hunters to separate also and to recall the dogs which have gone astray after false game the huntsman should always accompany his dogs and encourage without pressing them too hard he should assist them in detecting all the arts of escape used by the stag for this animal has remarkable address in deceiving the dogs with this view he often returns twice or thrice upon his former steps he endeavors to raise hinds or younger stags to accompany him and draw off the dogs from the object of their pursuit he then flies with redoubled speed or springs off at side lies down on his belly and conceals himself in this case when the dogs have lost his foot the huntsmen by going backwards and forwards assist them in recovering it but if they cannot find it they suppose that he is resting within the circuit they have made and go in quest of him but if they are still unable to discover him there is no other method left but from viewing the country to conjecture where he may have taken refuge and repair to the place as soon as they have recovered his foot and put the dogs upon the track they pursue with more advantage because they perceive that the stag is fatigued their ardour augments in proportion to his feebleness and their scent becomes more distinct as the animal grows warm hence they redouble their cries and their speed and though the stag practices still more arts of escape than formerly as his swiftness is diminished his arts and doublings become gradually less effectual he has now no other resource but to fly from the earth which he treads and get into the waters in order to cut off the scent from the dogs the huntsmen go round these waters and again put the dogs on the track of his foot the stag after taking to the water is incapable of running far and is soon at bay when a stag is worn out with fatigue he turns upon the hounds and is said to be at bay but he still attempts to defend his life and often wounds the dogs and even the huntsmen when too forward by blows with his horns till one of them cuts his hams to make him fall and then puts an end to his life by a blow of a hanger they now celebrate the death of the stag by a flourish of their horns the dogs are allowed to trample upon him and at last partake richly of the victory by devouring his flesh  every season is not equally proper for hunting the stag with hounds in spring when the leaves begin to unfold and to adorn the forests when the earth is covered with fresh herbage and flowers their perfumes diminish the sensation of the dogs and as the stag is then in his greatest vigor it is extremely difficult for them to come up with him it is likewise a settled point among hunters that when the hinds are about to bring forth the chase is most difficult and that at this period the dogs often quit a fatigued stag and pursue any hind which bounds before them in the same manner in the beginning of autumn when the rutting season commences the hounds hunt without ardour the strong odor of love renders perhaps the scent more uninteresting and perhaps at this season the odor of all stags is nearly the same during the winter snows it is also improper to hunt the stag because the hounds have no acuteness of scent and seem to pursue the foot rather by the eye than the nose as in this season the stags find not sufficient nourishment in their retreats they issue forth into the more open parts of the country and even into the sown fields they assemble in flocks in the month of december and when the frosts are severe they seek shelter on the seacoasts or in covered places where they lock themselves fast together and acquire warmth by mutual respiration when the rigours of winter decline they frequent the borders of the forest and make depredations on the rising wheat in spring they shed their horns which fall off spontaneously or by rubbing them gently against the branches of trees it is seldom that both horns fall off at the same time the one generally preceding the other a day or two the old stags cast their horns first which happens about the end of february or beginning of march an aged stag or one in his seventh year or upwards does not cast his horns before the middle of march a stag of six years sheds his horns in april young stags or those from three to five years old shed their horns in the beginning and those which are in their second year not till the middle or end of may but in all this there is much variety for old stags sometimes cast their horns sooner than those which are younger besides the shedding of the horns is advanced by a mild and retarded by a severe and long winter  as soon as the stags cast their horns they separate from each other the young ones only keeping together they no longer haunt the deepest recesses of the forest but advance into the cultivated country and remain among brushwood during the summer till their horns are renewed in this season they walk with their heads low to prevent their horns from rubbing against the branches for they continue to have sensibility till they acquire their full growth the horns of the oldest stags are not half completed in the middle of may and acquire their full length and hardness before the end of july those of the younger stags are proportionally later both in shedding and being renewed but as soon as they have acquired their full dimensions and solidity the stags rub them against the trees in order to clear them of a skin with which they are covered and as they continue this friction for several days successively it is said le nouveau traite de la venerie p     that the horns retain the color peculiar to the juices of the trees against which they have been rubbed that they become red when rubbed against beeches and birches brown against oaks and black against elms and trembling poplars it is likewise said that the horns of young stags which are smoother take not so deep a tincture from the trees as those of old stags which are rougher and closer covered with little prominences because it is those prominences which retain the colored juices of the trees but i cannot believe that this is the true cause for i have kept tamed stags in an enclosure where there was not a single tree and yet their horns were colored in the same manner as in those which inhabit the forests  soon after the stags have polished their horns they begin to feel the impressions of love toward the end of august or beginning of september they leave the coppice return to the forests and search for the hinds they cry with a loud voice their neck and throat swell they become perfectly restless and traverse in open day the fields and the fallow grounds they strike their horns against trees and hedges in a word they seem to be transported with fury and run from country to country till they find the hinds or females whom they pursue and compel into compliance for the female at first avoids and flies from the male and never submits to his embraces till she be fatigued with the pursuit the old hinds likewise come in season before the younger ones when two stags approach the same hind they must fight before they enjoy if nearly equal in strength they threaten paw the ground set up terrible cries and attack each other with such fury that they often inflict mortal wounds with the strokes of their horns the combat never terminates but in the defeat or flight of one of the rivals the conqueror loses not a moment in enjoying his victory unless another rival approaches whom he is again obliged to attack and repel the oldest stags are always masters of the field because they are stronger and more furious than the young ones who must wait patiently till their superiors tire and quit their mistresses sometimes however the young stags accomplish their purposes when the old ones are fighting and after a hasty gratification fly off the hinds prefer the old stags not because they are most courageous but because they are much more ardent they are likewise more inconstant having often several females at a time and when a stag has but one hind his attachment to her does not continue above a few days he then leaves her goes in quest of another with whom he remains a still shorter time and in this manner passes from one to another till he is perfectly exhausted  this ardour of love lasts only three weeks during which the stags take very little food and neither sleep nor rest night and day they are either walking running fighting or enjoying the hinds hence at the end of the rutting season they are so meagre and exhausted that they recover not their strength for a considerable time they generally retire to the borders of the forests feed upon the cultivated fields where they find plenty of nourishment and remain there till their strength is reestablished the rutting season of old stags commences about the beginning and ends about the  0th day of september in those of six or seven years old it begins about the  0th of september and concludes in the beginning of october in young stags or those in their third fourth or fifth year it begins about the  0th of september and terminates about the   th of october and at the end of october the rutting is all over excepting among the prickets or those which have entered into their second year because they like the young hinds are latest of coming into season hence at the beginning of november the season of love is entirely finished and the stags during this period of weakness and lassitude are easily hunted down in seasons when acorns and other nuts are plentiful the stags soon recover their strength and a second rutting frequently happens at the end of october but it is of much shorter duration than the first  in climates warmer than that of france the rutting time like the seasons is more forward aristotle informs us aristot hist animal lib   c     that in greece it commences in the beginning of august and terminates about the end of september the hinds go with young eight months and some days and seldom produce more than one fawn they bring forth in may or the beginning of june and so anxiously conceal their fawns that they often expose themselves to be chaced with a view to draw off the dogs and afterward return to take care of their young all hinds are not fertile for some of them never conceive these barren hinds are grosser and fatter than those which are prolific and also come soonest in season some hinds are said to have horns like the stag which is not altogether improbable the young are not called fawns or calves after the sixth month the knobs of their horns then begin to appear and they take the name of knobbers till their horns lengthen into spears and then they are called brocks or staggards during the first season they never leave their mothers in winter the stags and hinds of all ages keep together in flocks which are always more numerous in proportion to the rigor of the season they separate in spring the hinds retire to bring forth and during this period the flocks consist only of knobbers and young stags in general the stags are inclined to associate and nothing but fear or necessity obliges them to disperse the stag is capable of generating at the age of eighteen months those brought forth during the spring of the preceding year cover the hinds in autumn and it is presumeable that these embraces are prolific the following circumstances however may render this opinion doubtful the stags have not then acquired above a half or two thirds of their growth which is not completed till the eighth year of their age and their horns continue to increase during the same period but it ought to be remarked that the fawn soon gathers strength that during the first and even the second year his growth is very quick and that he has already a redundance of nourishment because his horns are considerably long which is the most certain mark of ability to impregnate it is allowed that animals in general are not capable of procreating till they have nearly acquired their full growth but those which have fixed seasons for rutting or spawning seem not to observe this law fishes spawn and are prolific before they have attained a fourth or even an eighth part of their growth and among quadrupeds those which like the deerhind have determined seasons for rutting procreate earlier than other animals  there are so many relations between the nutrition the production of the horns the rutting and the generation of these animals that to have a clear conception of the particular effects which result from them it is necessary to give a general recapitulation of what i formerly advanced on the subject of reproduction see above vol ii chap        generation depends solely on a redundance of nourishment during the growth of an animal which is always most rapid in infancy the nourishment is entirely exhausted in the extension and developement of the body hence there is no redundance consequently no production or secretion of seminal fluid and of course young animals are incapable of procreation but when they have attained the greatest part of their growth the redundance of nourishment begins to manifest itself by new productions in man the beard the hair the prominency of the breasts and the expansion of the organs of generation appear at the age of puberty in the brute creation and particularly in the stag this redundance produces effects still more remarkable as the growth of the horns the swelling of the testicles the turgidity of the neck and throat the fat the rutting etc and as the growth of the stag is at first very rapid only a year passes before the redundance of nourishment begins to show itself by the production of horns if brought forth in may the rudiments of the horns appear in the same month of the following year and they continue to lengthen and acquire solidity in proportion to the quantity of nourishment taken by the animal about the end of august they are fully grown and so dense and insensible that the animal rubs them against the trees in order to deprive them of the skin or scurf with which they are covered at the same time the fat which is likewise produced by the redundance of nourishment ceases to accumulate and begins to be determined toward the organs of generation and to excite in the stag that ardour of desire which renders him perfectly furious that the production of horns and the secretion of semen depend on the same cause is evident from this fact that when the organs necessary for the secretion of semen are destroyed by castration the production of the horns is likewise prevented for if this operation is performed after the horns are shed they are never renewed and if on the contrary it is done when the horns are perfect they never fall off in a word after castration the animal remains during life in the same condition it was before that operation as it feels no longer the ardour of rutting the concomitant symptoms likewise disappear there is no longer any accumulation of fat or suet no more turgidity of the neck and throat and the disposition of the creature becomes more gentle and tranquil the parts cut off therefore were necessary not only for collecting the redundant nourishment but likewise for pushing it to the surface of the body in the form of fat and particularly to the top of the head where it gives rise to the horns and for giving vigor and spirit to the animal castrated stags it is true become fat but they produce no horns their neck and throat never swell and their fat is never so highly exalted as that of entire stags which in the rutting season have an odor so strong as to be perceived at a great distance and their flesh is so infected with it that it is uneatable offensive to the smell and putrifies in a very short time while that of the castrated stag may be preserved fresh and eat at all seasons the difference between the horns of stags of the same age of which some are thick and others thin and slender which is solely owing to a defect of food is another proof that the horns are produced by redundant nourishment for a stag which inhabits a rich country where he is not disturbed by dogs or men but is allowed to feed and ruminate in peace will always have the highest widest largest and most branchy horns but those which live in situations where they can neither find repose nor a sufficient quantity of food will have horns with few branches slender stems and browantlers thus it is easy to judge by the horns of the stag whether he has lived in a rich and peaceful country or the opposite those which are in bad condition have been wounded or much disturbed by hunting are seldom fat or have fine horns their rutting time is also later and their horns are neither so soon shed or renewed hence every circumstance concurs in demonstrating that the horns like the seminal fluid are nothing but the redundant and superfluous organic nourishment which could not be exhausted in expanding and supporting the animal body  it is therefore apparent that penury of food both retards the growth and diminishes the size of the horns and perhaps it is not impossible by retrenching the quantity of food to suppress entirely this production without having recourse to castration it is however certain that castrated stags eat less food than those which are unmutilated and the females of this species as well as those of the fallowdeer the roe and the elk have no horns because they eat less than the males and because at the very time that a redundance of nourishment would naturally happen they are with young and instead of showing itself externally it is first exhausted in nourishing the foetus and afterward in nourishing the fawn the objection that the female raindeer which has horns like the male rather supports than weakens this argument for of all horned animals the raindeer in proportion to his size has the largest and most voluminous horns often extending before and behind the whole length of the body he likewise abounds most in fat la veneric de du foilloux p     and besides the horns of the female are much smaller than those of the male this example therefore proves no more than that when the redundance is so great as not to be exhausted by gestation and the growth of the foetus it breaks through the body and forms a new production as in the male only smaller in size because the quantity of redundant matter is less  what i have remarked concerning nourishment ought not to be extended to the mass or volume of the aliments but only to the quantity of organic particles that living active and prolific matter which unfolds and supports all animated beings the rest is nothing but dregs which may be more or less in quantity without inducing any change upon the body and as the lichen rangiferinus or raindeer liverwort is the ordinary food of the raindeer and is more substantial than the leaves the bark or the buds of trees it is not surprising that this animal should have a greater redundance of organic particles and consequently larger horns and more fat than the common stag it must be acknowledged however that the organic matter which produces the horns is not perfectly disengaged from useless particles and that it preserves after passing the body of the animal marks of its former vegetable state the horns of the stag shoot grow and are disposed like the branches of a tree its substance is perhaps less osseous than lignous to use the expression it is a vegetable grafted upon an animal participating of the nature of both and forming one of those shades by which nature always bounds the extremities of her productions and which she employs to connect substances that are greatly removed from each other  in the animal as formerly remarked see above vol ii art of old age and death  both extremities of the bones grow at a time the fulcrum upon which the extending power is exerted is in the middle of the bone which part is always first ossified and from which the two extremes progressively recede and continue soft till the bone acquires its full length in the vegetable on the contrary only one extremity of the wood grows the bud which unfolds to form a branch is attached to the old wood by its inferior extremity and upon this fulcrum the power of longitudinal extension acts this remarkable difference between the vegetation of bones and the solid parts of plants does not take place in the horns of stags on the contrary nothing can be more similar to the growth of a tree the horns extend at one extremity only the other serving for a fulcrum they are first tender as an herb and then harden like wood the skin which covers and grows along with them is their bark and it is rubbed off after they attain their full size as long as they continue to grow their extremities are soft and they likewise divide into several branches in a word every circumstance is similar and corresponds in the developement of both hence the organic particles which constitute the living substance of the stag still retain the impression of the vegetable because they arrange themselves in the same order as the parts of plants here it is apparent that matter has an influence upon form the stag which inhabits the forest and feeds only on the sprigs of trees takes so strong an impression from the wood that he produces a species of tree which preserves indelible and evident marks of its origin this effect though singular is not solitary and depends on a general cause which i have already pointed out  both in animals and vegetables the character or mould of each species is the most constant and unalterable thing in nature what is most variable and desultory is the matter of which they are composed matter in general seems to be indifferent to all forms and capable of receiving every possible impression the organic or living particles of this matter pass from vegetables to animals without destruction or alteration and form equally the living substance of the herb of the wood of the flesh and of the bones according to this view it appears that matter can never have any influence on form and that no kind of food provided the animal can extract the organic particles and assimilate them by nutrition could induce any change upon the form or have any other effect than to support and expand the body by modelling itself upon all the particles of the interior mould and intimately penetrating them what proves this point is that animals which live upon herbage a substance very different from that of their own bodies extract from it materials sufficient for the production of flesh and blood and that they are nourished and grow as well as animals who feed upon flesh alone however by examining nature more minutely we shall find that these organic particles sometimes do not perfectly assimilate themselves to the internal mould and that matter has often a sensible influence upon form size for example which is one of the attributes of form varies in every species according to the difference of climate the quality and quantity of flesh two other attributes of form change according to the difference of food this organic matter therefore which the animal assimilates to its own body by nutrition is not absolutely indifferent to the reception of every form nor deprived of the original figure which it possessed it retains some characters of its primitive state it acts therefore by its proper form upon that of the organized body to which it affords nourishment and though this action is almost imperceptible and infinitely inferior to the power which obliges the organic particles to assimilate themselves to the internal mould that receives them yet in the progress of time sensible effects must result from it the stag who inhabits the forests and lives solely upon wood produces and carries about with him a species of trees which is nothing but the redundant part of his nourishment the beaver who lives in the waters and feeds upon fishes has a tail covered with scales the flesh of the otter and of most water fowls is a lent diet a kind of fishy flesh we may therefore presume that animals perpetually nourished by the same food however strong the original impression of nature would in process of time acquire a tincture from the qualities of this food and undergo a kind of transformation by an assimilation contrary to the first the nourishment would no longer assimilate itself entirely to the form of the animal but the animal would partly assimilate itself to the form of the nourishment as we perceive in the horns of the stag and the tail of the beaver  in the stag the horns are an accessory a part foreign to the animal and only regarded as belonging to him because it proceeds from his body but it is really a vegetable production since it retains the characters of that vegetable from which it derives its origin and resembles the wood of trees in the manner of its growth ramification solidity drying and separation for after acquiring its greatest density it ceases to extract nourishment it falls spontaneously like a ripe fruit from the branch the very name given to this production in our language is an indication that it has been regarded as wood the french call the horns of a stag his wood  and not as a horn a bone a tusk etc and though this theory seems to be sufficiently established by the preceding reasoning yet i ought not to pass over a fact recorded by the ancients aristotle captus jam cervus est hederam suis enatam cornibus gerens viridem quae cornu adhuc tenello forte inserta quasi ligno viridi coaluerit arist hist animal l ix c    theophrastus hedera in multis creatur et quod mirabilius visa est in cornibus cervi etiam aliquando commovit inquit jul scaliger apud theophrastum virum accuratum cervi cornibus haerens hedera quid enim eo seminium detulit etc lib ii de cause plant cap     and pliny in mollioribus cervorum cornibus hedera coalescit dum ex arborum attritu illa experiuntur plin de admirand auditionibus  tell us that ivy has been seen growing round the young horns of stags if this fact be true and it may easily be determined by experiment an analogy still more intimate will be established between the wood of the stag and that of trees  the horns and tusks of other animals are not only different from the wood of the stag but in their growth texture and form both external and internal there is nothing analogous to wood the nails the claws the hairs the feathers the scales of animals grow it is admitted by a species of vegetation but this vegetation differs widely from that of wood the horns of oxen goats antelopes etc are hollow within but the wood of the stag is equally solid through its whole extent the substance of these horns is the same with that of the nails claws and scales but the horns of the stag resemble wood more than any other substance the inside of all hollow horns is covered with a kind of periosteum and they contain in their cavity a bone or core which supports them they never shed but grow during the life of the animal and its age may be learned by their rings or annual circles instead of growing by their superior extremity like the wood of the stag they grow like nails feathers and hairs by their inferior extremity in the same manner the tusks of the elephant walrus and wild boar and all other animals are hollow within and grow only by their inferior extremity thus horns and tusks have no more analogy to the wood of the stag than nails hairs or feathers  vegetation may therefore be reduced to three kinds the first in which the growth proceeds from the superior extremity as in plants trees and the wood of the stag the second where the growth advances from the inferior extremity as in horns nails claws hairs feathers scales tusks teeth and other external parts of animal bodies the third in which the growth proceeds from both extremities at the same time as in bones cartilages muscles tendons and other internal parts of animals the material cause of all these three species is the redundance of organic nourishment and the assimilation of this nourishment by the internal mould which receives it is the effect thus the growth of an animal is always more or less rapid in proportion to the quantity of this redundant nourishment and after the greatest part of growth is acquired it is determined to the seminal reservoirs endeavors to escape from the body and to produce by means of copulation new organized beings the difference between animals which like the stag have fixed seasons and other animals which can engender at all times proceeds entirely from their manner of feeding man and domestic animals who have daily an equal quantity of food and often too much are perpetually in a capacity for procreation the stag on the contrary and most wild animals who suffer greatly in the winter for want of food have then nothing redundant and are incapable of generating till they recruit during the summer it is immediately after this season that the stag begins to rut and by the great waste he suffers at this period he continues during winter in a state of languor and debility his flesh is then so meagre and his blood so impoverished that worms breed under his skin which still augment his misery and he does not get quit of them till the spring when he acquires new life and vigor by the active nourishment furnished to him by the fresh productions of the earth  thus the life of the stag is spent in alternate plenty and want vigor and debility health and sickness without having any change introduced into his constitution by these opposite extremes he lives as long as other animals which are not subjected to such vicissitudes as he grows five or six years he lives seven times that number or from    to  0 years nouveau traite de la venerie p      what has been reported concerning the longevity of the stag merits no credit it is only a popular prejudice which prevailed in the days of aristotle and which that philosopher considered as improbable because neither the time of gestation nor of the growth of the young stag indicated long life vita esse perquam longa hoc animal fertur sed nihil certi ex  quae narrantur videmus nec gestatio aut incrementum hinnulli ita evenit quasi vita esset praelonga arist hist animal lib vi c     this authority ought to have abolished the prejudice but it has been renewed in the ages of ignorance by a fabulous account of a stag taken by charles vi in the forest of senlis with a collar upon which was written this inscription caesar hoc me donavit the love of the mavelous inclined men to believe that this animal had lived a thousand years and had his collar from a roman emperor rather than to suppose that he came from germany where all the emperors take the name of caesar  the horns of the stag augment annually both in height and thickness from the second to the eighth year and continue nearly in equal beauty during all the vigor of life but when he grows old his horns decline our stags have seldom more than twenty or twentytwo antlers or palms and this number even when at the highest pitch of vigor and perfection is by no means constant for it varies every year according to the quantity of nourishment and repose the animal has enjoyed the largeness of the horns depends on the same cause and their quality is also determined by the kind of nourishment they receive like the wood of the forest the wood of the stag is large tender and light in moist and fertile countries and short hard and heavy in dry and barren regions  the size and stature of the animals themselves likewise differ according to the places they inhabit the stags which frequent the valleys or hills abounding in grain are larger and taller than those which feed upon dry and rocky mountains the latter are low thick and short neither are they equally swift but they run longer than the former they are also more vicious and have longer hair on their heads their horns are commonly short and black like a stunted tree the bark of which is always of a darker color but the horns of the stags which feed in the plains are high and of a clear reddish color like the wood and bark of trees which grow in a good soil these little squat stags never frequent the lofty woods but keep always among the coppices where they can more easily elude the pursuit of the dogs the corsican appears to be the smallest of these mountainstags he exceeds not the half of the height of the ordinary kind and may be regarded as a terrier among stags his color is brown his body is squat and his legs are short and what convinces me that the size and stature of stags in general depend on the quantity and quality of their food is that having reared one at my house and fed him very plentifully for four years he was much taller thicker and plumper at that age than the oldest stags in my woods which are however of a very good size  yellow is the most common color of the stag but many of them are brown and others red white stags are more rare and seem to be a race that has become domestic but very anciently for both aristotle and pliny mention white stags and they appear then to have been equally uncommon as at present the color of the horns like that of the hair depends on the age and nature of the animal and the impression of the air the horns of young stags are whitish and less deeply colored than those of the old stags whose color is a clear diluted yellow have often pale illcoloured horns those which are of a lively yellow have generally red horns and brown stags especially those which have black hair on the neck have likewise black horns the internal substance of the horns it is true is almost equally white in all stags but they differ greatly in solidity and texture some of them are very spongy and even contain pretty large cavities this difference in texture is sufficient to account for their assuming different colors and it is unnecessary to have recourse to the juices of trees since we daily see the whitest ivory turn yellow or brown after being exposed to the air though its texture be much more compact than that of the stags horns  the stag appears to have a fine eye an acute smell and an excellent ear when listening he raises his head erects his ears and hears from a great distance when he is going into a coppice or other half covered place he stops to look round him on all sides and scents the wind to discover if any object is near that might disturb him he is a simple and yet a curious and crafty animal when hissed or called to from a distance he stops short and looks steadfastly and with a kind of admiration at carriages cattle or men and if they have neither arms nor dogs he moves on unconcernedly and without flying he appears to listen with great tranquillity and delight to the shepherds pipe and the hunters sometimes employ this artifice to encourage and deceive him in general he is less afraid of men than of dogs and is never suspicious or uses any arts of concealment but in proportion to the disturbances he has received he eats slow and has a choice in his aliment and after his stomach is full he lies down and ruminates at leisure he seems to ruminate with less facility than the ox it is only by violent shakes that the stag can make the food rise from his first stomach this difficulty proceeds from the length and direction of the passage through which the aliment has to go the neck of the ox is short and straight but that of the stag is long and arched and therefore greater efforts are necessary to raise the food these efforts are made by a kind of hiccup the movement of which is apparent and continues during the time of rumination his voice is stronger and more quivering in proportion as he advances in years the voice of the hind is shorter and more feeble she never bellows from love but from fear the stag during the rutting season bellows in a frightful manner he is then so transported that nothing disturbs or terrifies him he is therefore easily surprised as he is loaded with fat he cannot keep long before the dogs but he is dangerous when at bay and attacks the dogs with a species of fury he drinks none in winter nor in spring the dews and tender herbage being then sufficient to extinguish his thirst but during the parching heats of summer to obtain drink he frequents the brooks the marshes and the fountains and in the season of love he is so overheated that he searches every where for water not only to satisfy his immoderate thirst but to bathe and refresh his body he then swims easier than at any other times on account of his fatness he has been observed crossing very large rivers it has even been alleged that attracted by the odor of the hinds the stags in the rutting season throw themselves into the sea and pass from one island to another at the distance of several leagues they leap still more nimbly than they swim for when pursued they easily clear a hedge or a pale fence of six feet high their food varies in different seasons in autumn after rutting they search for the buds of green shrubs the flowers of broom or heath the leaves of brambles etc during the snows of winter they feed upon the bark moss etc of trees and in mild weather they brouze in the wheatfields in the beginning of spring they go in quest of the catkins of the trembling poplar willow and hazel trees the flowers and buds of the corneltree etc in summer when they have great choice they prefer rye to all other grain and the black berrybearing alder rhamnus frangula linn to all other wood the flesh of the fawn is very good that of the hind and knobber not absolutely bad but that of the stag has always a strong and disagreeable taste the skin and the horns are the most useful parts of this animal the skin makes a pliable and very durable leather the horns are used by cutlers swordslippers etc and a volatile spirit much employed in medicine is extracted from them by the chemists  supplement it is well known that in many animals as cats owls etc the pupil of the eye contracts prodigiously in the light and dilates in the dark but this great contraction and dilatation had never been observed in the eyes of the stag i received from m beccaria a learned physician and celebrated professor at pisa the following letter dated at turin october          i presented a piece of bread says m beccaria to a stag that was confined in an obscure apartment to allure him to a window that i might admire at leisure the rectangular and transverse form of his pupils which in a strong light exceed not half a line in width by about five lines in length in a fainter light their breadth enlarges to more than a line and a half but still preserve their rectangular figure and in passing from light to darkness they dilate about four lines but always transversely that is horizontally and preserving their rectangular form these facts may be easily ascertained by laying the hand upon the eye of a stag for whenever the eye is uncovered the pupil will be seen dilated above four lines  from this fact m beccaria concludes with probability that the other species of deer enjoy the same power of contracting and dilating their pupils but what is most remarkable the pupils of cats owls and several other animals contract and dilate vertically while that of the stag contracts and dilates horizontally  to the history of the stag i must add a fact communicated to me by m le marquis damezaga who to much learning has joined great experience in the chase  stags he remarks shed their horns sooner or later in the month of march in proportion to their ages at the end of june the horns of the old stag are long and begin to itch him it is at this time also that the stags begin to rub off the skin which covers their horns at the commencement of august their horns begin to assume that consistence which they retain during the rest of the year on the   th of october the attendants of the prince of conde pursued a stag of six years old this was the rutting season when the stags are much less vigorous but we were surprised to find the animal fly at a great rate and lead near fix leagues from his harbor  when this stag was seized we found that his horns were white and sprinkled with blood as they ought to be at the time they are rubbed against the trees and that they had still rags of the skin which covers them during the time of their growth his horns were diversified with many branches all the hunters who were in at the death expressed their surprise at these appearances but their astonishment was augmented when they wanted to remove his testicles for none were to be found in the scrotum but after opening the body two testicles were discovered in the abdomen about the size of filberds and we clearly perceived that he had never experienced the effects of the rut it is well known that during the months of june july and august the stags are prodigioustly loaded with fat which is generally so entirely exhausted about the middle of september that nothing but the muscular flesh remains but this stag had lost none of his fat because he was never in a condition for rutting he had still another singularity for in the right foot he wanted the middle bone which in the left was half an inch long and as large and pointed as a toothpick  it is well known that a stag castrated when he has no horns never afterward acquires them and that if the operation is performed when his horns are in perfection they remain in the same state during life hence it appears that the very minute organs of generation above described were sufficient to produce the annual change of horns but that nature has always proceeded slowly in the conformation of this animal for we could discover no marks of any accident which could induce us to believe that the order of nature had been deranged it is therefore reasonable to suppose that this retardation proceeded from the imbecility of the organs of generation which however were sufficient to produce the fall and renewal of the horns since the cabbage or burs demonstrated that at the time this stag was killed he had had horns annually from the second to the sixth year  these observations of the marquis damezaga seem to prove in a still stronger manner than any thing formerly remarked that the fall and renovation of the stags horns depend entirely on the presence of the testicles and partly on their being more or less perfect for in the instance before us the testicles being imperfect and too small the horns for that reason in their growth shedding and renewal were much later than in other stags  pontoppidan when speaking of the norwegian stags remarks that they are only found in the dioceses of bergen and drontheim that they sometimes swim in flocks across the straits between the continent and the neighboring islands resting their heads upon each others crupper and that when the chief of the file is fatigued he retires behind to repose himself and the most vigorous occupies his place pontoppidans not hist of norway   it has been thought that the stags of our forests might by treating them with care and gentleness as the laplanders manage the raindeer be rendered domestic upon this subject m le vicomte de querhoent has communicated to me the following fact stags were first brought to the isle of france by the portuguese they are small and of a greyer color than those of europe from whom however they derived their origin when the french took possession of this island they found great numbers of those stags of which they destroyed a part and the remainder took refuge in the most retired places they are now rendered domestic and some of the inhabitants keep large flocks of them  i have seen at lecole veterinaire a small kind of stag which was said to have been brought from the cape of good hope its skin was interspersed with white spots like that of the axis it was called the hogstag because its legs were thicker and it had not the same agility of body as the common kind the figure of it is represented in the plate its length from the muzzle to the extremity of the body was only three feet four inches and a half the legs were short

similarity be great in every respect they fly from each other never intermix and of course give rise to no intermediate race it is even rare to find fallow deer in a country much frequented by stags unless they are industriously transported into it their nature seems to be less rustic and robust than that of the stag and they are likewise less common in the forests they are kept in parks where they may be said to be half domestic more of them are reared in england than in any other country of europe and the english are extremely fond of their venison the dogs also prefer the flesh of this deer to that of all other animals and after they have once eat of it they are extremely apt in the chase of the stag or roe deer to change their course when they perceive the scent of the fallow deer in some provinces of france and in the neighborhood of paris there are fallow deer as also in spain and germany those of america were probably transported from europe it seems to be an animal peculiar to the temperate climates for there are none in russia and they are seldom met with in sweden or other northern countries linn faun suec   the stags are more generally diffused over europe they are even found in norway and all the northern regions lapland perhaps excepted they are also frequent in asia especially in tartary description de linde par marc paul live   p    lettres edifiantes

par charlevoix tom    p     differ from ours only in the length of their horns and the direction of their antlers see the figure of the canadian stag in lhist des animaux par m perrault  which is sometimes not straight as in the common stag but turned backward so that the end of each points to the stem of the horns but this form of the horns is not absolutely peculiar to the stag of canada for we find similar horns engraven in la venerie de du fouilloux la venerie de jacques du fouilloux p     and those of the corsican stag have straight antlers which is a sufficient proof that the canadian stag is only a variety to which stags of all countries are subject there are likewise horns which have a number of antlers on their summits in form of a crown these are rarely found in france but says du fouilloux ibid p  0  they come from russia and germany this is only another variety and not a different species from the common kind hence in canada as well as in france most stags have straight antlers but in the former they are larger and thicker because they find in these uninhabited regions more nourishment and repose than in populous countries there are large and small stags in america as well as in europe but however generally this species is diffused it seems to be limited to cold and temperate climates the stags of mexico and south america those of cayenne those called gange stags mentioned in m perraults memoirs under the name of sardinian hinds those denominated cape stags and those of guiney and other warm countries belong not to the common species as will appear when the particular history of each is given  as the fallow deer is less savage more delicate and approaches nearer to the domestic state than the stag he is also subject to a greater number of varieties besides the common and the white fallow deer there are several other varieties as those of spain which are nearly as large as the stag but their neck is not so thick and their color is darker with a blackish tail not white below and longer than that of the common kind those of virginia which are almost as large as those of spain and remarkable for the great size of their genital organs others have a compressed forehead ears and tail longer than those of the common fallow deer and marked with a white spot upon the hoofs of the hind feet others are spotted with white black and yellow and others are entirely black all these have their horns flatter broader and better garnished with antlers than those of the stag they likewise incline more inwardly and are more palmated at the points and when the horns are very strong the largest antlers are sometimes terminated by small plams the tail of the common fallow deer is longer than that of the stag and its hair is brighter the horns of the fallow deer shed like those of the stag but they fall off later and are renewed nearly at the same time their rutting season arrives fifteen days or three weeks after that of the stag the males then bellow frequently but with a low and interrupted voice they are not so furious as the stag nor exhaust themselves by rutting they never depart from their own country in quest of females but they dispute and fight for the possession of their mistresses they associate in herds which almost always keep together when there is a great number in one park they generally form themselves into two distinct troops which soon become hostile because they both wish to occupy the same part of the enclosure each of these troops has its own chief who marches foremost and he is always the oldest and strongest of the flock the others follow him and the whole draw up in order of battle to force the other troop from the best pasture the order with which these combats are conducted is very singular they make regular attacks fight with courage mutually support each other and never think themselves vanquished by a single check for the battle is daily renewed till the weaker are completely defeated and obliged to remain in the worst pasture they love elvated and hilly countries when chaced they run not out like the stag but double and endeavor to conceal themselves from the dogs by artifice and by substituting another animal in their place however when fatigued and heated they take the water but never attempt to cross such extensive rivers as the stag thus between the chase of the fallow deer and stag there is no material difference their knowledge and instincts their shifts and doublings are the same only they are more frequently practiced by the fallow deer as he is less enterprising and runs not so far before the dogs he has oftener occasion to change or substitute another in his place to double return upon his former tracts etc which renders the hunting of the fallow deer more subject to inconveniences than that of the stag besides as he is smaller and lighter the impressions of his feet upon the ground are slighter and the branches he knocks off from the trees with his horns are smaller hence the dogs are less apt to observe the change or substitution of another animal and it is more difficult to bring them into the scent when at fault  the fallow deer is very easily tamed and eats many substances which are rejected by the stag he likewise preserves his fat or venison much better for he is not rendered meagre by rutting though followed by the longest and severest winters and he is nearly in the same condition during the whole year he brouzes closer than the stag which makes the trees or bushes cut by him more difficult to shoot than those cut by the stag the young fallow deer eat quicker and with more avidity than the old they ruminate plate live fallow deer plate lv female fallow deer they search for the females in their second year and attach not themselves to one like the roe buck but love variety like the stag the female goes with young eight months and some days like the hind she produces one sometimes two and very rarely three fawns they are capable of engendering and producing from the age of two to that of fifteen or sixteen years lastly the fallow deer resemble the stag in almost all their natural dispositions and habits the greatest difference between these two animals consists in the duration of their lives we formerly remarked from the testimony of huntsmen that the stag lives thirtyfive or forty years and from the same authority we learn that the fallow deer live only about twenty years as they are smaller it is probable that their growth is sooner accomplished than that of the stag because in all animals the duration of life is proportioned to the time of growing and not to the time of gestation for here the time of gestation is the same besides in other species as that of the ox though the time of gestation be long the duration of life is short of course we ought not to measure the duration of life by the time of gestation but by that of the growth reckoning from birth nearly to the full expansion of the body for a few supplementary remarks on the fallow deer see the article axis   the roe deer the roe deer has strong upright rugged and trifurcated horns from six to eight inches long the length from nose to tail is three feet nine inches the height before it two feet three inches behind two feet seven inches the length of the tail is only one inch the weight of a full grown buck is near  0 lb the hair in summer is very short and smooth the ends of the hairs are of a deep red color and the bottoms of a dark gray in winter the hairs are very long and hoary at the tips except on the back where they are often very dark the legs are slender and below the first joint of the hind legs there is a tuft of long hair the rump and under side of the tail are white pennant

occupies the deepest shades of the forest and the most elevated ridges of those mountains which are covered with lofty trees the roe deer as if inferior in species contents himself with a humbler residence and generally dwells among the thick foliage of young brushwood but if he is inferior to the stag in dignity strength and stature he is endowed with more gracefulness vivacity and courage when the fawns of the roe deer are attacked he defends them with courage and though smaller he has strength enough to combat a young stag and put him to flight nouv traile de la venerie p      he is superior in gaiety neatness and sprightliness his figure is more elegant and handsome his eyes are more brilliant and animated his limbs are more nimble his movements quicker and he bounds seemingly without effort with equal vigor and agility his coat or hair is always clean smooth and glossy he never wallows in the mire like the stag he delights in dry and elevated situations where the air is purest he is likewise more crafty conceals himself with greater address is more difficult to trace and derives superior resources from instinct for though he has the misfortune to leave behind him a stronger scent than the stag which redoubles the ardour and appetite of the dogs he knows how to withdraw himself from their pursuit by the rapidity with which he begins his flight and by his numerous doublings he delays not his arts of defense till his strength fails him but as soon as he finds that the first efforts of a rapid chase have been unsuccessful he repeatedly returns on his former steps and after confounding by these opposite movements the direction he has taken after intermixing the present with the past emanations from his body he rises from the earth by a great bound and retiring to a side he lies down flat on his belly and in this immovable situation he allows the whole troop of his deceived enemies to pass very near him  the roe deer differs from the stag and fallow deer in disposition temperament manners and almost every natural habit instead of associating in herds they live in separate families the father mother and young go together and never mix with strangers they are constant in their amors and never unfaithful like the stag as the females generally produce two fawns the one male and the other female these young animals brought up and nourished together acquire so strong a mutual affection that they never quit each other unless one of them meets with a misfortune which never ought to separate lovers this attachment is more than love for though always together they feel the ardour of the rut but once a year and it continues only fifteen days commencing at the end of october and ending before the fifteenth day of november they are not then like the stag overloaded with fat they have no strong smell no fury in a word nothing that can change the state of their bodies during this period they indeed suffer not their fawns to remain with them the father drives them off as if he meant to oblige them to yield their place to those which are to succeed and to form new families for themselves however after the rutting season is past the fawns return to their mother and remain with her some time after which they separate forever and remove to a distance from the place which gave them birth  the female goes with young five months and a half and brings forth about the end of april or beginning of may the hinds as formerly remarked go with young above eight months and this difference alone is sufficient to prove that these animals are so remote from each other in species as to prevent their ever intermixing or producing an intermediate race by this difference as well as that of figure and size they approach the goat as much as they recede from the stag for the goat goes with young nearly the same time and the roe deer may be regarded as a wild goat which feeding solely on wood carries wood instead of horns the female when about to bring forth separates from the male to avoid the wolf who is her most dangerous enemy she conceals herself in the deepest recesses of the forest in ten or twelve days the fawns acquire strength sufficient to enable them to follow her when threatened with danger she hides them in a close thicket and to preserve them presents herself to be chaced but notwithstanding all her care and anxiety the young are sometimes carried off by men dogs or wolves this is indeed the time of their greatest destruction of this species which is not very numerous i know from experience that more are destroyed in the month of may than during all the rest of the year i often live in a part of the country at montbard in burgundy where roe deer are greatly esteemed many fawns are annually brought me alive by men and others killed by dogs without reckoning those which are devoured by wolves and i have observed during the space of more than twentyfive years that as if there were a perfect equilibrium between the causes of destruction and renovation their number is always nearly equal in the same districts it is not difficult to count them for they are no where numerous and they live separately in distinct families in a coppice for example of  00 acres there will be one family or from three to five individuals for a female which generally produces two fawns sometimes brings forth but one and sometimes though very seldom three in another district of double the extent there will be seven or eight that is two families and i have remarked that each district always harbors an equal number excepting when the winters have been extremely rigorous and long in this case the whole family is destroyed but it is replaced by another the following year and those districts for which they have a predilection are always inhabited nearly by an equal number it is alleged however that in general their number is diminishing there are whole provinces it must be acknowledged of france where not one of them is to be found though common in scotland they are not very common in scotland for they exist no where but in what is called the highlands or northern mountains of scotland  there are none in england they are very rare in italy and they are now scarcer in sweden than formerly etc but this effect may have proceeded from the diminution of forests or from some very severe winter like that of the year   0  which almost destroyed the whole roe deer of burgundy so that several years passed before the species was recruited besides they are not equally fond of every country for in the same countries they prefer particular places they love hills or plains on the tops of mountains they never stay in the deepest recesses of the forests nor in the middle of extensive woods but give the preference to the skirts or projections of woods which are surrounded with cultivated sields and to open coppices which produce the berrybearing alder brambles etc  the fawns continue with their parents eight or nine months and when separated about the end of the first years of their age their first horns begin to appear in the form of two knobs much less than those of the stag there is still a greater difference between these two animals the horns of the stag shed in the spring and are renewed in summer but those of the roe deer fall off at the end of autumn and are replaced in winter several causes concur in producing these different effects in summer the stag takes a great deal of nourishment and grows exceedingly fat he next exhausts himself so much in the rutting season that the whole winter is necessary to recover his vigor but during this season instead of superabundant nourishment he is half starved for want of subsistence and consequently his horns cannot begin to shoot till the spring when his nourishment begins to be redundant the roe deer on the contrary who is never so much wasted has no occasion for equal reparation and as he is never loaded with fat as no change is produced in him by rutting but continues always nearly the same he has at all times a redundance of nourishment so that even in winter and a short time after rutting he sheds and renews his horns thus in all these animals the redundant organic nourishment before it is determined to the seminal reservoirs and forms the seminal fluid is transferred to the head and manifests itself externally by the production of horns in the same manner as in man the hair and the beard announce and precede the secretion of the seminal fluid and it is apparent that these vegetable productions as they may be denominated are formed of a redundant organic substance but still imperfect and mixed with brute particles since they preserve in their growth and substance the qualities of vegetables but the seminal fluid the production of which is not so early is a matter purely organic deprived entirely of its brute particles and perfectly assimilated to the body of the animal  when the roe deer has renewed his horns he rubs them against the trees like the stag in order to tear off the skin with which they are covered and this commonly happens in the month of march before the trees begin to shoot hence it is not the sap of the wood which colors the horns of the roe deer however the horns are brown when the animal is brown and yellow when he is red and consequently the color of the horns proceeds as formerly remarked see above history of the stag p  0   solely from the nature of the animal and the impression of the air the second horns of the roe have two or three antlers in each side the third three or four the fourth four or five and they seldom have more we distinguish the old ones by the thickness of the stems the largeness of the bur of the pearlings etc as long as the horns continue soft they are extremely sensible of this i have had a striking example the young shoot of a roe bucks horn was cut off with a ball the animal was stunned and fell down as if he had been dead the shooter who was near seized him by the foot but the buck suddenly recovering his senses and his strength dragged the man though he was strong and alert thirty paces into the wood after killing him with a knife we discovered that he had received no other wound besides it is well known that flies are very troublesome to the stag when his horns are growing he retires to the deepest parts of the wood where the flies are less numerous because when they fix upon the tender horns the irritation they occasion is insupportable thus there is an intimate communication between the soft parts of the horns and the whole nervous system of the animal the roe buck who has nothing to apprehend from the flies because he renews his horns in winter never retires in this manner but he walks with caution and carries his head low lest he should touch the branches  in the stag the fallow deer and roe buck the frontal bone has two processes or eminences on which the horns rest these processes begin to shoot at the age of five or six months soon after acquire their full growth and instead of rising higher in proportion as the animal advances in years they annually sink and diminish so that in old stags or roe bucks the burs are nearly supported upon the frontal bone the processes of which having then become very broad and very short this is the most certain mark by which the age of these animals can be distinguished at first sight this fact appears to be singular but admits of an easy explanation when it is considered that the horns supported by these processes press against them during the whole time of growth which continues for several months every year hence these bones however hard must become broader and sink lower annually by the great and long continued pressure they receive from every renewal of the animals horns it is for the same reason that though the stems and burs or rings always grow thicker in proportion to the animals age the height of the horns and the number of antlers diminish so fast that when he is very old they are only two thick knobs with very small antlers  as the female roe goes with young only five months and a half and as the growth of the fawn is more rapid than that of the stag the duration of her life is much shorter seldom extending i imagine beyond twelve or fifteen years i have reared several of them but could never preserve them above five or six years they are very delicate in the choice of their food require a great deal of exercise fine air and much room which is the reason why they are unable excepting in the first years of their growth to resist the inconveniences of a domestic life to make a male live comfortable he must be furnished with a female and a park of a hundred acres they may be tamed but can never be rendered obedient or familiar they always retain a portion of their natural wildness are easily terrified and then run with such force and precipitation against the walls that they often break their limbs however tame they may be they cannot be trusted for the males particularly are subject to dangerous caprices they take an aversion at certain persons and make furious attacks with their horns the blows of which are sufficient to knock a man to the ground after which they continue to tread on him with their feet the roe buck bellows not so frequently nor with so loud or so strong a voice as the stag the young ones utter a short and plaintive cry mimi by which they indicate their want of food this sound is easily imitated and the mother deceived by the call will come up to the very muzzle of the hunters gun  in winter the roe bucks frequent the thickest coppices and feed upon brambles broom heath the catkins of the hazel willow etc in spring they repair to the more open brushwood and eat the buds and young leaves of almost every tree this warm food ferments in their stomachs and intoxicates them to such a degree that they are easily surprised they know not where they are going and not unfrequently come out of the wood and sometimes approach flocks of cattle and the habitations of men in summer they dwell in the more elevated coppices from which they seldom depart excepting in very dry weather when they go to drink at some fountain for when the dews abound or the leaves are moistened with rain they never drink they are delicate in the choice of their food they eat not with avidity like the stag and they seldom approach the cultivated fields because they prefer the berrybearing alder and bramble to grain or pot herbs of any kind  though the flesh of these animals be excellent food yet it admits of much choice the quality of their venison depends chiefly on the country they inhabit and even the best countries produce good and bad kinds the flesh of the brown roe buck is finer than that of the red all the males after the age of two years have hard and illtasted flesh but that of the females though farther advanced in years is more tender the flesh of the fawns when very young is loose and soft but at the age of eighteen months it is in its highest state of perfection those which live in plains and valleys are not good those that come from moist countries are still worse those brought up in parks are insipid and lastly there are no good roe bucks but those of dry and elevated countries interspersed with hills woods cultivated and fallow lands where they enjoy plenty of air food freedom and solitude for those which have been often disturbed are meagre and the flesh of those that have been often hunted is dry and insipid  this species which is less numerous than that of the stag and very rare in many parts of europe seems to be much more abundant in america where there are two varieties the red which is the largest and the brown which has a white spot behind and is smaller and as they are found in the northern as well as the southern parts of america it is probable that they differ more from each other than from those of europe they are very common for example in louisiana the flesh of the roe buck is much used in louisiana this animal is somewhat larger than the european kind and his horns are similar to those of the stag but he differs both in the coat and the color he serves the inhabitants in place of mutton  sur la louisiaine par m dumont tom   p     and larger than those of france they are likewise found in brazil for the animal called cujuacuapara differs not more from our roe buck than the stag of canada from our stag there is indeed a little variation in the figure of the horns as appears from perraults figure of the canadian stag compared with the description and figure of the brasilian stag given by piso in brazil says piso there are roe bucks of which some have no horns and are called cujuacuete and others have horns and are called cujuacuapara the latter are smaller than the former their hair is smooth glossy and mixed with brown and white especially when the animals are young for the white is effaced with age the foot is divided into two black toes upon each of which there is a smaller one superinduced the tail is short the eyes large and black the nostrils open the horns are of a middle size and fall off annually the female goes with young five or six months they may be tamed pison hist brasil p     etc margraave adds that the horns of the apara have three branches and that the inferior branch is longest and divided into two from these descriptions it is apparent that the apara is only a variety of our roe buck and ray suspects raii synops anim quad p  0  that the cujuacuapara is the male and the cujuacuete the female and that they both belong to the same species i should willingly assent to mr rays opinion if piso had not expressly said that those which have horns are smaller than the other kind it is not probable that at brazil the females of this species should be larger than the males since every where else they are smaller at the same time though i believe the cujuacuapara to be only a variety of our roe buck to which we may also add the capreolus marinus of johnston i shall not decide concerning the cujuacuete till farther information be obtained  supplement it has frequently been mentioned in my original work that the common colors of wild animals are yellow brown and gray and that the domestic state gives rise to white fallow deer white rabbits etc i find however that nature alone sometimes produces the same effect upon wild animals m labbe de la villette informs me that a man belonging to his brothers estate near orgelet in

of a letter from m labbe de la villette a m de buffon dated lonlesaumier june           roe bucks similar to those of europe are found throughout all north america only they are larger and their size increases in proportion as the climate becomes more temperate the roe bucks of louisiana are generally double the size of those of france extract of a letter from m de fontenelle kings physician at new orleans to m de buffon  m de fontenelle adds that they are easily tamed in this he is supported by the evidence of m kalm who mentions a roe buck which went daily to the wood in quest of food and returned to his house in the evening voyage de pierre kalm tom   p   0  but in south america this species is subject to great varieties m de la board kings physician at cayenne says that they have there four kinds of stags called indiscriminately both males and females by the name of hinds the first kind called wood or red hinds keep perpetually in the thickest parts of the woods to avoid being tormented by the flies this kind is taller and thicker than that called the savanna hind and yet is exceeded in size by the barallou hind which is the second species and of the same color with the wood hind when the males are old their horns consist of only one branch and they at no period exceed four or five inches in height these barallou hinds are rare and combat the wood hinds in these two species at the side of each nostril there are two considerable glands which secret a white fetid humor  the third species is called the savanna hind its coat is greyish and its limbs and body longer than the preceding m de la board was assured by the hunters that the savanna hind had no glands on the nostrils and that it was less savage and even so curious as to approach men  the fourth species is the savanna hind which is smaller and more common than the other three they are not so wild and their horns are longer and more palmated or branched than those of the other three kinds they are called savanna hinds because they frequent the watery savannas and lands covered with marshes  these animals feed upon the manioc and often destroy the plantations their flesh is very tender and welltasted both the old and the young are used as food and are superior to the european stags they tame so easily that they run about the streets of cayenne and go out of the town and return without being afraid of any object the females even go into the woods in quest of wild males and afterward return with their fawns  the caricou is the smallest his hair is of a whitish gray color and his horns are straight and pointed he belongs rather to the roe buck than to the stag he never appears near inhabited places but is very common in large woods however he is easily tamed and the female brings forth only one fawn every year  if the above descriptions be compared with what is afterward remarked in the history of the mazame or mexican deer it will appear that all these pretended

are however only slight vicissitudes in the ordinary course of animated nature which in general is always the same its movements are performed on two steady pivots unlimited fecundity and those innumerable causes of destruction which reduce the product of this fecundity to a determined measure and preserve at all periods nearly an equal number of individuals in each species and as those enormous multitudes of animals which sometimes suddenly appear vanish without augmenting menting the common stock that of the human species in like manner continues always the same the variations of the latter are only slower because the life of man being longer than that of small animals more is necessary to bring about the alternate changes of augmentation and diminution but even this time

number of men like that of all other animals ought at all periods to be nearly the same since it depends upon the equilibrium of physical causes and this equilibrium to which every thing has been long reduced cannot be infringed either by the efforts of men or by any moral circumstances which are only particular effects of those physical causes whatever care man may bestow on his own species he will never render it more numerous in one place but at the expense of an equal diminution in another when any portion of the earth is overstocked with men they disperse or destroy each other and often establish such laws and customs as give too great a check to this excess of multiplication in remarkably prolific climates as in china egypt and guiney the inhabitants banish mutilate sell or drown their offspring in france and other catholic countries they are condemned to perpetual celebacy those who exist usurp easily the rights of those who have no existence regarding themselves as necessary beings they annihilate those which are contingent and for their own convenience suppress future generations the same restrictions are laid upon man without his perceiving it as are imposed upon the other animals we cherish or multiply neglect or destroy our species according to the advantages or inconveniences which result from them and as all moral effects depend upon physical causes which ever since the earth acquired its consistence are fixed and permanent the number of the human species as well as that of all other animals must likewise be constant and unalterable besides this sixed state this constant number imply not absolute quantities all physical and moral causes and the effects that result from them are balanced and comprehended within certain limits which are more or less extended but never to such a degree as to destroy the equilibrium as the whole universe is in perpetual motion as all the powers of matter mutually act upon and counterbalance each other every effect is produced by a kind of oscillations to the middle points of which we refer the ordinary course of nature and the extremes are those effects which are farthest removed from that course hence we find that both in animals and vegetables an excessive multiplication is commonly followed by sterility plenty and scarcity alternately succeed each other and often so quickly that a tolerable judgment may be formed of the produce of one year by that of the preceding year apple plumb oak beech and most fruit and forest trees produce abundantly but once every other season when caterpillars flies fieldmice and other animals mutliply to excess in one year their number is greatly diminished the following year if insects during these fertile seasons multiplied the next in proportion to their numbers the whole fruits of the earth all our domestic animals and even man himself would fall victims to their rapacity but the causes of destruction and sterility immediately succeed those which give rise to a redundant multiplication neither is this destruction occasioned by contagion it is a necessary consequence of too great a mass of animated matter collected in one place in every species there are particular causes of death as shall afterward be shown which are sufficient to compensate the excess of preceding generations  i must again remark that this reasoning is not to be understood in an absolute or even in a strict sense especially with regard to those species which are not left entirely to the guidance of nature man and the other animals he has taken under his protection and care are more abundant than they would be without that attention he bestows on them but as this care has also its limits the augmentation which results from it has long been confined by immutable boundaries and though in civilized countries the human species as well as domestic animals are more numerous than in other climates they never multiply to excess because whenever they become incommodious their number is diminished by the same power that produced them  in districts appropriated to the pleasures of the chase four or five hundred hares are sometimes killed in the course of a single days sport the multiplication of these animals is very rapid from the first year of their existence they are always in a condition for propagating the females go with young only thirty or thirtyone days they bring forth three or four at a litter and immediately afterward they receive the male they likewise admit him during the time of gestation and from a peculiar conformation of their organs they have frequent superfoetations for the uterus is only a continuation of the vagina and has neither neck nor orifice as in other animals but in each horn there is an orifice opening into the vagina which dilates during the time of bringing forth thus the horns are two distinct uteri which can act independent of each other so that the females of this species are capable of conceiving and bringing forth at different times by each uterus and consequently superfoetations must be as frequent among these animals as they are rare in those which have not a double organ  it is therefore apparent that the female hares may be in season and impregnated at all times another singularity in their structure proves them to be equally lascivious as they are fertile the glans of the clitoris is prominent and nearly as large as that of the male penis and as the vulva is hardly visible and the male when young has neither scrotum nor testicles on the outside of the body it is often difficult to distinguish the females from the males this peculiarity of structure has given rise to the following notions that hermophradite hares are very common that the males sometimes bring forth young and that some are alternately males and females and perform the functions of either sex because the females being more ardent than the males often mount upon them and because the external resemblance is so great that unless narrowly examined the one may easily be mistaken for the other  the young when brought forth have their eyes open the mother suckles them about twenty days after which they separate and procure their own food they never remove far from each other nor from the place where they are littered they live however in solitude each making a form or seat at the distance of sixty or eighty paces thus when we meet with one young hare we are almost certain of finding two or three others in the neighborhood they feed more in the night than in the day they eat herbs roots leaves fruit grain preferring those plants which have milky juices during winter they gnaw the bark indiscriminately from all trees excepting that of the alder and lime which they never touch when reared in houses they are fed with lettuce and pot herbs but the flesh of those fed hares is always bad tasted  during the day they sleep or repose in their form and are active only in the night when they move about feed and copulate when the moon shines they are seen playing together leaping and chacing each other the smallest motion or the noise of a falling leaf is sufficient to terrify and make them fly different ways  some authors maintain that hares chew the cud but i cannot assent to this opinion because they have one stomach only and its conformation as well as that of the other intestines are totally different from those of ruminating animals the caecum of the latter is small but that of the hare is very large and when to the capacity of the stomach this large caecum is added it is easy to perceive that this animal by taking a great quantity of aliment may live upon herbs alone like the horse and ass which have also a large caecum and but one stomach and consequently are incapable of ruminating  hares sleep much but always with open eyes they have neither eyelids nor cilia and their eyes seem to be bad but as a remuneration they have an acute sense of hearing and enormous ears in proportion to the size of their bodies these long ears they move with great facility and employ them as a rudder to direct their course which is so rapid that they outstrip all other animals as their fore legs are much shorter than the hind legs they run easier up than down hill hence when pursued they always take to the highest grounds their running is a kind of gallop a succession of quick leaps their motion is not accompanied with noise because their feet are covered both above and below with hair they are perhaps the only animals which have hair in the inside of the mouth  the duration of their life like that of other animals is proportioned to the time of their growth which is completed in one year and they live about seven the males are said to live longer than the females they pass their days in solitude and silence and their voice is never heard but when seized or wounded it is a loud sharp cry having some resemblance to the human voice they are not so savage as their manners and habits would indicate they are gentle and susceptible of a kind of education though easily tamed and even rendered caressing they never acquire that attachment which is necessary to make them domestic for when taken young and brought up in the house they take the first opportunity of regaining their liberty and of flying to the fields as they have a fine ear sit spontaneously on their hind legs and use the fore legs as a kind of hands they have been trained to beat a drum to perform gestures in cadence etc  in general the hare wants neither instinct sufficient for his own preservation nor sagacity for escaping his enemies he forms a seat or nest in winter he chooses situations exposed to the south and in summer to the north with a view to deceive he conceals himself between clods or hillocks of the same color with that of his own hair i have seen says fouilloux a hare so sagacious that after hearing the hunters horn he started from his form and though at the distance of a quarter of a league went to swim in a pool and lay down on the rushes in the middle of it without being chaced by the dogs i have seen a hare after running two hours before the dogs push another from his seat and take possession of it i have seen others swim over two or three ponds the narrowest of which was eighty paces broad i have seen others after a two hours chase run into a sheepfold and lie down among them i have seen others when hard pushed run in among a flock of sheep and would not leave them i have seen others after hearing the noise of the hounds conceal themselves in the earth i have seen others run up one side of a hedge and return by the other when there was nothing else between them and the dogs i have seen others after running half an hour mount an old wall six feet high and clap down in a hole covered with ivy lastly i have seen others swim over a river of about eighty paces broad more than two times in a length of two hundred paces  but these facts unquestionably exhibit the greatest efforts of their instinct for their ordinary resources are not so fine nor so complicated when pursued they first run with rapidity and then double or return upon their former steps they always run in the direction that the wind blows the females run not so far from their place of starting as the males but they double oftener in general hares hunted in the place that gave them birth never remove to a great distance from it but return to their form and if chaced two days successively they perform in the second day the same doublings they had observed the day before when a hare runs straight out and to a great distance from the place he started it is a proof that he is a stranger it often happens that male hares especially during the most remarkable period of rutting which is in the months of january february and march when they have few females near them perform journies of several leagues in quest of mates but as soon as they are started by the dogs they fly back to the place of their nativity and never more return the females wander not in this manner though longer than the males they are weaker and less agile but they are more timid for they never allow the dogs to come so near their seats as the males and their doublings are more frequent they are also more delicate and more susceptible of impressions from the weather they avoid water and dews but there are males called measled hares which love marshy and watery grounds the flesh of these hares is bad tasted and in general the flesh of all hares which inhabit valleys is whitish and insipid but those of elevated or hilly countries where the wild thime and other savory herbs abound are extremely good it has even been remarked that those which live in the low woody grounds of the same country are not near so good as those that inhabit the ridges of hills or the cultivated fields and vineyards and that the flesh of the female is always more delicate than that of the male  the nature of the soil has a considerable influence on the hare as well as upon all other animals the mountain hares are larger than those of the plains and likewise of a different color the former are browner and have more white under the neck than the latter which are almost red in high mountains and in northern regions they become white during winter and resume their usual color in the summer only a few and perhaps these are very old continue white for they all turn more or less white with age the hares of italy spain and barbary are smaller than those of france and other northern nations according to aristotle they are smaller in egypt than in greece  hares are equally diffused over all climates they abound in sweden denmark poland russia france britain germany barbary egypt the islands of the archipelago and particularly delos descript des isles de larchipel de dapper p      which was called lagaia by the ancient greeks because of the number of hares which were found there lastly hares are numerous in lapland les oeuvres de regnard tom   p   0 il genio vagante tom   p    voyage de la martiniere p     where they are white for ten months of the year and resume their proper color only during the two warm months of summer hence it appears that every climate is nearly equal to these animals it has however been remarked that they are less frequent in the east than in europe and that they are very rare in south america though they again make their appearance in virginia canada la relation de la gaspesie par le p le clercq p     etc  in the neighborhood of hudsons bay le voyage de robert lade tom   p      and the straits of magellan but these north american hares are perhaps a different species from ours for travelers inform us that they are not only much larger but that their flesh is white and of a different taste from that of the common kind la suite des voyages de dampier tom   p      they add that the hair of the north american hares never falls off and that their skins are excellent furs in excessively hot countries as senegal gambia guiney lhist genesis des voyages par m labbe prevot tom   p          and particularly in the cantons of fida apam agra and some other regions situated under the torrid zone both in africa and america as in new holland and the isthmus of panama there are animals which have been called hares by travelers but are rather a species of rabbit dampier vol   p     wafer tom   p      for the rabbit is a native of warm climates and is never found very far to the north but the hares are larger and stronger in proportion to the coldness of the country they inhabit  this animal though so much in request for the tables of europeans is not relished by the oriental nations the flesh of the hare it is true as well as that of the hog was interdicted by the law of mahomet and still more anciently by the jewish law but it was much esteemed by the greeks and romans inter quadrupedes gloria prima lepus martial  it must indeed be allowed that not only the flesh but the blood of this animal is excellent the fat contributes nothing to the delicacy of the flesh for the hare in his natural state of perfect liberty is never fat but when fed in the house he often dies merely by the load of fat he acquires  the hunting of the hare is the amusement and not unfrequently the sole occupation of the idle as it requires little apparatus or expense and is even useful it is a diversion universally agreeable in the mornings and evenings the hunter watches at the edges of the wood the going out or returning of the hares during the day he searches for them in their forms when the air is clear and the sun brilliant an expert hunter will discover at a considerable distance a hare that has been chanced by the fumes which arise from its body conducted by this mark i have seen men whose eyes were accustomed to this kind of observation part from their company and go to the distance of half a league to kill a hare in its seat hares allow a very near approach if they are not advanced upon directly but by a winding and seemingly inattentive motion they are more afraid of dogs than of men and start sooner when they hear or perceive a dog though the hares run faster than the dogs yet as they never fly straight out but double about the place where they were started the gray hounds who hunt more by the eye than the scent generally overtake and kill them in summer they frequent the fields the vineyards in autumn and the woods or coppices in winter and in all seasons they may be raised and chaced by hounds they may also be taken by birds of prey a perpetual war is carried on against them by owls buzzards eagles foxes wolves and men so numerous are their enemies that they escape only by chance and are rarely allowed to enjoy the small protion of time allotted them by nature  supplement it is universally known that hares make forms and burrow not in the ground like rabbits but i have been informed by an able naturalist m hettlinger superintendant of the pyrennean mines that in the mountains in the neighborhood of baigory the hares often make holes in the clefts of rocks which is not considered as remarkable letter from m hettlinger to m de busson dated at baigory july           it is likewise well known that hares do not willingly inhabit places which are frequented by rabbits but it also appears that rabbits do not multiply in countries where hares are numerous  in norway says pontoppidon rabbits are found only in a few places but hares are very frequent their hair which is brown and gray during summer becomes white in winter like cats they take and eat mice and are of a smaller size than those of denmark pontoppidous not hist of norway   that hares eat mice is extremely improbable but it is not the only mavelous or false fact related by the good bishop of bergen  the hares of the isle of france remarks m le vicomte de querhoent are not larger than french rabbits their flesh is white and they

both in external form and internal structure never intermix they constitute two distinct species however as it has been maintained by hunters la venerie de du fouilloux p  00  that male hares in the rutting season pursue and cover female rabbits i endeavored to discover what would result from this union for this purpose i reared together male rabbits and female hares and female rabbits and male hares but nothing was produced from these trials i only learned from them that these animals though very similar in form are so different in their natures as to be incapable of producing mules i put a young hare and a young female rabbit in the same apartment but they lived not together three months as soon as they acquired a little strength they became mortal enemies and their continual wars terminated in the death of the hare of two male hares farther advanced in life which i confined separately with a female rabbit one suffered the same fate and the other which was very strong and very ardent perpetually tormented the rabbit with attempts to cover her and at last killed her by wounds or by too violent caresses i made similar trials with three or four male rabbits and an equal number of female hares but the latter died in a still shorter time though nothing was produced i am inclined to think that they sometimes actually coupled it is certain at least that notwithstanding the resistance of the female the male was gratified and it was more reasonable to expect fruit from these mixtures than from that of the rabbit and hen which according to a certain author would produce chickens covered with hair or rabbits covered with feathers see lart delever des poulets  this ridiculous conclusion was drawn from a vicious male rabbit which having no female used a hen in the same manner as he would any other moveable it was extremely improbable that two species so remote from each other should be fertile while nothing results from the union of the hare and rabbit whose species are so very analogous  the fecundity of the rabbit is still greater than that of the hare without believing with wotton that from a single pair put upon an island six millions were found at the end of one year it is certain that these animals multiply so prodigiously in a country which is commodious for them that the produce of the earth is not sufficient to afford them subsistence they devour herbs roots grain fruits and even young trees and shrubs and if not furnished with dogs and ferrets the inhabitants would be obliged to desert these countries the rabbit not only produces more frequently and in greater number than the hare but has likewise more resources for escaping his enemies he easily abstracts himself from the observation of man the holes which he digs in the earth where he retires during the day and impregnates his mate protect him from the ravages of the wolf the fox and birds of prey here the whole family live in perfect security the females nourish their young about two months and never allow them to go out of their retreat till they are able to shift for themselves by this means they avoid all the dangers of youth while more hares on the contrary are destroyed during this period than in all the after part of their lives  this management is alone sufficient to prove that the rabbit is superior in sagacity to the hare the structure of both is the same and might enable them equally to dig retreats in the earth both are equally timid but the talents of the one being weaker than those of the other he contents himself with forming a seat on the surface of the ground where he remains perpetually exposed while the rabbit endowed with a superior instinct digs for himself an asylum in the earth this labor is unquestionably the effect of sentiment for domestic rabbits never give themselves the trouble of digging they dispense with digging retreats for the same reason that domestic birds dispense with building nests because they are equally sheltered from the inconveniences and dangers to which wild birds and wild rabbits are continually liable it has often been remarked that when a warren is attempted to be replenished with domestic rabbits both they and their offspring remain like the hares upon the surface and that they never begin to dig holes for their protection till after they have endured many hardships and passed through several generations  the colors of the domestic rabbit vary like those of all other domestic animals for we have white black brown and spotted rabbits the black rabbits are rarer than the white brown or variegated kinds all wild rabbits are brown and even among the domestic ones it is still the predominant color for in every litter though both male and female be white or both black or the one white and the other black some of the young are always brown it is seldom that above two or three resemble the parents but the brown rabbits though in a domestic state generally produce young of their own color only and it is very rare and as by accident that they bring forth white black or mixed kinds  at the age of five or six months these animals are capable of procreating they are said to be constant in their amors and after attaching themselves to a particular female generally never quit her the female is almost perpetually in a condition for receiving the male she goes with young thirty or thirtyone days and produces from four to eight at a litter like the female hare she has a double uterus and consequently may bring forth at two different times superfoetations however seem to be less frequent in this species than in that of the hare this circumstance may perhaps be owing to the constancy of the females and to their indulging in fewer adventures and unseasonable embraces  some days before bringing forth they dig a new hole not in a straight line but angular at the bottom of which they make an excavation and then pull great quantities of hair off their bellies and make a bed of it for the reception of their young during the two first days they never leave their offspring they never go out but when pressed with hunger and return as soon as they have filled their stomach which they do with surprising quickness in this manner they tend and suckle their young for more than six weeks during which the father has no knowledge of them he never enters the hole dug by the mother and the female when she leaves her young frequently shuts up the mouth of the hole with earth diluted in her own urine but when they begin to come to the mouth of the hole and to eat groundsel or other herbs presented to them by the mother the father seems to know them he takes them between his paws smooths their hair and licks their eyes each of them one after another equally partakes of his care and attention he receives at the same time many caresses from the mother and in a few days afterward she is generally impregnated  i received the following remarks from m le chapt du moutier who has amused himself for several years in rearing rabbits i began says he with only one male and one female the male was perfectly white and the female brown in their posterity which was very numerous the brown greatly predominated there was a considerable number of them white and mixed and some black when the female is in season the male seldom quits her his constitution is so vigorous and ardent that i have seen him embrace the female five or six times in less than an hour in the time of coition the female lies flat on her belly with her four paws stretched out and she utters small cries which rather indicate pleasure than pain their manner of coupling resembles that of the cats with this difference that the male bites the neck of the female with less violence these animals pay much respect to their fathers which i discovered by the great deference my rabbits entertained for their original father who was easily distinguished by his whiteness being the only male of this color which i preserved the family soon increased but those who had likewise become fathers were always subordinate to their first sire whenever they fought either for females or food the grandfather ran up to them with full speed and as soon as they perceived him order was reestablished if he surprised them in the act he first separated the combatants and then gave them an exemplary punishment i had still a farther proof of his dominion over his posterity having accustomed them to retire into their apartment upon the blowing of a whistle when i gave the signal however distant they might be the grandfather put himself at their head and though he arrived first he allowed them all to pass before and entered last himself i fed them with bran hay and a good deal of juniper of this last they eat the berries the leaves the bark and leave nothing but the wood this food gave a fine flavor to their flesh and made it equally good as that of the wild rabbit  these animals live eight or nine years as they pass the greatest part of their lives in holes where they enjoy perfect tranquillity they grow much fatter than hares their flesh differs likewise both in color and taste the flesh of the young rabbit is very delicate but that of the old is dry and hard as i formerly remarked they are originally natives of warm climates they were known to the greeks arist hist animal

the noxious species are few in number and though upon the whole what is hurtful seems to abound more than what is serviceable yet every thing is well ordered for in the physical world evil is subservient to good and there is nothing really noxious in nature if the destruction of animals be hurtful is not man considered as forming a part of the general system of animation the most noxious and pernicious of all beings he alone sacrifices and annihilates more individuals than the whole carnivorous tribes the latter are hurtful only because they are rivals to man because they have the same appetites the same taste for animal food and because in obedience to this unavoidable and necessary desire they sometimes dispute with him that prey which he would engross for the gratification of his inordinate appetite for man always sacrifices more to his intemperance than to his real wants born to destroy the subordinate races of animals he would exhaust all nature if by a fecundity superior to his depredations she did not repair the perpetual havoc he makes but death is only the minister of life and destruction is the parent of reproduction however great therefore the waste made by man and the carnivorous animals the fund or total quantity of life is never diminished for in proportion to their premature destruction fresh births are produced  large animals constitute but a small part of life the earth teems with the smaller tribes every plant every grain every particle of organized matter contains millions of animated atoms vegetables seem to be the great fund of subsistence but this fund however inexhaustible would hardly be sufficient to the still more numerous tribes of insects their fecundity which is equally great and often quicker than the reproduction of plants indicates the superiority of their numbers for plants are only renewed every year but a single season gives birth to several generations of insects especially among the minuter tribes their multiplication therefore if they were not devoured by other animals would exceed that of vegetables but many insects feed upon other insects some tribes as the speeders devour indifferently their own as well as many other species the whole are eaten by the birds and the wild and domestic fowls serve for nourishment to man or become the prey of carnivorous animals thus violent deaths are equally necessary as natural ones they are both modes of destruction and of reproduction the one continues nature in perpetual youth and the other preserves the order of her productions and limits the number of species both are effects depending upon general causes every individual drops at the end of a determined period or if prematurely cut off it was because he was superfluous how many flowers are cropped in the spring what numberless beings are extinguished the moment they begin to exist how many germs are annihilated before they are unfolded man and the carnivorous animals feed upon individuals either completely formed or about to exist flesh eggs seeds and germs of every species constitute their ordinary nourishment this waste alone might limit the exuberance of nature let us attend to one of those inferior species that serve for nourishment to others the herrings for example present themselves in myriads to our fishers and after feeding all the monsters of the northern ocean they furnish subsistence to europe during a certain part of the year if incredible numbers of them were not devoured by other animals what would be the effects of such an amazing multiplication they alone would cover the whole surface of the sea but by their numbers they would soon injure and destroy each other for want of sufficient nourishment their fecundity would diminish contagion and famine would produce the same effects as the present consumption the number of these animals would by no means increase but the number of those who feed upon them would greatly diminish and as the same remark may be applied to any other species they must of necessity prey upon one another hence the killing of animals is both a lawful and an innocent practice because it is founded in nature and they hold their existence under that seemingly hard condition  it must be allowed however that the motives which have raised doubts concerning this matter do honor to humanity animals at least those who are endowed with senses and are composed of flesh and blood are sensitive beings like us they are capable of pleasure and subject to pain to sacrifice unnecessarily those animals who approach or live with us and who like man exhibit symptoms of pain when injured indicates a cruel insensibility for those whose nature differs greatly from ours cannot affect us natural pity is founded on the analogy which takes place between us and the object that suffers and the degree of it is proportioned to the nearness of this conformity or resemblance in structure the word compassion implies a division of suffering in man the sentiment of pity belongs more to the body than to the mind and the animals are also susceptible of it they are moved by the voice of pain they run to succor each other they recoil at the view of a dead body of their own species thus horror and pity are not so much passions of the mind as natural affections depending on the sensibility of the body and similarity of structure this emotion therefore ought to diminish in proportion as different animals recede from each other in their nature and conformation the beating of a dog or the killing of a lamb excite our compassion but we feel no emotion when a tree is felled or an oyster swallowed  animals whose organization resembles that of man must have similar sensations and the liveliness of these sensations must be proportioned to the activity and perfection of their senses those on the other hand whose senses are blunt cannot have exquisite feelings and those who are deprived of any organ of sense must likewise want the correspondent sensations motion is a necessary effect of the exercise of sentiment we formerly proved sec above discourse on the nature of animals vol   p  0   that whatever be the organization of an animal if it be endowed with sentiment it must exhibit its feelings by external movements thus plants though properly organized are insensible beings as well as those animals who have no apparent motion in the same manner animals who like the sensitive plant only move their bodies but are deprived of progressive motion have very little sentiment and even those who are endowed with the power of moving progressively but whose actions like those of automations are extremely limited in number and always performed in the same manner have only a small portion of sentiment which is confined to a few objects in the human species there are many automatons education and the mutual communication of ideas by means of social intercourse augment both the quantity and the vivacity of our sentiments what a vast difference in this respect between a savage and a civilized man between a female hottentot and a woman of fashion among the animals in like manner those who live in a domestic state have their feelings improved by their frequent intercourse with man while those who remain wild preserve only their natural sensibility which is often more certain but always more confined than that which is acquired by education and example  besides considering sentiment entirely as a natural faculty independent of the movements produced by it we may still ascertain its different degrees by physical relations to which too little attention has hitherto been given to possess a high degree of sensibility the animated body must form a whole not only sensible in all its parts but so constructed that these parts intimately correspond with each other in such a manner that an impression made upon one must necessarily be communicated to all the rest there must also be a common center upon which the various impressions or vibrations must terminate and this center must like a fulcrum react and reflect all these movements thus man and those animals who resemble him most in organization will be the most sensible beings those on the contrary who form not so complete a whole whose parts have a less intimate correspondence who have several centres of feeling and who under the same covering seem not to include one perfect animal but various centres of existence separate from each other are beings of much less sensibility when a polypus is cut in pieces each division lives separately the head of a wasp after being divided from the body lives moves and even eats as formerly a lizard though cut asunder is neither deprived of motion nor of feeling the limbs of a lobster are renewed after amputation the heart of a turtle continues to beat long after being cut out of the body the principal viscera of insects as the heart and lungs make not a whole in the center of these animals but extend along the body and form a succession of unconnected hearts and windpipes all these and similar animals whose organization is so far removed from that of man have little sentiment  in man and in the animals which resemble him the diaphragm appears to be the center of sentiment it is upon this nervous part which conveys the impression of pain and of pleasure that all the movements of the sensible system are exerted the diaphragm makes a transverse division of the body into two equal parts the superior of which includes the heart and lungs and the inferior contains the stomach and intestines this membrane is endowed with such an extreme sensibility and is so necessary to the communication and propagation of feeling that the slightest wound whether in its center or circumference is always accompanied with convulsions and often with death the brain therefore which has been considered as the seat of sensation is by no means the center of sentiment for it may be wounded and even parts of it cut away without destroying the animal  sensation therefore ought to be distinguished from sentiment sensation is only a vibration or impression on the sense but sentiment is the same sensation rendered agreeable and disagreeable by the propagation of the vibration through the system the essential characteristic of sentiment is pleasure or pain for all other movements though they pass within us are totally indifferent and do not affect us all the external motions and the exercise of every animal force depend on sentiment which only acts in proportion as it is affected the diaphragm therefore which we consider as the center of sentiment is also the center of force or common fulcrum upon which every force is exerted  all lively emotions whether pleasant or painful sickness fainting and every sensation that has become agreeable or disagreeable are felt internally in the region of the diaphragm in the brain on the contrary there is no indication of sentiment we feel only pure sensations in the head we can indeed recall any sensation whether agreeable or disagreeable and if this operation which is performed in the head be followed by a real and lively sentiment we immediately feel the impression of it in the region of the diaphragm thus in the foetus where this membrane is not exercised there is no sentiment or at least it is so feeble as to produce no effect for the little motions of a foetus are mechanical and have no dependence either on sensation or on the will  whatever be the nature of that matter which serves as a vehicle to sentiment and gives rise to muscular motion we know that it is propagated by the nerves and that it is instantaneously communicated from one extremity of the system to the other we know not how this movement is performed whether by vibrations like those of elastic cords or by a subtle fire similar to that of electricity which resides not only in animated and unanimated bodies but is perpetually regenerated by the motion of the heart and lungs by the friction of the blood in the arteries and also by the action of external causes upon the organs of sense it is certain however that the nerves and membranes are the only sensible parts of an animal body the blood the lymph the fat the bones the flesh and all the other solids and fluids are in themselves totally insensible the brain is a soft unelastic substance and of course incapable of producing or of propagating the vibrations of sentiment the meninges on the contrary which serve as an envelope or covering to all the nerves are exceedingly sensible like the nerves the meninges originate in the head and like them they divide into branches and extend along with their most minute ramifications they may be regarded as nerves rendered flat for they are of the same substance have nearly the same degree of elasticity and form a necessary part of the sensible system if the head therefore be the seat of sensation it must reside in the meninges and not in the medullary part of the brain the substance of which is entirely different  the opinion that the brain is the fountain of sensation and the center of all sensibility arose from this circumstance that the whole nerves which are the organs of sensation terminate in the brain and hence it was regarded as the only part fitted to receive every impression or vibration this supposition appeared so simple and so natural that the physical impossibility which it implies though abundantly evident was never attended to how can an insensible part a soft inactive substance such as the brain be itself the instrument of all sensation and motion how can this soft insensible substance not only receive impressions but retain them for a long time and propagate vibrations through all the solid and sensible parts of the body it may perhaps be replied with descartes and peyronie that the principle of sensation resides not in the brain but in the pineal gland or in the cortical substance but from examining the parts of the brain it is apparent that neither the pineal gland nor cortical substance contain nerves they are surrounded with the insensible part of the brain and so separated from the nerves that they can receive none of their movements hence these suppositions as well as the former fall to the ground  but what is the use what are the functions of this noble and principal part of the body is not the brain found in every animal is it not larger in man in the quadrupeds and in the birds who have all a great deal of sentiment than in fishes insects and other animals which have little sentiment when compressed is not all motion suspended if this part is not the principle of action why is it so essentially necessary why is it even proportioned in every species of animals to the quantity of sentiment they possess  these questions however difficult they may appear admit of easy solutions upon an attentive and unprejudiced examination the brain as well as the medulla oblongata and spinal marrow which is a prolongation of the brain are only a species of mucilage and hardly organized we discover in it indeed the extremities of small arteries which terminate there in vast numbers and carry no blood but only a white nutritious lymph these minute arteries or lymphatic vessels when separated from the brain by maceration appear like very fine threads the nerves on the contrary never penetrate the substance of the brain but terminate on its surface but they first lose their solidity and elasticity and their extremities next the brain are soft and almost mucilaginous hence the brain which is nourished by the lymphatic arteries furnishes in its turn nutriment to the nerves which ought to be considered as a species of vegetation issuing from the brain in trunks and branches which afterward divide into an infinite number of ramifications the brain is to the nerves what the soil is to plants the extremities of the nerves are the roots which in every vegetable are more tender and soft than the trunk or branches they contain a ductile matter proper for the growth and nourishment of the nervous tree this ductile matter they derive from the substance of the brain itself to which the arteries perpetually carry the necessary supplies of lymph the brain therefore instead of being the origin of sensation or the principle of sentiment is only an organ of secretion and nutrition but a very essential organ for without it the nerves would neither grow nor be supported  the brain is largest in man quadrupeds and birds because the quantity of nerves is greater than in the fishes and insects whose sentiment for this reason is feeble the latter have a small  proportioned to the small quantity of  it has to nourish on this occasion i must remark that mans brain as has been alleged is not proportionally larger than that of any other animal there are species of monkeys and of the cetaceous tribes which have larger brains in proportion to the size of their bodies than man and this fact likewise proves that the brain is neither the seat of sensation nor the principle of sentiment for if this were the case these animals would have finer sensations and more sentiment than the human species  plants absorb not the solid parts of earth or water these parts must be reduced by heat into thin vapors before they can be absorbed by the roots in the same manner the nerves are nourished by the subtle moisture of the brain which is absorbed by their extremities or roots and from thence conveyed to all the branches of the sensitive system this system as formerly remarked forms a whole all the parts of which have such an intimate connection that none of them can be injured without wounding the whole the slightest irritation of a small nerve is sufficient to convulse the whole body and the pain and consequent conions cannot be cured but by cutting the nerve above the injured part and then all the parts upon which this nerve was distributed become for ever immovable and insensible the brain ought not to be regarded as an organic portion of the nervous system because it has not the same properties nor consists of the same substance being neither solid nor elastic nor sensible i acknowledge that when compressed sensation ceases but this alone proves it to be a body foreign to the nervous system which acting by its gravity on the extremities of the nerves presses and benumbs them in the same manner as a weight applied to the arm leg or any other part of the body benumbs the nerves and annihilates their sensation it is true this cessation of feeling by compression is only a suspension or a benumbing which vanishes the moment the compression is removed and sensation and motion are again renewed i farther acknowledge that by tearing the medullary substance of the brain convulsions privation of feeling and death itself will ensue but these effects are produced because the nerves are entirely deranged and the whole of them materially injured in their very source  to these arguments particular facts might be added which would equally demonstrate that the brain is neither the center of sentiment nor the seat of sensation we have seen animals and even children born without head or brain and yet had sentiment motion and life there are whole classes of animals as insects and worms in whom the brain is not perceptible having only a part corresponding to the medulla oblongata and spinal marrow it is therefore more rational to place the seat of sensation in the spinal marrow which no animal wants than in the brain which is not an universal part common to all sensitive beings  the great obstacle to the advancement of human knowledge lies not in the objects themselves but in our manner of considering them mans body however complicated is more simple than his ideas it is less difficult to see nature as she is than to know her in the dress she is exhibited to us she only wears a veil but we give her a mask we conceal her with prejudices we suppose that she operates as we act and think her actions however are evident but our thoughts are obscure to her operations we transfer the abstractions of our own minds we judge of her designs by our own views and we perpetually blend her works which are uniform her facts which are always certain with the fluctuating illusions of our own imagination  i speak not here of systems purely arbitrary or of frivolous and imaginary hypotheses but of the methods generally employed in the investigation of nature even the method of experiment has produced more errors than truths this method though the most certain requires great dexterity of management a small deviation either leads to barren regions or to rare and obscure objects we nevertheless assemble them together and ascribe to them general relations and common properties and as mankind pass and repass on the crooked paths which have been formed the road appears to be clear and beaten though it terminates in nothing the whole world follows the method is adopted and the consequences derived from it are received as fixed principles i might demonstrate this doctrine by exposing the origin of what are called principles in all the sciences both abstract and real in the former the general basis of the principle is abstraction or one or two suppositions in the latter the principles are only consequences good or bad of the methods which have been observed i shall here limit myself to the science of anatomy did not the first man who contrary to a repugnance of nature opened a human body believe that by dissecting and examining its different parts he would soon discover its structure mechanism and functions but having found the subject to be infinitely more complicated than he imagined he was soon obliged to renounce his pretensions and to institute a method not for distinguishing and judging but solely in order that he might see the parts in a certain train or order many ages were necessary to bring this method to any degree of perfection and it alone still occupies the attention of our most accomplished anatomists this method however is not the science but only the road which ought to lead to it and which perhaps might have led to it if instead of traveling always in the same narrow path anatomists had extended the tract and compared the human body with that of the other animals what real knowledge can be derived from a single object is not every science founded on the comparison of similar and different objects of their analogous or opposite properties and of all their relative qualities absolute knowledge if it has an existence exceeds the powers of man we can only judge by the relations of things when solely occupied with the method of investigating a subject and when we consider it independent of what is analogous or different from it we can never arrive at real knowledge and far less rise to any general principle in this case we can only invent names and make descriptions of the object and of all its parts thus though human bodies have been dissected for three thousand years anatomy is still nothing but a nomenclature and hardly any advances have been made toward the real object which is the knowledge of the animal economy besides the method itself is still imperfect though it ought to be clear and simple since it depends on inspection and has no end but that of denominations as this nominal knowledge has been mistaken for science anatomists have been anxious to augment the number of names instead of limiting the number of objects they have loaded the subject with minute and fruitless details they were inclined to discover discrepances where every thing was alike in creating new names they imagined they were exhibiting new objects and the description of a minute part which had been either overlooked or neglected by former anatomists was dignified with the appellation of a discovery even the names themselves being frequently substituted in place of the objects with which they have no relation have only served to augment the confusion are not the nates and testes small parts of the brain similar to the whole and unworthy to be distinguished by particular denominations these names bestowed originally from caprice at last gave rise to new opinions and prejudices others given to parts which either did not exist or were imperfectly viewed have been the sources of fresh errors how many functions and uses have been ascribed to the pineal gland and that pretended void in the brain called the fornix while the former is only a simple gland and the existence of the latter is doubtful being probably produced by the hand of the dissector see steno   the most difficult part of science therefore is not to know those things which form the direct object of it but to strip them of a thousand false colors under which they have been concealed to examine the foundation and effects of the method employed by former inquirers to reject every arbitrary arrangement and in fine to endeavor to detect every error or prejudice that has been adopted all these precautions are necessary to uncover nature but to know her we have only to compare her with herself in the animal economy her appearance is very mysterious not only because the subject is complex but because having neglected those modes of comparison which alone could afford light we have been left to wander in the darkness of vague hypotheses the human body has been described in millions of volumes while the anatomy of the other animals has been almost entirely neglected in the human subject we have distinguished named and described the most minute parts while we are ignorant whether these or even parts of greater magnitude and improtance exist in other animals particular functions have been ascribed to particular organs without knowing whether the same functions are not performed in other beings though deprived of these organs so that in the different explications of the animal economy we labor under the double disadvantage of having commenced with the most complicated subject and of reasoning concerning this subject without the aid of analogy  in the course of this work we have observed a very different method uniformly comparing nature with herself we have traced her in her relations in her discrepances and in her extremes to mention here only those parts relative to the animal economy of which we have had occasion to treat as the generation the senses the movements the sentiment and the nature of animals the reader will easily perceive that after all the labor bestowed in discarding false ideas in rooting out established prejudices and in separating truth from arbitrary conceits the only art we have employed is that of comparison if we have succeeded in throwing light upon those subjects it must be ascribed not so much to ingenuity or labor as to the method we have followed and which we have endeavored to render as general as our knowledge would permit before giving general ideas we have invariably exhibited the particular results or effects  we shall now content ourselves with relating a few facts which will be sufficient to prove that man in the state of nature was never destined to live upon herbs grain or fruits but that in every period of his existence he as well as most other animals eagerly desired to nourish himself with flesh  the pythagorean diet though extolled by ancient and modern philosophers and even recommended by certain physicians was never indicated by nature in the golden age man was innocent as the dove his food was acorns and his beverage pure water from the fountain finding every where abundant subsistence he felt no anxieties but lived independent and always in peace both with himself and the other animals but he no sooner forgot his native dignity and sacrificed his liberty to the bonds of society than war and the iron age took place of that of gold and of peace cruelty and an insatiable appetite for flesh and blood were the first fruits of a depraved nature the corruption of which was completed by the invention of manners and of arts  these are the reproaches which in all periods have been thrown upon man in a state of society by certain austere and savage philosophers flattering their private pride by the humiliation of the whole species they have exhibited this unnatural picture which has no value but in the contrast to hold out to man chimerical ideas of happiness may perhaps be sometimes useful  did this state of ideal innocence of exalted temperance of entire abstinence from flesh of perfect tranquillity of profound peace ever exist is it not a fable where man has been employed as an animal to give us lessons of moral instruction is it even possible to conceive the existence of virtue previous to society does the loss of this savage state merit regret was man while a wild unsocial animal more dignified than the polished citizen yes for every evil springs from society and what does it import whether there was virtue in a state of nature if it gave rise to happiness if man were only less miserable than in his present condition liberty health strength are not these preferable to effeminacy sensuality and voluptuousness accompanied with slavery the absence of pain is more estimable than a thousand pleasures what is happiness but to have nothing to desire  if this representation were just they should go farther and tells us that it is better to vegetate than to live to have no desires than to gratify our appetites to doze perpetually in apathetic slumbers than to open our eyes to view the beauties of nature and in a word to sink below the condition of brutes or to become masses of inanimate matter attached to the earth than to be active and sentient beings capable of receiving pleasure from a thousand sources  but instead of disputing let us attend to facts we see not the ideal but the real state of nature is the savage inhabitant of the desert a tranquil being is he a happy man for we must not suppose with a certain philosopher one of the most ferocious censors of humanity rousseau  that the distance from man in a pure state of nature to the savage is greater than from the savage to us that the ages elapsed before the invention of words have been longer than those which were necessary for the perfecting of sings and of language i have always thought that in reasoning concerning facts all suppositions ought to be banished till every thing presented by nature be heartily examined now we find that mankind descend by imperceptible degrees from the most enlightened and polished nations to people of less genius and industry from the latter to others more gross but still subject to kings and to laws from these again to savages who exhibit as many different shades as the polished nations some savages form numerous nations subject to chiefs smaller societies of them are governed by customs and the most solitary and independent species constitute families and submit to their fathers thus an empire and a monarch a family and a father are the two extremes of society these extremes are likewise the boundaries of nature if they extended farther in traversing the numberless solitudes of the globe we must have discovered these human animals deprived of speech like the monkeys the males separated from the females their offspring abandoned to the elements etc even supposing the constitution of the human body to be very different from what we see it and that its growth were more rapid it is impossible to maintain that man ever existed without forming families because if not cherished and attended for several years the whole children must have inevitably perished whereas other animals require the care of the mother only a few months this physical necessity is a perfect demonstration that the human species could neither multiply nor exist independent of society and that the attachement of parents to children is natural this attachment must unite the parents and children into a small society which alone would be sufficient to accustom them to make certain gestures to utter certain sounds and inure them to every expression of sentiment and of desire all this is attested by facts for the most solitary savages have like other men the use of signs and of words  thus the state of pure nature is a known state it is that of the savage living in the desert but living in family knowing his children and being known by them using words and making himself understood the savage girl picked up in the woods of champagne and the man found in the forests of hanover are not exceptions to this doctrine they had lived in absolute solitude and could not therefore have any idea of society or of the use of words but if they had ever met the propensity of nature would have constrained and pleasure united them attached to each other they would soon have made themselves understood they would have first learned the language of love and then that of tenderness for their offspring besides these savages sprung from men of society and must have been left in the woods at the age of four or five years for before this period they could not have existed they must have been old enough to be able to procure subsistence but not to retain the ideas which had been communicated to them  let us then examine this man of nature this savage living in the family state if the family prospers he will soon become the chief of a numerous society of which all the members will have the same manners observe the same customs and speak the same language at the third or fourth generation new families will arise who may live separately but being united by the common bonds of customs and language they will form a small nation which increasing with time may according to circumstances either become one people or remain in a state similar to that of those savage nations with which we are acquainted if these new men live under a mild climate and upon a fertile soil they may occupy in the full possession of liberty a considerable space beyond which if they meet with nothing but deserts or men equally new with themselves they will remain savage and become according to circumstances either friends or enemies to their neighbors but when under a severe climate or ungrateful soil they find themselves pinched by numbers or cramped for want of room they will make irruptions form colonies and blend themselves with other nations of which they will either become the conquerors or the slaves thus man in every situation and under every climate tends equally toward society it is the uniform effect of a necessary cause for without this natural tendency the propagation of the species and of course the existence of mankind would soon cease  having discussed the origin of society and shown that it is founded on nature let us next inquire what are the appetites and taste of savages in this investigation we shall find that none of them live solely on fruits herbs or grain that they all prefer flesh and fish to other aliments that pure water is not pleasant to them and that they endeavor either to make for themselves or to procure from others a less insipid beverage the savages of the south drink the water of the datetree those of the north swallow large draughts of whale oil others make fermented liquors and the whole without exception discover a violent passion for ardent spirits their industry dictated by necessity and excited by their natural appetites is confined to the making of instruments for hunting and fishing a bow and arrows a club a net and a canoe constitute the whole of their arts and are all destined to procure a species of food corresponding to their taste and what corresponds with their taste must be agreeable to nature for as formerly remarked see above vol   article bull  man would die of inanition if he took not more substantial food than herbs alone having but one stomach match and short intestines he could not take a sufficient quantity of such meagre food as would afford him proper nourishment the same remark is applicable to fruits and grain for though corns and other grains have been highly improved by culture and contain a greater quantity of organic nutritive particles than any of those which are produced spontaneously by nature yet if men were denied any other food he would only drag out a feeble and a languishing existence  view those solitary enthusiasts who abstain from every thing that has had life who from motives of sanctity renounce the gifts of the creator fly from society and shut themselves up within sacred walls against which nature continually revolts confined in those living tombs where they contemplate nothing but death their mortified visages and hollow eyes indicate perpetual efforts to support a languishing feeble and useless existence they take food but their hunger never abates though aided by the fervor of a romantic imagination they are enabled to resist the effects of this cruel abstinence for a few years only and may be said rather to die daily than to live  if man were obliged to abstain totally from flesh he could not at least in our climates either exist or multiply this diet may perhaps be practicable in southern countries where the fruits are better concocted and the plants roots and grains more nourishing the brahmans however rather form a sect than a people and their religion though very ancient has never extended beyond their own climate  this religion founded on metaphysics is a striking example of the lot of human opinions by collecting the scattered fragments which remain it is unquestionable that the sciences have been very anciently cultivated and perhaps ripened to a degree of perfection beyond what they now are it has been known long before the present era that all animated beings contained indestructible living particles which passed from one body into another this truth adopted at first by philosophers and afterward more generally diffused would only preserve its purity during the enlightened ages a revolution of dark periods having succeeded no more of the living organic particles were remembered than what was sufficient to give rise to the notion that the living principle of animals constituted an indestructible whole which separated from the body after death to this ideal whole they gave the name of soul which they soon regarded as a being really existing in all animals and combinging with this chimerical being the real but disfigured idea of the passage of living particles they maintained that after death this soul transmigrated successively and perpetually from one body to another from this system man was not excepted they quickly associated morality with metaphysics they hesitated not to hold that this surviving being retained in all its transmigrations its former sentiments affections and desires weak minds trembled they contemplated with horror the passage of the soul from an agreeable lodging to be an inhabitant of an unclean and lothesome animal every new fear engenders a fresh superstition in killing an naimal they were terrified lest they should murder their mistress or their father they regarded every brute as their neighbor and at last both from motives of tenderness and of duty they maintained that they ought to abstain from every thing endowed with life this is the origin and progress of the most ancient religion of india an origin which shows that truth when committed to the multitude is soon disfigured that a philosophical opinion never becomes popular till it has changed its form but that by means of this preparation it may prove the basis of a religion the stability of which will be proportioned to the universality of the prejudice and being founded on truths misunderstood it must be environed with obscurity and of course it will have an air of mystery of grandeur and of incomprehensibility in fine that fear combining with reverence will make this religion degenerate into superstitious and ridiculous practices which however will take root and produce rites that at first will be scrupulously observed but will so gradually alter with time that even the opinion which gave them birth can only be traced in false traditions in proverbs and in tales puerile and absurd from hence we may conclude that every religion founded on human opinions is false and variable and that to promulgate the true religion which depends not on the fancies of men and which is constant unalterable and will always be the same is the prerogative of god alone  but to return to our subject an entire abstinence from flesh can have no effect but to enfeeble nature man to preserve himself in proper plight requires not only the use of this solid nourishment but even to vary it to obtain complete vigor he must choose that species of food which is most agreeable to his constitution and as he cannot preserve himself in a state of activity but by procuring new sensations he must give his senses their full stretch and eat a variety of meats to prevent the disgust arising from an uniformity of nourishment but he must avoid every excess which is still more noxious than abstinence  those animals who have but one stomach and short intestines are obliged like man to feed upon flesh it is an unquestionable fact that all animals which have more stomachs than one and long intestines like the cow sheep goat etc are herbivorous and that those who have but one stomach and short intestines like men dogs wolves lions etc are carnivorous  it must not however be concluded that herbivorous animals are under a physical necessity of feeding on herbs alone though the carnivorous tribes can by no means subsist without flesh we only maintain that the former can be sufficiently nourished without the use of flesh not that they would not have recourse to this food if nature had endowed them with talents adapted to the purposes of seizing prey for we have seen sheep calves goats and horses eat with avidity milk eggs and even flesh when cut down and seasoned with salt though they had not been previously accustomed to such food we may therefore maintain that the taste for flesh is an appetite common to all animals and that it is exerted with more or less vehemence or moderation according to their particular conformation for this appetite is apparent not only in man and the quadrupeds but in birds fishes insects and worms to the last of which it would appear all flesh has been ultimately destined by nature  nutrition in every animal is performed by organic particles which after being separated from the gross mass of aliment by means of digestion mingle with the blood and are assimilated to all the parts of the body but independent of this principal effect which is always proportioned to the quality of food another effect is produced which depends on the quantity or bulk of the nourishing substances the stomach and intestines consist of flexible membranes which occupy a considerable space within the body these membranes to preserve them in a proper state of tension and to counterbalance the action of the neighboring organs require to be always partly filled if for want of nourishment this large space be left entirely void the membranes having no internal support collapse and adhere to each other which gives rise to weakness and all the symptoms of extreme want thus the aliments before answering the purposes of nutrition serve as a ballast to the body both their presence and their volume are necessary to maintain the equilibrium between the internal parts which act and react against each other when a man dies of hunger it is not so much for want of nourishment as of a proper poise to the body thus animals and especially the most voracious tribes when pressed with hunger are so eager to fill the internal void that they swallow earth and stones clay has been found in the stomach of a wolf and i have seen swine eat it greedily most birds swallow pebbles etc this is not the effect of taste but of necessity for the most craving want is not to refresh the blood with new chyle but to maintain an equilibrium in the action of the great parts of the animal machine  the wolf the wolf is ranked in the same genus with the dog by linnaeus and by mr pennant the latter of whom describes him in the following manner wolf  dog with a long head pointed nose ears erect and sharp tail long bushy and bending down teeth large color generally pale brown tinged with yellow sometimes found white and sometimes black taller than a large greyhound  in greek  in latin lupus in italian lupo in spanish lobo in german wolff in swedish ulf in polish wilk in french le loup  lupus gesner icon animal quad p     lupus ray synops animal quad p      canis cauda incurvata linn syst     canis ex griseo flavescens brisson quad p      lupus vulgaris klein hist not quad p  0    the wolf is one of those animals whose carnivorous appetite is strongest though he has received from nature the means of gratifiying this taste though she has bestowed on him arms craftiness strength agility and every thing necessary for discovering seizing conquering and devouring his prey yet he often dies of hunger because men have declared war against him put a price on his head and forced him to fly to the forests where he finds only a few species of wild animals who escape from him by the swiftness of their course and whom he cannot surprise but by chance or by a patient and often fruitless attendance at those places to which they generally resort he is naturally clownish and dastardly but want makes him ingenious and necessity gives him courage when pressed with famine he braves danger he attacks those animals which are under the protection of man especially such as he can transport with ease as lambs small dogs and kids and when successful in his bloody expeditions he returns often to the charge till being wounded chaced and maletreated by men and dogs he retires during the day to his den but issues forth in the night traverses the country roams about the cottages kills all the animals which have been left without digs the earth under the doors enters with a dreadful ferocity and puts every living creature to death before he chooses to depart and carry off his prey when these inroads happen to be fruitless he returns to the woods searches about with avidity follows the tract of wild beasts and pursues them in the hope that they may be stopped and seized by some other wolf and that he may be a partaker of the spoil in fine when his hunger is extreme he loses the idea of fear he attacks women and children and even sometimes darts upon men till becoming perfectly furious by excessive exertions he generally falls a sacrifice to pure rage and distraction  the wolf both externally and internally has so strong a resemblance to the dog that he seems to have been formed upon the same model but he exhibits the same characters under a mask the figure is similar but the result is directly reversed their natural dispositions are so opposite that they are not only incompatible but repugnant by nature and inimical by instinct a young dog trembles at the first glance of a wolf the odor of the wolf though new and unknown excites such an aversion in the dog that he flies and comes quivering to the feet of his master a mastiff who knows his own strength though terrified at the appearance of a wolf attacks him with courage endeavors to put him to flight and exerts every effort to get rid of an odious object they never meet but either flight or death is the consequence when the wolf is strongest he mangles and devours his prey the dog with more generosity contents himself with victory he finds no savory odor in the body of a dead enemy but abandons him to be food for the ravens and even to other wolves for wolves eat the carcasses of each other and when one is much wounded the others follow the blood and assemble in troops to despatch him  the dog even when wild is not a fierce animal he is easily tamed and attaches himself with fidelity to his master the young wolf may also be tamed but he feels no attachments nature in him is too powerful for education with age he resumes his ferocious character and returns with the first opportunity to his savage state dogs even those of the most clownish race love to associate with other animals and are naturally disposed to accompany them it is by instinct alone and not by education that they know how to conduct and guard the flocks the wolf on the contrary is an enemy to all society and keeps no company even with those of his own species when several wolves appear together it is not a society of peace but of war it is attended with tumult and dreadful prowlings and indicates an attack upon some large animal as a stag an ox or a formidable mastiff this military expedition is no sooner finished than they separate and each returns in silence to his solitude there is even little intercourse between the males and females they feel the mutual attractions of love but once a year and never remain long together the females come in season in winter many males follow the same female and this association is more bloody than the former for they growl chaff fight and tear one another and often sacrifice him that is preferred by the female the female commonly flies a long time fatigues her admirers and retires while they sleep with the most alert or most favorite male  the season of love continues only twelve or fifteen days it commences with the oldest females the young ones are not so early disposed the males have no marked period but are equally ready at all times they go from female to female according as they are in a condition to receive them they begin with the old females about the end of december and finish with the young ones in the month of february or beginning of march the time of gestation is about three months and a half see nouveau traite de venerie p     and young whelps are found from the end of april to the month of july this difference in the time of gestation between the shewolf who carries  00 days and the bitch who carries only  0 days proves that the wolf and dog differ as much in their constitutions and particularly in one of the chief functions of the animal economy as they do in their tempers thus the wolf and dog have never been regarded as the same animal but by the nomenclators of natural history who being acquainted with the surface of nature only never extend their views beyond their own methods which are always deceitful and often erroneous even in the most obvious facts the dog and wolf cannot copulate or produce an intermediate race see article dog  their dispositions are opposite and their constitutions different the wolf lives much longer than the dog the former brings forth but once a year and the latter twice or thrice these distinctions are more than sufficient to demonstrate the two animals to be of very different kinds besides upon a closer examination we easily perceive that even externally the wolf differs from the dog by essential and uniform characters the appearance of the head and form of the bones are by no means the same the cavity of the eye in the wolf is placed obliquely the orbits are inclined the eyes sparkle and shine in the dark instead of barking he howls his movements though quick and precipitate are more equal and uniform his body is stronger but not so flexible aristotle tells us that the neck of the wolf consists of one continued bone but this is a mistake for the wolfs neck is composed of vertebrac and is equally flexible as that of a dog  his members are firmer his jaws and teeth larger and his hair coarser and thicker  but these animals have a great resemblance in their internal structure the wolves copulate like the dogs and have an osseous penis surrounded with a ring which swells and hinders them from separating when the females are about to bring forth they search for a concealed place in the inmost recesses of the forest after fixing on the spot they make it smooth and plain for a considerable space by cutting and tearing up with their teeth all the brambles and brushwood they then bring great quantities of moss and prepare a commodious bed for their young which are generally five or six though sometimes they bring forth seven eight and even nine but never less than three they come into the world blind like the dogs the mother suckles them some weeks and soon learns them to eat flesh which she prepares for them by tearing it into small pieces some time after she brings them fieldmice young hares partridges and living fowls the young wolves begin by playing with these animals and at last worry them then the mother pulls off the feathers tears them in pieces and gives a part to each of her young they never leave their den till the end of six weeks or two months they then follow their mother who leads them to drink in the hollow trunk of a tree or in some neighboring pool she conducts them back to the den or when any danger is apprehended obliges them to conceal themselves elsewhere though like other females the shewolf is naturally more timid than the male yet when her young are attacked she defends them with intrepedity she loses all sense of danger and becomes perfectly furious she never leaves them till their education is finished till they are so strong as to need no assistance or protection and have acquired talents fit for rapine which generally happens in ten or twelve months after their first teeth which commonly fall out in the sixth month see la venerie de du fouilloux p  00  are replaced  both males and females are capable of generating at the age of two years the females it is probable like those of other species are sooner mature for this operation than the males it is certain however that they never come in season before the second winter after birth which implies    or  0 months a shewolf which i brought up discovered no marks of love till the third winter or more than two years and a half we are assured by the hunters see le nouveau traite de la venerie p      that in every litter there are more males than females which confirms the general remark that in every species the number of males exceeds that of the females they likewise tell us that some males attach themselves to the females after the season of love is over and accompany them till they are about to bring forth that then the female steals off and anxiously conceals her young lest the father should devour them immediately after birth but that when brought forth he takes an affection for them supplies them with food and if deprived of their mother provides for and protects them himself these facts however have the air of fiction and seem contrary to the natural dispositions of the wolf  wolves acquire their full growth at the end of two or three years and live    or  0 years this fact accords with what we have already remarked concerning many other species that the time of growth is the seventh part of the total duration of life when old wolves turn whitish and their teeth are much worn when full or fatigued they sleep but more during the day than the night and it is always a kind of slight slumber they drink often and in the time of drought when there is no water in the hollows or in the trunks of old trees they repair several times in a day to the brooks or rivulets though extremely voracious if supplied with water they can pass four or five days without meat  the wolf has great strength especially in the anterior parts of the body in the muscles of the neck and jaws he carries a sheep in his mouth and at the same time outruns the shepherds so that he can only be stopped or deprived of his prey by dogs his bite is cruel and always more obstinate in proportion to the smallness of the resistance for when an animal can defend itself he is cautious and circumspect he never fights but from necessity and not from motives of courage when wounded with a ball he cries and yet when despatching him with bludgeons he complains not he is harder less sensible and more robust than the dog he runs and roams about whole days and nights and of all animals he is perhaps the most difficult to conquer in the chase the dog is gentle and courageous the wolf though ferocious is timid when he falls into a snare he is so overcome with terror that he may be either killed or taken alive without resistance he allows himself to be chained muzzled and led where you please without exhibiting the least symptom of resentment or discontent the senses of the wolf are excellent but particularly his sense of smelling which often extends farther than his eye the odor of carrion strikes him at the distance of more than a league he likewise scents live animals very far and hunts them a long time by following their track when he issues from the wood he never loses the wind he stops upon the borders of the forest smells on all sides and receives the emanations of living or dead animals brought to him from a distance by the wind though he prefers living to dead animals yet he devours the most putrid carcasses he is fond of human flesh and if stronger he would perhaps eat no other wolves have been known to follow armies to come in troops to the field of battle where bodies are carelessly interred to tear them up and to devour them with an infatiable avidity and when once accustomed to human flesh these wolves ever after attack men prefer the shepherd to the flock devour women and carry off children wolves of this vicious disposition are distinguished by the name of loups garoux see la chasse du loup de gaston phoebus  or wolves that should be guarded against  whole countries are sometimes obliged to arm in order to destroy the wolves princes have particular equipages for this species of hunting which is both useful and necessary hunters distinguish wolves into young old and very old they know them by the tracks of their feet the older the wolf his feet is the larger the shewolfs feet are longer and more slender her heel is also smaller and her toes thinner a good bloodhound is necessary for hunting the wolf and when he falls into the scent he must be coaxed and encouraged for all dogs have an aversion from the wolf and proceed with coldness in the chase when the wolf is raised the greyhounds are let loose in pairs and one is kept for dislodging him if he gets under cover the other dogs are led before as a reserve the first pair are let after the wolf and are supported by a man on horseback then the second pair are let loose at the distance of seven or eight hundred paces and lastly the third pair when the other dogs begin to join and to teaze the wolf the whole together soon reduce him to the last extremity and the hunters complete the business by stabbing him with a dagger the dogs have such a reluctance to the wolfs flesh that it must be prepared and seasoned before they will eat it the wolf may also be hunted with beagles or hounds but as he darts always straight forward and runs for a whole day without slopping the chase is irksome unless the beagles be supported by greyhounds to teaze him and give the hounds time to come up  in the country though men attended with mastiffs beat the bushes lay snares and baits dig pits and scatter poisoned pieces of meat yet the number of these destructive animals never decreases especially in woody countries the british pretend to have cleared their island of this rapacious creature and yet i am assured that wolves still exist in scotland see supplement to this article  as there is little wood in the southern parts of britain it was a more easy task to extirpate the wolf  the hair and color of these animals vary with the climate and sometimes even in the same country in france and germany beside the common wolves we find some with thicker and more yellow colored hair these wolves more wild though less destructive than the other kind never trouble the flocks or the habitations of men and live solely on hunting in the northern countries we meet with some wolves which are entirely white and others entirely black and the latter are larger and stronger than the former the common species are very generally diffused they are found in asia see le voyage de pietro della valle vol   p    africa

particularly in persia wolves are exhibited as spectacles to the people when young they are learned to dance or rather to perform a kind of wrestling with a number of men chardin tell us that a wolf well educated in dancing is sold at  00 french crowns this fact proves that these animals by time and restraint are susceptible of some kind of education i have brought up several of them when young or during their first year they are very docile and even caressing and if well fed they neither disturb the poultry nor any other animal but at the age of    months or two years their natural ferocity returns and they must be chained to prevent them from running off and doing mischief i brought up one till the age of    or    months in a court along with fowls none of which he ever attacked but for his first essay he killed the whole in one night without eating any of them another having broken his chain run off after killing a dog with whom he had lived in great familiarity i kept a shewolf three years in a large court and though shut up when very young along with a mastiff dog of the same age she could never suffer him to approach even when she came in season she provoked she attacked

in the history of the wolf i remarked that this animal was entirely extirpated in england by way of recompense it would appear that these voracious creatures have found out new countries to inhabit pontoppidan alleges that they existed not in norway before the year      he says that during the last war between sweden and norway the wolves passed the mountains by following the provisions of the army pontoppidans not hist of norway   some english authors who treat of british zoology have reproached me for maintaining that wolves still exist in the northern parts of their island i never did affirm this as a fact but only said see above p  0   that i was assured that wolves still existed in scotland lord morton then president of the royal society a scotsman worthy of the greatest credit and respect and proprietor of large territories in that country assured me of this fact in the year      to his testimony i still adhere because it is positive and because the assertion of those who deny the fact amount to a negative evidence only it is amusing to see the count de buffon notwithstanding the repeated assurances he has had to the contrary still pertinaciously maintaining that there are wolves in the north of scotland he appeals to the evidence of the late earl of morton we are fully disposed to give due weight to an authority so respectable and so worthy of credit but we are convinced that the count has misapprehended his lordship for it is universally known to the inhabitants of scotland that not a single wolf has been seen in any part of that country for more than a century past  thus far the translator had written but when the sheets were about going to the press he received from a gentleman not less remarkable for his learned and useful productions on various branches of natural history than for inviolable integrity the following anecdote in writing which throws a very different light upon this dispute i asked says he the late lord morton if he ever told m de buffon that wolves still existed in scotland and lord morton declared that he never did m de buffon quoted to me in      in private conversation that lord morton was his author which made me put the question to his lordship   the viscount of querhoent in his observations tells us that there are two species of wolves at the cape of good hope the one black and the other gray with black spots he adds that they are stronger than those of europe and their skin is thicker and their teeth more sanguinary but that their dastardliness makes them less formidable though like the ounces they sometimes during the night come into the streets of the city  the black wolf i describe this animal only as a supplement to the article wolf for both i am persuaded belong to the same species in the history of the wolf see above p  0   it was remarked that in the north of europe there are some wolves which are white and others black and that the black kind are the largest the wolf represented in the plate was brought from canada it was totally black but smaller than our wolf its ears were somewhat larger more erect and at a greater distance from each other the eyes were likewise a little smaller and appeared to be more distant from one another than in the common wolf these differences in my opinion are too inconsiderable to constitute a distinct species the greatest difference is that of the size but as i have oftener than once remarked all the animals common to the northern parts of europe and america differ in size and the black wolf of canada being smaller than those of europe only tends to confirm the general fact besides as he had been taken when very young and ever afterward confined with a chain constraint alone was perhaps sufficient to prevent plate lxiv wolf plate lxv black wolf

lynx and the fox are very numerous in north america and yet the black fox is very rare and his skin is much more beautiful than that of the black wolf which makes but a very coarse fur  i shall only add that this black wolf resembled the common wolf both in figure and dispositions for he became only rapacious with age and like the wolf he was ferocious without courage  the fox dog with a sharp

craftiness and he merits in some measure the reputation he has acquired what the wolf executes by force alone the fox performs by address and often with more success without combating dogs or shepherds without attacking the flocks or disinterring the bodies of the dead the fox is more certain of procuring his food he exerts more genius than motion and all his resources are within himself acute as well as circumspect ingenious and patiently prudent he diversifies his conduct and always reserves some art for unforeseen accidents of his own preservation he is extremely vigilant though equally indefatigable and even nimbler than the wolf he trusts not entirely to the swiftness of his course the fox knows how to ensure safety by providing himself with an asylum where he retires from pressing dangers where he dwells and where he brings up his young he is not a vagabond but lives in a settled domestic state  this difference though it appears even among men has greater effects and supposes more powerful causes among the inferior animals the single idea of a house or settled place of abode indicates a singular attention to self the choice of situation the art of making and rendering a house commodious and of concealing the avenues to it imply a superior degree of sentiment the fox is endowed with this quality and manages it with advantage he fixes his abode on the border of the wood in the neighborhood of cottages he listens to the crowing of the cocks and the cries of the poultry he scents them at a distance he chooses his time with judgment he conceals his road as well as his design he slips forward with caution sometimes even trailing his body and seldom makes a fruitless expedition if he can leap the wall or get in underneath he ravages the courtyard puts all to death and then retires softly with his prey which he either hides under the herbage or carries off to his kennel he returns in a few minutes for another which he carries off or conceals in the same manner but in a different place in this way he proceeds till the progress of the sun or some movements perceived in the house advertise him that it is time to suspend his operations and to retire to his den he plays the same game with the catchers of thrushes woodcocks etc he visits the nets and birdlime very early in the morning carries off successively the birds which are entangled and lays them in different places especially near the sides of highways in the furrows under the herbage or brushwood where they sometimes lie two or three days but he knows perfectly where to find them when he is in need he hunts the young hares in the plains seizes old ones in their seats never misses those which are wounded digs out the rabbits in the warrens discovers the nests of partridges and quails seizes the mothers on the eggs and destroys a vast quantity of game the wolf is not more noxious to the peasant than the fox to the gentleman  the chase of the fox requires less apparatus and is more amusing than that of the wolf to the latter every dog has great reluctance but all dogs hunt the fox spontaneously and with pleasure for though his odor be strong they often prefer him to the stag or the hare he may be hunted with terriers hounds etc whenever he finds himself pursued he runs to his hole the terriers with crooked legs or turnspits go in with most ease this mode answers very well when we want to carry off a whole litter of foxes both mother and young while the mother defends herself against the terriers the hunters remove the earth above and either kill or seize her alive but as the holes are often under rocks the roots of trees or sunk too deep in the ground this method is frequently unsuccessful the most certain and most common method of hunting foxes is to begin with shutting up their hole to place a man with a gun near the entrance and then to search about with the dogs when they fall in with him he immediately makes for his hole but when he comes up to it he is met with a discharge from the gun if he escapes the shot he flies with full speed takes a large circuit and returns again to the hole where he is fired upon a second time but finding the entrance shut he now endeavors to escape by darting straight forward with the design of never revisiting his former habitation he is then pursued by the hounds whom he seldom fails to fatigue because he purposely passes through the thickest parts of the forest or places of the most difficult access where the dogs are hardly able to follow him and when he takes to the plains he runs straight out without stopping or doubling  but the most effectual mode of destroying foxes is the laying of snares baited with a pigeon a live fowl etc i once suspended on a tree at the height of nine feet some meat bread and bones the foxes had been at severe exercise during the night for next morning the earth all around was beaten by their jumping as smooth as a barnfloor the fox is exceedingly voracious beside flesh of all kinds he eats with equal avidity eggs milk cheese fruits and particularly grapes when the young hares and partridges fail him he makes war against rats fieldmice serpents lizards tods etc of these he destroys vast numbers and this is the only service he does to mankind he is so fond of honey that he attacks the wild bees wasps and hornets they at first put him to flight by a thousand stings but he retires only for the purpose of rolling himself on the ground to crush them and he returns so often to the charge that he obliges them to abandon the hive which he soon uncovers and devours both the honey and wax in a word he eats fishes lobsters grasshoppers etc  the fox has a great resemblance to the dog especially in his internal parts his head however is larger in proportion to his body his ears are also shorter his tail thicker his hair longer and more bushy and his eyes more inclined he differs still more from the dog by a strong offensive odor which is peculiar to him and by his natural disposition for he is not easily and never fully tamed he languishes when deprived of liberty and if kept too long in a domestic state he dies of chagrin he does not copulate with the female dog see my experiments on this subject article dog  if they have no rooted antipathy they are at least indifferent to each other foxes produce but once a year and the litter commonly consists of four or five seldom six and never less than three when the female is full she retires and seldom goes out of her hole where she prepares a bed for her young she comes in season in the winter and young foxes are found in the month of april when she perceives that her retreat is discovered and that her young have been disturbed she carries them off one by one and goes in search of another habitation the young are brought forth blind like the dogs they grow    months or two years and live    or    years  the senses of the fox are equally good as those of the wolf his sentiment is more delicate and the organs of his voice are more pliant and perfect the wolf sends forth only frightful howlings but the fox barks yelps and utters a mournful cry like that of the peacock he varies his tones according to the different sentiments with which he is affected he has an accent peculiar to the chase the tone of desire of complaint and of sorrow he has another cry expressive of acute pain which he utters only when he is shot or has some of his members broken for he never complains of any other wound and like the wolf allows himself to be killed with a bludgeon without complaining but he always defends himself to the last with great courage and bravery his bite is obstinate and dangerous and the severest blows will hardly make him quit his hold his yelping is a species of barking and consists of a quick succession of similar tones at the end of which he generally raises his voice similar to the cry of the peacock in winter and particularly during frost and snow he yelps perpetually but in summer he is almost entirely silent and during this season he casts his hair the skins of young foxes and of those taken in summer are of little value the flesh of the fox is not so bad as that of the wolf dogs and even men eat it in autumn especially when he has been fattened with grapes and his skin in winter makes excellent furs he sleeps sound and may be easily approached without wakening he sleeps in a round form like the dog but when he only reposes himself he extends his hind legs and lies on his belly it is in this situation that he spies the birds along the hedges who have such an antipathy to him that they no sooner perceive him than they send forth soft shrill cries to advertise their neighbors of the enemys approach the jays and black birds particularly follow the fox from tree to tree sometimes two or three hundred paces often repeating the watchcries  i brought up some young foxes their offensive odor made it necessary to keep them in stables or places which were not much frequented this perhaps might be one reason why they were less tame than the wolf which was kept nearer the house at the age of five or six months the young foxes pursued the ducks and fowls and therefore it became necessary to chain them i kept two males and a female two years i tried in vain to make the males copulate with bitches though they had never seen females of their own species and were stimulated by the strongest desires of nature they uniformly rejected the bitches but whenever a shefox was presented to them though chained they instantly covered her and she brought forth four whelps the young foxes who when at liberty had darted on the poultry never attempted to touch a single fowl after they were chained a living hen was generally fixed near them for a whole night and though victuals were kept from them for many hours yet in spite of hunger and of opportunity they never forgot that they were chained and disturbed not the hen  the fox is so extremely subject to the influences of climate that the varieties of this species are almost as numerous as those of the domestic animals most of our foxes are reddish but some of them are found of a silver gray in both the end of the tail is white in burgundy the latter are called coal foxes because their feet are remarkably black their bodies have also the appearance of being shorter because they are better clad with hair there are some who are really longer than the other kinds and of a dirty gray color nearly the same with that of old wolves but it is uncertain whether this difference constitutes a real variety or is produced by the age of the animal who perhaps grows whiter as he advances in years in the northern regions the foxes are of all colors black blue gray ironcoloured silver gray white white with yellow feet white with black heads white with the extremity of the tail black reddish with the throat and belly entirely white and lastly some of them have a black line along the spine crossed with another black line over the shoulder the latter are larger than the other kinds and have black throats the common species are more generally

subsistence as his body is long his legs short his claws especially those of the forefeet very long and strong he digs and penetrates the earth with greater facility than any other animal he makes his hole winding and oblique the fox who cannot dig with equal dexterity avails himself of the operations of the badger being unable to make him quit his habitation by force the fox practices every art to render him uneasy he stands sentinel at the entrance of the hole and even defiles it with his ordure he afterward takes possession enlarges and fits it up for his own accommodation the badger though obliged to change his habitation leaves not his country he goes only to a small distance where he digs a fresh hole from which he never removes but in the night and as he never goes far he returns upon the approach of danger this is his only mean of safety for he cannot escape by flight his legs are too short for quick motion when at some distance from his hole he is soon overtaken by the dogs they seldom however accomplish their purpose without assistance the hair of the badger is very thick and his legs jaws teeth and claws are exceedingly strong these natural weapons he uses with courage

to the very last extremity  formerly when badgers were more common terriers were trained to hunt and to take them in their holes the badger defends himself by retiring and throwing back the earth in order to stop or bury the dogs he can only be taken by opening the hole above after the dogs have pushed him to the end of it the people lay hold of him with pincers and then muzzle him to prevent his biting i have kept some of them which had been taken in this manner a considerable time the young ones are easily tamed they play with the dogs and follow the person who feeds them but when taken old they continue always savage they are neither mischievous nor ravenous like the wolf and fox and yet they are carnivorous they eat every thing presented to them as flesh eggs cheese butter bread fish fruit nuts grain roots etc but raw flesh they prefer to every other food they sleep the whole night and three fourths of the day and yet they are subject to a lethargic or benumbed state during winter like the marmottes or dormice this great quantity of sleep makes them fat though they eat but little and for the same reason they can support hunger with ease and often remain in their holes three or four days together especially during snow  they keep their habitations extremely clean and never defile them with their ordure the male is seldom found with the female when about to bring forth she cuts down the herbage bundles it up and trails it with her feet to the bottom of the hole where she makes a commodious bed for herself and her young she brings forth in summer and the litter commonly

she rushes into the burrows of rabbits and seizes their young she likewise lays hold of fieldmice lizards serpents grasshoppers and birds eggs which she conveys to her offspring whom she often leads to the mouth of the hole in order to suckle or to feed them  these animals are naturally chilly those brought up in the house would never quit the corner of the fire and often approach so near as to

industry with age sufficient at least to carry on a successful war against the fishes who both with regard to sentiment and instinct are much inferior to other animals but i can hardly allow him to

in the cliffs of rocks and even in piles of floating wood that they deposit their young on beds made of twigs and herbs that we find in their habitations heads and bones of fishes that they often change their places of abode that they banish their young at the end of six weeks or two months that those i attempted to tame endeavored to bite though they were only taking milk and unable to eat

gesner hist quad p    ray synops quad p  00 and ray in imitation of albertus affirm that they intermix promiscuously this fact however which is supported by no other evidence appears at least to be doubtful i believe on the contrary that these animals have no intercourse but form two distinct and independent pendent species to illustrate this point i shall give a few reasons if the pineweasel were only a wild martin or the martin a domestic pineweasel the first would constantly preserve the same characters and the latter would be subject to variations as the wild cat uniformly remains the same while the domestic cat assumes all sorts of colors the martin on the contrary never varies but preserves its peculiar characters as constantly as the pineweasel retains those which are proper to it this alone is a sufficient proof that those two animals are specifically different and that the one is not a simple variety of the other besides there is no reason for regarding the martin as a domestic animal he is no more domestic than the fox or the polecats who like him approach the habitations of men in quest of their prey and he has no greater communication with mankind than the other animals we call wild or savage the martin therefore differs from the pineweasel both in disposition and temperament for the latter flies the open fields lives in the most secret recesses of the forest and is never found in great numbers in cold climates but the martin approaches our habitations takes up his abode in old buildings in haylofts and in holes of the walls the species is likewise spread in great numbers over all the temperate countries and is even found in warm regions as in madagascar see voyages de struys tom   p  0  and the maldiva islands voyage de pyrard tom   p      and is never seen in high latitudes  the martin has a fine countenance a lively eye supple limbs and a flexible body his movements are all exceedingly nimble he rather bounds and leaps than walks he climbs rough walls with ease and alacrity enters the pigeon or henhouses eats the eggs pigeons fowls etc and the female often kills great numbers and transports them to her young he likewise seizes mice rats moles and birds in their nest i kept one of these animals a considerable time he tamed to a certain degree but never formed any attachment and continued always so wild that it was necessary to chain him he made war against the rats and attacked the poultry whenever they came in his way he often got loose though chained by the middle of the body at first he went to no great distance and returned in a few hours but without discovering any symptoms of joy or of affection to any particular person he however called for victuals like a cat or a dog afterward he made longer excursions and at last he thought proper never to return he was then about a year and a half old seemingly the age at which nature assumes her full ascendency he eat every thing presented to him except salad and herbs he was fond of honey and preferred hemp seed to every other grain we remarked that he drank very often that he sometimes slept two days successively that at other times he would sleep none for two or three days that before sleeping he folded himself in a round form and covered his head with his tail and that while awake his motions were so violent so perpetual and so incommodious that though he had not disturbed the fowls we found it necessary to chain him to prevent him from breaking every thing we have had in our possession several other martins of a more advanced age which had been taken in nets but they continued to be totally savage bit all who attempted to touch them and would eat nothing but raw flesh  martins it is said go with young as long as cats we meet with young ones from spring to autumn and therefore it is probable that they bring forth more than once a year the younger females litter only three or four at a time but the more aged produce six or seven when about to bring forth they take up their abode in magazines of hay in holes of walls which they stuff with straw and herbs in clefts of rocks or in the hollow trunks of trees and when disturbed they remove their young who seem to grow very soon to maturity for the one i kept had nearly attained its full growth in one year hence we may conclude that those animals live only eight or ten years they have a kind of musky smell which is not very disagreeable the pineweasel and the martin like some other animals have two vesicles one on each side of the extremity of the rectum which contain an odoriferous matter similar to that procured from the civet cat their flesh retains a little of this odor and yet that of the pineweasel is not bad the flesh of the martin is more disagreeable and his skin is likewise much less valuable  supplement i have added the figure of an american animal which was sent from guiana to m aubry curate of st louis though this animal wants the teeth it is so similar in all the other parts of the body to the common martin that it may be regarded as a variety of that species it differs from the martin only in having the color of the hair sprinkled with black and white a shorter tail and spots on the head the martin of guiana is three or four inches longer than the european but the tail is proportionally shorter the muzzle seems also to be longer it is black and the blackness extends above the eyes passes under the ears along the neck and loses itself in the brown hair of the shoulders there is a large white space above the eyes which spreads upon the front surrounds the ears forms a narrow band along the neck and disappears on the shoulders the ears are perfectly similar to those of the martin the top of the head is gray mixed with white the neck is brown interspersed with ashcolored hairs and the body is covered with a mixture of white and blackish hairs these hairs are gray and ashcolored at their origin then brown and black and white at the extremities the under part of thejaw is of a blackish brown color which extends under the neck and vanishes toward the belly which is of a bright brown or chestnut the legs and feet are covered with shining reddish black hair and the toes have a greater resemblance to the toes of the squirrel and rat than to those of the martin the great toes of the forefeet are four lines long but those of the hindfeet only two the tail is more bushy at the origin than the extremity and the hair of it is chestnut or a bright brown mixed with black  we have given the figure of another cayenne animal which seems to have a great analogy to the former it was drawn from the life at the fair of st germain in      and measured    inches from the tip of the nose to the origin of the tail which was eight inches and more bushy at the root than at the extremity this animal is short legged like our martins the form of the head approaches nearly to that of the martin but in the ears there is no

very warm countries some of them are found in the forests of burgundy and likewise in those of fountainbleau but in general they are as rare in france as the martin is frequent there are none of those animals in britain because they have no extensive forests in that country they fly equally inhabited countries and uncovered fields they dwell in the woods and conceal not themselves among the rocks but traverse the forest and climb the trees they live by hunting and destroy prodigious quantities of birds by eating their eggs they seize squirrels fieldmice etc they also eat honey like the martin and polecat they never appear in the open fields in the meadows or in the vineyards they approach not the dwellings of men and they differ still farther from the martin in their manner of making their escape from the hunters when the martin is pursued by a dog he instantly runs to his hayloft or his hole the pineweasel on the contrary runs a long time before the dogs then climbs the trunk of a tree and from this station he views them as they pass the track which he leaves in the snow appears to be that of a large animal because he always leaps and both feet make but one mark he is somewhat larger than the martin and yet his head is shorter his legs are longer and consequently he runs more easily his neck is yellow but that of the martin is white his hair is finer more bushy and less subject to fall off the female prepares not a bed for her young and yet lodges them most commodiously the squirrels build nests in the tops of trees with equal art as the birds when the pineweasel is about to bring forth she climbs to the squirrels nest banishes the possessor enlarges the entry to it and there deposits her young she likewise uses the old nests of ducks or buzzards and holes of ancient trees from which she dislodges the woodpeckers and others birds she brings forth in the spring and her litter consists only of two or three though her young come into the world blind they soon acquire a considerable growth she brings to them eggs and birds and afterward leads them out to hunt along with herself the birds are so well acquainted with their enemies that when they perceive the pineweasel they utter the same mournful cry to advertise his approach as when they see a fox what shows that the birds are animated with hatred rather than fear is that they follow at a distance and utter this peculiar cry against all carnivorous animals as the wolf the fox the pineweasel the wild cat etc but never against the stag the roe the hare etc  the pineweasels are very frequent in the

and pigeonhouses where with less noise than the martin he makes greater havoc cutting off the heads of all the fowls and then transporting them one by one to his magazine if as frequently happens he cannot carry them off entire on account of the smallness of the entry to his hole he eats the plate lxxiii yellow breasted weasel brains and takes only their heads along with him he is likewise very fond of honey attacks the hives in winter and forces the bees to abandon them he never retires far from the abodes of men the spring is their season of love the males fight for the female on the roofs of houses they afterward leave her and go to pass the summer in the fields or in the woods the female on the contrary continues in her habitation till she brings forth and leads not off her young till toward the end of summer she litters three or four and sometimes five suckles them but a short time and early accustoms them to eat blood and eggs  in the villages they live upon poultry and in the country they hunt for prey during the summer they take up their abode in rabbitholes in the cliffs of rocks or in the hollow trunks of trees from which they issue out in the night and roam about the fields and woods searching for the nests of partridges larks and quails they climb trees in quest of the nests of other birds they lie in watch for rats fieldmice and moles and carry on a perpetual war against the rabbits who cannot escape them as they enter with ease into their holes a single family of polecats is sufficient to destroy a whole warren this would be a simple method of diminishing the number of rabbits in places where they are too abundant  the polecat is somewhat less than the martin his tail is also shorter his muzzle sharper and his hair blacker and more bushy he has white hair on his front and likewise on the sides of the nose and round the mouth he differs still more from the martin in his voice the martin has a sharp piercing cry the cry of the polecat is blunter each of them as well as the pineweasel and squirrel have a deep grunting tone which they often repeat when irritated lastly the odor of the martin is very different from that of the polecat which instead of being agreeable is extremely foetid and from this circumstance the animal obtained its latin name putorius he sends forth this insupportable odor to a great distance especially when irritated the dogs will not eat the flesh of the polecat and even his skin though good is in no estimation because it never loses entirely its natural smell this odor proceeds from two vesicles near the anus from which an unctuous matter continually exudes and the effluvia of it is extremely offensive in the polecat ferret weasel badger etc but it constitutes on the contrary a species of perfume

animal like the martin but the ferret is a native of warm countries and cannot subsist even in france unless in a domestic state the ferret alone is used in hunting rabbits because he is more easily tamed than the polecat both indeed have a strong and disagreeable odor but the most convincing proof of their being different animals is that they have no intercourse with one another and differ in a number of essential characters the body of the ferret is thinner and more lengthened his head narrower and his muzzle sharper than those of the polecat he is not endowed with the same instinct in finding subsistence but at least in our climates must be carefully nourished within doors and cannot exist in the fields for those who are lost in the burrows of rabbits never multiply but probably perish during the winter the ferret also like other domestic animals varies in color and is equally common in warm regions the ferret is found in barbary and is called nimse see shaws travels  as the polecat is rare  the female ferret is less than the male when in season she is so extremely ardent that we are assured she dies if her desires be not gratified gesner hist quad p      ferrets are

they produce twice every year the female goes six weeks with young some of them devour their young as soon as they are brought forth instantly come again in season and have three litters which generally consist of five or six and sometimes seven or eight and even nine  this animal is by nature a mortal enemy to the rabbit whenever a dead rabbit is for the first time presented to a young ferret he flies upon it and bites it with fury but if it be alive he seizes it by the throat or the nose and sucks its blood when let into the burrows of rabbits he is muzzled that he may not kill them in their holes but only oblige them to come out in order to be caught in the nets if the ferret is let in without a muzzle he is in danger of being lost for after sucking the blood of the rabbit he falls asleep and even smoking the hole is not a certain method of recalling him because the holes have often several entries which communicate with each other and the ferret retires into one of these when incommoded with the smoke boys likewise use the ferret for catching birds in the holes of walls or of old trees  according to strabo the ferret was brought from africa into spain which is by no means improbable as spain is the native climate of rabbits and the country where formerly these animals most abounded it may therefore be presumed that in order to diminish their number which perhaps was incommodious ferrets were imported for the purpose of hunting rabbits in a profitable manner in place of multiplying martins which would have destroyed the rabbits without bringing any advantage to the hunters  the ferret though easily tamed and rendered docile is extremely irascible his odor is always disagreeable but when he is irritated it becomes much more offensive his eyes are lively and his aspect is inflammatory all his movements are nimble and he is at the same time so vigorous that he can easily master a rabbit though at least four times larger than himself  notwithstanding the authority of commentators it is still uncertain whether the ferret be the ictis of the greeks the ictis says aristotle is a species of wild weasel smaller than the little maltese dog but resembling the weasel in its hair in the whiteness of the under part of the body and likewise in the craftiness of its manners it admits of being tamed and makes great havoc among the beehives being extremely found of honey it also attacks birds and like the cat has an osseous penis hist anim lib   cap      there appears to be a contradiction in saying that the ictis is a species of wild weasel which admits of being tamed for the common weasel which in this country is the most savage of the two is perfectly irreclaimable   the ferret though larger than the weasel can never be compared for size to the lapdog   the ferret appears not to have the cunning of the weasel nor indeed any craftiness at all lastly he never attacks the beehives nor is he fond of honey i inquired of m le roi inspector of the royal chaces concerning this last fact his answer follows m de buffon may be assured that the ferrets have no predilection for honey but when hungry may be made to eat to it i have fed them several days with bread soaked in water mixed with honey the two last days they eat it in pretty large quantities but the weakest of them began to be sensibly emaciated this is not the first time that m le roi has obliged me with important facts having no ferrets i tried the same experiment on the ermine by giving him only pure honey to eat and a little milk for drink but he died in a few days thus neither the ermine nor the ferret are fond of honey like the ictis of the ancients which inclines me to think that the word ictis is perhaps only a generic name or if it marks any particular species it ought rather to be applied to the martin or polecat both of which possess the craftiness of the weasel attack the beehives and are extremely fond of honey  plate lxxv ferret plate lxxvi

never in warm countries these animals therefore form two distinct species the common weasel sometimes turns white during the winter even in our climate this circumstance might give rise to its being regarded as of the same species with the ermine this mark is common to both but there are others in which they differ the ermine is reddish in summer and white in winter but the end of its tail is uniformly black the end of the weasels tail is yellow even when the animal turns white in winter it is besides always less and its tail much shorter than that of the ermine the weasel dwells not like the ermine in woods and deserts but near the habitations of men i have kept both species together but animals which differ in climate in constitution and in disposition never intermix it is true some weasels are larger or smaller than others but the difference never exceeds an inch in the whole length of the body but the ermine is two inches longer than the largest weasel neither of them can be tamed but are kept wild in iron cages neither of them voluntarily eat honey nor attack the beehives like the polecat and martin thus the ermine is not the savage weasel nor the ictis of aristotle which he says is easily tamed and very fond of honey the weasel and ermine instead of being easily tamed are so wild that they will not eat when any person looks at them they are in perpetual agitation always endeavoring to conceal themselves and if a man wants to keep them he must furnish them with a bundle of wool or flax in which they wrap and hide themselves from the light thither they drag every thing they can lay hold of and never eat but in the night they allow fresh meat to lie three or four days and even till it corrupt before they touch it they sleep three fourths of the day and watch their prey during the night when a weasel gets among the poultry he attacks not the cocks or old hens but singles out the chickens and young birds whom he kills with a single bite on the head and then carries off the whole one by one he likewise breaks the eggs and sucks them with incredible avidity in winter they generally live in granaries and barns where they often remain during

follows them into their holes she mounts the pigeonhouses and destroys the pigeons sparrows etc in summer they retire farther from houses especially into low grounds about mills along rivulets conceal themselves among brushwood in order to surprise birds and often take up their abode in old willows where the female brings forth her young she prepares for them a bed of straw leaves and other herbage and litters in the spring from three to five the young like those of the polecat pineweasel and martin are born blind but they very soon acquire growth and strength enough to follow their mother in the chase the weasels attack serpents waterrats moles fieldmice etc and overrunning the meadows they devour quails and partridges together with their eggs their motion consists of inequal and precipitant leaps and when they want to mount a tree they make a sudden bound by which they are at once elevated several feet high they leap in the same manner when they attempt to seize a bird  these animals as well as the polecat and ferret have a disagreeable odor which is stronger in summer than in winter and when pursued or irritated their smell is felt at a considerable distance they move always with caution and with silence and never cry but when they are hurt their cry is sharp rough and very expressive of resentment as their own odor is offensive they seem not to be sensible of a bad smell in other bodies a peasant in my neighborhood took three newlittered weasels out of the carcass of a wolf that had been hung on a tree by the hind feet the wolf was almost entirely putrified and the female weasel had made a nest of leaves and herbage for her young in the thorax of this putrid carcass  supplement the author here ingenuously quotes a letter he received from the countess of noyan dated at the castle of manceliere in britany july  0      in which that lady assures him that he had injured the character of the weasel by alleging that no art could reclaim or render him docile because she had tried the experiment upon a young weasel taken in her garden who soon learned to recognize and to lick the hand from which it received its food and became as familiar caressing and frolicksome as a dog or squirrel  this fact the author had still farther confirmed by a similar experiment made by m giely de mornas who trained a young weasel so completely that the animal followed him wherever he went the method of taming them is to stroke them often and gently over the back and to threaten and even beat them when they bite their odor is never offensive but when they

in the beginning of march      which was then white i kept it till april      when it would probably have become white had it been at liberty but it was confined in an iron cage against the bars of

circumstance it is a healthy vivacious animal has lively eyes a fine countenance and movements so rapid that it is impossible to follow them with the eye it has always been fed with eggs and flesh but

the name grison because i know not how it is denominated in the country where it is found the whole upper part of its body is covered with deep brown hair having white points which gives a grayish brown color under the head and neck is a bright gray because the hairs there are very short and the white part is of equal length with the brown the muzzle the under part of the body and legs are

not long enough and its legs are too long it is not mentioned by any author or traveller i showed it to several persons who had lived long in surinam but none of them knew it hence it either must be a

to have afforded a supply to each by multiplying the neighboring species the rat the mouse the fieldmouse the waterrat the short tailed field mouse the fat squirrel the garden squirrel the dormouse the shrewmouse and several others whom i mention not because they belong not to our climate form so many distinct and separate species but so analogous to each other that if any one should happen to fail the gap in the genus would hardly be perceptible it is this great number of neighboring species which has given to naturalists the idea of genera an idea which can only be employed when we view objects in general but which vanishes whenever we consider nature in detail  men at first gave distinct names to objects which appeared to differ from each other and at the same time they gave general denominations to objects that seemed to be nearly similar among a rude people and in the infancy of all languages there is hardly any thing but general terms or vague and illformed expressions for objects of the same order though very different from each other an oak a beech a lindentree a fir a pine a yew would at first have no other name but that of a tree afterward the oak the beech and the yew would all be called oak when these were distinguished from the fir the pine and the yew the three latter would be called fir particular names could only be invented in consequence of a minute examination of each different species and the numbers of these names are augmented in proportion to the extent of our knowledge of nature the more we examine her proper and particular names will become more frequent when natural objects therefore are represented to us under general denominations or by classes and genera it is recalling the darkness peculiar to the infant state of human knowledge ignorance is the parent of genera but science will for ever continue to create and to multiply proper names and i shall never hesitate in adding to their number as often as i have occasion to delineate different species  several species of small animals have been confounded under the generic name of rat but we shall confine this name solely to the common rat which is of a blackish color and infests the habitations of men the rat commonly frequents granaries and barns and from thence when food is scarce comes into our houses he is a carnivorous or rather an omnivorous animal he seems only to prefer hard substances to those which are tender or succulent he gnaws linen clothes furniture makes holes in the walls lodges in the ceilings and in the void spaces between the wall and the wainscotting from these lurking places the rats issue in quest of food and transport thither every substance they can drag forming considerable magazines especially when they have young to provide for the female brings forth several times a year but always in the summer season the litter generally consists of five or six they are fond of warmth and in winter insinuate themselves near the chimneys or lodge among hay or straw in spite of cats poison and snares these animals multiply so greatly that they often do much damage in old countryhouses where grain is kept and where the vicinity of barns and magazines of hay facilitates their retreat they often increase so prodigiously that the possessors are obliged to remove and desert their habitations unless the rats happen to destroy each other it is well known that rats when pinched for food eat one another when a famine is created by too great a number being crowded into one place the strong kill the weak open their heads and first eat the brain and then the rest of the body next day the war is renewed and continues in the same manner till most of them are destroyed this is the reason why these animals after being extremely troublesome disappear all of a sudden and return not for a long time the same thing happens to fieldmice whose prodigious multiplication is interrupted only by the hostilities they exercise on each other when provisions become scarce this sudden destruction is ascribed by aristotle to the operation of rains but rats are not exposed to rain and the fieldmice know how to guard themselves against its effects for the holes they inhabit are not even moist  the rats are as lascivious as they are voracious they squeak during their amors and cry when they fight they prepare a bed for their young and soon learn them to eat when the young begin to issue from their hole the mother watches defends and even fights with the cats in order to save them a large rat is more mischievous and nearly as strong as a young cat the foreteeth of the rat are long and strong the cat is not a good biter and as she uses only her claws she requires both to be vigorous and accustomed to fight the weasel though smaller is a more dangerous and formidable enemy because he follows the rat into his hole their strength being nearly equal the combat often continues long but the method of using their arms is very different the rat wounds only by reiterated strokes with his foreteeth which are rather destined for gnawing than biting and being situated at the extremity of the lever or jaw they have not much force but the weasel bites cruelly with the whole jaw and instead of letting go his hold he sucks the blood from the wounded part and therefore the rat uniformly falls a sacrifice to the weasel  of this species as in all those which consist of numerous individuals there are many varieties beside the common rat which is blackish some are brown others gray reddish and even totally white the white rats have red eyes like the white rabbit the white mouse and all the other animals which are perfectly white the whole species and its varieties appear to be natives of the temperate climates and are more diffused over the

and others in the diocese of aggerhum where no rats are to be found and that the rats on the south banks of the river vormen soon perish when carried to the north side of it this difference he adds can only be ascribed to certain exhalations of the soil which are destructive to these animals these facts may be true but we have often discovered that pontoppidan is an author who deserves not entire credit  m le vicomte de querhoent has favored me with the following remarks that the rats transported from europe to the isle of france increased to such a degree that it is alleged they made the dutch leave the island the french have diminished the number though great quantities of them still remain some time adds m de querhoent after a rat resides in india he acquires so strong a smell

they are shot caught in traps and destroyed by millions in a word they subsist by their amazing fecundity alone  they bring forth at all seasons and several times in the year the litter generally consists of five or six in less than fifteen days the young are strong enough to disperse and to procure food for themselves the duration of life in those small animals must therefore be short since their growth is so rapid and this circumstance still farther augments the idea of their prodigious multiplication aristotle tells us that having shut up a pregnant mouse in a vessel along with plenty of grain he in a short time after found   0 mice all sprung from the same mother  these little animals are by no means ugly they have a vivacious and elegant air that species of horror some people feel at them arises from the surprise and inconveniences they sometimes occasion all mice are whitish under the belly and some are altogether white others are more or less brown and black the species is generally diffused over europe asia and africa and it is alleged that those of america where they are very numerous came originally from the old continent it is however certain that this little

elevated countries it seems to take a considerable time in arriving at full growth because it varies greatly in size the largest are between four and five inches long and the smaller ones which appear likewise to be adults are an inch shorter and as we find them of all intermediate sizes both the great and small are unquestionably the same species ignorance of this fact has probably led some naturalists to make two species of them the one called the great fieldrat and the other the fieldmouse ray who first fell into this blunder seems to acknowledge that he knew but one species de hac specie mihi non undequaque satisfactum est ray synops quad p      and though the short descriptions he has given each species appear to differ we ought not to conclude that both exist   because he himself knew but one   because after all the researches i have made i have not been able to discover more than one kind because gesner and other naturalists mention only one species under the name of mus agrestis major which they say is very common and because ray says that the other kind called mus domesticus medius is also very common hence it is apparent that none of these authors have ever seen both kinds since they acknowledge both to be very common   because in this single species individuals are found of a larger and lesser size this circumstance might lead them to consider the small as of one species and the large of another lastly because the descriptions are too vague and inaccurate to establish a specific difference  the ancients indeed mention two species the one under the denomination of mus agrestis major the other under that of mus agrestis minor these two species are very common and we know them as well as the ancients the first is our longtailed fieldmouse the second is not the mus domesticus medius of ray but another animal known by the name of the shorttailed fieldmouse or little fieldrat and as it differs both from the rat and the longtailed fieldmouse i have given it its italian name compagnoli or compagnol  the longtailed fieldmouse as i formerly remaked lives in dry and elevated grounds in the woods and adjacent fields they are found in vast numbers they retire into holes among the brushwood and under the trunks of trees where they amass great quantities of acorns nuts and beechmast sometimes a whole bushel is found in a single hole and this hoard is not proportioned to the wants of the animal but to the capacity of the place where it is deposited these holes are generally more than a foot under ground and often divided into two apartments the one for living in along with their young and the other for a magazine i have frequently seen great damage done to the plantations by these animals they carry off the new sown acorns by following the furrow of the plough they dig up one after another not leaving a sngle seed this happens chiefly in those seasons when the acorns are scarce not finding enough in the woods they come in quest of them in the cultivated fields and do not eat them on the spot but transport them to their holes where they amass such quantities tities that they often corrupt these creatures alone do more mischief in a nursery of trees than all the birds and other animals put together the only way to prevent this damage is to lay traps at ten paces asunder through the extent of the sown ground no other apparatus is necessary than a roasted walnut placed under a flat stone supported by a stick the animals come to eat the walnut which they prefer to acorns and as the walnut is fixed to the stick whenever they touch it the stone falls and crushes them to death i have used the same expedient for the destruction of the shorttailed fieldmouse who likewise destroy acorns when i began this operation i desired all the mice that were caught by the traps to be brought to me and found with astonishment that above  00 were taken each day from a piece of ground consisting only of about  0 french arpents from the   th of november to the  th of december above  000 were slain in this manner their numbers gradually decreased till the frost became severe when they retire to their holes and feed upon the magazines they have collected it is more than  0 years since i made this trial which i always repeated when i sowed treeseeds and never failed to catch vast quantities of these mice they abound chiefly in autumn their numbers being much less in the spring for if provisions fail during the winter the strong devour the weak the longtailed field mice likewise eat the shorttailed species

arising from them their skin is hardly of any value and their flesh though eatable is not so good as to be much demanded but it might be improved by keeping them in warrens where they would have the benefit of fresh air and the liberty of choosing herbs agreeable to their taste those kept in houses have nearly the same bad taste with warrenrabbits and those kept in gardens during summer have an insipid but less disagreeable savor  the temperament of these animals is so hot and premature that they copulate five or six weeks after their birth they acquire not however their full growth before the  th or  th month but this increase of size consists only of fat for the solid parts are fully unfolded before the age of six months the females go with young only three weeks and i have known them

young twelve or fifteen days she banishes them as soon as she receives the male which happens at farthest three weeks after her delivery and if any of them persist in following her they are maletreated and slain by the father thus these animals produce at least every two months and as their young bring forth in the same space we are astonished at their rapid and numerous multiplication from a single couple we may have  000 in one year but their destruction is as rapid as their propagation they are killed by cold and by moisture they allow themselves without resistance to be eaten by

their offspring and even allow themselves to be devoured without resistance they seem to have no distinct sentiment but that of love when under the influence of this passion they are susceptible of anger fight cruelly and even kill each other in disputing the possession of a female they pass their lives in sleeping eating and amors their sleep is short but frequent they eat every hour both day and night and they indulge in mutual embraces as often as they eat though perpetually throwing out urine they never drink they feed on all kinds of herbs but especially on parsley which they prefer to grain or to bread they are likewise fond of apples and other fruits they eat precipitantly like the rabbit little at a time but very often they make a kind of grunting noise similar to that of a young pig a kind of chirping noise marks the time of their amors and they raise a sharp cry when they feel pain they are extremely delicate and so impatient of cold that it is difficult to preserve them

things and the hedgehog but one important thing is a proverbial saying of the ancients zenodotus plutarchus et alii ex archilocho  the latter knows how to defend himself without fighting and to wound without making an attack having little strength and less agility for flight he has received from nature a spinous armor with the faculty of rolling himself up like a ball and of presenting on all sides those sharp weapons which repel the enemy the more he is harassed he rolls himself up the closer his fears tend still farther to defend him for by throwing out his urine the smell and humidity of which spreads over his whole body he completely disgusts the enemy thus most dogs content themselves with barking and never choose to seize the hedgehog the fox however accomplishes his end by wounding the animals feet and making the blood run into its mouth but the hedgehog is proof against the weasel the martin the polecat the ferret and birds of prey from the head to the tail both male and female are equally covered with spines and only the under parts of their bodies are garnished with hair but those arms which are so useful to them in defending against enemies become exceeding inconvenient when they want to unite they cannot copulate in the manner of other quadrupeds but face to face either on end or lying the females come in season in the spring and bring forth in the

devoured them one after another this was not the effect of hunger for she eat bread meat and fruits one would never have imagined that an animal so slow and indolent could be so impatient of confinement it even possesses the same species of malevolence with that of the monkey a hedgehog that had slipped into the kitchen took the meat out of a small kettle and defiled it with his ordure i kept males and females in a room together but though they lived they never coupled i left several of them in my gardens where they did so little mischief that it could hardly be perceived they live upon fallen fruits and dig the earth to a small depth with their noses they eat maybugs beetles grasshoppers worms and some roots they are likewise fond of fleshmeat which they devour either raw or roasted in the country they are frequently found in the woods under the trunks of old trees in the cliffs of rocks and particularly among the stones collected upon the fields and vineyards i am

transporting fruits or grapes they seize with the mouth every thing they eat and though they abound in our forests they have never been discovered upon trees but are always found in holes or under the moss they stir not during the day but go about the whole night they approach not the habitations of men but though they sometimes appear in the meadows they prefer dry and elevated grounds they are taken by the hand never fly nor defend themselves with their feet or their teeth but when touched they roll up in the form of a ball and will not extend themselves unless they be plunged in water they

mouse seems to form a link in the chain of small animals and to fill the interval between the rat and the mole which though they resemble each other in size differ greatly in figure and are very

than those of the mouse by the number of its toes having five on each foot by the tail and legs especially the hindlegs which are shorter than those of the mouse by the ears and lastly by the teeth this little animal has a strong and peculiar odor which is very disagreeable to the cats who pursue and kill but never eat the shrews it is probably this bad smell and the reluctance of the cats which have given rise to the vulgar prejudice that the bite of the shrewmouse is venomous and particulary hurtful to horses but the shrew is neither venomous nor is it capable of biting for the aperture of its mouth is not large enough to take in a duplicature of another animals skin which is absolutely necessary to the action of biting the disease of horses vulgarly ascribed to the bite of the shrewmouse is a swelling or blotch and proceeds from an internal cause which has no relation to a bite this animal especially in winter frequents haylofts stables barns and dunghills it feeds upon grain insects and putrid flesh in the country it frequents the woods and lives upon grain it conceals itself under moss and the leaves and trunks of trees and sometimes in the holes abandoned by the mole or in smaller holes which it digs with its muzzle and claws the shrew produces an equal number though not so frequently as the mouse its cry is also much sharper but it is not near so agile it is

perpetual vigor so lively and reciprocal an attachment subsists between the male and female that they seem to dread or to disrelish all other society they enjoy the placid habits of repose and of solitude the art of securing themselves from disquiet and injury of instantaneously making an asylum or habitation of extending its dimensions and of finding a plentiful subsistence without the necessity of going abroad these are the manners the dispositions and the talents of the mole and they are unquestionably preferable to talents more brilliant and more incompatible with happiness than the most profound obscurity  the mole shuts up the entrance of her retreat and seldom leaves it unless compelled by the admission of water or when its mansion is demolished by art she makes a round vault in the meadows and generally a long trench in the gardens because it is easier to remove cultivated ground than a turf rendered compact and solid by the roots of herbs she continues not long in miry nor in hard stony ground but delights in a soft earth stored with esculent roots and well peopled with insects and worms which constitute her chief nourishment  as the moles seldom leave their subterranean abodes they have few enemies and easily elude the carnivorous animals the overflowing of rivers is their greatest scourge during inundations they are seen swimming in vast numbers and using every effort to gain the more elevated grounds but most of them perish as well as their young who remain in their holes without this devastation the great talents they have for multiplying would render them extremely incommodious to man they couple about the end of winter and go but a short time with young for we find them very small in the month of may they generally bring forth four or five at a time and it is easy to distinguish the hillocks under which they litter for they are larger and made with more art than the common kind i believe those animals bring forth more than once a year but of this i cannot be certain it is a fact however that we meet with young ones from april to august perhaps some of them may be later in coupling than others  the habitation where they deposit their young merits a particular description because it is constructed with singular intelligence they begin with raising the earth and forming a pretty high arch they leave partitions or a kind of pillars at certain distances beat and press the earth interweave it with the roots of plants and render it so hard and solid that the water cannot penetrate the vault on account of its convexity and firmness they then elevate a little hillock below upon the top of which they lay herbs and leaves for a bed to their young in this situation they are above the level of the ground and consequently out of the reach of ordinary inundations and are at the same time defended from the rains by the large vault that covers the internal one upon the convexity of which they rest along with their young this internal hillock or vault is pierced on all sides with sloping holes which descend still lower and serve as subterraneous passages for the mother to go in quest of food for herself and her offspring these bypath are firm and beaten extend about twelve or fifteen paces and issue from the mansion like rays from a center we likewise find under the superior vault the remains of the roots of the colchicum or meadow saffron which seem to be the first food given to the young from this description it is apparent that the mole never comes out but at a considerable distance from her habitation and that the most simple and most certain method of taking both the old and the young is to make a round trench which will cut off all the communicating passages but as the mole upon the smallest noise flies and endeavors to carry off her young it will be necessary to employ three or four men with spades to raise the hillock at once or to make a trench almost instantaneously and then to seize them or to watch them as they attempt to escape  it has been foolishly asserted by some writers ursus meles erinaceus talpa vespertilio per hyemem dormiunt abstemii linn faun suec p    that the mole and

functions they are a kind of hands ten times larger than the feet and four times longer than the body of the animal in fine they are parts which have rather the air of caprice than of a regular production this membrane covers the arm forms the wings or hands of the animal unites with the skin of the body and at the same time surrounds the legs and even the tail which by this bizarre conjunction becomes in some measure one of its toes to these discrepancies and disproportions of the body and its members may be added the deformities of the head which are often much greater for in some species the nose is hardly visible the eyes are sunk near the ear and confounded with the cheeks in others the ears are as long as the body or the face is twisted into the form of a horseshoe and the nose turned up like a cocks comb all of them have small obscure covered eyes a nose or rather nostrils illformed and a mouth extending from ear to ear they all likewise endeavor to conceal themselves fly the light inhabit dark places only from which they never go out but during the night return at break of day and fasten themselves against the walls their motion in the air is rather a desultory fluttering than flying which they execute very aukwardly with difficulty they raise themselves from the earth and never fly to any great height they quicken relax or direct their flight in a manner the most bungling and imperfect their flight is neither rapid nor direct but consists of quick vibrations in an oblique and winding direction they fail not however in passing to seize flies gnats and particularly moths which fly only during the night these they swallow almost entire and we find in their excrements portions of wings and other dry and indigestible parts of moths having one day descended into the caverns of arcy to examine the stalactites i was surprised to find in a place covered with alabaster and so dark and profound a kind of earth which was totally different it was a thick mass several feet in extent of a blackish matter almost entirely composed of fragments of the wings and legs of flies and moths as if immense numbers of these insects had assembled in order to die and corrupt together this however was nothing else but the dung of bats probably amassed during many years in a favorite part of these subterranean caverns for through the whole of these caverns which extend above half a quarter of a league i saw no other collection of this matter and i imagined that the bats had fixed upon this place for their common abode because it was reached by a glimmering light from an aperture in the rock and that they chose not to go farther lest they should be lost in a darkness too profound  bats are real quadrupeds excepting the faculty of flying they have nothing in common with birds but as the action of flying implies great strength in the upper and anterior parts of the body the bats have their pectoral muscles much stronger and more fleshy than those of quadrupeds and in this they have an affinity to the birds they differ from them however in every other part of their structure both external and internal the lungs the heart the organs of generation and all the other viscera are similar to those of quadrupeds excepting the penis which is pendulous and loose a thing peculiar to man the monkeys and the bats like the quadrupeds the bats are viviparous and have teeth and paps they are said to bring forth but two at a time and that they suckle their young and even carry them when flying in summer they copulate and bring forth for they are in a torpid state during winter some cover themselves with their wings as with a mantle and suspend themselves by the hind feet to the vaults of subterraneous caverns others stick fast to old walls or retire into holes wherever they take up their winter abode they always assemble in such numbers as secure them against the effects of cold they pass the winter without food or motion never awake till the spring and again retire at the end of autumn they support hunger better than cold though carnivorous animals they can subsist several days without food when they get into a lardner they fix upon the suspended meat and eat flesh whether raw or roasted fresh or corrupted  only two species of bats have formerly been described as natives of our climate beside these m daubenton has discovered other six which are equally numerous and common and it is therefore astonishing that they should so long have escaped notice these seven species are perfectly distinct and never associate together  the first which is well known is the common bat of which we have already given the synonimes  the second or longeared bat with ears an inch long thin and almost pellucid the body and tail are only one inch and three quarters long this and all other bats except the ternates and the horseshoe have a  or internal year serving as a valve to close the greater when the animal is asleep

than the common bat the longeared bat is much less than the common species its wings are likewise shorter its muzzle smaller and sharper and its ears of an immoderate size  the third species which we shall denominate the noctule from the italian word notula was not known though very common in france and even more frequent than the two preceding species this bat is found under the eaves of houses castles and churches and also in the hollows of old trees it is nearly as large as the common bat its ears are broad and short its hair reddish and it has a sharp piercing voice like the sound of a small bell the noctule has the nose slightly bilobated ears small and rounded on the chin a minute verruca hair of a reddish ash color length to the rump two inches eight tenths tail one inch seven tenths extent of the wings    inches pennants synops of quad p       the fourth species we shall call the serotine it is smaller than the common bat or noctule and nearly of an equal size with the longeared bat but it differs from the latter in having short pointed ears blacker wings and the hair of a deeper brown the serotine has a longish nose and short ears but broad at the base the hair on the upper part of the body is brown mixed with ferruginous and the belly of a paler color the length from nose to rump is two inches and a half pennants synops of quad p   0   the fifth species we shall name pipistrelle from the italian word pipistrello which likewise signifies a bat the pipistrelle is not near so large as the common bat the serotine the noctule oreven the longeared kind it is the smallest and least ugly of all the bats though the upper lip is turgid the eyes small and deep sunk and the front much covered with hair the pipistrelle has a small nose the upper lip swells out a little on each side the ears are broad and the forehead covered with long hair the color of the upper part of the body is a yellowish brown that of the lower part dusky and the lips are yellow it is the least of bats not one inch and a quarter long to the rump the extent of the wings six inches and a half pennants synops of quad p   0   the sixth species i call barbastelle from the italian word barbastello which also signifies a bat this animal is nearly of the same size with the longeared species its ears are as broad but not near so long the name barbastelle is the better adapted to it because it appears to have large whiskers this however is only an appearance occasioned by the turgidness of the cheeks which form a kind of pudding above the lips the muzzle is very short the nose much flattened and the eyes near the ears the barbastelle has a sunk forehead long broad ears the lower part of the inner sides touching each other conceal the face and head when looked at in front the nose is short and the end of it flatted the cheeks are full the upper part of the body is of a dusky brown the lower ashcolored and brown its length to the rump about two inches and the extent of the wings ten and a half pennants synops of quad p   0   lastly we shall call the seventh species the horseshoe the countenance of this animal is remarkably deformed the most striking feature is a membrane in the shape of a horseshoe which surrounds the nose and the upper lip in france it is very common and frequents the walls and vaults of old houses some of them are larger and others smaller but they are otherwise so similar in form that we consider them as of the same species but as i have remarked this difference without finding any of an intermediate size i cannot determine whether it is an effect of different ages or a constant variety in the same species this bat has a membrane at the end of the nose in form of a horseshoe the ears are long broad at the base and sharp pointed inclining backward it wants the little or internal ear color of the upper part of the body cinereous of the lower whitish there is a greater and less variety the greater is above three inches and a

      we have three species of this animal the fat squirrel the garden squirrel and the dormouse which like the marmot sleep during the winter of these the fat squirrel is the largest and the dormouse the least several authors have confounded these three species though they are easily distinguishable the fat squirrel is about the size of the common squirrel and has its tail covered with long hair the garden squirrel is not so large as a rat has very short hair on its tail excepting near the extremity where it is bushy the dormouse is not larger than the common mouse the hair on its tail is longer than that of the garden squirrel but shorter than that of the fat squirrel and terminates bushy the garden squirrel differs from the other two by having black spots near its eyes and the dormouse by having whitish hair upon its back all the three are white or whitish on the throat and belly but the garden squirrel is of a fine white the fat squirrel only whitish and the dormouse rather yellowish than white in all the under parts of the body  these animals are improperly said to sleep during winter for it is not a state of natural sleep but a torpor or numbness of the senses and members produced by a chillness of the blood the internal heat of these creatures exceeds not that of the air when the heat of the air is ten degrees above the freezing point their temperature is precisely the same i have plunged the ball of a thermometer into the bodies of several living garden squirrels and found their internal heat to be always nearly equal to the temperature of the air i have even seen the thermometer sink a degree or half a degree when applied to the heart the temperature of the air being at that time only    now we know that the heat of man and of most quadrupeds is always more than  0 degrees it is not therefore surprising that these animals whose heat is so small should fall into a benumbed state whenever their internal heat is not augmented by that of the external air and this always happens when the thermometer exceeds not ten or eleven degrees above the freezing point this is the true cause of the torpid state of what are called the sleeping animals a cause which though common to all animals that sleep during winter has hitherto been overlooked i have discovered it in the three animals under consideration in the hedgehogs and in the bats and though i have never had an opportunity of examining the marmot i am persuaded that its blood like that of the other sleepers is cold because it is subject to torpor during the winter  this torpid state continues as long as the cause by which it is produced and ceases with the cold a few degrees of heat above ten or eleven is sufficient to reanimate them and if kept in a warm place during the winter they are never benumbed but go about and eat and sleep from time to time like other animals when they feel cold they roll themselves up in the form of a ball in order to expose less surface to the air and to preserve their natural warmth it is in this form that they are found during the winter in hollow trees and in holes of walls exposed to the south there they lie without the smallest motion upon moss and leaves and though tossed about they neither extend themselves nor exhibit any signs of life from this state nothing can rouse them but the application of a gentle and gradual heat for they die when suddenly brought near a fire though in this state they have no motion though their eyes are shut and they seem to be deprived of every sensation yet they feel pain when it is acute a wound or a burn makes them contract and utter a low cry which they even repeat several times hence their internal sensibility as well as the action of the heart and lungs still subsist it is presumable however that these vital motions act not with equal force as when the animal is in its ordinary state the circulation it is probable proceeds in the large vessels only the respiration is slow and feeble the secretions are inconsiderable and no excrements are voided there must likewise be little or no perspiration since they pass several months without eating which could not happen if they lost as much of their substance by this means as they do at other times when they have an opportunity of repairing this natural waste by taking nourishment they still however lose some part because in long winters they die in their holes perhaps likewise it is not the duration but the rigor of the cold that destroys them for they soon die when exposed to a strong frost what induces me to think that they perish not by loss of substance is that in autumn they are exceedingly fat and equally so when they revive in the spring this quantity of fat serves for an internal nourishment to the animal and supplies what it loses by respiration  as cold is the only cause of their torpor and as they fall not into this state but when the temperature of the air is below ten or eleven degrees they frequently revive during the winter for in this season there are often many days when the liquor in the thermometer stands at          and even higher degrees and during fine weather of this kind the dormice come out of their holes in quest of food or eat what they had collected in autumn aristotle and all the succeeding naturalists have asserted that the dormice pass the whole winter without eating that in this season of abstinence they grow very fat and that they are better nourished by sleep alone than other animals by food this notion is both absurd and impossible the dormouse who sleeps four or five months could only fatten by the air it respires supposing a part of this air to be converted into nourishment an augmentation so considerable could never result from it it would not even be sufficient to repair the continual waste occasioned by perspiration aristotle might be led into this error by the mild winters of greece where the dormice sleep not perpetually but often revive take plenty of food and are therefore extremely fat though in a torpid state the truth is they are fat at all times and particularly in summer and autumn their flesh resembles that of the guineypig the romans reckoned dormice among their most delicate dishes and reared them in great quantities varro describes the method of making warrens for them and we learn from appicius the manner of dressing them in the high taste of his times in this practice whether from a disgust at these animals because they resemble rats or from the badness of their flesh the romans have not been followed by other nations i have been informed by peasants who had eat them that they were not better than waterrats besides the fat squirrel is the only species that is eatable the flesh of the garden squirrel is bad and has a disagreeable flavor  in manners and dispositions the fat squirrel greatly resembles the common species it lives in forests climbs trees and leaps from branch to branch with less agility indeed because the squirrel has longer legs and a body more light and meagre they both however live upon the same food namely filberts chestnuts and wild fruits the fat squirrel likewise eats small birds which he takes in their nests he makes not a nest in the tops of trees like the squirrel but he makes a bed of moss in the hollows of their trunks or in the cliffs of rocks but he always chooses a dry place he abhors moisture drinks little and seldom descends on the ground he differs still more from the squirrel in this circumstance that the latter is easily tamed and the former continues always wild they couple in the end of spring and the females bring forth in summer the litter generally consisting of four or five the young grow quickly and we are assured that they live only six years in italy where these animals are still eat the natives dig pits in the woods and strew them with straw moss and beachmast they choose dry places under the shelter of rocks and with a south exposure to these the fat squirrels resort in great numbers and the people find them there in a torpid state toward the end of autumn when they are in the best condition for eating these small animals are bold and defend their young to the last extremity they bite violently with their foreteeth which are very long and of great strength they neither fear the weasel nor small birds of prey they escape from the fox because he cannot follow them to the tops of trees their most formidable enemies are the martins and wild cats  the fat squirrels are not very generally diffused they appear not in very cold climates such as those of lapland and sweden at least they are not mentioned by the northern naturalists the species they describe is the dormouse which is the least of the three neither i imagine are they to be met with in very warm countries because our travelers are silent on this article there are few or none in open countries like britain they require temperate climates abounding with wood we find them in spain in france in greece in italy in germany and in switzerland where they live in the forests upon the hills and not on the tops of high mountains like the

a very long naked tail and the spine of the back arched like that of the squirrel its body is likewise thicker and it has whiskers like a cat it is not above nine or ten years since this species was

numbers of them both living and dead and communicated to me the remarks he had made upon this new species the males are larger stronger and more mischievous than the females when hard pursued or when we attempt to seize them they face about and bite the stick or the hand that strikes them their bite is not only cruel but dangerous for it is instantly followed by a considerable swelling and the wound though small is long in healing the females bring forth three times a year hence two individuals of this species may produce at least    young in    months the mothers prepare a bed for their offspring some of the females sent us whom we kept in cages were with young and two or three days before they brought forth we observed that they gnawed the wood of the cages and made of the cuttings which were in considerable quantities a convenient bed for their little ones  the brown rats have some qualities which make them approach to the nature of the waterrat though every where diffused they seem to prefer the banks of waters the dogs pursue them with the same remarkable fury as they chase the waterrat when pursued and they find it equally easy to take to the water or to conceal themselves in brushwood they choose the water enter it without fear and swim with great dexterity and ease this phenomenon is chiefly exhibited when they cannot regain their holes for like the longtailed fieldmouse they dig subterraneous retreats or rather they nestle in those made by the rabbits the brown rats may be taken in their holes by ferrets who pursue them with equal ardour as they do the rabbit  these animals pass the summer in the country and though they feed principally upon fruits and grain they eat young hares partridges and fowls when they enter a henhouse like the polecat they kill more than they can eat toward the month of november the mother and all the young quit the fields and come in troops into the barns where they do infinite mischief by mincing the straw consuming the grain and infecting every thing with their ordure the old males remain in the fields each inhabiting his own hole where like the fieldmice they amass acorns beachmast etc filling the holes to the top and remaining themselves at the bottom they sleep not like the dormouse but go out in winter especially when the weather is mild those who take up their abode in barns banish all the

aldrovandus is only the commentator of gesner and authors of less note have implicitly copied him we hesitate not therefore to borrow facts from him with regard to the marmots who are natives of his country and concerning whom he was better informed than us though like him we have kept several of them in a state of confinement what he says corresponds so exactly with our own observations that we doubt not the truth of his remarks when he retails facts of which we have no knowledge  the marmot when taken young may be rendered nearly as tame as our domestic animals he learns to seize a stick to dance to perform various gesticulations and to obey the voice of his master like the cat he has an antipathy against dogs when he begins to be familiar in the house and perceives that he is protected by his master he attacks and bites dogs of the most formidable kind though not so large as a hare he is stouter and his strength is aided by a peculiar suppleness and dexterity with his foreteeth which are pretty long he bites most cruelly he attacks not however either dogs or men unless when he is irritated if not prevented he gnaws furniture and stuffs and when confined even pierces through wood as his limbs are short and his toes fashioned like those of the bear he often sits on end and walks with ease on his hindlegs he carries food to his mouth with the forelegs and eats in the manner of a squirrel he runs pretty quick up hill but slowly on a plain he climbs trees and mounts between the cliffs of rocks or two adjoining walls and the savoyards it is said learned from the marmots to climb for the purpose of sweeping chimneys they eat every thing presented to them as flesh bread fruit roots pot herbs maybugs grasshoppers etc but milk and butter they prefer to every other aliment though less inclined to theft than the cat they endeavor to slip into the dairy where they drink great quantities of milk making like the cat a murmuring noise expressive of pleasure besides milk is the only liquor that is agreeable to them for they rarely drink water and they refuse wine  as to figure the marmot has some resemblance both to the bear and to the rat it is not however as perrault and some others imagined the arctomys or bearrat of the ancients its nose lips and form of the head resemble those of the hare it has the hair and claws of the badger the teeth of the beaver the whiskers of the cat the eyes of the fat squirrel and the legs of the bear the tail is short and the ears terminate abruptly the hair on the back is of a reddish brown color more or less deep this hair is pretty rude but that of the belly is reddish soft and bushy its voice resembles the murmuring of a young dog when caressed or in a sporting humor but when irritated or frighted it makes a whistling noise so loud and piercing that it hurts the ear it loves cleanliness and retires like the cat to void its ordure but like the rat it has a very strong disagreeable smell especially in summer it is remarkably fat in autumn besides a large epiploon it has two very thick fatty follicles all the parts of its body however are not equally fat the back and reins are loaded with firm and solid fat similar to the flesh of a cows udder thus the marmot would make very good eating if it had not always a disagreeble odor which cannot be concealed but by very strong seasonings  this animal which delights in the regions of frost and snow and which is only found on the tops of the highest mountains is more subject than any other to be rendered torpid by cold in the end of september or beginning of october he retires into his hole from which he comes not out till the beginning of april his retreat is made with precaution and furnished with art it is capacious broader than long and very deep so that it can contain several marmots without any danger from the corrupting of the air with their feet and claws which are admirably adapted for the purpose they dig the earth with amazing quickness and throw it behind them it is not a hole or a straight or winding tube but a species of gallery made in the form of a y each branch of which has an aperture and both terminate in one where the animal lodges as the whole is made on the declivity of a mountain the innermost part alone is on a level both branches of the y are inclined and the one is used for depositing the excrements of the animals and the other for their going out and coming in the place of their abode is well lined with moss and hay of which they make ample provision during the summer it is even affirmed that this labor is carried on jointly that some cut the finest herbage which is collected by others and that they alternately serve as vehicles for transporting it to their dens one it is said lies down on his back allows himself to be loaded with hay extends his limbs and others trail him in this manner by the tail taking care not to overset him these repeated frictions are assigned as the reason why the hair is generally rubbed off from their backs but it is more probable that this effect is produced by their frequent digging of the earth which is sufficient to peel the hair off their backs whatever may be in this it is certain that they dwell together and work in common at their habitations where they pass three fourths of their lives thither they retire during rain or upon the approach of danger and never go out but in fine weather and even then to no great distance one stands sentinel upon a rock while the others sport on the grass or are employed in cutting it to make hay when the sentinel perceives a man an eagle a dog etc he alarms the rest by a loud whistle and is himself the last to enter the hole  they make no provisions for winter as if they divined that they would then have no use for victuals but when they perceive the first approaches of the sleeping season they set to work in shutting up the two entrances of their habitation and this they perform with such labor and solidity that it is easier to dig the earth any where else than in the parts they have fortified they are at this time very fat weighing sometimes twenty pounds and they continue to be plump for three months but afterward gradually decay and are extremely emaciated at the end of winter when discovered in their retreats they are found rolled up in the form of a ball covered with hay and they are carried off in so torpid a state that they may be killed without seeming to feel pain the fattest are chosen for eating and the young ones for taming like the dormice they are revived by a gradual heat and those which are fed in houses and kept warm never become torpid but are equally lively and active in the winter as in the summer as to the sleeping of the marmot we shall not repeat what was said under the article of the fat fquirrel the cooling of the blood is the sole cause of this pheanomenon and it has been remarked by other writers that in this torpid condition the circulation as well as all the secretions were extremely languid and that the blood not being renewed by fresh accessions of chyle has no serosity phil trans no      whether they remain constantly torpid for seven or eight months as is alleged by most authors is uncertain their holes are deep and they live together in numbers a considerable heat therefore must be preserved for some time and they may eat the herbage they have amassed we are even told by m altmann in his treatise on the animals of switzerland that the hunters allow the marmots to remain unmolested for three weeks or a month that they never dig in soft weather or during a warm wind that without these precautions the marmots awaken and dig still deeper but that by opening their retreats during hard frosts only they find them so torpid as to be carried off with ease we may therefore conclude that they in every respect resemble the dormice and that if they remain longer torpid it is because they inhabit a climate where the winter is longer  these animals produce but once a year and the litter generally consists of three or four the growth of their young is very quick they live only nine or ten years and the species is neither numerous nor much diffused the greeks were unacquainted with the marmot or at least they have made no mention of it among the latins pliny is the first who takes notice of it under the name of mus alpinus or alpine rat and indeed though there are several species of rats in the alps none of them is so remarkable as the marmot or like it live in the summits of the highest mountains the other species confine themselves to the valleys the sides of the hills or first mountains besides the marmot never descends from the heights but seems peculiarly attached to the chain of the alps and to prefer a south or east exposure to that of the north or west he is found however in the appennines the pyrenees and the highest mountains of germany the bobak of poland auctuarium hist not poloniae auct rzaczynski p      to which m brisson regn anim p      and after him messrs arnault de nobleville et salerne hist not des animaux  have given the name of marmot differs from this animal not only in color but in the number of toes for it has five toes on the fore feet the claw of the great toe appears beyond the skin and we find within the two phalanges of the fifth toe which is entirely wanting in the marmot hence the bobak or polish marmot the mouax or marmot of canada the cavia or marmot of bahama and the cricet or marmot of strasburgh are all different species from the alpine marmot  supplement i have here given the figure of an animal called monax or marmot of canada the design was sent me by mr colinson but without any description this species of marmot seems to differ from the other marmots by its having only four toes on the forefeet while the alpine marmot and the bobak or polish marmot have five toes both on the fore and the hind feet there is also some difference in the form of the head which is more thinly covered with hair the tail of the monax is longer and less bushy than that of the common marmot so that this canada animal may regarded rather as a neighboring species than as a simple variety of the alpine marmot in this species i presume the animal called the whistler by baron hontan may be ranked voyage du baron de la honton tom   p     he says that it is found in the northern parts of canada that it is nearly of the size of a hare but shorter in the body that it is hunted only for its skin which is much valued but that its flesh is not good he adds that the canadians call these animals whistlers because in fine weather they whistle at the entrance to their holes which he has frequently heard our alpine marmot makes the same kind of whistling noise  the marmot of kamtschatka the russian travelers have discovered an animal in kamtschatka which they have called a marmot but of which they have given us only a very slight intimation they tell us that its skin resembles at a distance the variegated plumage of a beautiful bird that like the squirrel it uses its forefeet in eating and that it feeds on roots berries and cedarnuts it is worthy of remark that the expression cedarnuts presents a false idea for the true cedar bears cones and other trees called by the name of cedars bear berries  the marmot of the cape of good hope we owe the first notices of this animal to m allamand a learned naturalist and professor at leyden m pallas has described it under the name of cavia capensis and m vosmaer under that of the bastard african marmot both have given a figure of it from the same plate of which m allamand has sent me a copy in writing on this subject to m daubenton he remarks  i send you the figure of a species of cabiai i know no other name to give it which i received from the cape of good hope it is not so well drawn as i could wish but as i have the animal stuffed in my cabinet if you are inclined i shall transmit it to you by the first opportunity  we accepted not this obliging offer of m allamand because we were soon after informed that one or two of these animals had arrived in holland alive and hoped that some naturalist would furnish us with an exact description both mr pallas and vosmaer have accordingly described this animal and i shall here give extracts from their remarks  this animal says m vosmaer is known at the cape of good hope under the name of the rock badger probably because it lives among rocks and under the earth like the badger to which however it has no resemblance it has a greater affinity to the marmot and yet it differs considerably from that animal kolbe is the first who mentions this animal and he says that it resembles the marmot more than the badger  we shall adopt the name of the marmot of the cape in preference to that of the cavia because it differs from the cavia or cabiai in many respects   in the climate the cavia being an animal of south america while the other is found only in africa   because cavia is a brasilian word and ought not to be transported into africa since it belongs to the true cavia and to the caviacobaia or guineypig lastly because the cabiai inhabits only the margins of waters and has membranes between its toes but the marmot of the cape lives among rocks and in dry grounds which it can dig with its claws  the first animal of this species says m vosmaer that appeared in europe was sent by m tulbagh to the prince of orange and its skin is still preserved in his cabinet the color of the first differed greatly from that of another which arrived afterward it was very young and very small that which i am about to describe was a male and was sent me by m bergmeyer of amsterdam the life of this animal according to my information is very melancholy for it slept much during the voyage its motion is slow and performed by leaps but perhaps in a natural state it is equally active as the rabbit its cries were frequent but short sharp and piercing  i shall observe in passing that this character brings the animal still closer to the marmot for the alpine marmots often make a sharp whistling noise  in holland continues m vosmaer they feed this marmot with bread and different kinds of pot herbs it is probable that this animal brings forth often and in great numbers the form of their feet indicates that they are destined for digging the earth the present marmot having died at amsterdam i gave it for dissection to m pallas  in stature it resembles the common rabbit but it is thicker and more collected the belly is peculiarly gross the eyes are beautiful and of an ordinary size the eyebrows both above and below are garnished with some short black hairs above which there are five or six hairs of the same color but long that turn back toward the head it has similar whiskers on the upper lip about the middle of the muzzle  the nose is black naked and divided by a fine future which descends to the lip the nostrils resemble a cord broke through the middle under the muzzle on the throat and the cheeks are some long rude black hairs and hairs of the same kind are scattered over the whole body in the palate there are eight deep furrows the tongue is very thick tolerably long garnished with small papillae and oval at the point in the upper jaw there are two strong teeth which protrude over the under jaw and are considerably distant from each other having a kind of triangular appearance in the under jaw it has four close cutting teeth which are very broad long and flat the grinders of which it has four on each side are also large and a fifth of a smaller size may be added to the number its forelegs are short and half covered with the skin of the body the feet are black and naked those before have four toes the one in the middle longest and the exterior one is shorter and seems to adhere to the third the toes are armed with round short claws which adhere to the skin like the human nails there are three toes on the hind feet the middle one only is furnished with a crooked claw and the exterior toe is shorter than the others the animal leaps on its hind legs like the rabbit it has not the smallest vestige of a tail the color of the hair is gray or a yellowish brown nearly like that of a wild rabbit but it is deeper upon the head and back and the breast and belly are whitish there is also a whitish belt upon the neck and near the shoulders this belt forms not a collar but terminates at the top of the forelegs in general the hair is soft and woolly  plate
