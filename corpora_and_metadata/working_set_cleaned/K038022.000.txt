preface the author presents his compliments to the ladies and gentlemen engaged in the hotel particularly mr king mr parsons and miss p hopkins  with pleasure acquiesces in the general opinion that the principal success and uncommon applause the subsequent petite piece has been received with is very justly attributed to the great attention and excellence of the performance for which they have his best thanks and warmest good wishes  and with regard to any merit he might lay claim to in the production the situation of an author as described in the underwritten passage denique non omnes

bard  then who would break a rule framed and established in the earliest school or who so jealous of anothers fame to damp a spark just rising to a flame and yet  from our reports within  it is said there are  some wits amongst ye  so ill bred they come  unknowing  wherefore  or for why  to break on criticwheel  a butterfly but sure my eyes  and they are not bad good folks can easy read  these

working at the tambour tabby waiting flavia and are you sure tabby the postman had no letters for me today i am certain it was his rap which has more music in it to the ears of an expecting lover than the most favorite air of a fisher or bach   tabby indeed madam were i young and handsome as you are i would not be balkd about it for though mr montague neglects writing sir john seymour would not had he the same opportunity   flavia sir john seymour what know you pray of sir john seymour  rising displeased at her pertness tabby nay nothing madam only    flavia only what i charge you speak   tabby that he must love you madam and that dearly to be so vast generous as he is to me upon all occasions   flavia i hope you dont accept of any favors from him   tabby lord madam he does the favor so genteely and so privately there is no refusing the gentleman   flavia i charge you as you value your place to decline any thing his generosity offers as you are not to learn of my fathers having early contracted me to another abroad   tabby and yet madam i should think a bird in the cage is worth two in the air and as to my old master sir jacob so as he parts not with his money he cares not i believe had you married the hoitytoity man from beyond sea or were to elope with our robin   flavia i must tell you you give your tongue a liberty very unbecoming depending i suppose for your security on the confidence i have placed in you but as my prior engagement prevents i fear any honorable conclusion with sir john i beg no more impertinence on that head   tabby pertly madam i can be secret as well as another when services are thus rewarded   flavia leave me  reseating herself at the tambour tabby they first make us familiar then wonder at our freedom  aside exit enter sir jacob not seeing flavia sir jacob returned from walking fatigued mercy on me what a pity it is one cannot take a hackneycoach as formerly i used a seat in a playhouse at half price it would be the certain making of me whereas this walking every day to and from change creates such an appetite that i foresee i shall eat myself out of house and home before christmas unless indeed i should be fortunate enough to be laid up with a strong fit of the gout or visited by that old family complaint the rheumatism rare disorders both for economy no eating no drinking no but why delay communicating the contents of friend wentworths letter to my daughter flavia going sees flavia ah flavia child good morrow   flavia rising sir good day to you   sir jacob ah child my good days are all over   flavia all over sir you alarm me i do not understand you   sir jacob not any thing succeeds that i undertake deceived at home disappointed abroad every day brings on new expenses and no money to pay with   flavia excuse me if i conceive you torment yourself sir without a cause as in the city i know you to be esteemed a good man   sir jacob who me child good i good heaven forgive them who say so ill of me   flavia is it then saying any ill of you sir to say you are rich   sir jacob can they say worse for supposing me rich how can i be safe shall i not be assassinated will not my house be surrounded night and day with thieves double locks treble keys and a hamper of padlocks will not avail me any thing   flavia if your affairs are as desperate as you would have them thought permit me to enquire what it is you have in that strong box in your study so curiously chained to the wall which you keep locked with treble keys and visit so regularly twice a day   sir jacob eagerly strong box child what strong box i have no strong box  that you see is an old iron chest bought as a fixture with the house and i keep it locked because there is nothing in it fit to be seen   flavia how then sir are you to defray the expenses of my marriage when    sir jacob interrupting her why that child is the very disappointment i was mentioning your intended husband mr montague is coming over it is true but it is in his coffin i hear   flavia how sir in his coffin say you   sir jacob yes our neighbor wentworth has been with me this morning with an account from abroad of his death in some absurd duel  i dont like these same duels  shall never like them again  as by this means you are at present disappointed of getting a husband  and i aside in getting rid of a daughter  mercy on me how care as a body may say mounts behind a man   flavia the manner of his death sir i own affects me and must have felt it severely had not our knowledge of each other been in its infancy when he left england are you acquainted sir with any other particulars relative to this unhappy affair   sir jacob not any one misfortune i thought sufficient to know at a time besides my thoughts were immediately turned on the hopes of recovering something from his executors on the contract for though he has lost his life child it is no reason i should lose my money   flavia how sir recover on the contract and is it possible such an idea could enter into your mind at an hour like that you received the fatal news in   sir jacob night and day child business must be minded take care of business and it will take care of you is an excellent saying and as the opinion i mean to take will cost me nothing why if i find myself without a remedy i will even oblige you and think no more about it so child i will just step in send robin to market and then to cousin capias make a case of it as of a pauper and return immediately going returns do you hear not a word of my being a good man or any strong box i charge you  exit flavia how undesignedly do we oftentimes take pains to discover the very thing we would most wish to conceal nor am i i fear if i examine my own heart less guilty in this particular than my father for with all my caution and reprimands to this maid of mine i fear she is more in the secret of my heart about sir john seymour than i could wish her surely it is a strange weakness our sex are ever guilty of in thus making confidants of those whose very interest it is oftentimes to betray us but hark  by the noise my father i fear is returned looking out as i live and with him tabby trembling like quicksilver   sir jacob noise without as he enters so madam minx you thought to escape me with this letter did you   enter sir jacob holding tabby trembling relying i warrant on my not having as much mercury in my heels now as formerly but you are mistaken you jade i have enough left yet to do your business and now pray tell me from whence comes it and for whom is it designed for i can see no direction or postmark it has looking at it as he continues holding her   flavia thanks to the happy invention of lemonjuice  aside tabby dear sir i am all over in such a fluster not knowing what you meant to be at upon the stairs that i scarce know whether i stand upon my head or my heels nor shall i be able to recover myself or tell you a single syllable this halfhour unless you take off your handcuffs   sir jacob whence had it you i say   tabby significantly from a man sir   sir jacob as i suspected and for my daughter i suppose   tabby yes sir for your daughter  my mistress   flavia aside to tabby why sure you do not mean to discover me   tabby aside trust me for that madam   sir jacob to flavia and you know it is contents perhaps   flavia not i truly sir how is it possible i should know what a letter contains before it comes to my hands and you do not seem very willing to part with it   sir jacob not till mrs pert there satisfies my curiosity by telling me from what man she had it   tabby that then sir i can soon do by assuring you i received it from mr edging the manmillener in tavistockstreet and contains i suppose some new pattern for a ruffle taken from the ladys magazine   flavia aside female policy never fails a chambermaid at a pinch i see   sir jacob oh a pattern is that all   tabby all yes sir all and a very pretty pattern no doubt you have made of yourself in this business   sir jacob peace insolence here then child giving the letter to flavia take the pattern if it is one   flavia opens it and in opening drops the cover yes sir it is a pattern i assure you and one when i have finished i hope you will approve   sir jacob as flavia is examining the supposed pattern not having any direction on it this cover may serve to keep a whole years accounts ah what would become of me if i did not stoop as he takes it up to these things myself   tabby aside what a miserable suspicious covetous old  had he been my father i believe i should have poisoned him a twelvemonth ago   sir jacob to flavia expressing looks of great pleasure at the letter why daughter you seem to be wonderfully taken methinks with that same pattern  my mind misgives me strangely  aside tabby aside how truly now does he speak without knowing it   flavia it contains to deceit believe me sir putting the letter in her pocket and with your leave will instantly go and draw it out   sir jacob well well do so child   flavia come then tabby follow me i shall have occasion for your assistance  exit tabby aside as she is taking the frame in her hand and following he little suspects i believe that fire is the engine my mistress draws with upon these occasions  exit sir jacob go for an impudent baggage  and now for neighbor capias whose opinion i must know before i discover    enter robin hastily with a basket of eggs softly rascal or you will break all the eggs why where are you running in such a plaguey hurry   robin to get dinner ready quickly and not waste the fire   sir jacob blockhead fool ass have i not told you a thousand times never to light the fire till the things for dinner are all brought into the house however i have put it out  therefore stay and    robin zooks what a  stopping his mouth as if going on   sir jacob why you rascal if i had not a little economy in these matters you could not eat as you do twice a day   robin aside and when at fathers i am sure i eat more at once   sir jacob but come let us know what sort of a bargain you have made   robin here they are the best in the market eggs at a halfpenny apiece   sir jacob and a dear bargain too looking at them too small by the sixteenth of an inch i see already oh heavens if i send such an extravagant dog as you to market i shall soon be ruined well spendthrift and how many have you brought me   robin a groats worth   sir jacob a groats worth did ever any body hear the like and what the devil sirrah can we do do you think with eight eggs   robin why sir ant we four in family   sir jacob i know it puppy but can any person eat more than one egg blockhead besides a good servant who minds his masters interest would go to the cooks cheapen every joint  taste all  buy none  and make a good meal into the bargain therefore do you hear puppy take em in and measure me four by my own eggscale  you will find it in the study  the rest you may carry back i will not have them and be sure make haste as i am but stepping to next door and shall not be long before i return  exit robin taking up the basket not having any bowels himself he never thinks of those who have measure an egg looking at them was there ever such a saveall o as he is going pinchgutfarm how have i wronged you in the many wry words i have given thee  exit enter flavia with a letter tabby following flavia well tabby this attention and constancy of sir johns knowing me contracted to another at the time he first professed a partiality for me i own is more than i expected for the men in general let them say what they will are a mere changeable silk   tabby yes madam but sir john like your old garnet and white tabby curtsying is laing you see  a hint this i think she has worn it long enough i hope she will take it  aside flavia giving the letter and now tabby to your care and management i commit this letter which if possible deliver to sir john himself i have there confirmed to him the unfortunate affair of mr montague and of my present situation   tabby taking the letter rather an unlucky affair for mr montague to be sure madam but it is an ill wind they say blows nobody good and your remedy i believe waits only to be taken to hand   flavia waste no time good tabby in talking but instantly go lest my father return and enquire for you besides i am all impatience to know the result of my letter before i speak to him on the subject   tabby good or bad i will not delay it madam and as the distance is not far i shall not be long in my return going halfmeets sir jacob and slips on one side to avoid him   enter sir jacob hastily and agitated sir jacob so so so misfortune on misfortune and no remedy on the contract how all mankind conspire to torment me  but may not cousin capias have been guilty of a little mistake in practice here the greatest lawyers have been what if i send a quaere or two to the attorney general of the ledger he is in full practice and gives his opinion gratis but then like many other opinions it may be worth nothing when i have got it as he is often more knotty than his tie sure i was born a martyr to disappointments   flavia advancing sorward what trifle has disconcerted you now sir   sir jacob trifle all alike i see seeking my ruin and where pray is that jezebel your maid   flavia gone out sir   sir jacob gone out to lay out more money perhaps   flavia rather i hope to bring some in sir if you knew all    sir jacob eagerly ay flavia how my child that is a good girl tell me and be some comfort to me in the midst of my misfortunes   flavia why sir  the letter    sir jacob well child  what of the letter tell me   flavia was as you suspected no pattern but a letter from    sir jacob from whom speak for i long to be weighing the money   flavia but you must first sir  weigh the man if my happiness has any interest with you   sir jacob that child depends entirely upon what the principal is therefore explain for as yet i understand you not   flavia you must know then sir that letter was from sir john seymour   sir jacob well child from sir john seymour go on   flavia your impatience sir prevents my proceeding   sir jacob proceed then   flavia who has long been an admirer of mine   sir jacob why i protest i begin to admire you myself child   flavia let me entreat you sir to    sir jacob well well i have done child go on   flavia but knowing the early contract you made with mr montague he despaired of success and declined carrying his partiality for me beyond a generous and polite friendship but being since informed of the unhappy fate of mr montague has ventured to write on that subject with a tender of his hand and heart in case i confirmed the truth of this information   sir jacob well and you have confirmed it have you not  still eagerly flavia i have sir and tabby is now gone with the answer   sir jacob and wrote you nothing more   flavia yes sir that i would take an early opportunity of communicating the affair to you and if possible prevail on you to permit his visits more openly   sir jacob that was dutiful and you know child i was ever easily prevailed on to your advantage  or my own sir john expects no money i suppose   flavia my situation sir has hitherto made it impossible for me ever to know his sentiments on that head   enter tabby hastily tabby eagerly with a letter not seeing sir jacob well madam i have seen sir john and here is    sir jacob snatching it out of her hand another pattern is it mrs contriver however flavia take and read it that i may know what way i may be prevailed on in this business   tabby so so my mistress has discovered all and now see who will i suppose  aside flavia opening the letter and reads my admired and muchloved flavia to a heart panting with suspense and fear your letter brought the most pleasing cordial and i shall be the happiest of men when you have gained sir jacobs consent to throw myself and fortune at your feet therefore fail not to use your most powerful rhetoric in the favor of  dear flavia your ever affectionate john seymour      sir jacob short sensible and to the purpose i like it well and from it is contents believe i shall not give your rhetoric child much trouble as i find myself more than half inclined to give my consent already   tabby pertly as things then sir should not be done by halves give your full consent at once and let me go tell sir john you will be glad to see him   sir jacob do you think hussy your mistress has not a tongue of her own that she needs your alarm to be always going   flavia her good wishes for my happiness sir may make her perhaps freer than is becoming you must excuse her therefore for my sake and as i have no reason to doubt the sincerity of sir john let me prevail on you to see him for i confess he won my heart when i had not a hand to give him   sir jacob and now you have he must not look for a single guinea to cross it with if he expects my consent   flavia well sir but will it not be time enough to refuse when he makes the request   sir jacob no child a request in moneymatters is better prevented than refused therefore you had better send and let him know i am at home and shall be glad to see him and the sooner the better for delays i find are dangerous  going toward the table tabby you see madam  just as i said  no matter who the man is  for i will venture to say he knows no more of sir john than i do the length of his bags or he the getting up small linen   flavia well well tabby interrupting her delay not but fly with your message instantly and in a lovers key tell him the pleasing news  exeunt flavia and tabby different ways sir jacob alone pulls out a leathern bag scales and weights sits down at the table pulling it forward sir jacob and now i am alone i may safely examine neighbor heeltaps rent for count money they say after your father aye and weigh it too as the world goes if you would avoid being cheated and yet after all our care and caution a light guinea i see taking one in his hand will be creeping in this knave of a crispin had but five pounds to pay me for a whole years rent and three out of the five i see are short weighing oh the hang dog the sweater i will instantly send him notice to quit at christmas here robin robin gets up and goes toward the door to call looking every now and then at the table where the money is why robin i say as he returns to the table hears a knocking mercy on me what vile noise is that i hear upon these occasions a mans money putting it up is never safer than in his own pocket and now come who will   enter robin introducing wentworth and sir john robin master wentworth sir and sir and sir john seymour   sir jacob i am glad to see you neighbor and your friend there   wentworth a friend of mine sir jacob why he is more likely to be a friend of yours i understand   sir jacob ah that is as it may turn out   sir john miss flavia your daughter sir has long been the object of my affection   sir jacob has she  here robin eagerly go call her down  the fight of her perhaps may throw him off his guard  aside robin yes sir  exit sir john and but for a prior engagement i understood she was under should have declared my intentions much sooner   sir jacob she has no money sir john a right philosopher she carries all she has about her but then she is a girl of such prudence    sir john and that is a rare quality in this age   sir jacob why she is prudence itself writes an admirable hand and casts accounts like a broker   sir john uncommon talents these   sir jacob and then she works with her needle like a nun   sir john a fortune in itself   sir jacob and in my mind as good if not actually better than money why prudence is worth at least a hundred a year and a hundred a year in the three and a half per cent is worth  000l there is one item writing will save a stewards wages that is  0l a year and in the three and a half per cent is worth at least   00l there is another item needlework is dear now her needlework is worth at least  0l a year  0l a year long annuities is   00l more so you see sir john there is a fortune of  000l paid down at once no bonds no mortgages all ready money prompt payment mr wentworth   wentworth and my friend sir john i dare say will not have the least objection to settle the whole of the ladys fortune on her   sir jacob will he   sir john and a considerable addition from my own sir jacob sufficient i hope to make two affectionate hearts happy or rather one for seeing flavia here comes all my soul holds dear   flavia enters and retires with sir john to the back of the stage sir jacob to wentworth half whispering but is sir john neighbor tenant in fee or tenant for life only for that you know    wentworth yes sir jacob i know you are the most fortunate man in the world in having such a soninlaw in himself amiable in his family noble in his fortune independent   sir jacob say you so why then if he settles her fortune upon her for life and his own upon first and other sons in tailmale i think i may venture to give my consent without further enquiry and so sir john and daughter flavia as they come forward as the making of others happy is two and a half per cent better than making ones self so why you have my consent to marry when you please in the mean time that i may not retract being old and have gotten but a shallow memory with your leave sir john we will enter into a bit of a contract which our friend wentworth here will witness on your part and i on that of my daughter   sir john i cannot have the least objection sir and with your leave sir jacob will ring for pen ink and paper   sir jacob i believe i can save you the trouble pulling out the cover he picked up and a leather inkbottle and at the table there we shall finish this business in the dispatch of a transfer  see how aside as they go to the table looking at the cover time and accident bring things to use seats himself at the table and writes of what place shall i write you to sir john   sir john of seymourplace in dorsetshire   sir jacob writing of seymourplace in dorsetshire there rises and gives the paper to sir john i believe little else is necessary now but to sign   sir john reads and returns it not any thing sir   wentworth but should not the lady sir jacob have read to her what she is to sign   sir jacob no she is a dutiful girl and will sign any thing i bid her  there giving her the paper   flavia as for instance sir takes it to the table and signs it   sir jacob but as you sir john are principal in this business you will please to sign next   sir john most cheerfully goes and signs it   sir jacob and now that jezebel tabby once discharged all my she cares are over   tabby enters as sir john is signing it tabby hastily robin sir being out of the way i answered the door myself and here is a strange servant below earnest to speak with you   sir jacob eagerly taking the contract from the table comes forward how with me say you   tabby yes sir with you and you only and that instantly he says  exit enter trimwell abruptly trimwell my very words believe me sir jacob   sir jacob hastily going up to him well fellow would you speak with any one here   trimwell or i must return you no answer sir significantly   sir jacob and what want you who are you whence come you  earnestly trimwell softly good old gentleman if you please three interrogations in a breath are too much for any honest man to answer   sir jacob will you tell me fellow who you are i say or will you get out of my house   trimwell the first before the last if you please then and at a word i am the servant of my master   sir jacob but who is your master jackanapes   trimwell a stranger good sir therefore as a stranger with your leave i will return and say you give him welcome  as if going stops sir jacob has this stranger no name varlet   trimwell doubtless and i think a very honest one it is significantly somewhat of the longest i confess  his name is george frederic montague flavia wentworth and sir john expressing great surprise at hearing the name   sir jacob who how what   trimwell yes sir  george frederic montague  who as i said before has the good fortune to have me for his servant  is just arrived post from dover desires to see you sent me with this message and now expects my return with impatience to be admitted to be delivered in a quick affected tone and if you want to know who i am my name  or rather names  for you must know  like master like man  i have my three  john epaulet trimwell gentleman and valetdechambre as you see to this very honorable stranger   sir jacob it is all a lie rascal mr montague your master as you impudently call him is dead   trimwell significantly dead is he   sir jacob yes dead   trimwell poor gentleman he must certainly walk then for he was alive and in tolerable good spirits not a quarter of an hour ago and they must have done him great injustice to have killed him without my knowing any thing of the matter   sir jacob just or unjust i tell you he is dead absolutely dead   wentworth to trimwell i believe there is no doubt of it   trimwell excuse me sir if my doubts are not so easily satisfied and with your leave will step and soon convince ye ye are all in the wrong here  exit wentworth what can all this mean sir jacob this fellow is either a knave or a fool   sir jacob both neighbor wentworth both and deserves to be set in the stocks a rascal i wish i were a justice of the peace for his sake   wentworth and yet what he says of mr montague seems very particular notwithstanding my letter   flavia but see he returns and with him the person whom he calls his master   trimwell enters introducing clarissa montague personating her brother as if just arrived from paris trimwell permit me gentlemen to introduce my dead master to you and pray peruse him well do sir speak and convince this honorable company and particularly that good old gentleman there pointing to sir jacob that you are really flesh and blood and not the dead thing they took you for   clarissa why really sir jacob i must confess it has more the appearance of the one than the other from the strange reception my sudden arrival has met with from you which ought to be what the french call enjoue and not hold a barbare english consultation to know whether you are at home or not   sir jacob putting the contract into his pocket beggars and strangers young gentleman i am never at home to   clarissa but as i am neither one or the other sir i    sir jacob no why who are you i know you not your gentleman puppy there indeed calls you george frederic montague but he fell in a duel by the hand of one neville as my neighbor here can testify pointing to wentworth   wentworth such certainly was the information i received from my correspondent by the last mail from paris   clarissa a mere affair of gallantry believe me and a slight scratch soon settled the business as these letters and papers will confirm going up to gives letters and papers to sir jacob you know the hand and seal trimwell give this note to that gentleman pointing to wentworth then instantly go to lowes hotel enquire after my letters i have ordered them to be directed there as well as those for my sister clarissa be careful of them till my return which will not be long first  exit clarissa going up to flavia retire back sir jacob aside as i suspected and the whole of neighbor wentworths foreign intelligence a cursed lie perhaps and my daughter engaged in two contracts at once i shall go distracted had she died in her cradle i had been happy but what say the letters  opens and reads sir john do dear wentworth explain for i am on the rack   wentworth the papers he has given sir jacob and my note will i presume unravel this whole mystery  reads aside sir informed you were here and fearing i might not have one favorable moment of seeing you alone this entreats you not to leave me till that opportunity offers having something of consequence to communicate to you and you only  yours montague     what may this mean i think i may safety comply with the request   sir jacob to sir john why these papers sir john prove the bearer to be no other than the very montague my daughter was contracted to but the frippery airs dress and manners of a french court have so altered and womanizd him as a body may say i knew him not your contract therefore shall be returned you and you child may go in and say your prayers and thank heaven in the confusion you are likely to have any hust and at all  either way i part with no money that is my comfort in the worst of ills  aside sir john angrily to sir jacob insolent unfeeling old wretch but know young man going up to clarissa it shall not end here for he must win her first who wears her now and that from the point of my sword you may perhaps see me again sir  exit agitated flavia to wentworth anxiously let me prevail on you sir to follow your friend and divert him if possible from a resolution i so feelingly dread being put in execution on this strange discovery whilst i retire   wentworth as she is going strange indeed madam but by waiting the event of matters i may be the better able perhaps to prevent any ill consequences  exit flavia clarissa advancing forward well sir jacob have the letters and papers confirmed me the living or the dead montague contracted to your daughter   sir jacob returning the papers living or dead i wish you were safely in bed together that i might at once know the end of all my care and expense   clarissa i have an hundred pound bill turning to sir jacob sir taking it out of a pocketbook i must get you to discount for me as the expense of traveling has taken away all my ready money and in london i am told we are oftener in want of small change than sums   sir jacob the bill i suppose is good  looking at it clarissa as a french bankers credit with an english acceptance can make it   sir jacob well well i will step to a neighbors and see what i can do you pay the discount for i see it has three days to run   clarissa by all means sir and your coachhire into the bargain   sir jacob half going returns i shall find you here at my return   clarissa or at the hotel in covent garden i am there for the present and in case of my absence it may be lest with my servant i believe him honest and may be trusted   sir jacob aside as he is going as my own strong box is my neighbor upon these occasions to walk to it and charge coachhire would be a stroke known hitherto only to lawyers populus me sibilat at mihi plaudo  exit clarissa since the opportunity sir now offers in me behold pulling off her hat clarissa sister to the living montague and learning you were here presumed on the long intimacy which subsisted between you and my late father to write the note my servant gave you   wentworth ah is it possible time and the little knowledge i had of you whilst in england and your present disguise i confess made me not recollect you   clarissa i must rely for the present on your secrecy and friendship   wentworth rely on both pray proceed   clarissa the death of my brother and his falling by the hands of mr neville were mere reports the first taking rise from a duel he was engaged in at rome on an affair of honorable love and the latter from mr nevilles sudden departure from paris on the cool reception his addresses to me met with from my brother who no sooner recovered and married the lady than my love for neville returned and determined me to personate my brother and follow him here to england   wentworth and have you been successful in your pursuit   clarissa being but just arrived i have not his leaving paris without ever daring to bid me adieu i know not where he is   wentworth and pray what may be the steps you mean to take   clarissa to remain in this disguise by the help of which and the letters i have brought sir jacob will not suspect the deceit and i shall be the better able to make those enquiries after mr neville which in my own character as a woman might perhaps be thought indelicate besides from a chancery trust reposed in sir jacob was he to know of my design he would certainly use every art to prevent my ever marrying at all   wentworth i see your situation and from the delicacy of it will give you every assistance possible you lodge at the hotel you say   clarissa and the short time i mean to stay this disguise will protect me favor me with your company there and i will explain more to

double stage than i in waiting for this same master of mine after a journey to take some refreshment suits most travelers yet he takes nothing here but his portmanteau and humble servant then instantly sets out to pay a visit to a covetous old dog of a miser who knowing persons of my rank and order are at boardwages would sooner see a stranger break his neck in his house than his fast i can bear this airy diet no longer i will even go and appease the angry tumults within by finding some diversion for my teeth going stops but who have we here   enter neville in a travellingdress followed by a chairman with his portmanteau chairman arrah my dear master your portmanteau is so mortal heavy and little timsey has padded so far with it he must be after giving his shoulders a holiday awhile setting it down   neville let it be short then as i am going only to that hotel pointing   chairman long or short if i am to be after carrying it any further i must get a brother of the strap i believe to lend me a cast of his office by carrying it for me   neville seeing trimwell apropos you seem at leisure honest friend do lend this chairman a hand with this portmanteau into that hotel pointing to it whilst i discharge him   trimwell with pleasure sir but as he is tired had i not better lend him two when i am about it takes up the portmanteau and carries it in   neville a clever fellow this here sir pulls out his purse and gives money   chairman looking at it little tims not paid your honor  bowing neville here then friend  gives more money chairman looking at it oh long life to your honor you could not give me less for carrying your wigbox and i am sure your portmanteau made little timsey reel again   neville angrily there then now are you paid  kicks him chairman arrah faith am i and in full and so your sarvent looks at the money o my jewel that little timsey was but a jontleman to return the civility  exit neville the impositions of these fellows are intolerable trimwell returns so friend you have done as i desired you   trimwell bowing i have sir   neville and pray what sort of a house is this   trimwell an excellent hotel sir i assure you good beds handsome furniture a mancook and civil waiters lodging sit for an ambassador at least   neville you are a servant i presume   trimwell it being my misfortune as it is that of many others to have the appetite of a gentleman without the estate i am and in my services sir  clocklike  to be set agoing either backward or forward at a masters pleasure   neville have you been long a servant   trimwell coming sir of a running generation i have been of the trade ever since i could go   neville indeed   trimwell even so sir my father was ticketporter to one of the inns of court my mother went out awashing and when withchild of me a few shirts being missing from one of her customers out of pure modesty she fairly run the country so that you see sir i was born to my trade and have it by birth and education   neville are you in want of a master then   trimwell at present i am sir  and no lie either  aside neville and i in want of a servant during my stay here which is uncertain would you choose to engage   trimwell most readily  for who knows ours being but a traveling engagement my first master may mean to give me the slip aside  what are your terms sir   neville three guineas amonth   trimwell i am your man sir my name trimwell and the best recommendation    neville interrupting him is your countenance on which i shall depend without further enquiries here is money enquire at the lodge if there are any letters for mr neville whilst i step in and give some necessary orders  exit trimwell solus let me see three guineas amonth and a bachelors sineture place no bad circumstance this of the portmanteau i think times are pressing and behooves men of my industry to look about them and as for my young parisian should he mean to resign me why trimwells provided for and now for the letters neville i think is the name  going meets clarissa and wentworth clarissa trimwell   trimwell oh the devil here is my other master before i was aware of him  aside clarissa surprized at seeing him where are you going i ordered you to wait at the hotel   trimwell confused true sir but being impatient for your return i kept upon the lookout and chance directed me this way   wentworth aside this fellow of hers is a shrewd one i warrant by the ease and air of his dialect   clarissa go then and enquire if there are any letters for me or for my sister as i ordered you   trimwell where pray sir am i to bring them   clarissa to my apartments in the hotel you will find us there  exeunt wentworth and clarissa trimwell as they are going the devil i shall a rare town this halfanhour ago i scarce knew whether i had any master at all or not and now i have two and both in a house what shall i do with them for they say there is no serving two and yet why not double wages double meals are great spurs to invention courage trimwell and go execute both thy masters orders at once  going enter sir john seymour sir john aside as he enters a lucky circumstance this for if i mistake not this is montagues servant i saw at sir jacobs pray friend where can i find your master  trimwell returning trimwell not recollecting him in that hotel sir which master now does he mean i wonder  aside sir john go tell him then a gentleman wishes to speak with him whom if he is a man of honor he will not refuse seeing   trimwell by his manner all is not right i fear i will excuse myself therefore carrying the message aside it being an hotel sir if you please to step in the servants of the house will obey any of your commands as i am in haste to execute some orders i have just received  from    sir john angrily no trifling sir but go this moment with my message   trimwell you must know sir my master is    sir john show me the way this instant sirrah or    trimwell aside go i must i see so i will even take him to the first master i find this way sir if you please  exeunt into the hotel scene an apartment in the hotel table and chairs sir john seymour alone agitated no never shall a rival carry off my lovely flavia i must not will not lose her and though this montague may have escaped death in paris he    enter trimwell introducing neville trimwell to neville there that is the gentleman sir and now with your leave i will step to enquire about the letters indeed i believe i had better step any where than wait the event of this business  aside exit they walk about some time exchanging civility of hat etc without speaking neville your commands with me sir   sir john surprised with you sir i do not recollect i ever had the honor of seeing you before   neville i was informed by the servant sir you earnestly desired to see me and spoke in terms which carried some resentment with them   sir john he misunderstood me then most exceedingly sir and i ask pardon for the mistake but the person i spoke of is his master who is a   eagerly neville interrupting i am his master sir and am what   sir john you his master sir   neville yes i most certainly am sir   sir john why then sir there is the strongest resemblance i ever saw between your servant and the servant of a gentleman just arrived from paris   neville it is not long since i left that place myself sir   sir john the name of the gentleman i want is montague   neville i knew him well sir  expressing concern sir john as the affair then between us does not require secrecy that gentleman by virtue of a contract now seeks to rob me of the only woman i adore and am myself contracted to   neville he will never then accomplish his design or interrupt your felicity sir as i have been informed within this hour he died soon after i left that place   sir john pardon me sir but the report is totally groundless as i this morning saw him alive and well and sir jacob thrift the ladys father has taken every possible method to be assured of his identity and by letters and other credentials it is now beyond a doubt and as you say you have some knowledge of him if you should chance to meet him before i see him let me entreat you to tell him that if he merits the hand he aspires to sir john seymour expects to hear from him as a man of honor ought who glories in being his rival and hope my situation will justify the liberty of the request i am now making sir your servant  exit neville sir your servant a strange adventure this i am actually lost in astonishment montague recovered and now in england in either case i will instantly return to paris on the wings of love to behold my charming clarissa once more and prevail on her if possible to be mine for sir john seymours situation is not more distressing than my own  musing enter trimwell trimwell here sir here is your  feeling in his pocket   neville interrupting trimwell will you go with me to paris   trimwell when sir   neville instantly   trimwell what tonight sir   neville no we will sleep first and set out by daybreak   trimwell i am for a nap then first sir if you please as i entirely agree with friend sancho that he was a wise man who first invented sleep here are your letters sir pulling out letters  but i have made a strange mistake i fear by putting both masters letters into one pocket what shall i do i have it aside  a brother liveryman sir desired me to enquire at the same time for his masters letters but being all foreigners and i not understanding the language be pleased sir to examine and take what are for you gives them and    neville ah what do i see a letter directed to clarissa montague and to be left at lowes hotel till called for  what can this mean i am in a maze can she too be in england and i not know it  where is the servant for whose master you had this letter what is his name and with whom does he live speak instantly  eagerly trimwell confused and hesitates his name sir  is  is  is  richard  and he lives with  with  i never heard with whom sir  bowing neville why how could you ask for his masters letters if you did not know his name   trimwell true sir  what invention now aside oh he wrote it down on a piece of paper sir with a direction where to find him   neville give me that paper   trimwell i have it not sir i have lost it out of my pocket  i   feeling for it confusedly neville how then is this letter to be delivered if you do not know where to find him   trimwell on second thoughts sir  i recollect  he was to meet me in the piazza and if you please to give me the letter i will go find him   neville no trimwell this letter concerns me nearly and i am determined to open it as if going to open it halfbreaks the seal and stops  and yet the indelicacy of such a step cannot be justified i will not therefore open it but charge you as you regard my happiness and your own interest go find richard instantly and learn from him where he is to carry the letter giving the letter and be not long in your return as i expect a person with money which in case of my absence you must receive   trimwell your commands shall be obeyed sir  but what excuse have i sir for it is having the seal broke  looking at it neville i will reseal it seals it and if you but find richard all will be well again and you amply rewarded  exit trimwell richard  stifling a laugh he little thinks i believe this same richard is no other than my other master to whom i will instantly go and deliver this letter  exit scene changes to another apartment in the hotel clarissa at a table writing enter trimwell clarissa trimwell what has delayed you thus have you enquired about my letters as i ordered you   trimwell i have sir and received only this one   clarissa looking at it how is this a letter from paris and sealed with nevilles arms rising what can this mean it is not his hand if he is returned there i am utterly undone examining it it has been opened  to whom sir have you betrayed the secrets of this letter   trimwell opened sir it cannot be why it has never been out of my hands since i received it  agitated clarissa and are you hardy enough to deny it villain why look  showing it him trimwell falling on his knees on my knees kind sir i entreat your forgiveness but there coming a letter also for me from an old withered relation of mine in the country who wrote a hand i never could read i applied to a civil goodnatured gentleman to read it for me and in my hurry gave him your letter for mine which he resealed the moment we discovered the mistake   clarissa half aside from the arms this civil gentleman could certainly be no other than neville himself and where pray did you meet this kind friend of yours   trimwell at  at  at   agitated clarissa half aside by the confusion of his answers i suspect his veracity however i will go communicate the circumstances to mr wentworth and in my way call on sir jacob lest he discover my situation before i receive my money  putting on her hat exit trimwell what a fortunate planet must i have been born under to have matters go on thus swimmingly egad trimwell if your masters will find you in belief you will find them in lies i warrant what an immense sum now should i be worth to a primeminister as a porter for i can outlie a courtier a lover a chambermaid a milliners apprentice a lawyer or even the newspapers at a general election   enter sir jacob with the money in a bag endeavors to conceal it sir jacob well mr gentleman is your honors master within i have urgent business with him   trimwell aside which now of my honorable masters can old cent per cent want to be inquisitive is the very badge of our office i will sift him  what pray sir may be your business with him   sir jacob that is no answer to my question mr inquisitive my business is with him not with you therefore is he within or no i say   trimwell unless i know your business sir he is not within   sir jacob aside oh the insolence of office  but when i have told you my business will he be within then think you   trimwell perhaps he may  if i like your business  aside sir jacob why then mr primeminister be pleased to tell your master i have brought the money and desire to know if he be within or no   trimwell aside i will even venture then to say no in order to give one or other of my masters a proof of my honesty should old squaretoes dare trust me with it therefore  no sir my masters not within i assure you   sir jacob where can i find him   trimwell i know not it is a question we seldom ask each other when we go out  affectedly sir jacob and his return    trimwell like my own uncertain   sir jacob are you honest   trimwell tolerably so who dare doubt it   sir jacob here then take this bag of an hundred pounds and be sure you give it him when he returns and tell him i have bookd the discount and charges   trimwell yes sir  eagerly sir jacob going returns and yet notwithstanding my commission it were prudent methinks not to leave it without a receipt the hangdog with his tolerable honesty may say he never received it aside  so do you hear you can write i suppose mr gentlemans  gentleman   trimwell write sir  hesitating sir jacob yes sir write as i dont choose to leave the money without a receipt   trimwell oh you are perfectly right sir and if you please i will take the money in with me and bring a receipt ready wrote   sir jacob but i do not choose any such thing sir or to part with you or the money out of my sight without a receipt therefore come to the table and write one instantly  trimwell sets down to write and appears embarrassed trimwell it would be better worded sir i should think if you would please to set down and write it and let me sign it  rising from the table sir jacob what blockhead you cannot write a receipt i suppose   trimwell whilst sir jacob sets down and writes to be sure sir joining with a few pounds shillings and pence was as far as i went in my education more in one of my cloth would have been pedantry   sir jacob rising from the table here then giving him the paper let us see what sort of a scrawl you make trimwell sets down signs and returns it there that will do and now dispose of it as your tolerable honesty or knavery best advises i care not  exit trimwell a fair wind to you old trader and i shall not find it a difficult matter i believe to persuade either of my young captains to receive your lading and pay the duty  exit scene changes to nevilles apartment in the hotel enter neville followed by trimwell neville well trimwell have you been and found richard as i ordered you   trimwell no sir but i have found a much better thing  this bag of money you expected to receive some   neville yes an hundred pounds   trimwell the money is certainly yours then sir exactly the sum   neville and while i examine it i once more desire you not to rest till you have found richard  goes to the table as if to examine it trimwell i will feek him high and low sir instantly   neville do so   trimwell going i am glad however the right owner has got the money  aside exit neville putting up the money comes forward how distressed and agitated has this circumstance of the letter made me its being directed to be left till called for makes every present search after her uncertain and carries with it the appearance of a secresy most alarming what if i go to sir jacobs on the information received from sir john by pretending business with her brother i may hear perhaps something of my clarissa without my design being even suspected it shall be so   exit scene sir jacobs house enter sir jacob followed by flavia and robin sir jacob blockhead how often have i told you i am never at home to men without names come to rob me perhaps i will not see him   robin he looks like no such sort of a parson sir   sir jacob looks fool who trusts to looks nowadays when thieves sharpers and swindlers are as well dressed as lords and courtiers on a birthday no no i will not see him   flavia let me prevail on you sir it may be somebody you would wish to see   sir jacob well then if i must  do you hear  go show him up  but be sure daughter you do not leave the room for though you cannot defend me yourself you can scream and raise the house   exit robin flavia perhaps somebody from mr montague or sir john   sir jacob whoever it is he is here to answer for himself i see   enter clarissa clarissa you see sir jacob i use the freedom of a soninlaw already but money you know    sir jacob is soon parted with you have

fatherinlaw and by your prudent care have prevented my being guilty of the excesses you lay to my charge as you have not yet paid me my money   sir jacob how not paid you that is pleasant   clarissa

say i have not received it a gentleman tells you so and am now come to receive it   sir jacob that is being serious indeed but sir to be as serious as you the money has been paid   clarissa that is a mistake or something worse sir jacob and permit me to say it has not been paid   sir jacob i have debited your account   clarissa then sir if you have debited my account as you call it act like an honest man and let it be for value received   enter trimwell trimwell i have been in quest of my master    sir jacob runs up to trimwell there is the man i paid it to   trimwell why what is the matter

obstacle to your daughters happiness and my own is now removed what say you my flavia   going up to her flavia if my father consents sir the inclination of my heart is sufficiently known to you   sir jacob how what alive and married say you worse and worse   clarissa even so believe me sir jacob   sir jacob alive or dead then it shall go hard but i will recover on the contract  but you baggage you what a spirit you must have to adventure thus  a woman want to marry my daughter  that is pleasant  but my money you wanted my money too villain turning to trimwell impostor rascal i hear no certain account of that all this time   trimwell as for names good sir call me as many as you please  they are slight wounds and will break no bones  scoundrel and rascal are the familiar terms of society and friendship is a greatcoat we put off and on as best suits our convenience but will not you kind sir to neville be pleased to be my advocate upon this occasion and set this matter right   neville i certainly sir jacob received an hundred pound from him   sir jacob designed for mr clarissa there   neville no designed for me and delivered to my servant   sir jacob your servant why who the devil

be sure i have been a little unlucky in my services of today both in this moneybusiness and in the affair of the letters but as every thing seems likely to find it is right owner and no ill consequences have happened i hope i shall be pardoned by you sir to neville by you sir  that is to say by you madam to clarissa and by you good sir to sir jacob   clarissa most readily your mistakes have made me the happiest of women   neville and me the happiest of men   sir jacob and as i see i am to lose nothing by it why i forgive you but youre a sad dog   trimwell why sir you must acknowledge i am as gentlemen go now a kind of a person with a shabby fort of genteel about me i told you truth about the money and you see i have been serving but one master all this time   sir john there seems some honesty about the fellow after all  sir jacob may i now aspire to take your daughters hand   sir jacob ay ay here joining their hands i give it you with all my soul and if i recover handsomely on the contract i may perhaps find in my heart to give ye  your weddingsupper into the bargain   wentworth that sir jacob i have taken the liberty of providing   sir jacob eagerly have you so why that is kind and friendly of you and if ever i marry  which heaven forbid till there is an act for exporting all the false heads and false bottoms in the kingdom  i will return the compliment
