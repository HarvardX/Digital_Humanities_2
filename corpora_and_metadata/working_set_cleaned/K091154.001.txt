bell near exeterchange in the strand and c etherington at york mdcclxx  unknown and wishing personally to remain so the dramatic censor as a mark of perfect esteem and a natural tribute to the most powerful universal abilities that ever graced the english stage thus dedicates on most disinterested principles his first volume of critical observations to david garrick esquire  advertisement as most writers both for and against the stage have either dealt out enthusiastic abuse or fulsome panegyrics the obvious utility of an impartial medium between such extremes first suggested the following work no man who is not either mad or silly can be hardy enough to deny that a wellregulated drama is worthy support in the most polished learned or moral state nor on the other side can we contend in favor of many established pieces humor has been too often made the subtle conveyance of very licentious sentiments and many pernicious characters are placed in too fair a point of view to develope vice from this poetical masquerade to strip off the serpents shining coat and to show the poison which lurks within is the dramatic censors leading principle to point out in a plain manner and unadorned style the beauties and defects of each piece to throw out hints respecting the performance of every character worth notice and to give a concise general idea of the plays taken into consideration the scope of his design  far from glancing an eye toward infallibility of opinion the following strictures and illustrations are submitted with all due deference to the public as meant for useful information how far they answer this desirable purpose candid readers on perusal must determine  the dramatic censor will gratefully receive and respectfully use any remarks suitable to his plan he may be favored with by letter directed to the care of mr bell publisher of this work near exeter exchange strand  the dramatic censor  the dramatic censor richard the third as altered from shakespeare by cibber criticism is undoubtedly the most elaborate and ungracious of all literary compositions passing censure must ever be painful to a liberal mind and has no palliation no balancing pleasure but contrasted praise however the general advantages arising from candid investigation equally separated from partial indulgence or malevolent severity deserve some degree of honest approbation and strengthen the feelings to undertake with becoming resolution so hazardous a task  dramatic compositions are of a nature too nice and complicate for all admirers of the stage to consider with that attention which is necessary to understand them properly hence much of the true relish and solid improvement derivable from them is lost and often changes the theater from what it literally may be a profitable school of moral instruction to the sphere of useless or prejudicial dissipation  this consideration has given rise to the following work in which the various opinions are diffidently submitted to not dogmatically obtruded upon our several readers where we strike out new and useful lights we doubt not being allowed some credit for them where we appear fallible indulgence is hoped for since however we may err in the extensive scene before us our warmest wishes are to be right  the hallowed shrine of shakespeare every friend of intrinsic merit must approach with reverence yet why amidst the meridian blaze of his brightness should we decline discovering and pointing out those dark spots which his genius shares in common with the sun implicit admiration as well as implicit faith argues a narrowness or sycophancy of mind which we hope ourselves free from and shall as much as possible follow that excellent maxim to extenuate nothing nor to set down aught in malice  to pursue all the nice and intricate distinctions of classical criticism would occasion prolixity appeal only to the judgments of learned readers and therefore be totally incompatible with our design which is merely to try each drama as a picture of nature at the bar of nature and the manners of those nations where the scene of each is laid  well knowing how insipid prefatory matter generally is thus much only is offered by way of introduction and we hope the candid reader will from hence suggest whatever else may seem essential  of all those various subjects which have engaged the tragic muse none are of equal force and dignity to historical ones from a multiplicity of great and interesting events they rouse and command more passions than any other of this shakespeare was a most competent judge and happily availed himself i say happily because he not only thereby gained a wide fruitful field for the exertion of his amazing talents but in a political sense did honor to his country by delivering faithfully many memorable events in a much more striking manner than any historian could possibly do he has also thereby indulged that commendable national vanity which makes britons fond of seeing britons distinguished on the theater of life  richard the third as acted though essentially shakespeares is much indebted for its variety compactness and spirit to the late colley cibber whose thorough acquaintance with the stage well qualified him for regulating a plot and arranging of scenes which is indeed no more than a kind of dramatic mechanism yet indispensibly requisite  the laureat has been blamed for mutilating other plays of beautiful passages to enrich this but though we admit it to be literary depradation we must rather vindicate than censure him there is little if any dishonesty in stealing jewels merely to ornament the just owner besides it shows what cibber was never accused of modesty  by avoiding studiously the insertion of his own inadequate stuff  this play opens with wellimagined propriety as a plain simple introduction is the best preparative to a succession and climax of interesting events expectation strained at the beginning most commonly produces a faint unaffecting catastrophe the previous character of henry and the mode of his introduction prejudice us in his favor his philosophical reflections are suitable to his depressed situation as well as his turn of mind and tressels pathetic narration not only serves to raise our tenderest concern for an unhappy king and father but prepares us with great judgment for what we must expect to find in gloucester which description naturally arising out of the circumstance has far greater merit than those lugged in headlong merely for sake of explanation  notwithstanding some good critics have condemned soliloquies in general as unnatural yet we must venture to contend for their propriety since nothing is commoner than for people in private life warmly possessed of any subject to talk as if in conversation though alone in this light gloucester is very justly brought to view and i doubt if by any other means so striking and copious a picture could have been given of his whole heart in a first appearance nor could any other character have given so happy a delineation of him as he does of himself  the first act concludes properly with putting a period to henrys life which indeed could not have been preserved any longer with suitable importance and richard gives an extended idea of his ambitious remorseless principles in a very characteristic soliloquy  the short scene with which the second act begins is a just preparation for the funeral of henry and those obsequies being partly shown keep the unfortunate monarch in our remembrance till more bustling events supersede him lady anns introduction is affecting but her yielding to him whose hands are still red with the blood of her husband and father renders her future misfortunes rather just punishment than motives for pity however the scene is wrought up in a very masterly manner and in the performance gives scope for capital acting the concluding part of this act introduces the duke of buckingham the queendowager and acquaints us with king edwards death richard also unveils part of his design relative to prince edward whose approach and destination to the tower he announces  the young king and his brother the duke of york make a most pleasing apppearance in the first scene of the third act that solid good sense discoverable in one and the shrewd pregnant simplicity of the other are admirably struck off after their departure for the tower richards earnest disclosure of his views to buckingham opens a wider field for expectation and his method of securing his cousin to his interest shows gloucester an able politician fit to avail himself of buckinghams weak venal disposition  lady anns treatment in the succeeding scene manifests her husbands brutality more strongly yet as we have already hinted seems no more than a just consequence of that unpardonable vanity which led her into such an unnatural connection  buckinghams illustration of the method used by him to work on the citizens and his treatment of them when they enter show him versed in court chicanery particularly throwing in a remark it is hard  the mayor should lose his title with his office richards hypocrisy is here painted in a capital manner and is most admirably assisted by the assumed passion of his cousin on one side with the sycophantic credulity of the citizens on the other his reluctance and their persuasions like well adapted lights and shades engage and please the attention which is well varied by richards sudden transition to a state of ambitious exultation and from thence to a struggle with conscience which appears to lodge a constant thorn in his breast  in the beginning of the fourth act our feelings are turned upon objects of real strong pity our tears which have ceased since the first are here called forth again judiciously in behalf of an unhappy mother and her helpless infants the characters introduced to furnish fresh matter for concern are well brought forward and the queens grief is wrought up in an affecting manner however we must be of opinion that the scene is not near so interesting as it might have been made that lady ann and the duchess of york are here mere nonessentials that the children do not affect us as they ought and that all the queens speeches except the last three are far too unimportant for her heartrending situation  richard now discovered as king works upon buckingham by distant insinuation to effect his main purpose that of destroying the children his cautious earnestness and the dukes conscientious diffidence are extremely well contrasted the kings impatience at buckinghams coldness his indifference at the news brought by lord stanley his enquiry after and remarks on his wife ann with his subsequent contemptuous treatment of his lukewarm cousin exhibit great and masterly diversification of action  the scene between tirrel dighton and forest should for two reasons have been made longer first to have raised our pity more even by the immediate murderers next to have given richard more time for his appearance at the tower there are but ten lines from going to meet tirrel in his closet before that impious tool comes on with his followers quite prepared had he mentioned the premium and the kings favor to lull their scruples the business would have been conducted more consistently  the kings soliloquy is masterly anxious hope and guilty ambition quiver in every syllable nor is the succeeding scene less characteristic catesbys entrance is well contrived and gives a good opportunity for that fiery spirit breaking out which so much animates the remainder of the piece richards interview with the ladies though not essential in some measure deserves its place as in it the tyrant is devoted to destruction by a mothers curse the following part of this act is as rapid and as well a conducted series of interesting events as ever was exhibited in any drama and it concludes with a very bold striking climax of passion  the three first scenes of the fifth act are merely preparatory to what follows and therefore judiciously short richmond shows himself sufficiently and stands well contrasted to his antagonist richards scene in the tent is as well imagined to engage the feelings of spectators and to show the power of action as possible nor could ghosts ever be more justifiable than here however we must offer a doubt whether such false creations of the brain should ever be called to view since it is most certain that they play upon our passions in flat and absurd contradiction to our reason let this point be determined as it may cibber showed just critical judgment in rejecting the second introduction of those imaginary existences which we find in shakespeares richard because in representation one would have flattened the other and both must have consequently palled after many martial excursions in which the leading character is very happily exhibited the catastrophe is wrought up to a most pleasing event in his death a circumstance as consonant to strict poetical justice as it is to historical truth richmonds conclusive scene displays a generous patriotic disposition and is as agreeable as the place it stands in will admit  having thus given a general delineation of the plot and arrangement of scenes it becomes necessary to enquire for the moral without which no dramatic piece can have intrinsic worth in historical plays we cannot expect much social instruction as they chiefly appeal to national transactions however from richard the third we may draw this useful conclusion that no degree of success and grandeur no gratification of lawless ambition however splendid can still the voice of conscience which though unheard by the world speaks in thunder to the guilty wretch who bears such a painful monitor in his bosom  the characters of this piece are many in number yet exhibit no great variety of contrast after richard henry richmond the queen and children all the rest are of a similar complexion richard is truly in point of figure sentiments language and conduct  himself alone however historical relation admits doubts of that monarchs personal deformity it was certainly well judged to make his external appearance on the stage emblematic of his mind and for sake of singularity dressing him only in the habit of the times may be defensible but what excuse can be made for showing him at his first entrance in as elegant a dress as when king i am at a loss to suggest does he not after his scene with lady ann profess a design of ornamenting his person more advantageously macbeth when king is always distinguished by a second dress why not richard a still greater breach of propriety appears in putting mourning upon none of the persons at court but the ladies and the children though richard pays all other external respect to the circumstance of his brothers death  through three acts richard appears the close dissembling politician and affords no great variety of action indeed his soliloquies are so long and so frequent that very few who attempt to represent him avoid falling into an insipid sameness  in the fourth and fifth acts he breaks out like a flame which has been long smothered and through the impetuosity of agitating circumstances betrays many performers into the error of outheroding herod  the public have set up mr garrick as a standard of perfection in this laborious difficult part and if we consider the essentials his claim to such distinction will immediately appear indisputable a very deformed person never rises above and seldom up to the middle stature it is generally attended with an acuteness of features and sprightliness of eyes in these three natural points our roscius stands unexceptionable variations of voice and climax of expression in both which he stands without an equal graceful attitudes nervous action with a wellregulated spirit to animate within natural bounds every passage even from the coldest up to the most inflamed  mr garrick also preserves a happy medium and dwindles neither into the buffoon or brute one or both of which this character is made by most other performers it is true there are many passages which have a ludicrous turn yet we may rest assured that he who occasions least laughter is most right in respect of marking particular places with peculiar emphasis some exceptions may be taken or doubts raised against every person we have ever seen in the part however tracing minute lapses of this kind which after all may be mere matter of opinion would occasion too great a digression we shall therefore only mention three which strike us most the first is  i am myself alone  which words are often expressed in a tone of confident exultation as if he was singularly above the rest of mankind whereas adverting to his own unhappy composition it should be uttered with heartfelt discontent and indeed the three preceding lines which exclude him from all social intercourse should be expressive of concern  the second passage is where buckingham solicits richard for his promise and richard meditates in these lines i do remember me that henry the sixth did prophesy that richmond should be king when richmond was a little peevish boy it is odd  a king  perhaps    the last line is often spoke without a tone of continuation to the word perhaps which is most evidently intended the third place is in these lines hence babbling dreams ye threaten here in vain conscience avaunt  richards himself again   it is usual to speak this couplet in one continued climax of passion whereas the two words marked in italics should be uttered in a lower tone expressive of mental agony  conscience being the constant disturber of his peace and a great bar to his resolution the latter part of the line rises to a kind of triumphant exultation which not only varies but gives force to the expression  having placed mr garrick far before all other competitors in this character as supporting every scene throughout the whole with very capital merit it would be ungenerous not to acknowledge that mr mossop displays great powers mr sheridan much judgment and mr smith considerable spirit but had the first more delicacy with less labor the second more harmony and less stiffness the third more variation with less levity their merit would rise several degrees beyond what it is  henrys character is composed of pathetic dignity in representation it should be studiously remembered that his griefs though a distressed king and father should not be blubbered like those of a schoolboy but should paint feeling worthy the monarch and the man  the part is admirably drawn and highly finished yet we cannot remember any performer doing it tolerable justice except mr digges who is now we believe retired from the stage  richmond requires little more than a good figure free deportment with smooth spirited expression yet our theaters have not often filled it with ability the late mr palmer though no tragedian came nearest the idea we can form of it  the queen though not wrought up to the pitch her circumstances seem to admit is a character of much respect and attention mrs pritchard did more for it in action than the author in writing it is now given to second and third rates for what reason is hard to say as there never was nor perhaps ever will be an actress of higher estimation than the lady just named what she did not think beneath her is certainly equal to any existing merit and the public have an undoubted right to expect capital performance wherever it can be introduced nor should the ridiculous word consequence deter managers from fulfilling this point of duty  the sentiments and verification of this tragedy are rather familiarlynervous than flowing and affluent however the language all through is uniformly characteristic unless we object to a person in henrys situation stepping aside to the allusions of frosty caucasus and december snow since it is trespassing upon probability and nature to make a character deeply distressed or torn with passion vent poetical similitudes for which reason also we must condemn those lines in the last speech of the fourth act though the thought is really fine that speak of the fever worn wretch they are generally omitted but more we imagine to relieve the actors utterance than from any idea of impropriety  upon the whole richard appears much better calculated for representation than perusal as indeed every bustling piece must be however taste and judgment will not by any means hold it light in the closet  the stratagem a comedy by farquhar as mr pope declared an honest man the noblest work of god so mr addison pronounced a good tragedy to be the noblest work of man whether he advanced this opinion from intending to raise such a masterly and permanent monument to his own reputation upon the story of cato or if he did how much he failed in the great attempt we shall not at present pretend to determine but rather yield to drydens assertion that an epic poem is undoubtedly the most arduous and comprehensive effort of human genius  the tragic muse confessedly claims great preeminence over her sister the comic yet if we consider that a knowledge of ourselves and the world are the best possessions of our minds the laughing lady though she must yield precedence to dignity may certainly upon just principles boast a greater share of utility the elevated passions and incidents with which we are treated by the former may warm melt and astonish our feelings while the latter playing with fancy in its natural or some other familiar sphere exhilarates our spirits puts judgment in good humor and pleasantly prepares us to receive some occasional necessary lashes of correction applied to our vices or follies  there is one remark relative to the dramatic sisters well worth notice that as the elder is less general so she is more lasting her characters and passions are the same through ages while the younger is forced to draw existing peculiarities which when their parent fashion vanishes disappear with her and become obsolete thus the comedies of shakespeare and ben johnson exhibit masterly genius yet as the originals they took their pictures from are unknown their force and beauty are in a great measure lost when mr garricks fribble was first played a small hat helped considerably to mark the petiteness and insignificancy of his figure what sort of a hat must he wear now to distinguish him from the present liliputian headcovers  we are told that wilkes played all his fine gentlemen in fullbottomed wigs as cibber did the fops also how strange would any thing of that kind appear at present when even bishops wear cropeared bobs the coxcomb and fine lady of every seven years vary considerably in almost every point of conversation and deportment as they do every single year in regard of dress wherefore the writer of the present day if he has genius suitable must have great advantage of his predecessors prevailing manners and originals being on his side  there have been instances of men very little conversant in life writing tolerable tragedies but we do not remember one nor do we believe an instance can be given of any person writing a comedy of merit whose intercourse with and knowledge of society has not been pretty extensive  unities of time and place are strictly applied critical trammels serving no purpose but to check the nobler flights of genius the same latitude of imagination which can move us from a chamber to a street and thence to a grove may undoubtedly reconcile much greater transitions avoiding this very allowable liberty has made most of our modern tragedies so barren of incident that they are heavy and palling to a degree but though moderate freedom is contended for poetical licentiousness should be avoided a child to be born in the first act and appear sixteen or seventeen years old in the fifth as we find in the winters tale throws contempt upon probability and overstrains the utmost stretch of credibility such a lapse of time is totally unwarrantable indeed as comedy is a delineator of familiar life the unities should be much more punctually observed in her compositions than those of tragedy  thus much premised let us proceed to the investigation of mr farquhars last production an odd yet it is hoped not very blameable composition for a dying author whose genius like an expiring taper has here thrown out several stronger flashes of light than when in a perfect state of existence  the stratagem more properly so called than beaux stratagem takes its name and birth from the declining circumstances of two genteel spirited young fellows who from their own account have spent their fortunes and rather chose to retire from the circle of gay life before necessity subjected them to contempt having seen many examples of worthy sensible men who wanting full pockets were not only shunned but publicly ridiculed by coxcombs of their former acquaintance whose finances remained still unimpaired  the design of our adventurers traveling to repair fortune in the matrimonial way though not strictly honorable is no way chimerical or improbable and laying the first scene in a publichouse gives an opportunity of opening the play and its general design with humor as well as propriety  the bustle of boniface and the pertness of cherry are extremely characteristic nor can any thing be better supported than the forward selfsufficient talkative landlord is with his guests in the first scene the praise of his beer his punctuality respecting its age its killing his wife with the help of usquebaugh his resignation upon that circumstance his transition to the characters of lady bountiful the other ladies and mrs sullen is a wellexpressed chain of connected humorous nothingness which is not a little enlivened by making every person old bonny mentions a subject of appeal to the tankard his curiosity in sounding archer about his master and archers whimsical reserve work a comic effect  the scene of explanation between aimwell and archer seems rather essentially the effect of their situation and scheme than merely a designed information to the audience and boniface comes in happily to prevent its being tedious the conversation concerning supper is well wrought up and archers objections to pig and onions judiciously thrown in whether we consider them as involuntary ones forgetting his assumed station or as a design of giving aimwell a better opportunity of showing himself the master  bonifaces comments and conjectures upon the money which aimwell commits to his care are such as might be expected from such a person who appears under cover of specious open bluntness to be a rogue himself and an encourager of other rogues  cherrys dislike of his principles recommends her  but when she recals the words my father and says  i deny it  my mother was a good freehearted generous woman and i cannot tell how far her goodnature might have tended for the good of her family  she trespasses too much upon the bounds of delicacy  archers ensuing dialogue with her is spirited pleasing and natural females of an inn are deemed lawful game both for genteel and servile travelers what he says to her is commonplace flattery therefore welladapted to a gallant footman her replies are the right drain of barmaid smartness and wit her catching at a slip of expression when he says  there is a swarm of cupids my little venus which has done the business much better  that being rather above the rest of his style  is well thrown in and his confusion upon the unexpected questions respecting his name parish etc not only gives cherry a plausible reason for viewing him as a dubious character but also affords him a very good opportunity of exhibiting equivocal looks and expression the short subsequent repartees are extremely pleasant their concluding with a second kiss and bonifaces calling cherry give a timely termination to the first act  at the beginning of the second act mrs sullen a married and dorinda a single lady are introduced by their conversation we find that the former has been bred up in and is fond of townlife that the latter has passed her time in and is reconciled to rural retirement or at most a country town  mrs sullen after rallying country pleasures and giving no very favorable idea of her lord and master in a description as inconsistent with decency as his behavior is with goodnature and good sense approaches the squire on his entrance with becoming affability to which he makes very brutal returns indeed sullen appears to have no manner of business here but to draw his own picture when sober as he does afterward when drunk on ordering scrub to get ready for shaving his head the lady throws out a most shameful hint concerning his temples which to make it more gross is in representation twice repeated this gives scrub who catches her meaning an opportunity of raising a gallerylaugh by the mean piful pantomimical action of representing his  horns with two fingers this piece of behavior shows the lady to be void of sense as well as modesty a servant and such a servant as scrub especially is a strange confidant for such an explanation we heartily wish the stageladies would omit the passage and go directly to inveterate stupidity did you ever know etc  the remainder of this scene has spirit yet offers but a very faint exculpation for mrs sullens mode of thinking and speaking except in that line where she says to dorinda if i go a step beyond the bounds of honor leave me the mention of going to church immediately after such a conversation is i believe not at all unnatural in a fine lady  the short ensuing scene is of very little consequence except containing some very just and keen remarks upon the impression that aimwells external appearance is likely to make the satire though only pointed at a country congregation might be as justly applied to many thousands in this metropolis who are equally devoted to outside show and unmeaning curiosity  gibbets account of his plunder is pleasant and satirical bonifaces mention of his two guests natural and their joint endeavors to sound archer with his evasive answers are truly comic the introduction of cherry with her childish repetition of loves catechism preserves a flow of spirits  we could wish the question where love goes out had been omitted the discovery of archer not being a footman is well thrown in and the girls proposition of marriage though something forward by no means unnatural how she stands possessed of two thousand pounds immediately at her own disposal admits some doubt archers hesitation falls well in cherrys taking it as a confirmation of his superior rank justifies her discernment and the friendly hint concerning her father shows her heart in a very favorable light  archers soliloquy is very pertinent pleasant and lively but somewhat ungenerous where speaking of one who has offered so substantial a proof of confidence and regard he says  if the wench would promise to the when the money were spent  egad one would marry her this may be gallant but it is mean and mercenary also notwithstanding rhimes or tags as they are called appear peculiarly absurd in comedy we are willing to forgive the four following for that good sense they exhibit and that certain truth they so agreeably convey in verse almost as easy and natural as prose  for whatsoever the sages charge on pride the angels fall and twenty faults beside on earth i am sure amongst us of mortal calling pride saves man often and woman too from falling the ladies again present themselves and inform us that the single one has received one of loves instantaneous lighteningwinged darts from aimwells eyes while at church mrs sullens raillery in this scene is extremely suitable both to character and occasion  there is great judgment in reserving one character or more to the third nay even the fourth act this reinforcement farquhar has most happily availed himself of in the parts of scrub and foigard the former of whom is most certainly a child of whim yet so near nature and so fraught with laughter that he must please the latter is as much within the rules of critical propriety as possible and an object of real entertainment  scrubs packet of news concerning the strange gentleman cannot be unfolded properly without having a powerful effect the conjectures he relates and his own of aimwells being a jesuit because his footman talks french must dilate even the rigid muscles of stoicism  love like necessity being a parent of invention we must admit the young ladys sending scrub to cultivate an intimacy with aimwells footman as a natural piece of policy servants being in general a communicative index to the fortune family connections and qualities of their masters and mistresses which archer in his conversation with scrub seems well acquainted with and profits by as we shall find upon coming to that scene  aimwell and archer support different feelings in their succeeding scene becomingly the former speaks of his mistress with all the rapture of real passion the latter dwells upon their original view her fortune yet steps somewhat aside and with much pleasantry mentions his own adventure with cherry his burlesque heroics the nymph who with her twice ten hundred pounds with brazen engine hot and coif clear starched can fire a guest in warming of the bed are not only a just reproof to aimwells romantic allusions but also a laughable satire upon those poetical writers who appropriate high flown strained images and pompous versification to the most trifling circumstances  bonifaces disposition of introducing his guests to each other is truly that of a country landlord and his attempt to find out aimwell when he replies to his invitation of gibbet  who shall i tell him sir would  is very consistent with impertinent curiosity and low cunning  gibbets rusty appearance and aenigmatical mode of conversation are certainly well adapted to his character aimwells questions are suitable and hint a just suspicion of the pretended captain bonifaces preparative for foigards appearance in a blundering affectation of knowing men and languages is very laughable and the priests joining company enriches the short scene he is concerned in very considerably  archer and scrub are now exhibited in a diverting state of familiarity the droll simplicity of the latter is a well drawn contrast to the polite shrewdness of the former who artfully feels the simpletons pulse and under friendships assumed veil winds into the subject he has in view this whimsical teteatete never fails even with indifferent performace setting the risible faculties at work scrubs terrible secret of being in love with gipsey is a most forceable stroke of low humor and the chain of explanation which arises from it concerning the french count the priest and mrs sullen is extremely natural opening part of the plot seemingly without any design of the author the transition to scrubs various employments very properly puts a stop to the conversation and the ladies appear in very fit season  mrs sullens throwing down her fan by way of lure to a footman though a smart agreeable fellow shows her in the light of a giddyheaded coquette or something worse it would have been an allowable method of beginning conversation with a gentleman but to a servant in livery violates decorum besides it does not answer the intention for scrub is forced to act as master of the ceremonies at last  archer in his conversation with the ladies uses judiciously that strained style of expression which we may suppose a coxcombly valet would be fond of and lady howdyes message is as poignant a piece of satire upon the unconnected jargon and unintelligible lumber of words a fashionable footmans scull is loaded with as ever was penned his reply to mrs sullens surprise at his not being better provided for came from the authors heart though now commonly omitted  i was offered a lieutenants commission but that is not provision for a gentleman this seems a contempt thrown on subaltern gentlemen but farquhar felt the forceable truth having been in that station himself if it was too little forty years ago what is it now when every article of life is advanced above a third and yet military pay remains unaugmented though judges and several officers of state who had salaries large enough before have been considerably increased reader excuse this short digression strong feelings for a very respectable and serviceable set of gentlemen have forced it from us  dorindas information that archer probably is a companion of my lords in disguise rather palliates her sisters favorable disposition toward him but mrs sullen true to the unblushing principles of a vicious heart throws off all reserve in these words  i chose the count to serve me in a design upon my husband but i should like this fellow better in a design upon myself  after such an explicit declaration who can say that this lady deserved a better husband than sullen neglect on one side long acquaintance frequent interviews and very engaging qualifications might warp even virtue at an unguarded season but at first sight and such inferior rank it is literally too gross  sullens behavior is such as we may expect from him after his exit a design is mentioned which as the play is performed cannot possibly be discovered for it never comes to action nor explanation the author is not to blame for by means of the frenchman mrs sullen means to awaken her husbands jealousy but that character being totally omitted that matter remains in the dark unless something can be picked up from what foigard says afterward but how a spectator is to know that for the project here hinted at we cannot tell  lady bountifuls character is amiable and aimwells feigned sickness well contrived to gain admission to his mistress the bustle occasioned by his mistake is well conducted but there is a line frequently introduced to create laughter in the upper regions which occasions us to wish shakespeares excellent rule was more enforced by managers and better observed by performers  let your clowns speak no more than is set down  or if this is too strait a limitation for the ministers of momus we would at least have them consult decency in their own additional wit nor sacrifice it for a little smuggled applause we have heard what follows frequently spoke  you shall taste my water it is a cordial i can assure you and of my own making which scrub facetiously enforces by saying do taste it sir for my lady makes very good water another stroke of mrs sullen for which we must criminate the author is very offensive when archer says i find myself very ill at this minute she replies aside indeed with this emphatic observation i fancy friend i could find a way to cure you  aimwells introducing his footman to the ladies is what i believe no peer or commoner ever did in similar circumstances notwithstanding the apology of his understanding pictures  foigards conversation with gipsey entirely appertains to the under plot of introducing the count into mrs sullens closet the priest is herein well characterized too many we fear of that fraternity having made a very bad use of their influence over families  the picture scene between mrs sullen and archer if we can reconcile the ladys amorous condescension contains many pleasing allusions and delicate compliments particularly comparing the duke of marlborough then in the zenith of glory to alexander the hint of his own disguise thrown out in jupiters approach to leda and asking the lady if she did not serve the painter who presumed to draw her breasts as jupiter did salmoneus for imitating his thunder are well imagined though in a romantic strain what follows respecting the bedchamber is as extraordinary a coupdemain of gallantry as can be met with considering the circumstances of such different rank so slight an acquaintance time of the day and company at hand if the attack be truly british as archer insinuates then are britons lions in love scrubs entrance is critical and lucky his confused manner of telling the priests plot humourous and natural  the comparative view of compliments from their lovers for mrs sullen honestly owns archer such between her and dorinda is very spirited but both the ladies rather call a blush upon the cheek of modesty when one says  you cannot think of the man without the bedfellow i find to which the knowing young lady replies i dont find any thing unnatural in that thought while the mind is conversant with flesh and blood it must conform to the humors of its company another passage not very defensible is  mine spoke the softest moving things  mine had his moving things too this reply is generally delivered with such an illustrative emphasis that there needs no ghost to tell what the character or at least the actress means we wish this arch mode of expression as it is called was reformed all together and it soon would be if public resentment instead of applause attended it  in the latter part of this scene the author labors and with some effect to make mrs sullen apologize for herself when she speaks of her own heart and the violence done her feelings by a brutish insensible husband some rays of partiality will break in upon us for her unhappy situation yet her relapse in these lines banish them all  to confess the truth i do love that fellow  and if i met him dressed as he should be  and i undrest as i should be  look ye sister i have no supernatural gifts  i cannot swear i could resist the temptation  though i can safely promise to avoid it and that is as much as the best of us can do  a very pretty compliment truly  not resist temptation then where is virtue avoiding what may endanger it is most certainly prudent but resisting solicitation and curbing our own passions prove integrity  the chastity of a nun locked up within grates and walls is no merit but if the same person amidst the gay world guides her steps in the right path this is positive virtue which we believe a great majority of the fair sex are capable of and rises far above that degree of mere negative virtue which mrs sullen palms upon her sex having no other principle herself  archer who seems to have no real honesty from the beginning confirms it by his remark upon aimwells saying when he speaks of dorinda it is a pity to deceive her nay if you stick to those principles stop where you are foigards prevarication and archers detection are whimsically droll  the priests catch at tipperary and saying he went to school at kilkenny is as natural and pleasant a blunder as we have met with  the short scene between boniface and the robbers is only introduced to let the audience know the design on mr sullens house  a new character sir charles freeman without whom the catastrophe could not have been brought about makes his appearance at the beginning of the fifth act and not only from the landlord but from the squires personal appearance and conversation gains a confirmation of the disposition of his hopeful brotherinlaw  the scene between archer and mrs sullen is supported with great warmth and vivacity the eclaircissement is wrought up to a strong pitch of passion and becomes very critical when scrubs fright in a very convenient and laughable manner interrupts it but archers remark upon his disappointment is gross to the last degree and should never be spoke  the very timorous stag will kill in rutting time scrubs mistaking him for one of the thieves is a natural effect of fear and varies the dialogue pleasingly  the seizing of the robbers and the disposal of them fall well in gibbets remark that he must save some part of his money to bring him off at the sessions is a keen just stroke of satire against that vile perversion of justice which for bribes protects rogues who can pay well  archers availing himself of a slight wound to draw lady bountiful and mrs sullen aside that aimwell may address dorinda to more effect gives the plot a probable progress dorindas generous objection to a hasty marriage and its delicate effect upon her lover are very agreeable incidents not a little heightened by foigards dissatisfaction at being so often called to no purpose archers reproach to aimwell shows him in a very unfavourable light  the unexpected intelligence brought by sir charles freeman of aimwells succeeding to his brothers title and estate opens our views to a favorable conclusion which till this remains judiciously doubtful archers confusion upon hearing of sir charless arrival shows commendable and nataral spirit dorindas next change is very well imagined and the reason she assigns for it shows refined generosity which is that as aimwell had heartily acquainted her with his poverty she thinks it her duty to let him know his good fortune before their marriage  archers immediate demand of half the ladys fortune is mean and unmannerly and aimwells replies are somewhat strange for the situation of things as this comedy is played we find foigard most absurdly introduced to speak of the robbery as being told to him though the audience has already seen him in presence of the same characters placed as a guard over the thieves this by the author was put into the frenchmans mouth however a slight alteration may bring propriety to the priest only making him enter with  arra sure there has been another robbery  then the mention of boniface falls in aptly  cherrys billetdoux shows honest attachment and sure never was so contemptible a return made for generosity as archers disposing of such a girl with two thousand pounds fortune to be gipseys successor in dorindas service  the scene of separation between sullen and his wife has a peculiar degree of humor and delineates both the characters pleasantly upon sullens refusing to refund his ladys fortune archer makes a most extraordinary proposition first with respect to the ten thousand pounds aimwell resigns in his favor then by putting the squires bank notes and writings into sir charless hands these bank notes etc we find were taken by mr gibbet how archer came by them we do not so clearly perceive unless he picked his pocket when first seized but allowing he does as may be justifiable what right does that give him over the papers that he should lay ten thousand pounds mortgage on them and how amazing a compliance is the squires acquiescence to such a demand instead of saying his head we think he should reply my pocket aches consumedly but all of a sudden he grows the best natured brute imaginable and invites them to be as merry as they please in his house and at his expense  if wit be an essential of comedy this piece is certainly deficient in that point for we find scarce any of those unstudied flashes of imagination which claim that title however the dialogue is easy spirited and natural throughout well varied and well adapted to the several characters the humor forcible and maintained without descending too low the characters well grouped and the scenes arranged with judgment yet it is to be lamented that there are few moral sentiments that the plot is in many places reduced to pitiful expedients for support that the principal man and woman are despicable wretches that human nature is shown in a very unfavourable light that several passages raise gross ideas that the voluntary divorce is absurd that archer and mrs sullen are left in a very unsatisfactory or offensive state that the whole piece is totally without a moral and that the four following conclusive lines have no meaning at all or else a very bad one both happy in their several states we find those parted by consent and those conjoined consent if mutual saves the lawyers fee consent is law enough to set you free   thus mr farquhar dissolves the marriageknot with as much ease and expedition as alexander did the gordian of old one would think his method had been pretty generally inculcated and is well received among the great world at present  in respect of characters we perceive that archer is a gay sensible gallant but unprincipled young fellow whose chief wish is to repair a shattered fortune and obtain pleasure at any rate hazarding honesty for the one and social as well as moral obligation for the other his attack upon cherry may pass but his romantic one upon mrs sullen is absurd as well as vicious the view of gain one main point is in no shape answered there yet notwithstanding these objections he is a very agreeable and therefore dangerous dramatic object vices should never be dressed up in pleasing colors however such he is drawn by the author and now we shall merely consider him in the mode of action  the attributes for supporting this part are vivacity of deportment significancy of look and pert volubility of expression every one of which mr garrick possessing it is no wonder his performance should be capital the scenes in which he particularly outstrips competition are those with cherry  where he delivers lady howdyes message and the picture scene with mrs sullen  mr smith is very sprightly agreeable and characteristic nor is mr lee without considerable merit but still we must insist that mr garrick both as footman and gentleman maintains his usual great superiority though not so much as where more forceable powers are wanting  we have been so unfortunate as to see mr sheridan walk through this character and have heard of mr mossops undertaking it but the report cannot be true as it must nearly reduce him to the state of the king of the antipodes in cronon that is making a topsyturvy part of it and standing upon his head  aimwell who is only a plain unaffecting gentleman found better support by far from mr ross and the late mr palmer than from any other person we have seen sullen is well enough in the hands of mess gibson and burton but was indescribably better in possession of mr quin nay of mr luke sparks mr love exhibits the ignorant jocund effrontery of boniface equal to any one we recollect and mr moody is extremely characteristic in foigard yet we must be of opinion that if criticism would enjoy a feast of originality from the hibernian priest it must be found in the performance of mr sparks now at drury lane  scrub is a very marked and striking character simple yet cunning forward though timid a tattler affecting secrecy and a fool assuming wisdom his situations are happily grotesque and pregnant with much pleasantry a performer must have very faint comic powers who cannot keep an audience in good humor with this part and yet some very capital ones have run wild mr the cibber gained applause but entirely from making droll faces mr woodward took the same path with some variations for the better mr shuter also has the fault of being rather too comical while mr weston by an admirable naivete of performance most certainly stands unrivalled in the part and throws all elaborate mechanical acting far behind  as to the ladies the old one is a very good woman but neither here nor there in action mrs sullen has been sufficiently animadverted on to show that she is very censurable yet she must always gain attention and respect from an audience mrs pritchard and mrs woffington had each great merit in this part but undoubtedly preference was due to the former who with a figure less happily adapted and less vivacity still preserved the character without rendering the licentious passages so offensively intelligible or dwindling so much into the affected coquette of living performers we can only say that mrs barry gives satisfaction upon very just principles yet must own a wish to see mrs abington who is happily devoted to comedy and that alone in possession of this part first because her attributes are extremely suitable and next because the small number of characters she plays does not often enough gratify the public desire of seeing her in respect of mrs lessingham who performs it at covent garden we wish her a better income off the stage than she makes on it and should be very glad to see mrs bulkley fill up her present cast which though confined is of too much consequence to be dallied with  dorinda is amiable but not interesting what could be made of her was to be found in the placid modest sensibility of mrs palmer who though she never could equal great undertakings always made seconds of this kind pleasingly respectable every thing we wish for in cherry miss pope furnishes but miss ward though she means well is far too faint  hamlet written by mr william shakespeare the opening of this tragedy is extremely well devised the time of night the place the characters and what they speak all most naturally concur to raise an awful preparatory apprehension for the appearance of that supernatural agent on whom the main action totally depends and indeed so artfully has shakespeare wrought upon his great patroness nature so powerfully does he engage our passions upon this occasion that even those who laugh at the idea of ghosts as old womens tales cannot avoid lending an eye and ear of serious attention to this of hamlets father  introducing him previously to some of the inferior characters brings him with double force upon the principal one and horatios determining to acquaint the prince with so strange and alarming a circumstance is very natural  the singularity of hamlets appearance as a mourner when all the rest of the court are in a state of festivity and congratulation raises our idea of his filial affection and concern his indifferent contemptuous replies to the king and his catching so eagerly at the word seems used by his mother are a happy commencement of his character laertess soliciting leave to travel seems merely calculated to keep him out of the way and to learn fencing against the fifth act  the first soliloquy of hamlet is particularly striking and essential as it lays open in a pathetic beautiful manner the cause of his melancholy and paints his mothers frailty with strong feeling yet preserves a delicate respect  the scene which introduces horatio etc to communicate the circumstance of the preceding night succeeds naturally and the broken mode of conversation in lines and halflines is so artfully contrived is executed in so masterly a manner that the spectators though they previously know the subject are yet agreeably lured on to hear it related and thoroughly sympathize in the transitions of hamlet whose interrogations concerning the awful ambassador of heaven are such as give us a stronger feeling of the ghost than even his appearance does on the princes determination to watch notwithstanding his violent agitation he might have used a phrase less censurable than the following i will speak to it though hell itself should gape and bid me hold my peace   laertess short advice to ophelia is pregnant with affection and good sense as polonius is introduced to hasten his son on board we could wish those excellent maxims for youth in the first scene of the second act and which are always omitted in representation were transposed to this place and given personally by the father to his son such a treasure of useful instruction should upon no account be lost to the stage poloniuss observations to ophelia are prudent and descriptive of paternal affection  the remarks of hamlet and his friends when entered upon the platform are very politically thrown by the author upon a far different subject from what has brought them there and with the intervention of a flourish of martial music usher in the ghost with as much or more effect than at his first appearance  the princes address begins with becoming awe yet we apprehend rises too suddenly into expressions ill applied to the venerable wellknown beloved figure then before him terror does indeed confound reason but seldom gives birth to a passionate presumptive effusion wherefore we must be hardy enough to offer an objection against the following lines as to their import be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned be thy intents wicked or charitable   nor can we by any means acquiesce in opinion that a heart so fluttered and affected as hamlets is could possibly dictate multiplied images most certainly we discover much more of the poet and fancy than suitable feeling in  tell why thy bones hearsed in canonized earth have burst their searments why the sepulcher wherein we saw thee quietly interred has opened its ponderous and marble jaws to cast thee up again   besides in the strictness of observation it is worthy notice that hamlet in one line calls the appearance in view a spirit and immediately materializes him by mentioning the corporeal appurtenance of bones the conclusion of this scene is admirably composed of broken sentences terror passion and assumed resolution  in the succeeding scene a narration of a very affecting nature is delivered by the ghost in language worthy that inimitable author who created characters from the force of imagination and from the same inexhaustible source furnished a peculiar mode of expression from each  the roman catholic opinion of purgatory is inculcated through the whole of this interview and funeral rites or preparatives thereto particularly mentioned in this line unhouseld unanointed unaneald but whether shakespeare may thence be deemed a favourer of popish principles remains a matter of much doubt and the determination could we come at it would be of no consequence to our present purpose however let the religious bent be what it may we must admit the ghosts stimulation to revenge furnishes a very gross idea of immortality which should be freed from the passions and remembrances of clay nor does the palliative distinction which forbids any violence against the queen take off the imputation of mortal frailty hanging about an existence merely spiritual an abrupt departure and those beautiful lines with which the ghost disappears are a very happy conclusion to the scene which spun out to a greater length would have lost much of its force and beauty  hamlets ensuing soliloquy is very natural and highly expressive of the impressions left upon him his conversation with horatio and marcellus is judiciously evasive for the circumstance just learned of his fathers death does not admit in policy of communication and if it did a repetition would pall the audience however though this scene altogether has the merit of pleasing propriety we can by no means unless hamlet here assumes his frenzy commend the light expressions to his fathers shade  truepenny  working in the cellarage  old mole  worthy pioneer  especially as he is calling upon his friends in a most solemn sensible manner for a promise of secrecy  thus ends the first act which is so full of business and that of so important a nature that perhaps no author but shakespeare could have produced any thing after relative to the same story worthy of attention yet what follows shows us the possibility and executive power  polonius commences the second act with ophelia who in a very picturesque manner makes her father and the audience acquainted with the princes distraction which the sly old statesman imputing to hamlets passion for his daughter determines to avail himself of with the king as appears by his reading a letter and commenting upon it in the next scene which with the queens admitting love as a probable cause of her sons phrenzy determines them to feel his inclination upon that point polonius like a busy useful courtier undertakes this and encounters hamlet whose pretense of not knowing him occasions much pointed satire and several agreeable repartees from whence polonius not being able to deduce any thing useful retires and makes way for two other courtspies who under a veil of friendship endeavor to worm out the secret but he evades their design in a different and more masterly manner there could not be a more pregnant rich and philosophical dissertation upon the mode of his own mind and the excellence of human nature than the following elegant piece of poetical prose delivered by hamlet  i have of late but wherefore i know not lost all mirth foregone all custom of exercise and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a steril promontary this most excellent canopy the air this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears to me nothing but a foul and pestilential congregation of vapors what a piece of work is man how noble in reason how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals  in the foregoing passage we have as concise and beautiful a delineation of human nature as thought can conceive or words express and the immediate transition to mention of the players who though seemingly intruders are material agents for the plot is excellently contrived by the author since hamlet as we may justly suppose from his proceedings immediately suggests that use for the actors in their profession which soon after he makes of them  when polonius enters to tell him of the comedians the prince again assumes his style of equivocal repartee and indeed is pleasingly witty with the verbose old statesman his welcome to the players is well adapted to the mode of behavior he has put on but his hint to the lady of her voice like a piece of uncurrent gold being cracked in the ring is not commendably delicate requiring a taste of their quality and making a mistake in the first line of that passage he points out respecting pyrrhus are pleasing and natural circumstances though of the minute kind  from the imagery of those speeches which the player repeats it appears plainly that they and the scene in the third act are not only intended as preparatory means to convict the king of guilt but are also meant to realize the characters of the main action therefore the matter manner and action are evidently proposed as a contrast of fiction to what it is necessary the audience should think truth  there is no sentiment in the whole character of hamlet nor indeed any other more worthy a good heart and great mind than his reply to polonius who says he will use the players as they deserve much better  use every man according to his deserts and who shall scape whipping use them after your own honor and dignity the less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty  at the beginning of the soliloquy which concludes the second act hamlet gives himself additional force and reality by alluding to the players fictitious feelings compared with his own substantial cause of grief the design of rousing conscious guilt in his uncle by a representation similar to the murder of his father is politic and well introduced for a million of instances furnish indubitable proof that murder though it have no tongue will speak with most miraculous organ his remarks that the spirit he has seen may be a devil and that the devil may have power to assume a pleasing shape savor very strongly of a weak superstitious mind and give us no exalted idea of the princes head however favorably we judge of his heart  in the first scene of the third act we find the king eager to get the cause of his nephews supposed frenzy the play being mentioned and an invitation for the court to see it his majesty from political reasons agrees and ophelia is left to try what explanation she can bring her lover to  the celebrated soliloquy  to be or not to be  is he e introduced and exhibits a beautiful chain of moral reasoning the objection thrown in against suicide  the dread of something after death is concise persuasive and highly consonant with the true principles of moral philosophy critics have with justice pointed out the inconsistence of that parenthesis which styles the future world an undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveller returns notwithstanding the masterspring of this very play is such a traveller therefore a palpable flat contradiction to the above assertion the author no doubt meant a corporeal traveller but it is stretching indulgence very far to admit such a latitude of expression  the conversation between hamlet and ophelia is finely imagined to puzzle the spies who watch his words and actions and though it exhibits madness yet as polonius remarks of a former scene  there is method in it shakespeare in all his pieces seems to have had great regard to the capital characters both as to strength and variety the feigned madness in this piece tends greatly to the latter and gives much scope particularly in this scene for powerful action  the kings proposition of sending the prince to england though a strange scheme shows the apprehension which conscious guilt fixes on his mind  hamlets advice to the players is as just and sensible a lecture upon several theatrical excellencies and errors as ever was penned but few who perform the part have a right to deliver it being in many instances guilty themselves of those very absurdities which they recommend a reformation of  hamlets behavior in the scene of the play is extremely characteristic his sportive replies to ophelia and his satirical taunts to the king suit the state of things happily indeed the mock representation and every other circumstance are very well conducted toward the grand point and his majestys abrupt retreat sufficiently evinces his guilt the ensuing convention with rosencraus and guildenstern plainly shows the just opinion hamlet entertains of court sycophants and his playing upon polonius is pleasant as well as poignant  the kings soliloquy is a most finished piece of argumentative pathetic contrition and furnishes a very instructive picture of a guilty mind of hamlets which immediately succeeds we cannot speak favorably as it greatly derogates not only from an amiable but even a common moral character  revenge when most provoked rather violates human feelings however as in some instances the heart cannot decline it and what more provoking than the death of a father yet life for life is the utmost that can be required for a mortal vice or failing premeditately to plunge the perpetrator into a state of infinite misery had we power would be giving nature a diabolical bent therefore when hamlet resolves upon taking his uncle in some peculiar act of sin that his heels may kick at heaven he certainly forms a design and utters sentiments more suitable to an assassin of the basest kind than a virtuous prince and a feeling man  in that excellent scene of the closet where the prince so beautifully and so powerfully remonstrates to his mother upon her guilty and shameful situation there appears an incident which rather casts another shade upon our heros character that is the death of polonius it happens evidently through a mistake supposing him the king yet when the mistake is discovered he has not common humanity enough to regret taking the life of an innocent inoffensive old man nay the father of a lady too for whom he professes a regard but by the following lines seems to hold the matter light thou wretched rash intruding fool farewell i took thee for thy betters take thy fortune thou findst to be too busy is some danger in the conclusive speech of the act it is true he seems to feel but we apprehend too slightly and making himself the vindictive minister of heaven is arraigning providence for influencing punishment where no guilt has appeared by the same mode of argument every rash or bad man may palliate the most inordinate actions  indeed why polonius should be killed in flat contradiction to every degree of poetical justice is rather mysterious if meant merely as a cause for laertess resentment and ophelias madness we must assert that both might have been brought about on a better principle as will appear from some general strictures on the plot  the ghosts appearance gives great force to and raises a very beautiful climax of passion in this scene and it is impossible to form an idea of any thing better calculated for actors to strike or an audience to feel in the circumstances and expression are so highly deserving of each other that the performance must be languid indeed and feelings totally benumbed if both eyes and hearts are not much interested  the kings resolution of sending hamlet to england seems justly precipitated by the unjustifiable event of poloniuss death the scene in which the king enquires for the body contains some pointed expressions and the princes departure is of that unaffecting nature that we doubt whether one spectator out of a thousand ever said i hope he will come again though from such a voyage so late in the piece it seems very doubtful  ophelias distraction is an extreme pretty variation of action and is described with a forceable delicacy worthy of shakespeares pen laertes is ushered in with a strange insinuation importing no less than a proposition to choose him king how this became necessary or is reconcilable we cannot see as in a preceding scene the king says that he cannot enforce any law against hamlet on account of the murder committed because he is loved of the distracted multitude who like not in their judgment but their eyes and where it is so the offenders scourge is weighed but never the offense   nay speaking of the matter afterward to laertes the king delivers himself thus why to a public court i might not go is the great love the people bear him who dipping all his faults in their affection would like the spring that turns wood to stone convert his gyves to graces   now if hamlet was so extremely popular how is it possible to suppose that laertes by complaining of a private injury should supersede him in the peoples favor and gain their voices to the prejudice of his birthright besides laertess attack upon and language to a monarch without knowing a syllable of the matter he contends about makes him an absolute drawcansir equally the foe of justice reason and decorum indeed the author seems to have been sensible of this making the king say will you in revenge of your dear fathers death destroy both friends and foes   ophelias second introduction relieves and gives some sparks of life to a conversation full of false fire and impotence wherein one party appears a blustering fool and the other a dastard villain as to the conspiracy against hamlets life it seems the ne plus ultra of a forced catastrophe a plan which by approving it shows laertes to be as much an intentional murderer as the king  there is a degree of detestation mingled with contempt and that disagreeble feeling both these characters raise the queens account of ophelias mournful end is justly admired and though the lady while in her senses said very little to affect us yet here the poet teaches us to feel for the event which has deprived her of life  notwithstanding mr voltaires objections to the first scene of the fifth act as being inconsistent with the dignity and decorum of tragedy are in a great measure true yet the characters are so finely drawn such pointed satire and such instructive moral sentiments arise as give it great estimation and raise it far above insipid propriety some expressions of the gravedigger in answer to hamlets question how long a corpse will be in the ground before it rots however true are offensively indelicate  the funeral of ophelia is indeed a maimed and to me an irreconcilable piece of work she is we find allowed christian burial is attended by the king queen and whole court yet the clergyman refuses funeral service supposing her death doubtful though the queen in the foregoing act imputes it without reservation to an accident and we venture to presume there is no medium between admission to consecrated ground with all usual ceremonies and a total exclusion from the whole but the author seems to have been in a state of difficulty  he would have a grave and made the best apology for it he could  the encounter of hamlet and laertes is supported with an excess of spirit on both sides and if we consider the real state of things rather blameably on the part of the former he has killed the father and in consequence deprived the sister of her senses yet when a grieving injured brother and son vents an explanation very excusable in his situation the prince even at the interment of a woman he pretends love for indulges a most outrageous degree of passion interrupts a sacred ceremony and offers his lesson in style of a challenge to laertes nay after most insulting behavior when separated  he retorts accusation upon the challenged person in the following irritative taunt hear you sir what is the reason you abuse me thus i loved you ever  but it is no matter let hercules himself do what he may the cat will mew the dog will have his day   there is indeed a palliative excuse made by hamlet to laertes for this inconsistent behavior at the beginning of the last scene  where he says  this presence knows and you must needs have heard how i am punished with a sore distraction what i have done that might your nature honor and exception roughly awake i here proclaim was madness   now if it be considered that this madness has been but assumed this appears a mean prevarication to a man whom he has most deeply injured and who to his knowledge never meant him wrong to say that this passion was put on to deceive the court weighs but little as we find in the action dishevelled hair ungartered stockings etc are laid aside for a composed appearance and immediately after the bluster we perceive him not only regular in conversation with a coxcomb messenger of the kings but punctual in the terms of the challenge and coolly sensible in fulfilling it before the court without any design more than the credit of victory in view  another faint apology is made in a scene with horatio where the prince seems to be sorry that the bravery of laertess grief should so far provoke him but all this scene except a very few lines is left out in the representation and indeed though meant to account for hamlets coming back it draws such a strange picture of his getting at the kinds dispatches and forging others to turn the design of his death upon rosencraus and guildenstern that we may lament such low chicanery in a character of dignity one who had no occasion but much to the contrary to appear a volunteer in his uncles proposition of sending him to england however as the transaction of his speedy return should be accounted for we wish somewhat more like a narrative was preserved in action  ostrick is a whimsical mushroom of fancy and though shakespeare presents his audience with a danish beau he took the constituent parts from english courtbutterflies of his days and even furnishes him with the equivocal punning style which took its rise and fashion from that second solomon james the first whose pedantry and hatred of witches were equally conspicuous  the last scene if there are two good fencers which by the bye seldom happens must please the eye considerably yet such a slaughter of characters must cloy the most sanguine critic that ever thirsted for theatrical bloodshed and pity must extend very far indeed to attend even the expiring hero of this piece with any degree of patience  having thus progressively delineated the plan it becomes necessary to make some general strictures upon the whole to justify those occasional remarks which have been made  at the opening of the play we find that a very remarkable apparition has been seen by the palaceguard two nights together yet so resolute and secret have these soldiers been that no mention is made of it except to horatio who disbelieves the story but on his watch the third night is convinced by ocular demonstration upon which he very naturally determines to mention it to hamlet in particular as seemingly most interested in the appearance this in conjunction with bernardo and marcellus he does the next morning here it seems a little irreconcilable that horatio the particular and intimate friend of the prince should be in elsineur two days or more as we must suppose from circumstances before he paid respects to his royal patron these we confess are minutiae yet claim notice in the strictness of criticism  hamlets assumed madness might undoubtedly have been made the instrument of some important secret purpose relative to his fathers murder and his own just resentment yet as it now appears answers no other end than merely cajoling the king distressing the queen and ophelia bamming polonius and the courtiers and giving great scope for capital acting which last article seems much more the authors intention through this piece than decorum and consistence  the king not being able either by his spies or even condescending to be a listener himself to find out the bottom of this frenzy which through conscious guilt to him looks terrible forms a resolution of sending hamlet to england under pretense of receiving tribute but as appears afterward that the complaisant english monarch should put to death the heir of the danish crown upon mere request  strange that he who found means to destroy his own brother in the plenitude of power and popular esteem should take such a roundabout method to dispose of a nephew he seems to fear and full as strange is it that hamlet who has so much cause to suspect his uncles intention and who has such powerful motives for staying at home should tamely without objection go upon the voyage  on returning we do not find him taking any step toward punishing the murderer nay most politely undertakes to win a wager for him how unworthily for him then does the catastrophe come about when wounded with a poisoned weapon himself when he hears of his mothers being poisoned then and not before urged by desperation not just revenge he demolishes the king of shreds and patches as he properly styles his uncle in the third act  from this view it is with all deference apprehended that after his detection at the play if his majesty upon the principle of selfdefence had formed a design of taking the prince off by instruments at home if that design had been made known to the queen had she through maternal affection put hamlet on his guard and had that prince taken measures worthy the motives of stimulation a tyrant of some consequence and uniformity would have been shown in claudius a tender mother in the queen and a hero in hamlet the innocent characters polonius and ophelia might have been saved and death prevented from stalking without limitation at the catastrophe as it stands no less than eight of the characters are disposed of that way four in view at one time upon the stage  in respect of characters we are to lament that the hero who is intended as amiable should be such an apparent heap of inconsistency impetuous though philosophical sensible of injury yet timid of resentment shrewd yet void of policy full of filial piety yet tame under oppression boastful in expression undetermined in action and yet from being pregnant with great variety from affording many opportunities to exert sound judgment and extensive powers he is as agreeable and striking an object as any in the english drama  in the performance of this character we must as in richard place mr garrick far before any other competitor his reception of and address to the ghost his natural picturesque attitude terrorstruck features low tremulous expression rising in harmonious gradation with the climax of his speech and feeling all give us the most pleasing we had almost said astonishing sensibility in all the pointed parts of the dialogue his matchless eyes anticipate his tongue and impress the meaning upon us with double force no man ever did nor possibly ever will speak hemistics broken sentences and make transitions with such penetrating effect in this lies the indisputable superiority of our modern roscius that where other performers and good ones too pass unnoticed he is frequently great where an author is languid he gives him spirit where powerful due support out of many instances we shall select only two first where hamlet says to his interposing friends  i say away  then turning to the ghost  go on  i will follow  his variation from extreme passion to reverential awe is so forceably expressed in eyes features attitude and voice that every heart must feel the second is in the third act where the queen says the ghost is but the coinage of his brain his turning short from looking after the apparition with wildness of terror and viewing his mother with pathetic concern is most happily executed  mr barry gave considerable pleasure in hamlet which was however chiefly derived from a fine figure and musical voice but declamation and originality were wanting  mr sheridan under the disadvantage of a moderate person and still more moderate voice by the effects of sound judgment undoubtedly stands second in the lighter scenes he wants it is true ease and levity but in the soliloquies and the third act closet scene he is or has been truly excellent  mr ross has the ease of a gentleman and dignity of a prince but wants weight for the declamation poignancy of expression for the spirited parts and variation of countenance for the vehement passions however he might justly gain more critical applause if he would forget the audience glow with his character and be more assiduous in the support of every scene not drop some as if unworthy his notice  the whole part of the king except his soliloquy is truly wretched for an actor and to say the truth we never saw one who did not make a very insipid figure in it the late mr sparks excepted he was great in the forementioned soliloquy respectable in every passage of the least regard and so peculiarly happy in falling when stabbed from the throne that we may truly say a good end apologized for a very bad character  polonius is drawn with some tint of the whimsical yet we cannot suppose him meant for that laughing stock that buffoon of tragedy he is generally represented wherefore we must be bold to assert that mr macklin who while his capabilities lasted should never have been separated from the stage was far the best of many we have seen he showed oddity grafted upon the man of sense and as we remember retained most of that scene at the beginning of the second act which good sense and shakespeares friends must lament the general omission of  mr shuter whom nature conceived and brought forth in a fit of laughter may mean extremely well but in this character his literally happy countenance plays rather against him mr taswell and mr arthur steered a medium course which if it did not reach capital propriety yet deserved considerable praise  laertes is a character no way remarkable unless as contributing to the catastrophe unless by joining in and executing a villainous device for the destruction of hamlet mr lee whose abilities strengthened many second and third parts while they marred principals made more of laertes considerably than any other performer has done for several years  the ghost is most admirably written and according to the idea we form of supernatural utterance adapted to supernatural appearance mr quin has never been excelled nor by many degrees equalled solemnity of expression was his excellence in tragedy and if we may be allowed the remark his fault though not directly to our purpose at present we cannot help observing that shakespeares fame as an actor was disputed only because he wrote as plainly appears from the mode of speaking mr garrick by most excellent example has established he certainly as a judge and lover of nature despised the titumti monotonous singsong then fashionable and indeed equally admired till within less than these last thirty years for this reason he was judged to be but a middling performer except in the ghost and there with propriety no doubt he assumed pomposity which on other occasions less commendable would have rendered him a very popular actor want of action in the ghost throws a damp on the narration if a spirit can assume corporeal appearance there can be no reason to suppose imaginary arms motionless no more than imaginary legs however some peculiarity in this point as well as the tones of expression should be observed  horatio is the only amiable man in the piece yet except his first scene is very inconsiderable what could be made of such a character mr havard showed in full and it would be wronging mr hulls sensibility for such feelings as actuate hamlets friend not to acknowledge he does him great justice  the gravedigger was never in better preservation than with mr yates the queen should be an object of detestation or pity yet is neither but an odd compound of both mrs pritchard here as in many others much more interesting  when shall we see her like again ophelia found a great friend in mrs cibber and has no reason to complain of her intimacy with miss macklin  as to the versification and dialogue of this piece they are flowing without monotony poetical without bombast easy without flatness and always speak to the heart where there is opportunity or occasion to transcribe all the beautiful passages would seem a design to fill up and to produce only few where there is abundance must be deemed partiality wherefore we refer to the readers taste and the piece itself presuming to conclude our remarks on it with one general observation which is that no play can afford more entertainment on the stage or improvement in the closet though abounding with superfluities and inconsistencies several of the former are omitted in performance most of the latter must remain all the moral we can deduce is that murder cannot lie hid and that conscience ever makes a coward of guilt  the recruiting officer a comedy by farquhar the opening of this comedy is peculiar in two respects first as no other begins in the same manner and next as its title is verified in the first scene there is one essential toward drawing characters in a masterly manner a strict intimacy with and a thorough knowledge of the station of life represented this requisite mr farquhar thoroughly possessed in the piece under consideration the military life he not only liked but was himself immediately connected with therefore we may naturally suppose his portraits drawn from striking likenesses and are highly finished however as examination will prove this point either for or against the author better than supposition let us proceed to a candid trial  the character of a good recruiting sergeant is as complicate for low policy or more so than any other he must have smoothness and volubility of tongue seeming generosity professed goodnature pliable compliance to flatter different tempers unblushing confidence unbounded lies a still conscience and an unfeeling heart these qualifications must be the test of kites character  the first speech of this noncommissioned officer to the mob is a masterly piece of military elocution it touches with strong propriety upon those points most likely to impress the simple the idle and the dissolute introducing himself to costar permain by offering his cap to try on and the countrymans apprehensions of such an experiment are highly in character the serjeants account of the bed of honor the recruits disgust at being saluted by the title of brother and his being soothed into good humor by some compliments thrown out upon the importance of his figure render this scene highly pleasing  captain plume is well introduced as hearing his own drum but he appears to have a strange idea of smart riding and expedition when he speaks of one hundred and twenty miles in thirty hours in the ensuing scene kite preserves his character of humor and throws out some excellent strokes in mentioning the recruits he has picked up one in particular conveys just satire though perhaps not generally understood speaking of a welsh parson he has enlisted the captain asks can he write to which kite replies hum  he plays rarely upon the fiddle this alludes to a scandalous circumstance then common and we fear now to be met with too often among curates in wales we mean stipends so low as ten pounds a year which occasioned many to work as day laborers but the most usual method of eking out such pitiful allowances was to keep hedgealehouses and every sundayafternoon in particular to amuse their parishioners with some tunes on the fiddle the circumstance of mrs molly at the castle seems to have no connection with the piece except to show some part of plumes character and to give a hint of the shadows which frequently fill up military musterrolls  worthy whose name is no otherwise exemplified in his character than as a tame and we may add a simple lover opens the important secret of his being in love and plume with much pleasantry rallies the romantic swain throwing out some useful observations upon love policy but whatever justice there may be in the following piece of advice it is very unbecoming the due reserve of a stage the captain speaking of what he would do to win a coy mistress speaks thus the very first thing that i would do should be to lie with her chambermaid and hire three or four wenches in the neighborhood to report i had got them with child nor is a passage some lines after more justifiable where mentioning sylvia the honorable captain declares he would have debauched her if he could and continues  she was a pert obstinate fool and would lose her maidenhead her own way the anecdote of sylvias sending ten guineas to mrs molly does credit to her feelings and places her in esteem of the audience before she makes her appearance  in the next scene the ladies are very well contrasted melindas affectation of refined notions is very genteelly repulsed by sylvia who pleasingly blends good sense with vivacity if any double entendre is allowable the following would certainly appear so but for the luscious intimation of theatric expression and the gross enforcement of melindas reply  sylvia says i can do every thing with my father but drink and shoot flying and i am sure i can do every thing my mother could were i put to the trial  to this her friend without much delicacy rejoins you are in a fair way of being put to it for i am told your captain is come to town another passage in melindas part of this scene is to me highly censurable to sylvias declaration of being tired of her sex the expective lady replies you are tired of an appendix to our sex that you cannot so handsomely get rid of in petticoats as if you were in breeches  the succeeding altercation between the female friends is extremely well devised and supported with much vivacity  the retorts arise naturally from each other and run into pitpat dialogue which adequately performed cannot fail to please  sylvias retreat is well timed to prevent excess but a remark of lucys after she goes off is infamously gross melinda proposes this question did you not see the proud nothing how she swelled upon the arrival of her fellow to which she receives the following answer from her maid who seems replete with the same ideas as her delicate mistress her fellow has not been here long enough to occasion any great swelling yet this and the other exceptionable passages i have pointed out might be very easily softened or if entirely omitted would be no loss in point of wit or humor  justice balance who opens the second act with plume speaks in the true english style for it is certain that the people of this island in general bear the taxes occasioned by war with great spirit when their fleets and armies furnish the newspapers with a violent effusion of blood which some may interpret as a mark of national inhumanity but rather appears to be the effect of a noble spirit which pants for superiority in the fields of fame and sacrifices weaker feelings to principles of glory  plumes frequent mention of sylvia interrupts the justices political bent pleasingly and when balance speaks of a dishonorable design upon sylvia as no more than similar to what he once had himself on a country gentlemans daughter the captains distinction between a friend and a stranger shows gratitude with delicacy of principle but flatly contradicts his declaration to worthy already noted which avows the design he here disclaims  sylvia is well introduced and the justice called upon conveniently to leave her with plume their encounter is polite and delicate but though the author seems to have meant a refined compliment in the circumstance of the captains will we cannot consider it as any other than a very suspicious one had it been sent to her on the eve of the battle provisionally it would have been what she calls it but to be the bearer of it himself to make personal mention takes off much of the obligation the ladys hint of his little boy at the castle is arch and pleasant and plumes following confusion very natural  justice balance after speaking of his sons death addresses his daughter with much intentional affection and prudent propriety intimating that as her fortune is increased from fifteen hundred pounds only to twelve hundred a year estate he expects her views should be more extended and desires her to think no more of captain plume when we say that the justice here speaks with propriety we only mean as a man of the world for it is plain that the vanity of family connections chiefly influences him which many a father ere now has mistaken for happiness besides if as he says he could like plume as a mere soninlaw to receive fifteen hundred pounds portion it is mean and mercenary to think him unworthy the same lady with twenty thousand nor can we conceive what idea he must have of his daughters mind to suppose she could from such principles shake off regard for a man she has entertained upon favorable terms  the favor asked that sylvia will never marry without his consent and his promise never to dispose of her without her own are strokes which give agreeable sensations to a feeling mind  melindas letter which she hints at the end of the first act starts some motives of perplexity by alarming the justice with apprehensions of plumes design upon his daughter and the old gentlemans sentiments in consequence of it are very spirited but we apprehend there are two intrusions upon decorum in the scene with worthy first ballances charging him with privacy to plumes dishonorable intentions and then refusing his author which is cruelty to an innocent person nor does it appear from the letter that he is enjoined secrecy next worthys descending to such a pitiful discovery as picking up a bit of a torn letter undoubtedly if a man of spirit heard an injurious report raised he would becomingly insist upon an explanation if the matter did not claim such serious procedure the same spirit would set him above peeping into fragments of paper the explanation arising from the matter makes melindas letter rather an excressence than essential to the plot  kite and the two recruits succeed very happily to enliven the latter part of this act which we must consider as rather dull in the preceding scenes the song the description of a soldiers importance giving the recruits titles of dignity and introducing the listing money under color of being the kings picture are all admirably well imagined the serjeants explanation of carolus too is truly laughable plumes joining in their mirth and the countrymans spirit of keeping on his hat to show independency are suitably in character kites roughness before his officer on their mention of going home and the captains interposition on the side of pearmain and apple tree is a true piece of recruiting policy which while it promotes humor in the scene carries on successfully the design of securing the men as volunteers the finesse of giving them their choice to go or stay after chastising the sergeant is excellent as is also the stroke of setting cofter to inveigle his simple companion  the merit of this scene lies in a very judicious humorous contrast of characters who well know life playing upon the simplicity of those who do not and it is so much in nature that a thorough acquaintance with it among young fellows in the country would certainly much impede the success of recruiting mencatchers  plume and worthy commence the third act with a scene no further worth notice than as it shows plume to have a commendable indifference for a woman whom he supposes altered in her affection by a fresh acquisition of fortune and his gallanting the country market girl rose to prove his freedom of heart is a very pleasing pretty incident indeed every one of the characters contribute to heighten and assist each other and the story which kite trumps up to engage bullocks attention while the captain takes off his sister is a circumstance of high wrought humor bullocks complaint to the justice concerning rose furnishes a very laughable scene  the policy of introducing new characters in the third act which was remarked upon in the stratagem is here used to very good purpose bullock and rose have been already brought forward as seasonable enliveners of the action and dialogue a third now appears the facetious captain brazen for whom we doubt not there were many originals in farquhars time and we could point out several of very similar features at the present day  this military sprig whose peculiar leading characteristic appears to be unlimited effrontery is exhibited at his first entrance and through the scene with much judgment with such strong outlines as plainly evince a greater share of originality than imagination his rapid address to worthy his pert observation of the justice the forward introduction of himself to that gentleman his turning the word laconic through ignorance into a proper name and his discussion upon that name are ludicrously whimsical  the affectation of a general acquaintance the boast of courage and the rhapsodical spirited narration concerning frank plume of northamptonshire are excellent ingredients to characterize the empty opinionated coxcomb and brazens departure so consonant to his entrance dismisses him with glee  rose exhibits a very natural picture of that simple pride and pleasure which we may suppose possesses the heart of an unsuspecting country girl upon being addressed by such a man as plume and her spirited attempts at improved behavior before the justice are extremely pleasant as is also the captains attack upon her without seeing balance from whence an agreeable confusion arises which terminates the scene laughably  modest mrs melinda and her modest maid lucy next make their appearance the former in her second speech utters a sentiment which we may pronounce the essence of infamy  flanders lace is as constant a present from officers to their women as something else is from their women to them and the latter replies in a very knowing strain which her mistress takes care to enforce by explanation in short as this scene has no tendency but raising offensive ideas we wish and recommend the omission of it brazen in his address to the lady and rhodomontade declarations presents a diverting peculiarity of character and melindas encouragement of him to mortify worthy suits well a coquettish heart  plumes tipsy condition varies the action and dialogue of his character seasonably giving him an additional supply of spirit and humor but worthys setting on plume to recover melinda from his rival and sheering off as if afraid to plead his own cause show that gentleman in a very strange light either fool or coward at least the encounter between plume and brazen is whimsically imagined and generally gives satisfaction the sighing swain comes in conveniently to take off his condescending mistress who kindly flies to him when apprehensive of danger and without any other retreat for safety  sylvia appears at this point of time metamorphosed into the appearance of a young fellow a circumstance not very consistent with delicate reserve nor even common modesty though authorized by many examples in private life and frequently adopted on the stage when shakespeare wrote no woman appeared on the stage therefore rosalind imogen portia etc were well calculated but at present we imagine plots might be carried on upon more probable principles of deception in this state however sylvia makes a very agreeable figure and plays upon the rival officers with great archness in their several offers we find the author exhibiting keen satire against the army when brazen says you shall receive your pay and do no duty the lady makes this very poignant return  then you must make me a field officer and a little lower there is a most excellent stroke against making men of little education and less religion military chaplains  kites method of introducing and recommending himself to the supposed recruit is highly artful and taking her off while the captains are engaged a good method of terminating the rencounter without bloodshed as to plumes distinction of fighting for a man and not for a woman it appears to us irreconcilable an affront is the spur to honor and to a man of spirit comes with equal force from every quarter and without an affront no one of real courage will draw his sword  roses communication of her interest with plume to sylvia in the first scene in the fourth act is well introduced to alarm that lady with jealousy and her method of sounding plumes real disposition toward the girl is natural bullock though he has but a small share of the dialogue greatly enlivens it with three or four humourous remarks we could wish sylvias reply to rose when she says will you be so kind to me sir as the captain would was more consistent with the character of a young lady plumes explanation of his design in gallanting rose is satisfactory to his mistress and exculpates him from a blameable intention upon unsuspecting innocence sylvia again goes too far when she says to plume lie with a common soldier would not you rather lie with a common woman  melinda and lucy in their short scene drop some expressions similar to those we have remarked upon already worthy who as it appears showed a little resentment when the lady put herself under his protection comes possessed with the same feeling and plays upon her passion with some degree of good sense which draws her into the dilemma of behaving like a virago and produces an unexpected undesigned reception to brazen which is the only material circumstances arising from the interview between the lady and her two lovers  kites appearance and conduct as a fortune tellers is a most satirical burlesque upon the credulity of those weak minded persons who believe in the predictive knowledge of such gentry his appropriation of the sun moon and deities to terrestrial circumstances and stations is a whimsical bam upon heathen mythology and astrology that succession of characters the author originally brought forward in this scene is now much and very properly curtailed in representation to confess the truth except some little use to the plot and a joke or two about the devil under the table there is nothing deserving notice in what remains  plumes discovery of melindas being the cause that sylvia was sent into the country occurs agreeably and the compliments he pays the fair sex for having entertained an injurious opinion of her deserves rather a better epithet than pretty however we could wish they had not been twisted into rhyme but mr wilkes loved to speak an epilogue to every act and as he pleased the audience farquhar thought it a duty to please him  at the beginning of the fifth act we find sylvia in custody and brought before the justice as it appears for seducing rose her intimacy with military weddings is not very characteristic for a young lady of fortune and genteel education and when she speaks of paying whores with a pinch it is still a greater trespass on due bounds indeed the whole scene means little and but for honest bullock would be very insipid  melinda and worthy according to conjuror kites prediction meet when after some altercation in which he charges her with cruelty and she him with base designs upon her virtue which he repents not having put in practice they patch up a strange unprincipled accommodation the three ensuing scenes contain small matter of entertainment nor is that of the justices and recruits much to be admired sylvias behavior before the bench is consistent with her design of provoking them to press her yet some of her remarks might as well have been omitted particularly that when the constable charges her with a rape and receives this reply is it your wife or daughter booby i ravished them both yesterday  brazens rencounter with worthy their ferocious intentions their battle and no battle with lucys method of dissipating the storm show the author hard set to accomplish his catastrophe which is still more plainly evinced by ballances short interview with his steward the remainder of this act hurries on without any manner of spirit humor intricacy or surprise  to consider the plot of this comedy in general we shall find it vague unconnected and depending on very low shifts the fragment of a torn letter being a main instrument one remarkable incongruity is that silvia should appear in a suit of her brothers clothes before her father without discovery though we find on the stewards bare mention of those clothes he immediately sees into the deception silvias contrivance of being given to plume as a recruit is a pitiful equivocal method of keeping her promise given in the second act that she would never give herself away without her fathers consent ballances way of sounding whether plume is privy to the scheme and the captains generous method of discharging the supposed recruit to oblige his friend are circumstances of merit all the underplot of lucy is a mere makeshift and utterly contemptible  plume is an agreeable well drawn character sensible easy and spirited possessed of courage without being fond of showing it feeling to love yet free from amorous weakness gallant but not vicious liberal in sentiment unaffected in expression and disengaged in action a credit to his author and a compliment to the army considered in this amiable light it is not to be wondered that so few performers hit him off happily in representation the ease of an accomplished gentleman and the milder virtues are much more difficult to exhibit pleasingly than low humor strong passions or fashionable vices  a very humane honest man may assume successfully the tyrant or villain in full contrast to his own nature but it is impossible to put on the port and demeanor of a gentleman unless the actor is really one at least in external appearance the late mr palmer was much respected in this part and indeed for the drunken scene deserved extensive applause but in all the rest had far too great a taint of the coxcomb which was so very natural to him in private life that he could hardly ever shake it off on the stage mr ryan under the heavy disadvantages of advanced years and a most unfavourable voice supported the captain with characteristic spirit but we must give mr smith an undoubted superiority for uniform ease elegance and suitable vivacity being the unaffected gentleman in private life he is necessarily so on the stage and it may with critical justice be said that he is both as much and as little of an actor in this part as any one who ever undertook it  mr lee figured plume extremely well and had considerable merit in performing it but from laborious attempts which are usual with him to make more of the character than the author intended he abated much of that pleasure the propriety of more spontaneous action must give in this part  brazen is very happily contrasted to his brotherofficer free without ease talkative without sense vain without consequence full of false fire yet not without some sparks of real courage farquhar in drawing this military coxcomb has preserved due respect for the army he has indeed rendered him ridiculous but not contemptible we may laugh at his follies but cannot frown at his vices for unless some few harmless invasions of truth to flatter his own vanity may be deemed vice he does not appear to have any as a gallant he appears more venal than affectionate as a companion more diverting than rational and as a man more made up of unpremeditated whim than subtle design  the cibber was by no means insipid in this part but he often pleased upon wrong principles particularly here as he ran into the evident absurdity of adding abel druggers grimace to the elegant deportment of foppington both which are totally inconsistent with brazen and utterly incongruous to each other the smart and the beau are each a distinct species of foppery and should be carefully marked  mr woodwaed as in every thing he does displays much pleasantry yet like the last mentioned gentleman makes us laugh in contradiction to judgment by using a sententious quaintness of expression instead of the precipitate snipsnap rhapsodical mode of utterance as is plainly intended for the character we must also lament as we shall often have occasion to do that so many of harlequins misplaced pantomimical beauties should be transplanted with such unlimited luxuriance into the chaster scenes of comedy  after saying thus much of two capital comedians i hope it will not be thought partial to remark that mr obriens person manner and executive powers displayed the true je ne scais quoi of acting and that criticism had very little left to wish for even on his first appearance though a more ticklish part never fell to the lot of a young beginner  balance is a consistent sensible worthy countrygentleman and as drawn much more becoming a commission of the peace than many real magistrates in performance no peculiar excellence can be expected however mr quin made him extremely respectable and mr sparks was several degrees above any present competitor many parts assist the actor but this is one of a larger number which lie heavy on him therefore doing it justice claims the greater merit  sergeant kite with moderate executive abilities must please as he speaks to the feelings in every line there appears little difficulty in representation and yet most who have undertaken him vary from strict propriety some turn him into a noisy bully and others into a subtle sycophant that he is partly comprised of both we own yet they should be so blended that neither may visibly predominate his cunning should soften his consequence and selfsufficiency render his art plausible mr berry  a good actor in some things  was here heavy to a degree mr anderson quite insipid nor is mr morris though nearer the mark by far what we could wish  bullock need not seek for a more adequate friend than mr dunstall as to the recruits they are laughable simpletons that seldom fail of proper effect to distinguish any in these parts where all we have seen are so much upon a level would be partial and setting down the whole would be giving an unnecessary catalogue of names most of which are but little and some not at all known  worthy who in no degree deserves his name being void as far as we see of virtue as well as vice is such an unseasonable water gruel tame pitiful lover that he must be an estimable performer who shields him from absolute contempt which by a welladapted placidity of performance mr hull agreebly effects having judgment to inform him where mediocrity is merit  sylvia the capital lady has spirit and sense but the former runs her into female quixotism and the latter often dwindles into licentiousness her disguise and the situation it consequently throws her into is very indelicate the scheme by which she obtains her wishes wild improbable and culpable  yet while mrs woffington filled this character there was not a more agreeable one on the stage equally degagee in the female and male semblance she ravished in both rendering even absurdities pleasing by the elegance of her appearance and vivacity of her expression as far as her figure would admit mrs pritchard was excellent at present miss macklin justly enjoys a considerable share of reputation in it having spirit of expression sensibility of look delicacy of emphasis and gentility of deportment  melinda is a vicious heap of inconsistencies with a shallow head and bad heart without a single circumstance or speech worth notice except some which call for censure we never saw any body exhibit her who deserved the least mention in criticism lucy is an obscure worthless engine of the underplot  rose is a pleasing welldrawn picture of rural innocence and humorous simplicity in performance we shall say just the same of her as of cherry in the stratagem  the unities of time and place are tolerably well preserved in this comedy but the plot has no trace of a moral and the catastrophe is huddled up without any degree of poetical justice  sylvia by the bye a dangerous lesson for young ladies  in consequence of hazarding her virtue obtains her wishes  melinda gains the man she has used infamously and worthy gets the woman he would have debauched while poor inoffensive brazen is left unrepining to solace himself with twenty recruits instead of twenty thousands pounds in short it appears that our author whose dialogue is unaffected and pleasant considered entertainment more than instruction so that i shall venture to affirm the recruiting officer though it makes us merry both in the closet and on the stage will never leave any useful impressions from either  macbeth written by shakespeare preternatural beings afford the widest most luxuriant field for genius to sport and ideas to vegetate in of this being truly sensible and willing to give his muse of fire unlimited scope shakespeare has in several pieces availed himself but in none more powerfully than the tragedy now before us however though critically we must admire that characteristic peculiarity of sentiment and expression which distinguish the witches it is nevertheless necessary to remark that exhibiting such personages and phantoms as never had any existence but in credulous or heated imaginations tends to impress superstitious feelings and fears upon weak minds for which reason we consider every dramatic piece which treats the audience with a ghost fairy or witch as improper for young unexperienced spectators in particular if as is well known old womens stories of such impress a timidity upon every child who hears their terrifying tales a timidity which lasts to the conclusion of life may we not infer apprehensions of their having a more forceable effect from being realized on the stage  it may be said that interdicting such poetical auxiliaries would cramp genius and deprive us of many unparalelled beauties to this the answer is plain that nothing which has not a good effect or at least an inoffensive tendency should be deemed beautiful or stand estimation  from what is thus premised we hope no other charge will be laid against shakespeare than the barbarous and credulous taste of the times in which he wrote and to which he submitted with possibly an oblique design of flattering the favorite opinion of james the first yet allowing this to be really the case it cannot exculpate his preternatural beings as such from rational censure for the reasons assigned above notwithstanding the author had historical tradition to countenance his introduction of them after this general and we hope just objection against the weird sisters we are to take the piece as it stands and consider distinctly its several component parts  macbeth commences with all the apparatus of terror  a storm a desert and three withered hags of little less than infernal appearance their short conference is full of meaning and a kind of oracular obscurity their sudden disappearance gains a desire in the spectators to see them again and to know in what sort of business such extraordinary agents are to be employed but we know not why they should sink under the stage immediately after pronouncing these words  hover through the fog and filthy air  the kings appearance to hear an account of the battle that account related by a wounded officer with such energy of description and so much to the honor of duncans generals are good preparations to possess us of the heroic part of macbeths part of macbeths character  but why this express of victory should be sent by so imperfect a messenger as one whose wounds yet green wanted the assistance of a surgeon we cannot think if the whole relation had come from rosse it would have been rather more suitable and would have given his character somewhat more importance  the witches at their next meeting question each other concerning their several employments and the replies show them pregnant with that diabolic malevolence which is charged against them the threats vented against the sailor whose wife had refused one of them chestnuts strike every feeling mind with sympathetic terror their preparation for macbeth has something mystically solemn in it  the notice taken of these odd oppearances by banquo is such as would naturally occur to a man of sense and spirit and their alternate climax of congratulation to macbeth much in character him they hail in plain and positive terms of prophecy which throws him very judiciously into a state of silent and confused reflection the author well knew that no words at this period would equal the more suitable speech of countenance and action therefore makes banquo whose open disinterested heart takes no alarm fill up a welladapted pause of the principal character by questioning the sisters concerning himself their replies to him are flattering but aenigmatical and seem to rouse macbeth to a curiosity of further information which however is properly checked for this time by the departure of the witches in his speech to them there appears an observation inconsistent with what is mentioned in the preceding scene macbeth says but how of cawdor the them of cawdor lives a prosperous gentleman   an unsuccessful rebel taken prisoner as cawdor must be by duncans sentencing of him to death could not justly be called prosperous especially by the general who has lately overthrown him but this is by no means a material lapse what we find a little further on shows more strange confusion when macbeth observes that cawdor lives and asks why do you dress me in his borrowed robes  angus makes this reply  who was the thane yet lives but under heavy judgment bears that life which he deserves to lose  whether he was combined with norway or did line the rebel with hidden help and vantage or that with both he labored in his countrys wreck i know not but treasons capital confessed and proved have overthrown him   it is worthy of remark that angus was present when rosse particularised cawdors rebellious conduct to the king notwithstanding he here expresses such ignorance of the cause of his impeachment  macbeths feelings upon this unexpected acquisition verifying in part the prediction which has been so lately pronounced to him the dawnings of ambition which break out upon his unconnected mediation are extremely natural but his adverting to murder for obtaining the state of royalty in view show him much too susceptible of villainous impressions  there are many circumstances and events to bring about the most unthought of changes in human affairs wherefore that man who premeditates the worst means at first must have by nature a deep depravation of heart and such macbeth will appear infected with from the whole of that speech which begins two truths are told etc notwithstanding some what like palliation is offered in two or three lines indeed his conclusion seems to banish what he beautifully styles fantastical murder but cannot banish from spectators his barbarous ideas so suddenly conceived we have dwelt upon this circumstance to strengthen our opinion that the author meant to draw him a detestable monster which some critics have rather disputed allowing him a generous disposition which we find no instance of even the conscientious struggles which we shall presently find him engaged with might arise in the most villainous nature  he who does a bad action precipitately or without knowing it to be such may stand in some measure excusable but when a man has scrupulously weighed every relative circumstance in the nicest scale of reflection and after all determines upon what nature gratitude and justice would avoid he must be composed of the worst materials  to coroborate the general idea of macbeths character which we have here offered and which will be enlarged upon when we go through the whole piece let us view him in the very next scene where after a most cordial reception from the king with unbounded promises of future favors he is so possessed of his base purpose that void of even common gratitude he replies upon duncans appointing malcolm prince of cumberland the prince of cumberland that is a step on which i must fall down or else oerleap for in my way it lies  stars hide your fires let not night see my black and deep desires the eye wink at the end  yet let that be which the eye fears when it is done to see   from this passage it appears that not content with the simple idea of regicide he determines to cut off the whole family in return for being loaded with honors by royal favor and at the very instant when this unsuspecting monarch and friend places himself upon his hospitable reception if this does not prove macbeth an exception to the satirists remark nemo repent fuit turpissimus we know not what can  lady macbeth and her husbands letter are judiciously introduced but sure such sympathetic barbarity was never in nature as suddenly on the instant breaks out in these words glamis thou art and cawdor  and shall be what thou art promised   what follows accuses macbeth of a milky softness in his nature of which he does not seem at all possessed for unsuccessful struggles of conscience cannot justly be called so however that he may not have the whole load of aggravated guilt to bear alone our author has made this matchless lady  we lament so detestable though a possible picture of the fair sex  exert uncommon talents of temptation on hearing of the kings visit with most unrelenting precipitation of thought she dooms the royal visitant  her invocation to spirits of evil influence is worthy of a powerful imagination and macbeths interruptive entrance extremely well timed but we must offer some doubt whether the word blanket of the dark does not convey a low and improper idea  macbeths mention of duncans approach without making any previous reply to his wifes cordial reception is a natural effect of what sits nearest his heart and her coming to the main point at once is well devised for working him up to her great purpose her confining the sentiment of murder in less than a line and warning him to disguise those looks which appear too intelligible impress us with a strong idea of her policy as does her second hint of duncans death and promising to take a great part of the dreadful business on herself  the short scene before the castle has nothing material in it except the following truly poetical remark made by banquo  this guest of summer the templehaunting martlet does approve by his loved masonry that heavens breath smells wooingly here  no jutting freeze buttrice nor coigne of vantage but this bird has made his pendant bed and procreant cradle where they most breed and haunt i have observed the air is delicate   lady macbeths strained compliment to the king has also merit as being natural no truth being more certain than that treacherous hypocrisy ever strives to wear the fairest smiles  in such a state of guilty perturbation as macbeth now appears no mode of expression could be so suitable as that of soliloquy it were to be wished however that our great author pursuing energy had not in some sentences bordered upon obscurity especially if we consider those passages as only repeated on the stage where the ear must inevitably be too quick for reception in an alteration of this play which has been often performed there are some attempts to render the lines we speak of more intelligible but like most other paraphrases they destroy the essential spirit  the reflection that if he could but gain ease even in this life he would jump the life to come is rather wildly impious but the inevitable temporal punishment of a conscience loaded with guilt is very well and commendably inculcated the arguments for declining the murder are so forcible that nothing but the most hardened heart under such conviction would proceed  where he personifies pity and mounts her astride on the blast fancy takes a very vigorous flight nor does expression fall beneath yet we are afraid they leave propriety behind the following lines are in our opinion very exceptionable  i have no spur to prick the sides of my intent but only vaulting ambition which oerleaps itself and falls on the other    to embody intention that ambition may be a spur to prick its sides leans toward the burlesque and then turning the spur into another body that it may vault over instead of gaining the saddle of intent corroborates this idea indeed this speech should always end at the deep damnation of his taking off  for pity  heavens cherubim and ambition all upon the full gallop are strained figures at least not at all adapted to a man deliberating upon one of the foulest most important murders he could commit  lady macbeth comes to speak in rather plainer terms yet unless we allow great latitude of expression what follows evidently admits of objection  was the hope drunk wherein you dressed yourself has it slept since and wakes it now to look so pale and sickly   suppose we pass over the literal acceptance of hope being drunk surely we must blame a lady of high rank for descending to such a vulgar and nauseous allusion as the paleness and sickness of an inebriated state nor is her comparison of the cat in the adage much more the effect of good breeding  macbeths reply to the very gross rebuff he has just received is as concise significant and noble a one as ever was uttered but his bloodyminded viragos next speech toward the conclusion wounds humanity with such a sentiment as no woman should utter nor any rational being hear yet that strange horrid picture of dashing a smiling infants brains out and laying a plan for complicated destruction occasions macbeth to say bring forth men children only for thy undaunted metal should compose nothing but males   should he not rather have said bring forth fierce tigers only for thy relentless nature should compose nothing but beasts   if it should be urged that such characters have been and may be we still contend that they are among the frightful deformities and essential concealments of nature which should be excluded from the stage  the midnight interview of macbeth and banquo at the beginning of the second act very properly ushers in the dreadful business then in agitation that prophetic heaviness of heart mentioned by the former his presenting a fresh mark of favor from the king to lady macbeth his speaking of the three weird sisters and macbeths affecting to slight the remembrance of them though not very obvious are yet considerable beauties we could heartily wish this passage did not occur  there is husbandry in heaven their candles are all out    what a poverty of idea and expression yet we also find the stars called candles by our author in his romeo and juliet  how much more worthy of himself and of his subject is what lorenzo styles them in the merchant of venice pattens of bright gold  in macbeths soliloquy where a visionary dagger strikes his minds eye the abrupt introduction of that alarming object is very judicious and beautiful nor can any thing be more natural than the effect it has on macbeth which is most admirably described and strongly impressed by a nervous succession of breaks which for a dozen or fourteen lines rise into a powerful climax of confusion  the momentary pause of unclouded reason which relieves imagination from her painful load and the quick return of coward conscience diversify the sentiment and action in a most interesting manner the picture of midnight as favoring witchcraft rapes and murder concludes this inimitable soliloquy with a due solemnity of terror a soliloquy of such unspeakable merit that like charity it may apologize for a multitude of faults  lady macbeth at her entrance gives us a piece of information not very defensible unless it is meant as some palliation of her character  the false fire of liquor for which she seems to have very little occasion must be in her situation rather a dangerous resource the remainder of her speech is happily disjointed by earnest expectation and jealous apprehension  the remark that a likeness of her father in duncans sleeping appearance prevented her from doing the business herself lets in a gleam of humanity upon this female fiend  the entrance of macbeth his highwrought confusion and every syllable of the ensuing scene exhibit an unparalelled combination of judgment and genius calculated to awake the drowsiest feelings and to alarm the most resolute heart  the picture of the grooms crying out in disturbed dreams  one heaven bless us and amen the other with the inimitable description of sleep and the idea of natures general friend being murdered in that sleep are astonishing efforts of mental ability and for so much certainly place shakespeare beyond any degree of comparative merit  the refusal of macbeth to go again into the scene of blood is an apt stroke of welltimed remorse indeed his bringing the daggers from the place they should have been left in is an extreme welljudged mark of confusion however we would rather have forfeited that instance of judgment than have heaped such savage inhumanity upon the female her boast of having hands crimsoned like those of her husband carries the offensive coloring still higher what succeeds on the interruption of knocking is expressed very characteristically  to what end shakespeare could introduce so incongruous a character as the porter who is commendably omitted in representation we believe no mortal can tell at such an interesting period to turn the most serious feelings into laughter or rather into distaste by a string of strained quibbles is an insult upon judgment and must fill the imagination with chaos of idea  some more suitable pause might have been made to give macbeth time for composing his ruffled figure the short scene between him macduff and lenox is well calculated lenoxs remarks upon the night are very consistent with those superstitious principles on which this play is chiefly founded and macduffs exclamatory entrance discovers duncans murder properly  the successive entrances and exits of various characters the real grief of some and the feigned sorrow of others macbeths apology for his political stroke of killing the grooms by an affecting picture of duncans situation and the rapid resolution of enquiring judicially into so unaccountable an event are all well arranged and happily expressed but the amazing precipitate flight of malcolm and donalbain without any apology except the paltry one of instantaneous fear places these sprigs of royalty in a contemptible light and its effect on the stage proves the justice of this remark for when one says i will to england and the other comically replies to ireland i nine times out of ten the audience are thrown into a horselaugh  we could wish this circumstance was altered as it easily might be by giving a few speeches of spirit and dutiful affection to one or both the princes expressive of their particular determination to discover and revenge their fathers death which might be overruled by macduffs representation of the danger they stand exposed to and that for their greater security it would be better to retire till the unavoidable convulsions of state were subdued or till proper measures could be taken to establish the legal succession this we apprehend would have carried them off with some grace whereas in their present disposition they make such a wretched figure that we can scarce forget it when malcolm appears to assert his right at the head of an army  the continuation of omens between rosse and the old man seems to have little meaning unless to keep reflection in an unremitted state of terror and unusual events are carried to a very strange pitch indeed when rosse asserts that he was eyewitness of duncans horses eating one another  macduffs account that macbeth is already named and gone to scone to be invested with royalty is a great trespass on time there being but twenty lines or thereabouts from the stealing away of the princes as it is properly phrased and his account of every thing being thus settled in consequence of their supposed criminal escape  introducing the witches at the end of the second act is a very seasonable relief to a feeling mind from the painful weight of horror which some preceding scenes must have laid upon it and in suitable music they continue the story predictively as a kind of chorus their rejoicing in the mischief already done and that which yet lies in the womb of time shows a disposition worthy such agents as the subordinate fiends of darkness  banquos reflections with which the third act begins are well adapted to the circumstances and all his doubts of macbeths elevation by honorable means natural as is also his adverting to the prophecy in favor of his own posterity the new kings fresh professions of friendship to and hospitable invitation of his former colleague and friend fix if possible a deeper stamp of baseness on his character but at the same time exhibit strength of policy and the succeeding soliloquy points out nervously motives for a fresh instance of barbarity the firm untainted dignity of banquos nature joined to the prediction of his childrens succession to the throne are strong motives of jealousy to rouse the bloodstained usurpers unrelenting disposition which takes the sure though meanest method of removing his fears by assassination  in respect of macbeths scene with the murderers we apprehend he uses too much circumlocution especially as we perceive by what he says at their entrance that those ruffians have been made acquainted with a main part of the affair banquos oppression of them being possessed of this does it not seem more natural that the tyrant would after this line we are men my liege immediately come to both of you know banquo is your enemy than run into the unessential digressive though just comparison of men and dogs we know it may be urged that murtherous intentions are communicated with slow and jealous caution this is undoubtedly the case in particular characters and circumstances  it is masterly to make king john wind about the disposition of hubert gradually he being a person of some consideration and doubtful principles but for macbeth to expatiate so much at large with such fellows as he seems to pick out appears a waste of words had there been any passage to indulge the authors fancy or to favor the performers action and utterance then a little superfluity would stand particularly excuseable with an audience and find some indulgence even from a critical reader as the scene stands we have ever observed it to pall in representation  what succeeds between macbeth and his lady is well adapted to their unavoidable perturbation but would have fallen in better as a continuation than making two distinct scenes macbeths exit after the murderers have left him is superfluous every thing he advances in this short conference shows a striking poetical yet natural picture of mental gloom and heartfelt agony his invocation of night and description of its solemn approach are pleasing effusions of genius  the scene of the murderers banquos fall and fleances escape is partly trifling partly shocking and seldom fails of proving laughable we wish something better had been substituted and the circumstance referred to a relation of it by the murderer we could also wish that decorum had not suffered by such a ragamuffins entrance into a room of state amidst the whole court and apprehend no necessity for this therefore are induced to blame it  considering the place hurry of spirits etc are bold to censure all the following speech except the first hemistich and the last marked in italics they are certainly as much as any man so situated would have said therefore what comes between is superfluous  then comes my fit again  i had else been perfect whole as the marble founded as the rock as free and general as the easing air but now i am cabbind cribbd confined bound in to saucy doubts and fears  but banquos safe had the affair been communicated in a proper place the disapointed usurper might have thrown out much more extended spirited remarks on the illboding failure of his foremost wish reproaches on the murderer for executing his charge imperfectly execrations against fortune for throwing any painful rubs in his way with other matters which might have been suggested would have added much at least to the acting merit of his character  banquos ghost which without being too ludicrous we may call the rawheadandbloodybones of tragedy is nevertheless well introduced to throw macbeth into those violent agitations which nature must feel and such as furnish extensive powers an almost unlimited scope to show themselves the words of both macbeth and his lady are beautifully applicable through the whole scene which concludes so far as the ghost is concerned with as forceable a climax of impassioned terror as ever any author penned the reflections which follow in the conclusive part of the scene are such as naturally arise from the subject and are nervously expressed macbeths determination to consult the witches plainly indicates the agitation and weakness of a guilty heart and a superstitious head we should be glad to know how he is so well acquainted with their places of rendezvous as to know exactly the spot of consultation  the witches receive in the following scene a sharp rebuke from their superior hecate for dealing in any mischief which did not originally spring from her she delivers herself in a fanciful style and opens with propriety their business at the pit of acheron  that remarkable incantation which begins the fourth act the mysterious ceremony practiced the emblematic ingredients collected for enchantment and the arrangement of them show a more peculiar luxuriance of fancy than any other author ever compacted into such narrow bounds the music also as in two former scenes has a very just and pleasing effect  macbeths mode of addressing the witches seems too much of the compulsive influenced by and giving credit to such beings we may naturally enough suppose his approach would have been in a milder strain however he brings to view a number of striking images respecting their power  a number of strange indeed very strange apparitions or sucking ghosts present themselves and deliver flattering dubitable predictions well calculated to mislead credulity and macbeths eagerly catching at the most favorable interpretation shows coward conscience like a drowning man catching at every broken reed for support the long train of shades representing the succession of royalty is well enough calculated to impress additional uneasiness upon the tyrant but such a superabundance and variety of specter palls even terror fatigues imagination and offends sight a dance is very well introduced here to relieve attention  one would naturally suppose that macbeth had enjoyed a full sufficiency of such agreeable company yet we find him rather displeased that they are gone the intelligence of macduffs flight to england is well thrown in to give spirit and an opening of business his wife and children being devoted to destruction in consequence we might reasonably expect from what has been already shown of macbeths jealous impatient cruelty  the next scene of macduffs lady and son where murderers come and demolish the latter in view of the audience is if we can be allowed the phrase farcically horrid as disgraceful an oddity as ever invaded shakespeares muse and therefore with great justice omitted in representation  the scene between malcolm and macduff is very happily conducted a politic suspicion makes the former reprobate himself that he may come more perfectly at the thane of fifes real disposition whose honest patriot principles must ever warm and please attention those reflections he throws out on vices which shame and endanger royalty are instructive and beautiful his short picture of the late king duncan and his queen to rouse the prince their son to emulation nobly pathetic and this proving the key to unlock malcolms reserve shows great judgment  a doctor brought in merely to introduce mention of english edwards power to cure by a touch  that very dubitable circumstance of tradition  is at best trifling or a paltry compliment to the then reigning monarch nothing at all to the matter in question and only breaks in abruptly upon a very interesting continuation we mean the heartfelt intelligence that rosse brings of the fatal tragedy acted in macduffs family his first speaking of general griefs the miseries of scotland is a welljudged preparative for a more confined and peculiar concern relative to one of the characters present indeed macduffs enquiry for scotland before his wife and children shows great magnanimity of mind and rosses diffident manner of revealing their lamentable fall is sensibly humane hence the scene by degrees of most exact proportion presents a climax of grief which never fails to work a general and suitable effect and concludes with a pleasing spirited denunciation of revenge against the bloodstained usurper thus the fourth act terminates leaving as every fourth act in particular should do an impatient expectation impressed upon the audience for what must follow  lady macbeths physician and one of the ladies of her bedchamber begin the fifth act with a few preparatory and pertinent speeches for a circumstance not expected the tormenting effects of a thorny conscience galling that female fiend beyond all power of disguise or composure a circumstance the more pleasing as it approaches us unawares and beautifully vindicates the justice of providence even here upon this bank and shoal of time  walking and speaking while actually asleep has been verified by many hundred instances therefore her lady ship is brought to view in as justifiable and affecting a situation as could possibly have been imagined  her disjointed mode of speaking the imaginary spot on her hand  the confused apprehensions of macbeths timidity similar to what she expressed at the time the action was really committed and the explanation thrown in by the attendants are admirably combined we may also venture to pronounce the heavy sigh she vents on despairing to clear herself of blood a striking effusion of a guilty heart her departure is finely and most naturally precipitated by acting over again the confusion which arose from knocking at the gate  four loyal leaders appear next as on their way to join the lawful prince their conversation has little material in it save properly acquainting the audience that the tyrant coops himself in dunsinane castle beleaguered with his crimes more painfully and closely than by his foes  macbeths expressions at his entrance most plainly evince a disturbed brain and forced resolution flying for safety to the prediction of the witches is a welltimed additional proof of that superstitious weakness which stimulated by ambition has hurried him into all his guilt and consequent misfortunes  the expressions he uses to the servant or officer who enters with intelligence of the english army are low and gross far beneath even a private gentleman and why shakespeare should make a monarch run into such vulgarisms is not easy to guess for the rage or grief of a king should always preserve peculiar dignity without which the author cannot boast a chaste preservation of character the following speech however makes full amends for a thousand venial slips the breaks in the two first lines afford a beautiful variety of action of tones of voice and countenance  those which succeed are as fine declamatory reflections arising from the consciousness of guilt and general dislike in a sensible man as the severest criticism could relish nor is it easy to determine which claims preference the sentiment or versification  take thy face hence  seyton  i am sick at heart when i behold  seyton i say  this push will cheer me ever or disease me now i have lived long enough my may of life is fallen into the fear the yellow leaf and that which should accompany old age as honor love obedience troops of friends i must not look to have but in their stead curses not loud but deep mouthhonour breath which the poor heart would fain deny but dare not macbeths reply to the physician on hearing of his ladys strong mental indisposition is no less worthy of capital genius no less satisfactory in speaking hearing or reading can thou not minister to a mind diseased pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow raze out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the stuffed bosom of that perilous load which weighs upon the heart   nothing could be more happily introduced from the morals they inculcate and the pause they give to macbeths rage than the two foregoing speeches they are a timely relief to the performers expression which otherwise must have been kept too much on the strain and a delicious treat to every intelligent mind amongst an audience  the scene which follows so indeed every intermediate scene of this act appears only serves to bring the catastrophe nearer to view and to circumscribe the principal character within narrower bounds that expectation of his fate may take wing amongst the audience  they express a firmer though not so outrageous a spirit in the assailing party and therefore appear as a natural contrast to the defensive side  macbeth at his next appearance again breaks out with flashes of false fire vaunting the impregnable strength of his fortress  notwithstanding we have expressed and really entertain a dislike of frequent quotation yet so strong a temptation lies here in our way we cannot resist it and the more readily give way being sensible that every reader of refined conception will rather thank us than pass any censure  besides having pointed out several passages which we apprehend of a contrary nature  it seems a necessary point of justice to the author  upon hearing a scream of women macbeth observes i have almost forgot the taste of fears the time has been my senses would have cooled to hear a nightshriek and my fell of hair would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in it  i have slept full with horrors  direness familiar to my slaughtrous thoughts cannot once start me  wherefore was that cry seyt the queen my lord is dead macb she should have died hereafter  there would have been a time for such a word tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in a petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death  out out brief candle lifes but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more  it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing    the foregoing speech has the first principle of intrinsic merit to an eminent degree moral instruction an equal number of lines never yet exhibited a fuller more complete picture of the vanity of human life and our author has with great address again used the method of realizing his character by making macbeth speak of the player as a fictitious transitory representative  the transition upon a messengers entrance who mentions birnhamwood as moving is truly fine macbeth has rested his security upon the sandy foundation of equivocal promises and now the broken reeds falling away one by one he plunges gradually into the rage and depths of desperation his resolution to sally out seems rather the effect of fatal inevitable destruction than real courage  the business now increases and justly hurries on to a rapidity of material events the tyrant is as himself aptly expresses it tied to a stake and therefore through compulsion must fight as to the combat wherein that unfledged warrior young siward falls it seems to have very little business in the piece unless to increase a torrent of blood already exceeding all due bounds  macduffs encounter with macbeth raises expectation to the very top of its bent and justice sits trembling in every humane bosom for so essential a sacrifice to her as the tyrant the introduction of macbeths sole remaining hope that of being invulnerable to any person born of a woman shows great judgment and his feelings on being told the fallacy of his charm are expressed in very apt terms  why the author chose to execute so great a culprit behind the scenes thereby depriving the audience of a most satisfactory circumstance is not easy to imagine death certainly is made in this instance too modest and the bringing on a head defeats every trace of the authors newborn false delicacy  the present mode of representation is much better  what follows macbeths fall is like the remainder of every tragedy when the plot is revealed and the principal characters are disposed of a matter of very little consequence therefore is confined as it ought to be within the bounds of judicious brevity malcolm however gives a piece of historic information concerning the first institution of earldoms in scotland which a tithe of every audience would not else know  as macbeth in representation dies before the audience it appeared necessary according to dramatic custom to give him some conclusive lines which mr garrick as we have been told has happily supplied as nothing could be more suitable or striking than to make him mention with dying breath his guilt delusion the witches and those horrid visions of future punishment which must ever appall and torture the last moments of such accumulated crimes  it has been already hinted and may be laid down as an irrefragable maxim that moral tendency is the first great and indispensible merit of any piece written for the stage in which light i am afraid the tragedy before us though a favorite child of genius will not hold a very distinguished place fate necessity or predestination has embarrrassed the most inquisitive philosophers the most painful theologists and still remains matter of much perplexity to those who endeavor to develope it shakespeare therefore who was no doubt an able moralist should have declined any subject which glanced an eye that way yet we find his macbeth strongly inculcates power of prediction even in the worst and most contemptible agents inculcates a supernatural influence of one mortal being over another it is but a very weak defense to say he only wrote according to the accepted notions of those times from whence he drew his plot  admitted  but whatever tends to weaken reason to mislead the understanding and intimidate the heart should not be used as a subject for dramatic composition which adorns fiction with her most persuasive charms weak minds are ever more liable to receive prejudicial than advantageous impressions wherefore any character incidents or sentiments which may work the former effect should be industriously avoided if the stage upon some occasions does not improve it should at least leave an audience no worse than it finds them equally avoiding vice and credulity  that we do not charge our author with promulging principles of fatalism without reason let us produce two passages exclusive of the prophecies which are derived from that source  at the end of lady macbeths first soliloquy she says all that impedes thee from the golden round which fate and metaphysical aid does seem to have crowned thee with   macbeth also just before the murderers are introduced to him in the third act expresses himself thus to make them kings the seed of banquo kings rather than so come fate into the list and champion me to the utterance    the very word fate if it has any meaning at all can boast but an unfavourable one to moral fitness it is a term crept into common use and established by custom how frequently do we hear upon the accidental or violent death of any person this absurd remark made  it was his or her fate  a minute investigation of this point would run us into an unpardonable digression from our proposed subject wherefore i have only started some hints for abler critics to elucidate or set aside as may seem fit and shall only add that the plot of macbeth though the unities of time and place are much infringed upon does not strike in representation with any offensive ideas of improbability but rises by very just degrees to a catastrophe which is well wrought up the moral is the same as that of richard the third showing that a guilty conscience is a constant tormentor and that a royal as well as a private murderer is obnoxious to punishment  among the natural characters if macbeth and his lady deserve such an epithet there is very little variety or contrast all the men except the principal are tolerably honest as to the heroine she stands alone  to delineate macbeth is not easy the author seems like prometheus to have made a man of his own but to have stolen his animation rather from hell than heaven by the account we hear of him previous to his entrance magnanimity and courage appear conspicuous in his conduct yet no sooner does he present himself but with all the weakness of unpractised youth he receives a strong impression from old womens prognostications and with all the aptness of a studied villain suggests the most pernicious practices which from that moment with a very few slight intervals take entire possession of his heart from his future proceedings we perceive him more actuated by jealous apprehensions than sound policy more influenced by rage and desperation than any degree of natural resolution credulous impatient vindictive ambitious without a spark of honor cruel without a gleam of pity  in short as complete a tool for ministers of temptation to work upon as ever fancy formed and too disgraceful for nature to admit amongst her works  however considered in the view of theatrical action there is not one personage to be found in our english drama which more strongly impresses an audience which requires more judgment and greater powers to do him justice many passages are intricate some heavy but for the greater part powerfully impassioned the mental agitation he is thrown into requires expression peculiarly forcible of action look and utterance even so far as to make the hearts of spectators shrink and to thrill their blood indeed every assistance from externals is given the actor such as daggers bloody hands ghosts etc but these must be treated judiciously or the effect as we have sometimes seen it may take a ludicrous turn  through all the soliloquies of anxious reflections in the first act amidst the pangs of guilty apprehensions and pungent remorse in the second through all the distracted terror of the third all the impetuous curiosity of the fourth and all the desperation of the fifth mr garrick shows uniform unabating excellence scarce a look motion or tone but takes possession of our faculties and leads them to a just sensibility  as shakespeare rises above himself in many places so does this his greatest and best commentator who not only presents his beauties to the imagination but brings them home feelingly to the heart among a thousand other instances of almost necromantic merit let us turn our recollection only to a few in the character of macbeth who ever saw the immortal actor start at and trace the imaginary dagger previous to duncans murder without embodying by sympathy unsubstantial air into the alarming shape of such a weapon who ever heard the low but piercing notes of his voice when the deed is done repeating those inimitable passages which mention the sleeping grooms and murder of sleep without feeling a vibration of the nerves who ever saw the guilty distraction of features he assumes on banquos appearance at the feast without sacrificing reason to real apprehension from a mimic ghost who has heard his speech after receiving his death wound uttered with the utmost agony of body and mind but trembles at the idea of future punishment and almost pities the expiring wreteh though stained with crimes of the deepest die  theatrical performance to most spectators appears a mechanical disposition of limbs and a parotted mode of speech so indeed it really is too often but intrinsic merit soars far beyond such narrow barren limits she traces nature through her various windings dives into her deepest recesses and snatches ten thousand beauties which plodding method can never display the dullest comprehension may be taught to enter on this side or that to stand on a particular board to raise the voice here and fall it there but unless motion and utterance are regulated by a cultivated knowledge of life and selfborn intelligent feelings no greater degree of excellence can be attained than unaffecting propriety like a fair field whose native fertility of soil produces a beauteous luxuriant crop of spontaneous vegitation which art can only regulate not enrich mr garricks matchless genius not only captivates our sportive senses but also furnishes high relished substantial food for our minds to strengthen by  mr quin whose sole merit in tragedy was declamation or brutal pride was undescribably cumbersome in macbeth his face which had no possible variation from its natural grace except sternness and festivity could not be expected to exhibit the acute sensations of this character his figure was void of the essential spirit and his voice far too monotonous for the transitions which so frequently occur yet wonderful to be told he played it several years with considerable applause  mr sheridan showed more variety of acting in this part than any other and made an astonishing good use of his limited powers without any exaggeration of compliment to that gentleman we must place him in a very reputable degree of competion with mr garrick in the dagger scene and at the same time confess a doubt whether any performer ever spoke the words this is a sorry sight better  as to the third fourth and fifth acts his meaning well was all we could ever perceive to recommend him  mr barry as a capital actor  indeed a very capital one in his proper cast made in our comprehension but a lukewarm affair of macbeth his amorous harmony of features and voice could but faintly if at all describe passions incident to a tyrant in such circumstances as he is placed his commanding figure and other requisites preserved him from being insipid though far beneath himself  mr powell  light lie the ashes of the respectable dead  was beyond doubt partially received in this tragedy the requisite force of expression and a proper disposition of features were wanting after the murder his feelings dwindled into a kind of boyish whimpering and his countenance rather described bodily than mental pain in the third act he seemed unequal to the arduous task of describing extreme horror and in the fifth macbeths weight of desperation bore him down even the soliloquies appeared too sententiously heavy for his expression as his playing the part was certainly matter of choice we are sorry he ever mistook his own abilities so much notwithstanding he met with public indulgence a compliment in some measure due even to the failings of a performer who displayed so much intrinsic merit as he did on more suitable occasions  mr holland that industrious useful laborious imitative actor idolized his great instructor too much to be any thing original in macbeth we deem him particularly unhappy aiming to be great he frequently lost all trace of character untunably stiff in all his declamation mechanical in action ungracious in attitude affected in feeling unharmonious in tones irregular in emphasis and wild in passion yet having an agreeable person significant aspect and powerful voice he often pleased his audience and kept attention awake while judgment was obliged to slumber or seek safety in silence from popular prejudice  among many theatrical circumstances much to be lamented is that terrible necessity which forces mr smith into an undertaking so opposite to every one of his requisites except figure we are confident his good sense agrees with us that saddling him with the part is an imposition upon that good nature and integrity which stimulate him to work through thick and thin for the support of covent garden house  macduff is a part of no great action except on discovery of the kings murder and the fourth act scene messrs ryan and havard both did him great justice yet we must be of opinion that mr reddish depicts him with superior strength and beauty his feelings are manly yet tender spirited without excess and to us convey whatever an author intended or an audience can wish  banquos chief merit is as a ghost here mr ross made the most striking picturesque appearance we have ever seen and with peculiar grace even beautified horror all the rest of the men in this play are unworthy notice  lady macbeth as to the detestable composition of her character has been sufficiently animadverted on therefore little more is necessary than to observe that though there does not appear much call for capital merit yet several firstrate actresses have made but a languid figure in representing her  notwithstanding mrs woffington was extremely well received and really did the part as well as her deplorable tragedy voice would admit we must place mrs pritchard foremost who made a very just distinction in the scene where banquos ghost appears between reproving macbeths behavior with passion or the anxiety of apprehension lest he should betray his guilt this latter method she happily pursued and here as well as in the sleeping scene gained manifest superiority mrs yates at present comes nearest the point of praise but certainly displays no very conspicuous merit in the character and to mention mrs barry would be to injure her as it certainly does not at all coincide with her capabilities  the witches we should take no notice of but for a supposed amendment in speaking and dressing those characters at covent garden as beings out of the course of nature shakespeare furnished them with a peculiarity of style why then should we not suppose he meant a peculiarity of deportment and utterance he certainly did as much as for caliban a languid propriety of natural expression destroys in them pleasing and characteristic oddity  as to dressing them in the sybillic taste it makes them rather roman than scots witches and sacrifices established national ideas at the shrine of false decorum for did appearance ugly features and advanced age dub any female a witch in the times of credulity even now a very disagreeable woman bent with age and wrapped in filthiness is stigmatized with that title though not so seriously north of the tweed nay macbeth himself styles them filthy hags most certainly alluding to personal appearance  if an alteration of dress is to take place in this play we could wish the characters were dressed in habits of the times which would be pleasing and we apprehend is necessary  macbeth for its boldness of sentiment strength of versification variety of passions and preternatural beings deserves to be esteemed a first rate tragedy containing a number of beauties never exceeded with many blemishes very censurable dangerous in representation as has been said to weak minds unintelligible to moderate conceptions in several places upon perusal therefore chiefly calculated for sound understanding and established resolution of principles either on the stage or in the study  the beggars opera written by gay notwithstanding we confess a partiality for music when it is composed of sweet significant and persuasive sounds yet the opera serious or comic but especially the former is a species of the drama not at all defensible it carries absurdity in its front and absolutely puts nature out of countenance to prove this would be superfluous as we cannot pay any reader so bad a compliment as to suppose that a single hint does not bear satisfactory conviction  shocked as every man of real taste feeling and genius must be at the predominance of those dearbought unessential exotics italian operas gay resolved to exercise his unbounded talent of satire against them and that good sense a little embittered might go down with more fashionable gout as apothecaries gild pills he called in music to his aid and such music too as was relishable by not caviare to the million thus as we have read of an army who defeated their enemies by shooting back upon them their own arrows so he struck deep wounds into the emaciated signori of that time by showing such sterling wit and humor as they were unacquainted with decorated with the reigning taste of the day  the thought was happy  ion equal to the design and the success   in the very name of this piece the author seems to have issued a keen shaft of ridicule and making the author a beggar is a noble sarcasm on fortune and public taste which have suffered most excellent talents to pine under a thousand disadvantages of unmerited perjury and even contempt no one knew better than gay the neglect which too commonly attends literary merit he experienced felt and with great poignancy of expression declared it  this piece opens with jonathan wild the reigning thiefmaker and thieftaker of that time under the title of peachum perusing his tyburnregister his song in eight lines contains more of the spirit of truth and satire than would animate some poems of eight score the succeeding scene with filch exhibits many excellent remarks and his account of the gang when looking out for proper sacrifices is not only an admirable but a very useful picture to the profligate mrs peachums expressions of pleasure that there has been no murder committed for some time recommend her to favor and peachums replies showing what money will do in criminal prosecutions is we are afraid too just mention of macheath naturally falls in and the spectators are prepared to receive him at least as an agreeable highwayman his attachment to polly comes aptly into the conversation and the plot very properly begins to dawn  speaking of pollys being in love peachum discovers a very suitable selfishness and where he remarks of what service she may be to him by acting on political principles the expression as well as some preceding ones glows with satiric meaning  my daughter to me should be like a courtlady to a minister of state a key to the whole gang  mrs peachums scene with filch has nothing but some strokes of low humor to recommend it yet in that light is very satisfactory and always works a very laughable effect  polly is introduced by her father under such circumstances as engage favor her mothers violent entrance is much in character the fainting too and the remedy for it are powerful burlesques on similar incidents to be met with in graver pieces the daughters silence on her marriage being discovered is a very probable effect of confusion and apprehension nor does a word of the consequent dialogue fail of due influence the impatience of the parents one through pride the other through interest give a fine opening for pollys delicate interesting apology of a sincere passion for the man she has married and peachums design of taking off his new son inlaw seems the growth of a mind fortified against any feelings of humanity  it is matter of wonder how several of our gay ladies and fine gentlemen can hear the following speech without blushing conscious guilt if she had had only an intrigue with the fellow why the very best families have excused and huddled up an affair of that sort it is marriage husband that makes it a blemish what peachum replies has a luxuriancy of merit but money wife is the true fullers earth for reputations there is not a spot or stain but what it can take out what brilliant what general what compacted satire mounted on the unshakable basis of truth does this short sentence contain how essentially superior to an assimilation of the same ingredients and mr footes pleasantry in the prelude to mr colmans man and wife which difference is only mentioned here to show how much the happy thought of one man of genius may be enervated by passing through the imagination of another  the parents endeavoring to persuade their daughter that an impeachment of the man she loves and is her husband also must recommend her to their favor has something in it shocking yet affords a very engaging pathetic transition in pollys character and her soliloquy upon hearing unseen the plan for macheaths destruction deserves much better delivery much more expressive features than it is in general favored with  the breaks are fine the sentiments tender the description lively all dressed in a naivete of language which finds a passage to the heart by natures aid alone  the hero is brought forward with great advantage the bold spirited symphony which introduces him has a similar effect to those flourishes of martial music in some tragedies and he comes very opportunely to give the first act additional life toward its conclusion pollys distress for his present danger very naturally disappears at the sight and affectionate address of her husband but with equal propriety soon returns again with a variation which pleasingly touches the audience his reluctance to fly and her tender resolution to part for a time rather than hazard his safety raise delicate feelings  as only the first song has been particularized it may be necessary to observe that to avoid repetition as much as possible all the musical part will be taken notice of in our general view of the piece on closing the remarks  in the first scene of the second act we are presented with a set of characters not at all respectable by profession yet amusing and somewhat instructive from their conversation which however we deem too full of sound sense and genteel keen satire for such personages  besides there are some sophistical justifications of highwaymen rather dangerous for dissolute minds in the drama this should be rarely meddled with as natural vice gains more confirmation from delusive show and false arguments than natural virtue does from moral instruction  however placing even thieves above courtiers in friendly attachments as the author has judiciously done in what follows must considerably palliate the objection we have raised one says who is there here who would not the for his friend another replies who is there here who would betray him for interest to which a third returns show me a gang of courtiers who can say as much it is very plain from this and many other inimitable passages that our author knew courtiers in general exceeding well whatever his knowledge of thieves might be  macheaths short interview with his gang means nothing more than acquainting them with the reason of his disappearance for some time by mat of the mints mentioning moorfields as the place of their rendezvous we may learn that part of the town was then as reputable as some other spots of it are at present  what succeeds this scene previous to the introduction of the ladies and their conversation however natural are by no means proper for public representation the dialogue has great spirit and is enlivened by several smart repartees but the subject of action and the characters are so much founded upon licentiousness as not to be defensible improper prejudicial ideas must arise and we heartily condemn the whole from this principle that vice is never more dangerous than when she smiles covering her deformities with a veil of pleasantry  indeed apprehending macheath in the midst of his jollity by the treachery of two prostitutes may convey good warning to some who associate with such wretches yet we are apt to think this scene is more apt to inflame the passions than to correct the conduct of youth and delicate taste must be offended at many sentiments too gross for its tender relish  lockits reception of macheath and his remarks upon the fetters at different prices show the jailer in true humourous yet shocking colors it being a miserable perversion of justice to treat culprits not according to the enormity of their crimes but strength of their pockets  the perplexity of macheath arising from his apprehension of lucys reproaches falls well in and her timely appearance confirms his fear however we must again pass censure upon our author for making lucy speak of her load of infamy from a promise of marriage and her jealousy of polly peachum the plot might have been sufficiently wrought up without allusions so very sensual we mean with respect to the audience macheaths endeavoring to sooth her into a good humor that they may serve his particular purpose though ungenerous is polite and in character the words which lucy speaks at going off i long to be made an honest woman are a strong and pleasant stroke of ridicule against those who vainly imagine that virtue is comprised in any external ceremony and that a mere compliance with established custom can sanctify vice  the satires which occur between peachum and lockit concerning their accounts are masterly and the song which we cannot avoid quoting inimitable when you censure the age be cautious and sage lest the courtiers offended should be if you mention vice or bribe it is so pat to all the tribe that each cries that was levelled at me   we have heard a short anecdote of sir robert walpole against whom gay chiefly brandished his pen in respect of this song which showed an agreeable and politic presence of mind being in the stagebox at the first representation of the opera a most universal encore attended lockits song and all eyes at the same time were fixed on sir robert who noting the matter joined heartily in the plaudit and encored it a second time with his single voice which not only blunted the poetical shaft but gained a general huzza from the audience  the thieftaker and jailer quarrelling upon a principle of honor is also admirably sarcastical upon those known scoundrels who pretend a jealousy for reputation and who insolently quarrel upon principles they are totally unacquainted with  nothing is commoner than for prostitutes to commence vehement burlesque altercations about virtue and gamblers about honesty  lucys interposition with her father in favor of her gallant and his obdurate refusal manifest a strict knowledge of nature as does her determination to effect the captains freedom at any rate no incident ever fell in more opportunely than pollys entrance at this critical point of time it reduces macheath to a peculiar dilemma and contrasts the ladies very agreeably their different feelings are expressed with a degree of very nice distinction tenderness is well opposed by vehemence of affection and the whole scene furnishes extreme agreeable action  pollys patience so long under such circumstances and at last breaking out into womanish resentment is a good delineation of a female mind under some restraint of delicacy yet susceptible of provocation upon tender points the quarrel is well conceived judiciously conducted and wrought into a humourous climax the timely intervention of peachum prevents actual hostilities and causes a pleasing touch of the pathetic while lucys resolution of stealing her fathers keys to give macheath his liberty puts expectation into a fresh degree of suspense and concludes the second act at a critical period  a supposition of his daughters connivance at the captains escape gives rise to lockits treating her somewhat roughly at the beginning of the third act but in the true spirit of corruption which we may style ex officio indeed the effect of his nature as well as place he enquires for the perquisite and is not a little chagrined at finding the girl possessed of generosity  in the short subsequent scene where filch is introduced we can by no means approve his gross answer to lockits observation that he looks like a shotten herring it is certainly only fit for the meridian of st giless  the character of a highwayman is well preserved in macheaths making a gaminghouse his first asylum after enlargement and fitting him up with occasional finery of external appearance shows the author not only a judge of nature but the stage for such sort of collectors general aim at making a gallant figure to appear what they are not and change of dress often gives an actor some novelty with the audience this scene however imports little more than to show the dissipated turn of our hero  peachum lockit and the tallywoman mrs dye trapes furnish us with a dish of conversation censurable throughout though it always pleases by the force of action the subject is too mean for the public ear the characters mentioned too despicable for notice except from the police and the old ladys secrets of her abominable trade infamous we would therefore recommend some other means of discovering macheath and heartily wish a total omission of such stuff as no person can learn anything from which it would not be better to be ignorant of  the design of poisoning polly in a glass of strong waters renders lucy a right newgate bird and makes her though the fact is not perpetrated an object of detestation and we apprehend unnecessarily unless we carry the idea of burlesque constantly in view and consider the author as ridiculing the poisoned bowls of tragedy so often needlessly administered and so often miraculously escaped another billingsgate sentiment we find furnished to lucy in this scene it comes immediately after these words i vow polly i shall take it monstrously ill if you refuse me  macheaths appearing in custody surprises and alarms attention his interview with the real and would be wife is very expressive of the circumstance and good performance may call forth some drops of pity for a very unworthy object  the different applications of the females to their several fathers call up tender sensations but we apprehend they are rather misplaced for as polly is certainly the leading character and offers the most pathetic address hers should have come last by way of climax  the sensible resolution and commendable though divided tenderness of macheath in his song as he goes off to the oldbailey recommend him considerably to favor and are therefore artfully thrown in  as italian operas depend a good deal on dancing merit we find gay has a stroke even at that by introducing a hop among the newgategentry to which by way of making a strange yet satirical medley the condemned hole immediately succeeds and like other great men in some serious pieces the captain sings through all weathers  high spirits low spirits love and despair he has no less than ten airs to go through successively yet so judiciously varied that he must be a bitter bad vocal performer indeed who palls his audience with them the following short scenes between him and his friends and that with the ladies claim no great share of praise nor do they merit any censure  that very unexpected turn the catastrophe takes is thus apologized for by the beggar in this kind of drama it is no matter how absurdly things are brought about  so you rabble there run and cry a reprieve  thus by a kind of poetical or rather operatical legerdemain hey pass misery is gone and leaves joy and cheerfulness in its place  to examine the plot of this piece by strict rules of criticism as the author does not by any means pretend to regularity would be too severe yet the unities are not grossly intruded upon except in one place  there are but threeshort speeches and a dance between macheaths being taken to trial and his appearing in the condemned hole which could scarce happen till a day after at least as prisoners though found guilty are not put there till after sentence  the dialogue of this opera has great ease spirit and correctness the sentiments are always just though sometimes blameable the satire inimitable and the songs without one exception bating that of mrs trapes an unparalelled treasure of brilliant allusions instructive ideas shrewd tendency familiar expression and unaffected versification they have the plain outward semblance of common ballads yet teem with a luxuriance of imagination truth and policy most amazingly compacted into an incredible narrow compass which in our estimation entitles them to be styled the quintessence of merit  yet after offering this impartial tribute at the shrine of gays genius it gives us concern to be under a necessity of remarking that a moral was the last point in his view if it entered there at all and in this respect a gloomy cloud casts its dark shade over the shine of praise he must otherwise have commanded if young minds which indeed the music helps leave a theater untainted with any prejudicial impression after seeing the beggars opera if no foolish young person of either sex admires macheath as any other than a diverting stagecharacter if his show and false courage do not delude the one sex nor his gallantry attract the other then the piece may stand as inoffensive but we fear it does not often work an effect of such mediocrity therefore are bold to call it a composition made up of ingredients much more noxious than salutary so pleasingly relished so flatteringly gilded that scarce any eye or taste can resist the powerful dangerous temptation it stands like light and heat alluring passions which play like moths around it till they fall a prey to the delusive object of their delight  in respect of characters the men are all arrant scoundrels and the females except polly vicious jades necessarily there can be but a very faint degree of light and shade which undoubtedly constitute not only a great part of dramatic beauty but propriety for all angels or all devils is but a very partial uninstructive picture of human nature but indeed our authors choice of characters would not admit of much variety wherefore we heartily lament his prostituting such exquisite talents to so unedifying or rather immoral a subject  macheath has something specious but not one valuable symptom in his composition his profession is not only to rob men of their property but females of their characters and peace there is an appearance of courage without a spark of reality for at the trying moment we find he applies to the true resource of a coward liquor in short he is a contemptible knave yet an agreeable gallant and therefore as we have already observed the more dangerous and censurable for public exhibition  in the performance of this part spirited boldness of figure flashy gentility of deportment and an expressive not a refined taste of singing are necessary under this idea of requisites we cannot say that any performer within our knowledge has represented him in a capital manner mr beards appearance and manner of singing were all that could be wished but his speaking was intolerable and he appeared too much of the gentleman mr lowes voice was more happy but his expression less characteristic and his speaking if possible worse mr vernons musical knowledge is extensive his merit in acting great but his figure rather inadequate and his voice totally so mr mattocks is far too faint in appearance and every degree of expression  if the managers of drury lane would do themselves and the public justice mr bannister who looks walks and sings the part take all together  better than any who have been mentioned should undoubtedly be put in possession of it and indeed of many others which are miserably mutilated by the present possessors  mr digges whom we mentioned in our remarks upon richard the third was not without great merit in the captain  peachum and lockit are admirably drawn for their stations and with a very natural distinction the former being more in the world has more extended ideas more shrewdness and is a knave of greater latitude mr macklin and mr yates were indisputably superior to any competitors in these parts but for general dryness and a just cynical turn of humor mr macklin stood in our opinion foremost at present it does not deserve notice at either house  lockit is obvious and easy to hit yet all we have seen never exceeded mediocrity some sink him into an absolute blackguard which there is no reason for and others soften the natural gloom of his station too much the late mr berry was we apprehend the most tolerable of any person for several years  filch is well desribed by the author and never was nor never need be better expired than by mr parsons of drury lane who if it would not seem an awkward compliment looks deports and sings the pickpocket to perfection  polly is an agreeable young woman imprudent yet delicate and constant in affection she commits a breach of filial duty it is true in point of her secret marriage but such parents as hers appear to deserve little confidence no character in the drama has furnished so many young adventurers as this several of whom have made ample provision for themselves through her introduction into life and upon the whole there never was a part in which so many unequal performers made a tolerable stand out of a large number in our recollection the following ladies deserved considerable praise miss norris miss falkner and mrs chambers  mrs pinto sung it better and brought more money by far than any person since the first season of exhibition mrs arne also had great musical merit but neither of them possessed a shadow of acting  mrs cibber was to the eye heart and ear worth all we have mentioned and the only sensible speaking female singer that we remember  were the understanding to be pleased with sensibility of countenance emphasis and sound we could wish to see miss macklin do the part at present  lucy is a character who through weakness of vice has forfeited her virtue she is composed of violent passions and as we have shown of a bad heart yet even with moderate merit must please in acting mrs clive though she squalled the songs did the part more justice than any body else we presume mrs mattocks would show more character and spirit in it than any one now on the stage  mrs peachum was extremely well represented by mrs macklin and does not suffer injury from mrs vincent but we apprehend would be much better in possession of mrs green as to mrs dye and the other ladies we shall take no notice of them as we cordially wish they were never to be seen again  from observations already made we have shown that there is scarce any moral deducible from the beggars opera that it is upon the whole a loathsome infectious carcass clothed in an angelic garb that it is sounded upon solid sense and satiric truth yet rises into a superstructure of licentiousness that it is highly entertaining not at all instructive that it is an exquisite burlesque upon italian operas and not a little so upon virtue that it is inflammatory with humor and vulgar with elegance in short it is one of those bewitching evils which offended reason must wish had never been brought to light while delighted taste must lament the very idea of its annihilation  othello written by shakespeare it is very much to be wished that tragic writers would rather bend their thoughts to familiar circumstances in life than those which concern elevated feelings and abstract passions the latter may indeed furnish matter to genius of a dignified nature but the former most effectually appeal to general instruction thus we may safely assert that though our authors julius caesar is equal to any piece ancient or modern for importance of subject greatness of character and liberality of sentiment yet feebler efforts of genius carry in their nature and composition a greater degree of social utility not that we consider the noble spirit of patriotism as too great or copious for any british bosom at least any honest one but it is not so relative to common domestic concerns as many other feelings which work essential advantage or overbearing misery  thus much we premise in favor of this tragedy founded on that fever of the mind jealousy which doctor young most emphatically calls the hydra of calamities a passion often arising in every station of life from sparks of inflammation at first scarce perceptible into a conflagration of the soul  othello commences with a scene between rodorigo and iago designed to let the audience know that the latter is chagrined at his general the moor for not promoting him according to his desire and that the former has a very affectionate tender for the commanders new married lady it appears plain that the amorous simpleton is made an absolute tool to the deep designs of iago who not caring to appear himself as the moors enemy sets on the glibtongued coxcomb to alarm brabantio with the elopement of his daughter this scene is well written but the passages hereafter pointed at are egregiously offensive and if performers will not voluntarily omit them ought to be condemned into obscurity at least from the stage by public repulses  iagos second speech to brabantio under the window beginning sir you are robbed is most grossly conceived and what immediately succeeds these words of the same character if possible worse because we come to do you service you think us ruffians iagos departure and leaving rodorigo to be the old senators guide is very politic  upon appearing with othello we find the doubledealing ancient working into othellos confidence by specious professions of attachment to his inclination and interest which prepares us for his future insidious transactions while the moors contempt of brabantios resentment shows that true dignified security of mind which conscious innocence bestows  the following scenes till the appears before the senate are rather trifling save that a message from the state saves othello the disgrace of going as a prisoner  the senate scene has ever been deemed an important one and indeed with considerable justice the paternal feelings of brabantio and the generous confidence of othello are well supported but the charge of gaining desdemona by spells and medicines however consonant to a venetian law against such practices we could wish had been rejected by our author for the same reason we have urged against witches the great probability of such characters and chimerical notions impressing irrational ideas upon weak minds indeed brabantios reason for supposing that his daughter could not have been won by any fair means to a match so seemingly preposterous is strong but not a sufficient apology for his charge which shows him like some modern senators to be none of the wisest  king james wrote a book of demonology but can any man in his senses call it a rational though a royal production  in his first address to the senate we perceive the moor apologizing with all the smoothness and flow of eloquence for his deficiency in that respect he is nervous concise and figurative therefore his modest opinion of himself seem strong symptoms of affectation we find brabantio in his reply possessed with the true old womanish credulous obstinacy sticking close to conjuration which indeed the duke very properly reproves  othellos narration though literally fine subjects him to an imputation of selfsufficiency that he might relate his story for the entertainment of desdemona and that she might conceive an affection for one concerned in so many great and interesting events is very consistent with him as a polite warrior and with her as an admirer of military achievements rising almost into the strain of romance but for the moor to aim so much at recapitulation of what must be known to most if not all of the statesmen who employed him as a general shows as if shakespeare unbridled fancy and studied more giving the performer a fine speech than preserving delicacy of character yet whatever objection we raise is much if not entirely softened by the great pleasure it always gives in recital  desdemonas appearance and candid declaration in favor of the moor gives a very satisfactory refutation to her fathers mysterious allegations what follows concerning cyprus we can by no means see any necessity for as every part of the plot might have been preserved with equal force by keeping the characters all through at venice we have declared ourselves so unclassical as not to be the friends of strict limitation but cannot countenance the introduction of a seavoyage where there is no occasion for it othello might have appeared as much in his military capacity by receiving orders to make dispositions at home against a turkish invasion as by going abroad  the ensuing scene between iago and rodorigo shows the former in a more extended light of knavery and his manner of working upon the shallow sopling is happily executed however we can by no means approve such a character as rodorigo in tragical composition he is only to be laughed at and that cannot be deemed a proper feeling for serious pieces besides through the whole he is literally a nonessential and as he says himself  that he is not a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry  would he were stationed more suitably not only because he disgraces more important concerns by his levity but also because his conferences with iago are upon an offensive subject and furnish many nauseous ideas set forth in gross expression  iagos soliloquy which concludes the first act is a masterpiece of villainous machination finely written for a judicious actor and very artfully throws out his chief motive of resentment against the general but if his expression of jealousy had been more obliquely worded it would have been more commendable  it is very judicious to retrench considerably those trifling scenes at the beginning of the second act but why the following speeches of montano and a gentleman should be omitted i know not since a storm is mentioned nothing could be put in their mouths as spectators of distracted elements more natural or more consistently poetical than these lines  mon methinks the wind has spoke aloud at land a fuller blast never shook our battlements if it has ruffiand so upon the sea what ribs of oak when mountains melt on them can hold the mortise  what shall we hear of this  genesis a segregation of the turkish fleet for do but stand upon the foaming shore the chiding billows seem to pelt the clouds the windshakd surge with high and monstrous main seems to cast water on the burning bear and quench the guards of the everfixed pole i never did like molestation view on the enchased flood  had the preceding passages belonged to capital characters they would have been carefully retained but in theatrical paring it seems a rule to render the smaller parts as inconsiderable as possible from a paltry selfish notion that thereby they become a better foil to the principal ones this makes prompters books such miserable multilated objects as they are in many places and at the same time wrongs both the author and public taste besides the preceding speeches are absolutely essential to raise a preparative anxiety for the safety of othello  iagos treatment of aemilia and his reflections on wives in general not only before strangers but even before desdemona is brutally unpolite a miserable shift to give time for othellos arrival besides the line after this nay it is true or else i am a turk admits no justification yet is retained in speaking by the same wise authorities which exclude the above quotation so pregnant with beautiful propriety  the last line of a former speech is also fulsome it comes after this saints in your injuries  devils being offended and all the ancients poetical reflections have a most plentiful lack of desirable meaning they do indeed verify his own remark of coming forth brains and all to be plain the whole of this scene till iagos remarks on desdemonas freedom with cassio is either trifling or abominable what depravity of imagination could tempt shakespeare to introduce the words in iagos sidespeech after these your fingers to your lips it is impossible to conceive for they are not only indecent but otherwise improper as they imply an uneasiness at the favor shown cassio which should rather please him as it apparently works for his purpose  othellos entrance relieves and charms attention after so insipid an interval the rapture of meeting safe after mutual danger is expressed equal to every idea arising from affection of heart and fire of imagination and the interview gives more satisfaction to the sensibility by being made judiciously short  licentiousness of sentiment again prevails unpardonably between iago and rodorigo even so much as to shame quotation indeed to do the stage justice this scene is much and commendably curtailed in representation iagos policy and method of working up rodorigo to quarrel with cassio speak an able genius for mischief his subsequent soliloquy offers some palliation of his baseness by harping again upon the string of jealousy and opens his future views more at large upon his going off the author has introduced a herald to proclaim festivity and we presume not improperly however the theaters reject him  bringing othello and desdemona for no other reason than to give cassio charge of the court watch which a general never does in such a manner to his inferior officer is trifling with the moors importance and makes his return during the quarrel too improbably sudden iagos inflammatory speeches to cassio respecting desdemona and the consummation of the moors nuptials are far too luscious for essential public reserve or even delicate privacy  the manner of working up the quarrel the quarrel itself and the drunkenness of cassio are violent intrusions upon the decorum of tragedy  cassio like a tame gudgeon swallows the bait laid for him as easily as any designing knave could wish and makes as foolish a figure as any hotheaded inebriated fool we have met with we dont say that natures bounds are at all violated but we conceive such pictures unworthy the more delicate and masterly beauties of this piece if any thing can palliate critical resentment it must be the respectable figure that othello makes in suppressing the riot iagos able hypocrisy which artfully criminates the friend he seems to excuse and cassios inimitable reflections when he is rather miraculously restored to reason iagos urging him to sue for his place again through desdemonas influence is a deep and sensible train laid full of seeming advantage fraught with perils and death his turning the easy benevolent disposition of desdemona into the materials of ruin for herself and cassio is the very essence of diabolical contrivance  rodorigos entrance seems calculated for no other purpose than to keep him in some degree of remembrance but iagos conclusion of the act shows intricate complication and great depth of design  from several scenes scattered through our authors plays we are apt to imagine he trifled with propriety to relax his genius what else could give birth to what we meet at the beginning of the third act a clown bandying strange quibbles and quaint conceits with some serenading musicians if shakespeares audience absolutely required such pitiful dialogue such puppetshew wit taste must have been in a very gothic state truly and the question naturally follows how the admirers of such peddling dialogue could relish the sublimer flights of his genius we might as well suppose one ear to be equally delighted with a solo by giardini and the braying of an ass the picking of a grindstone or whetting of a saw this act therefore now very judiciously begins in representation with desdemona aemilia and cassio who we find has preferred his petition and is promised countenance  his diffident retreat upon othellos entrance is the natural delicate effect of a sensible ingenious mind conscious of transgression and iagos short remark upon that circumstance is exquisitely imagined desdemonas unlimited generosity of temper beams forth in her warm method of importuning the moor in favor of his lieutenant and while it recommends her to public favor gives iagos sinister designs additional force othellos compliance with her request though cordial and affectionate yet supports by its delay the consequence and resentment of an offended commander an instantaneous pardon would have shown too much pliancy in him and must have debilitated the plot greatly  nothing can exceed othellos beautiful exclamation on his wifes going off it seems the involuntary effusion of abundant affection which his sense and sincerity enough rather to vent its rapures in the beloved objects absence than weakly or flatteringly to her face iagos distant subtle entrance upon the grand part of his design is admirable as is indeed the whole progress of this scene wherein othello shows much openness of temper and warmth of heart both which his insidious ancient works on with great judgment and propriety the doubs he raises with such hypocrital diffidence are judiciously suggested and othellos impatient curiosity extremely natural iagos reflections upon the superior value of a good name to riches are so well known that quoting them would be superfluous  his picture of jealousy also is amazingly striking and othellos generous disdain on being supposed capapable of so illiberal a passion most nobly expressed  how peculiarly pleasing nay instructive is his speech to that purpose we must present it to the candid reader why why is this think thou i would make a life of jealousy to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions no to be once in doubt is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsuffolate and blown surmises matching thy inference it is not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company is free of speech sings plays and dances well where virtue is these are most virtuous nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt for she had eyes and chose me  no iago i will see before i doubt  when i doubt  prove and on the proof there is no more but this away at once with love and jealousy   the enclosed passage is generally omitted on the stage and we apprehend properly  every thing which follows rises by such just degrees and such complete artifices are used to improve upon the moors unsuspecting nature that though we must pity we can hardly blame the agitation he is thrown into  the introduction of desdemona to interrupt the scene already long enough both for the audience and performer is very judicious and the little circumstance of the handkerchief very well conceived iagos making it though aparently insignificant an instrument of importance proves the author well acquainted with the nature of jealousy indeed it is astonishing how any critics could cavil at this incident as some have done after the following unanswerable apology for it  trifles light as air are to the jealous confirmations strong as proofs of holy writ   any person unacquainted with shakespeares astonishing ideas and unlimited expression would suppose othello had reached the top of his bent in his conference with iago already mentioned yet we find him returning filled with sevenfold rage first against the person who has made him acquainted with his misery and next against his unhappy injured wife  there never was amidst many other unparalelled beauties a more luxurious figurative climax of passion than what follows and quite justifiable though poetical for othello being enamoured of fame and the military character which he supposes his present disgrace will render him unfit for it naturally arises that they should occur even in the very whirlwind of rage which on his seeing iago rises still higher and carries the human heart as far as it can go upon such an occasion  i had been happy if the general camp pioneers and all had tasted her sweet body so i had nothing known  oh now for ever farewell the tranquil mind  farewell content farewell the plumed troops and the big war that make ambition virtue  oh farewell  farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump the spiritstirring drum thearpiercing fife the royal banner and all quality pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war and oh ye mortal engines whose rude throats the immortal joves dread clamours counterfeit farewell  othellos occupations gone we could wish the two first lines marked by italics had not conveyed an indelicate idea which if possible is less allowable in tragic than comic compositions though shakespeare has unhappily loaded this excellent play with such  iagos subtle affectation of chagrin at othellos boisterous treatment of him and his blunt method of expression are refined strokes of policy to recall the moors calmer reason and at the same time plant the dagger still deeper in his heart  after this line of iagos but how how satisfied my lord we would advise him to go forward into next speech by which a wretched breach of decency would be avoided his expression we cannot venture to quote and in that speech also his mention of goats and monkeys etc should undoubtedly be retrenched  where he is describing cassios dream the picture is drawn in much too glaring colors the painting need not have been so strong for a man of othellos apparent quick conception and delicate sensibility the handkerchief is extremely well introduced and othellos dreadful resolution what might be reasonably expected from a precipitate vindictive temper perplexed with such violent extremes however we cannot approve the assimilation of his resolution to the pontic sea which never feels an ebb though the thought is beautiful it suits not the circumstance of character  why aemilia in the short scene with desdemona where shakespeare has again produced his facetious word catching clown should throw out a hint of othellos being jealous or why his wife should suggest a thought of jealousy of him merely for losing an handkerchief though a particular one is not easy to account for the reentrance of othello teeming with confirmed rage fills us with anxious expectation and his being confined to the single circumstance of the handkerchief shows that our author knew how to make the smallest matters important yet we know not for what reason magic should be placed in the web of it unless to startle desdemona and to give the author an opportunity of indulging his fancy in some fine lines desdemonas urging cassios suit at such a time is excellently contrived to inflame her husband still more and his pressing the point that he supposes her afraid to hear through guilt shows judgment equal to any other passage in the play  the following speech of aemilia is liable to two objections as the first line seems unnecessary to proclaim a gross breach of time and next as those which come after exhibit a nauseous allusion  it is not a year or two shows us a man they are all but stomach and we are all but food the eat us hungrily  and when they are full they belch us up again as to the inference drawn from the first line by some critics that it places othellos nuptials so far back as one of the periods therein mentioned is we apprehend a strained interpretation for if the lady who plays aemilia lays any emphasis on the two marked words and expresses the last most forceably  it is not a year or two shows us a man  then the sense is obviously this how can you who have been so short a space married think of knowing the turns of a mans temper which requires even years to explain the following scene where iago and cassio are concerned has nothing material in it unless showing more goodness of heart in desdemona and more hypocrisy in iago who artfully seems to wonder at the storm himself has raised  after this scene which properly concludes the third act as it is played shakespeare brings in a mere excrescence of the plot bianca cassios courtezan of whom being totally excluded from the stage we shall say no more than express wonder how the author could incumber his piece with such a despicable nonessential  as if the moor had not been sufficiently wrought up which certainly he has been shakespeare for several pages at the beginning of the fourth act laboriously and from several passages we may add in a beastly manner endeavors to throw fresh fuel on his flames extending the matter to such a length as action could not render sufferable and in many places tending to the ridiculous wherefore we would recommend omission of every line which precedes  get me some poison iago the space of time since we have seen othello before and the temper he last appeared in sufficiently justify his coming on here fixed in the resolution of sacrificing his wife  lodovico appears deputed by the states of venice on a very odd errand no less than displacing othello from the government of cyprus and substituting cassio in his room our author knew little of or would not understand any sort of military regulation when he could raise a simple lieutenant at once to be governr of an island which was thought worthy the care of the general in chief as we have reason for supposing othello to be indeed we can perceive no use for the new character of lodovico however the scene where he first comes on gives great scope of natural and powerful action in othello whose jealousy predominates over every other consideration iagos giving a bad impression of him to lodovico is much in character  othellos sounding of aemilia is very suitable and his following interview with desdemona meltingly pathetic iagos viperous heart is rendered if possible more odious by his pretended concern for desdemonas pitiable situation and the miff between him and aemilia rises well to show her resistive spirit in contrast to the gentleness of her mistress  after desdemona has made an interesting exculpatory appeal to heaven the ladies give place to rodorigo who finding himself dallied with upbraids iago with sinister dealings as we wished from the beginning not to see this disgraceful mushroom of tragedy we shall only say of this scene that it serves the intended purpose well enough  the moor is presented to view at his next entrance in quite a different mode of behavior he is determined on his great revenge the plan is laid and therefore very naturally he wears a partial calm in external appearance which is like that generally proceeding the elementary shock of an earthquake the prologue of more assured and terrible destruction if desdemona was to chaunt the lamentable ditty and speak all that shakespeare has allotted for her in this scene an audience as foigard says would not know whether to laugh or cry and aemilias quibbling dissertation on cuckoldmaking is contemptible to the last degree  the fifth act commences with iago appointing rodorigo to the honorable post of an assassin which we think somewhat like placing a serpents sting in the tail of a butterfly a strange jumble of events ensue amidst which iago plays at bopeep with murder and secures the poor coxcomb he has robbed by privately stabbing him the introduction of othello at a window is quite superfluous and indeed all these transactions might have been referred more properly to narration which would nay does fall very naturally in at the unravelling of the plot we own ourselves desirous of having the fifth act begin with the bed scene and what aemilia leaves untold of the fray would come extremely well from cassio if the whole was done as shakespeare wrote it and bianca produced howling over her gallant the scene would be intolerable even as it is much shortened it rather intrudes upon material feelings  there is somewhat affectingly solemn in desdemonas situation and othellos appearance when she is in bed pity never received a more powerful call than to see sleeping innocence at the brink of destruction nor did her tender ear ever catch sounds more pathetically interesting than othellos reflections previous to her waking every soft sensation is put into a tremulative state and the susceptible spectator must feel an exquisite share of painful pleasure to see a determined murderer who moves us more to compassion than detestation which latter should attend such actions shows that our author had when he pleased an almost magic power over the human heart and could place the passions upon reasons throne  no conversation was ever more in nature than what passes between the moor and his wife every half line for brevity of expression is most judiciously adopted and recommends him to our favor without making her less pitiable  the act of murder is succeeded by a most beautiful wilderness of confusion nothing could be more happily fancied than aemilias approach at such a crisis the scene with her also is carried on with peculiar spirit and propriety  the revival of desdemona from a state of suffocation and her expiring without any fresh violence we apprehend to be rather absurd therefore highly approve othellos stabbing her with a dagger after the words  i that am cruel drawing blood accounts naturally for gaining power of speech and may yet be mortal  speaking of cassios freedom with his wife the moor uses some very gross expressions  all the remainder of this act exhibits an interesting train of explanations which though already known to the audience please as they lead to strict poetical justice however othellos violent exclamation beginning whip me ye devils is rather bombastical and profane  aemilias death is quite unnecessary as it cannot tend to render iago more detestable than he is already nor has she done any thing to merit punishment  wherefore it seems as if shakespeares tragic muse determined like renault in venice preserved to spare neither sex nor age and rejoiced as mr cumberland has it in his inimitable prologue of all prologues to the brothers to appear from shoulder to the flank all drenched in gore  notwithstanding suicide is a real act of cowardice an irrational and an irreligious escape from mental pain yet we can hardly blame othello for applying that desperate remedy to such complicated woes and there is something very noble in reminding the state of venice with almost his last words that he finished his life in the same manner which he had once used to vindicate the public honor of his masters iago is most properly denoted to utter contempt as well as abhorrence and reserving him for legal punishment in its utmost severity is more consonant to poetical justice than adding him to the heap of the slain would have been it was extremely judicious also to wrap up the whole in one speech after othellos death  this tragedy upon the whole contains many passages sublimely beautiful a number very trifling some absurd and too many licentious we mean as written by shakespeare  except transporting the characters from venice to cyprus which might have easily been avoided the plan is sufficiently regular pleasingly progressive and well calculated to touch most sensibly the feelings of horror and pity the personages are well contrasted and cooperate properly to the main action though rodorigo bianca and the clown disgrace their company much the stage however has banished two of them and if the third was consigned to oblivion it would be for the authors credit  indeed it is to be wished that instead of so many syllable hunting editions of shakespeare as have appeared a committee of able critics had united their abilities to strike out the insignificant and offensive passages which so often occur this would bring his merit into a more compact uniform view and considerably lessen the heavy public tax arising from extending his works at least three volumes more than are creditable to himself or useful to his readers such an edition regulated by all those already published without the encumbrance of multiplied conjectural notes unless there are very obscure allusions if prepared by impartial ability would be an acceptable offering to delicate taste and must we apprehend meet what it would certainly deserve general success  such a work we could cordially recommend to mr garrick and such suitable assistants as his extensive connexions in the literary world must easily procure him  we hope what is here offered will be considered as a hint only founded on united regard for the father of the drama the delicate dignity of the stage and the morals of readers as well as auditors  othello though he does not require all the powers of tragical expression certainly calls for several of the greatest  he is open generous free subject to violent feelings not as himself expresses it easily jealous yet rouzed by that pernicious passion above all violent restraint weak in his confidence partial in discernment fatal in resolution  if we may venture to say that any performer ever was born for one part in particular it must have been mr barry for the moor his figure was a good apology for desdemonas attachment even if she had not seen a fair instead of black visage in his mind and the of his voice to tell such a tale as he describes must have raised favorable prejudice in any one who had an ear or heart to feel  there is a length of periods and an extravagance of passion in this part not to be found in any other for so many successive scenes to which which mr barry appeared peculiarly suitable he happily exhibited the hero the lover and the distracted hussband he rose through all the passions to the utmost extent of critical imagination yet still appeared to leave an unexhausted fund of expression behind his rage and tenderness were equally interesting but when he uttered these words rude am i in my speech in tones as soft as feathered snow that melted as they fell we could by no means allow the sound an echo to the sense  though we are not at all fond of this gentlemans action in general yet respecting both it and attitude particularly when called by aemilia after the murder he was in this character extremely agreeable  mr quin  we are sorry to mention him so often disadvantageously  was  though othello is in the vale of years not a very probable external appearance to engage desdemona his declamation was as heavy as his person his tones monotonous his passions bellowing his emphasis affected and his under strokes growling  we remember once to have seen this esteemed performer play the moor in a large powdered major wig which with the black face made such a magpye appearance of his head as tended greatly to laugher one stroke however was not amiss coming on in white gloves by pulling off which the black hands became more realized  mr ross and mr powell were pretty much on a footing in this part the former figured it better and spoke most of the passages as well but the latter appealed more to the heart and wore the passions with natural grace however both were very far short of that capital merit a london audience have a right to expect  if it was possible for spectators to be pleased with meaning alone uttered through very ungracious inadequate organs mr sheridan might stand high in public estimation but execution being as necessary as conception we can only afford him the praise of barren propriety  iago is excellently drawn as a slow subtle irascible villain dead to every good or tender feeling mean hypocritical and vindictive base enough to do any bad action underhand but void of resolution to avow or vindicate his wickedness  to paint this complicate we may add monstrous character happily in representation is by no means easy mr ryan in his plausibility and ease was very commendable but uppeared greatly deficient in design mr sparks was heavy and laborious mr sheridan is excellent in the soliloquies but void of ease and insinuation in the dialogue mr holland hunting after a meaning he never found and mr lee crowds in a multitude of meanings the author never intended thus we introduce mr macklin to an indisputable preeminence for understanding the part as well and expressing it through the whole with more equal and suitable merit than any other performer we have seen and this we do not advance upon private opinion but from comparative views of the effect wrought by him and others upon various audiences to couch our praise in very odd terms he has got the indisputable involuntary applause of as many curses in iago as in shylock  cassio is a very amiable but except his drunken scene which we esteem disgraceful to tragedy a very uninteresting personage the late mr palmer did him great justice and the present mr palmer a rising young actor does not fall much behind in execution to which is added the advantage of a much more soldierlike appearance a person much better framed to make women false  the babbling hound rodorigo receives considerable pleasantry from mr dyer but if it is not prostituting mr kings sterling merit to mention him first in such a part we must give him the lead and say that if the reptile can be made sufferable it is by his performance which equal to some very arduous tasks can nevertheless when occasion calls condescend agreeably and make trifles interesting this is no small point of praise for many capital actors thinking a character beneath their dignity throw contempt on it and the audience but mr kings great good sense and respect for the public prevents him from so ridiculous a start of vanity  i wish every theatrical gentleman would follow the excellent example and comparatively speaking take as much pains with two or three lengths as two or three and twenty  brabantio while concerned is of some importance though his complaint is rather childish yet even the weak tears of a father claim respect and call upon general sympathy as they spring from the fair fountain of paternal affection mr berry though blubbering in grief was his characteristic fault stood well in this part we have had the anxiety to see mr anderson murder and the pain to hear that costive tragedian mr love growl it forth but never wish to feel such intellectual misery again  desdemona is a part of no shining qualifications every point of satisfaction that can arise from her unvarying gentleness and more than criticism could claim may be enjoyed from mrs barry who looks and expresses it much better than mrs yates to whom also we must prefer some years ago mrs bellamy in this character  aemilia has much more life than her mistress and shows a well contrasted spirit mrs hopkins does not fall short of our wishes and we remember to have received some pleasure from that uncultivated genius mrs hamilton in representing her  to offer a general opinion of this tragedy we deem it properly retrenched a most noble entertainment on the stage and a luxurious yet wholesome feast for the closet it rather wants business and therefore in some places lies heavy on action but it keeps an excellent moral in view and forceably inculcates it all along the fatal effects of jealousy by well wrought passions elevated sentiments and a dreadful catastrophe showing the very dangerous consequences of indulging even upon the most probable proofs such pernicious ungovernable prejudices in the human heart  having through unaccountable lapse of memory forgot to mention mr mossop both in this tragedy and macbeth it is hoped the reader will accept our opinion of that gentleman here though not in the regular course of our plan  no performer in our remembrance possesses a voice of more strength and variety than mr mossop and we believe he understands his author as well as any one yet an insuperable aukwardness of action and a most irksome laboriousness of expression render him peculiarly offensive to chaste judgment in macbeth a number of unlucky attempts at attitude ungraceful distortions of feature an overstrained affectation of consequence and many illapplied painful pauses banishing nature loudly proclaim the mere actor  in othello though liable to several of the same objections we deem him much happier the moors wildness of passion he describes extremely well and under all disadvantages most certainly stands second to though far beneath mr barry  love in a village an opera by mr bickerstaff though as advocates for nature we have declared critical war against operatical compositions in general an instance of dangerous resolution at present we only mean to try such pieces as they appear considering the songs as part of the dialogue the piece now before us has met with very uncommon success from what cause it has arisen whether indulgence of the town merits of performance or excellence of the author may probably appear from investigation  this opera has suffered heavy charges of plagiarism many we know to be true but the greater part we hope are false however suppose every imputation just the author might at least make the defense a young clergyman did who being reproached with preaching one of tillotsons sermons replied sir if you know this matter not one in a hundred of my congregation does i am certain it is much better than any thing my own head could produce and i hope you will allow i do my flock more justice by borrowing elsewhere than palming my own stuff upon them far be it from us to suppose this absolutely our authors case we only mention the matter in a friendly way to show that if it really was he has a very modest and good defense to offer  this piece opens with an air between two ladies wherein the pictures of hope are most amazingly diversified  in the first verse she is mentioned as a nurse a fairy a painted vapor a glowworm fire and a temperate sweet  in the second she comes upon us a soft soother a balmy cordial a bright prospect and a sure friend  in the third we find her a kind deceiver a dealer out of pleasure and a proprietress of dreams now admitting every one of these allusions justifiable though i doubt whether a kind or any other deceiver can be the surest friend  yet certainly there never was such a figurative heap crammed into so narrow a compass by any other writer  strong effect of luxuriant fancy  the ensuing dialogue of this scene which is pleasant and natural enough lets us agreeably into some light concerning the ladies themselves the old justice and his maiden sister but i am sorry our bard slipped by decency to make two wellbred young ladies speak in the following words  this libidinous father of yours he follows me about the house like a tame goat to which the magistrates daughter rather knowingly replies  i will assure you he has been a wag in his time rosettas spirit of freedom in love is pretty and the reason she assigns for her occasional elopement very satisfactory lucindas touching upon young meadows passion for her falls well in and extends our view of the plot in a pleasing manner it gives rosetta also some scope of acting in her feigned resentment at the supposition  young meadows in his soliloquy by accounting for his disguise in the same manner rosetta has done rather anticipates suspense by obliquely and too soon showing that they are the persons designed for each other his song expresses affection tolerably in the usual pastoral strain of feeding sheep together what ensues between him and rosetta has a great deal of merit  the would and the would not on both sides being very well expressed  her song in the midst of seeming resistance slips out an acknowledgment of love in this line to my heart its ease restore a most natural lapse and meadows perplexity arising from pride is very well set forth both in his soliloquy and song  hawthorns jovial disengaged song at entrance bespeaks him public favor and his blunt spirited observations upon the salutary effects of exercise to the old gouty justice are very much in character his third song too beginning the honest heart etc has just sentiment agreeably expressed  hodges relation of the difficulties he encountered in accomplishing lucindas message displays welldrawn low rustic humor which is generally remarkable for a roundabout story and making much of a little his freedom too with lucinda arising from the confidence she places in him is very well conceived and the selfsufficiency expressed in his song divertingly suitable lucindas song at the end of this scene we much approve for generosity of principle though there is nothing new in either the thoughts or language  the episode as we may style it of hodge and margery deserves some commendation as it sprinkles the piece with laughable materials but we think it would have been better if their quarrels had arisen from jealousy in the girl merely as a sweetheart rather than have made her intimate the absolute sacrifice of her virtue and the clowns charge against her of a bastard by another person is unnecessarily gross which idea is blameably continued in the last verse of margerys song the country statute though not at all essential to the piece is an agreeable scene and furnishes a spirited conclusion to the first act  lucinda and her lover eustace from whom hodge brought a letter of appointment begin this act when he proposes taking the advantage of every body being from home to elope which the lady with prudent delicacy declines her comparing women in love to weak indians who barter intrinsic value for tinsel toys conveys a sensible instructive idea the conversation between these two true lovers is as water gruel as the intercourse of such characters general proves to be and therefore judiciously made short we cannot agree in point of discretion with that sentiment in eustaces song which says doubting and suspense at best lovers late repentance cost since ten thousand instances prove that repentance oftenest comes from precipitation but the expression certainly stands excusable in eustaces situation we only offer a hope that no young person will receive it as a prudential maxim  the four last lines of the song terminate in a strange awkward jingle  best cost blessed lost  the entrance of justice woodcock is very characteristic affords a good variation of circumstance and throws the lovers into an unexpected dilemma lucindas device to impose upon the old gentleman though not at all new is at least well adapted the selfsufficient magistrates abrupt treatment of eustace before he knows any thing of him is a natural consequence of ignorant pride buoyed up with a commission of the peace and that very pride making him enter into a contradictory altercation with his precise sister produces very humorous effects and indeed useful ones to the young pair who are sheltered by the very pains mrs deborah takes to defeat their happiness this is making a whimsical and very natural use of the justices oddity if any person would wish a more laughable scene than this their risible faculties must be unusually rigid  however we must blame lucinda for mentioning five brats at a birth in her song to the old maid it is not within the pale of delicacy when woodcock gives a specimen of his singing i wish so gross a depredation had not been committed upon damon and phillida besides though sung by a humourist i dont think it very suitable to his daughters presence what follows after the old mans departure between the lovers means very little except to mention that his obstinacy is a circumstance much in their favor  in their reciprocal declaration of unchanging constancy a line which might be censured creeps in and fair creation sink in night when i my dear deceive   the passion could not be very lasting which only continued till night shrouded creation which to our view it does once every four and twenty hours at which time the sun ceases to spread his light and the stars very frequently seen to leave their orbits if this alludes to natures dissolution as we suppose the expression shows too great a stretch of poetic license in short the whole song though imitative of is infinitely beneath that of handels susanna whose tune it has borrowed  rosettas soliloquy examining into the state of her heart is pretty enough the ensuing scene between her and young meadows also has a share of spirited natural pleasantry that reciprocal pride which agitates the lovers and throws them into fretful altercation is justly conceived and by no means illexpressed nor does the spirit evaporate by being drawn out too far the justices appearance falls in well and occasions them to huddle up a kind of reconciliation  justice woodcocks amorous attempt upon rosetta is laughable enough but we wish the young lady had not discovered so strong an idea of his purpose as to let fall these words if ever i was to make a slip it should be with an elderly gentleman  indeed all the remainder of this scene though arch has much too strong a taint of indelicacy hawthorn however changes it for the better with his blunt agreeable raillery  sir william meadowss letter forwards the plot  woodcocks selfsufficiency in supposing himself so wise that none of his children would do an indiscreet thing is whimsical and hawthorns vindication of youth sensible but of all the poetical thefts ever committed of all instances of mending things for the worse as my countryman has it sure nothing is equal to what we shall produce hawthorn sings as follows my dolly was the fairest thing her breath disclosed the sweets of spring and if for summer you would seek twas painted in her eye her cheek her swelling bosom tempting ripe of fruitful autumn was the type but when my tender tale i told i found her heart was winter cold   the word thing at the end of the first line though justified by virgils noted mention of woman is a most strange expression adapted to a favorite mistress and however summer maybe allowed to glow on the cheeks of beauty yet we presume it too glaring a figure for the eye which is not here ornamented with sparkling vivacity but the meridian blaze  mark now what follows  assimilating his mistresss bosom to autumnal ripeness by which we find the fair thing was arrived at or past the full bloom of life sure such a compliment was never paid before but our author having begun with spring was determined to lug in the four seasons successively at any rate  the beautiful song which gave birth to this strange imitation runs thus in the village opera my dolly was the snowdrop fair curling endive was her hair the fragrant jessamine her breath white kidney beans her even teeth two daisies were her lovely eyes her breasts in swelling mushrooms rise her waist the strait and upright fir but all her heart was cucumber   if we consider this as sung by a gardener the allusions appear strikingly characteristic though comparing the eyes to daisies does not convey a very obvious or justifiable idea however it is impossible upon the whole to imagine how any writer could stumble upon so inadequate an imitation without any manner of necessity for so doing unless mere barrenness of invention and a resolution to make hawthorn sing at all events in a plaintive strain too quite different from what he commendably preserves through the rest of the piece  in the scene between hodge and madge we find more brutality breaking out from the clown than humor from either of them however his song is not without merit rosettas intervention creates a kind of bustle tolerably agreeable and throws hodge into a whimsical dilemma the reflections and song of rosetta upon his behavior to margery are extremely pretty exhibiting indisputable truth and some useful hints to the fair sex her compassion for the deluded girl speaks sensibility and goodness of heart  madges sudden design of trying london to repair her misfortunes is not at all unnatural though it seems strangely abrupt  the conversation between lucinda and rosetta furnishes information that a plan is laid for the former to elope with eustace  hawthorn though the occasion of his entrance appears dubitable is judiciously introduced as what he says not only raises an agreeable curiosity in the young ladies but the audience also some sensible remarks upon marriage and the qualifications of a husband ensue which concludes the second act with a very pleasing and spirited trio supported adequately by the several characters  sir william meadows a hearty plain old gentleman begins the third act with hawthorn their scene means nothing more than to throw some glimmering of light on the plot indeed the song with which it concludes has considerable merit perhaps the most for solid sense and natural expression of any in the whole piece rosettas change of dress seems to have no meaning except to please the vanity of external appearance so incident to most ladies on and indeed off the stage her confession of love for young meadows even in his servile capacity is ingenuous and her pride objecting to rank only shows commendable spirit by hodge we find that lucindas scheme of elopement is discovered by her aunt mrs deborah this gives an agreeable turn of sympathetic concern in rosetta who generously feels for a friend though her own concerns are in so prosperous a line of direction  the old maids haughty rigid treatment of her niece is very characteristic and the display of her own housewifely disposition truly humourous her reflections upon the ill effects of reading are the natural produce of a narrow mind uncultivated by education yet vain of its defective powers lucinda at last sets her aunt at defiance but upon what principle or what the thought is she hints at we know not  hodges soliloquy means very little unless to acquaint us with his hopes of rosettas favor which from the great change in her appearance and her behavior to him just before we think he has little right to expect the song is a very strange insignificant jumble of rustic licentiousness containing some truth little sense and less humor  young meadows with as unmeaning a change of dress as rosettas now appears and expresses uneasiness suitable to an anxious lover at his mistresss delay the simile in his song which likens beauty enshrining merit to a curious casket containing gems deserves rather a better epithet than pretty but the versification is not so easy as it might have been the lovers surprise at seeing his father instead of the lady is a well conceived circumstance and what follows does much credit to his honest disinterested feelings sir williams assumed displeasure works up the conversation pleasingly and hawthorn is a good medium to keep up the design of coming at young meadowss real inclinations  rosetta is introduced at a happy point of time and the discovery that the young peoples inclinations and their parents intentions exactly coincide is very well unfolded in the midst of her own happiness remembering lucindas perplexed situation and interesting her friends for that young lady throws fresh light on rosettas character and recommends her to an increase of favor  hawthorns resolution expressed in his song of not giving up his rural enjoyments for the bustle smoke and noise of london is the just effusion of a disengaged mind tolerably expressed  the next scene though short contains considerable humor the oddity of woodcock and his sister is extremely well preserved and well played upon by the lovers the dialogue runs judiciously into a pitpat strain and introduces the catastrophe pleasantly sir williams character of eustace justifies his claim to lucinda and making the justices obstinate contempt of mrs deborahs understanding a motive for agreeing to his daughters marriage closes the piece as an audience would wish without any forced incident  the unities of time and place are well enough observed in this piece the plot is regularly carried on and though it is rather too simple cannot be objected to as uninteresting or tedious the scenes are ranged in an agreeable state of connection without superfluity or scantiness the dialogue has ease and some gleams of spirit but not a spark of wit the songs in general exhibit the most trite hackneyed sentiments in awkward versification with several slips of grammar and not a shadow of genius as to the essence of dramatic merit a moral there is no trace of it to be discovered  the young ones very romantically run away from their parents and for such a notable breach of filial duty they have their wishes fulfilled lucinda does all she can toward an elopement and gets her lover too though there are no very pernicious inferences arising from these incidents yet they recommend indiscretion and are void of any useful tendency and brings them at best under the insipid denomination of merely inoffensive  with respect to characters the justice is a well drawn opinionated ignorant positive old coxcomb mostly in the wrong without any ill meaning and when in the right void of sensible intention sir william meadows a pliant good humoured baronet in whom some peculiarity is attempted without the least degree of success unless a most palling repetition of let me never do an ill turn lays any claim to merit  young meadows is a mere loving milksop with nothing but disinterestedness to mark him and yet eustace is much more a cipher hodge is a clown moderately well depicted rosetta and lucinda two young ladies of independent principles who think they have an exclusive right to please themselves without the least appeal to parental jurisdiction and mrs deborah a formal antiquated virgin vain of judgment which she has not and maliciously fond of preventing that happiness in others she never has enjoyed herself and despairs of ever tasting  the part of woodcock was doubtless designed for mr shuter and i presume it will be admitted that no author ever judged an actors capability better there is a strong peculiarity of humor most happily hit off in performance the character owes its commanding influence much more to features happily laughable and expression truly comic than the writers genius and without exaggeration it may be said that mr shuter in this whimsical justice must have force enough to dilate even the rigid muscles of methodism if it was possible to transplant a groaning congregation from moorfields or tottenhamcourt into covent garden even while their ears tingled with a fire and brimstone harangue they must unbend their gloomy brows and smilingly obey the irresistible force of matchless humor  young meadows has very little acting merit therefore is well adapted to that faintness of expression so discoverable in mr mattocks who nevertheless supports the songs and even speaks better than mr dubellamy a gentleman we never wish to hear speak in public both in justice to himself and to the audience mr dodd of drury lane did this part much better than either of the performers above mentioned  there is an agreeable manner and a sensible vivacity about him that the others are entire strangers to  hawthorn as he lived so we may say he died with that truly great intelligent english singer mr beard who expressed open hearted glee with amazing pleasantness and propriety every person in this light of comparison appears to great disadvantage however mr morris is far from contemptible indeed gives a much better idea of the character than any other person we have seen  that inoffensive personage eustace finds very tolerable accommodation with mr dyer and it is no small degree of merit to preserve such an unseasoned character from the charge of insipidity mr dunstalls hodge deserves a great deal of praise and yet we cannot help thinking if mr king was often seen in the part he would discover considerably more of critical humor sir william meadows may be done by any body without much chance of praise or censure  lucinda has too little acting for mrs mattocks who makes as much of the speaking as it will admit and supports the songs agreeably  mrs pintos rosetta as to the singing unexceptionable but for the rest mercy deliver us the part will not readily appear more delicately pleasing throughout than by mrs baddeleys performance whose figure voice and manner all happily concur to feast both eyes and ears  of the country girl we can only say that mrs baker makes a very pretty madge  the general merit of love in a village we must confine merely to being inoffensive as to its tendency with some spirit an agreeable share of ease and regularity most of the characters speak as they ought and the circumstances are well connected but if we look for sterling sense brilliant wit with keen useful satire which so much abound in the beggars opera we must say that this piece is nothing more than showy base metal favored with a very indulgent stamp of public favor to give it a kind of critical currency to which we apprehend select music adapted with real taste contributed not a little  any person who reads the village opera may soon perceive what use mr bickerstaff has made of it  romeo and juliet altered from shakespeare by garrick as we have already hinted it is a matter of astonishment how shakespeare could be so negligent of uniformity or so servile to depraved taste as to incumber scenes which reach true sublimity with others that may justly be styled poetical babbling and it is equally odd how the audiences which relished one could possibly digest the other however we have selfevident proof of this lamentable inequality in most of his best pieces  romeo and juliet in which our author has taken very unusual and very successful pains with his female character has many weeds in its original state to choke up some beautiful flowers of genius we may venture to say without pruning it would have made but an awkward appearance in representation otway a most excellent painter of the tender passions saw its luxuriance in that point flt and transplanted whole scenes into his plot of caius marius which was an act of gothic depredation producing a most unnatural connection which only served to prove that endeavoring to keep pace with shakespeare he fell far beneath himself  we have seen an alteration of this tragedy by mr theophilus cibber which was not void of merit and we recollect some tolerable endeavors of mr sheridan for that purpose but mr garrick appearing our authors most capable friend we shall stick to what he has enriched the stage and oblige the public with  notwithstanding a quarrel among domestics in consequence of animosities which prevail in the several families they are employed by is highly natural we can by no means countenance even that small part of the ludicrous scene with which the play now begins nothing can be expressed in more characteristic terms but we think it an ungracious commencement nay unnecessary for the enmity of the capulets is sufficiently made known without such mobbish scuffling wherefore we cannot but be of opinion that the necessity of some strolling companies which for want of number obliges them to cry down with the capulets etc behind the scenes forces them to an amendment benvolio and montague should certainly appear first and their short scene which contains many beauties would be a delicate opening indeed what precedes is a farcical prelude to grave events not unlike a merry andrew skipping before a funeral  romeos abstracted disposition of mind is prettily introduced through montagues affectionate concern and benvolios friendly feelings which appear so amply verified in the course of the play not only recommend himself but the persons spoken of to favor capulet and paris are only introduced to show that the latter is encouraged as a suitor to juliet consequently their brief interview offers nothing worth a particular remark  mercutio that peculiar offspring of spirited imagination even at his entrance strikes out the path of whim romeos entrance and the questions occasioned by it show much natural ease the breaks in that speech where he asks about the fray and mentions his love are masterly but we apprehend his coming to the subject thus at once is no way consistent with that impenetrable secrecy charged against him in a former scene indeed concealing it from his father is not surprising but after avoiding benvolio when single to communicate the point immediately before another person and such an humourist too from whom he can expect little but ridicule rather oersteps as we suppose the bounds of natural propriety  a touch of superstitious weakness we find thrown into romeos character in the mention of a dream but as it introduces so beautiful a description of the queen of dreams her equipage and various influence upon various characters we must rather be pleased than offended transcribing mercutios whole speech would infringe too much on our resolution of very limited quotation and yet we scarce know how to decline it  examining the proportions however is not dispensible for though we may admire general beauty it would be wrong to pass unnoticed what appear to us particular lapses  poetry in her descriptions should not only delight the imagination but if requisite should bear optical examination upon canvas now let us view queen mab she is described as being the size of an agatestone which as it is for the fore finger of an alderman cannot be supposed very minute indeed her chariot the shell of a hazlenut confirms this idea yet she her waggoner wagon and chariot by the by are strangely confounded the vehicle and all are drawn by a team of little atomies whose number by the word team is limited to six or eight though five hundred of those same atomies ottomites i have heard them called would not make up her majestys consistence alone  the traces of a small spiders web may do well enough but how it happens that the collars which in harness are the most substantial part should be reduced to watery moonshine beams we cannot say  this may be deemed word catching but if we consider that fancy in her most whimsical flights may without fear of limitation take judgment to her aid it follows that any deviation however slight however surrounded with beauties should be pointed out and for that reason only the above hints have been suggested as to mabs operation upon the parson lovers etc nothing can be more humorous or sensible affording the best original for dreams those thoughts and wishes which most impress our waking imaginations  before i pass from this celebrated speech i cannot avoid mentioning an extraordinary circumstance which plainly tends to show that men of very sound understanding often do very weak things  mr sheridan when he did or attempted to do romeo an undertaking he never should have disgraced himself with some three or four and twenty years since in dublin by an amazing stroke of injudicious monopoly annexed this whimsical picture to his own sighing lovesick part and what carries surprise still higher is that he should do so when it was extremely difficult to say which showed most absurdity his taking the speech or his pedantic manner of speaking it  taking romeo to capulets ball by way of diverting his imagination and that proving the means to inflame his passions are well designed incidents toward opening and carrying on the plot  lady capulet and nurse appear next however great a favorite the loquacious old dame may be with the majority of an audience criticism and taste unite in the wish that no such personage had appeared  indelicacy is very natural to nurses but why the reformer of this play should have retained swearing by her maidenhead we cannot think  juliets introduction has a degree of pleasing simplicity in it and we apprehend a very agreeable useful scene might have been struck out between the mother and daughter on the subject of marriage far preferable to mrs nurses trifling rhapsody of circumstantial nothingness which though extremely natural means nothing but to raise some laughs which we deem highly disgraceful to the nature bent and dignity of tragic compositions besides the old ladys hint of juliets falling backwards is only fit for the ears of a parcel of gossips who have wished decency good night and locked the door upon her  gregorys familiar low comedy message which concludes the scene is totally inconsistent with common english decorum much more the pride and distance of italian quality nurse from her station may claim some liberty but such headlong behavior from other servants is very censurable  capulet in welcoming the guests to his masquerade speaks to the ladies of their corns in a manner which may be jocular yet it is not polite but i suppose having their faces covered is his apology the little dispute about time between the old fellows is well suggested tibalts fiery temper shows itself properly upon distinguishing romeos voice and he is restrained from violence upon very hospitable and just principles by capulet who manifests commendable spirit  romeos address to juliet is modestly affectionate and her replies cordially delicate however with respect to the liking she takes we must suppose love flies with lightnings swiftest wings into her breast it rather indicates feelings of forward susceptibility  it is judicious to separate the lovers after a short interchange of words and juliets method of finding out who was her new favorite very proper  at the beginning of the second act romeo presents himself in a state of amorous pensiveness viewing the mansion of his mistress and upon going off is sought for by his two friends one of whom mercutio in the flow of raillery throws out some expressions highly exceptionable we heartily wish he had conjured no further than the ladys foot and leg and that he had mentioned some other place for raising a spirit than what he points at in the next speech  two passages more unpardonably gross than those hinted are scarce to be met they call loudly for obliteration it is not what such a man as mercutio might probably speak we are to consider but what is fit for readers to peruse or spectators to hear  in the next scene romeo who has romantically leaped the garden wall of a known foe without any leave or assignation from the lady is by the poets unlimited power brought to a sight of juliet who by a happy effort of imagination is made to reveal her love for romeo not suspecting his presence her justification of him from the quarrel of their families is sensible and fanciful nor do we know any thing better conceived than his sudden reply upon mentioning that his name is the only impediment to her wishes and his own  the diffident turn of expression he uses on being charged with an abrupt approach is extremely beautiful and juliets apprehension for his coming into so hazardous a place very natural indeed the whole scene is so interestingly tender  that we think even a despairing old maid could not see it without some sympathy to trace all its beauties would force us into a tedious repetition of multiplied eulogiums and leave us little to say on the following parts of the piece therefore let it suffice to observe that the lovers express mutual affection and exchange their vows in a most becoming manner the interruption by nurse causes a fine agitation of spirits and disjointed eagerness of expression if in such a glare of beauties there be one more striking than another it is that of juliets forgetting or pretending to forget why she called romeo back  friar lawrence is introduced with a just degree of benign moral dignity and his short dissertation on the contraste qualities of particular herbs which he aptly compares to those seeds of virtue and vice which inhabit the human breast is not only beautiful but pregnant with much solid sense and edifying truth in nothing is providence more delightfully manifested than in the vegetable world nor can any subject lead speculation into a more captivating maze the assimilation of grace and rude will to poison and medicine is nervously philosophical luxuriantly instructive having said thus much in favor of the fryars sololoquy we must lament as absolute foes to dramatic rhimes the mode of versification adopted indeed the measure is not so monotonous for a speaker as jingle in general is yet we apprehend blank verse would suit nature the authors sentiments and the performers utterance much better by way of encouraging some abler pen to undertake so desirable an alteration we diffidently submit what follows to candid taste  on frowning night the gray eyed morning smiles checkring with streaks of light the eastern clouds now ere the sun his burning eye advance to drink nights dews and cheer approaching day this osier cage must carefully be filled with baleful weeds and flowers of precious juice how wondrous is the powerful grace reposed within the beauteous vegetable world nor is there ought which springs from earth so vile but by some fair effect its birth repays to parent earth yet surely misapplied becomes pernicious stumbling over abuse virtue herself when tainted with excess may turn to vice and vice her form assume by action dignified within the rind of this fresh blooming flower  deathpregnant poison and salutary medicine reside being smelt it cheers with that sense every part but tasted stops the arrested pulse of life in man as well as herbs we may perceive like contrast foes encamped  grace and rude will and where the latter is predominant that canker death with speed the plant destroys what passes between the friar and romeo is suitable and pleasing we must be of opinion that the change of affection from rosaline to juliet is judiciously omitted as it certainly served no purpose but throwing an imputation upon romeos constancy which tainted must make him less the object of approbation and pity there is a most commendable prudent paternal tenderness in the expressions of lawrence  benvolio and mercutio appear still upon the hunt for romeo when the latter indulges his odd humors in as odd expressions his picture of tibalt who appears a man of mere fire and quarrel seems not to bear a just resemblance bullies are for the most part cowards but very seldom coxcombs comparing romeo to a dried herring wanting its roe is a very low pun and most pitiful quibbling conceit the scene with nurse and her simpleton attendant is an extraordinary jumble of matter contemptibly ludicrous her message concerning juliet has relation to the plot but we wish it had been delivered in a more suitable manner than by this comic ambassadress  as if what we complain of was not more than sufficiently farcical stage policy to please the upper regions generally presents peter as bearing an enormous fan before his mistress skipping also and grinning like a baboon the beating which he gets for not resenting mercutios raillery is a very mean pantomimical yet sure motive of laughter  the impatience expressed by juliet to hear the consequence of her message is expressed in lines charmingly poetical without any violence to nature or strain of imagination and the nurses behavior in what follows natural but we wish she had not mentioned romeos climbing a birds nest soon nor that juliet must bear the burden soon at night  in the next scene where juliet should have been allowed more time to appear we find friar lawrence has agreed to marry the young couple and seems tenderly interested but drops a very ungenerous insinuation when he concludes the act thus  by your leaves you shall not stay alone till holy church incorporates two in one   which conveys an idea of suspicion without any cause for the lovers dont hint at retirement but seem impatient for his benediction  at the beginning of the third act we meet mercutio again fraught with quaintness and quibble his quarrel with tibalt is such as might be expected from such blades and taking romeos quarrel upon himself shows something of generosity after receiving his death wound he utters a strange incoherent rhapsody and so much preserves uniformity that his death commonly proves a very laughable incident it is reported as an expression of shakespeares that he was obliged to kill mercutio in the third act to save himself whatever he may have thought of the character or whatever has been thought since if he never had been brought to light in this play though a fine effort of genius would have been waved propriety must have been much better preserved it may be said less spirit would have been the consequence we cannot grant this but shakespeares muse on such a subject could never have wanted more interesting matter  romeos engagement with tibalt shows great sensibility of friendship we have heard him bear reflections and of a severe nature vented against himself with philosophic resolution but roused by mercutios death he takes revenge which occasions consequences of a very serious nature whence the plot takes an important turn  i remember to have heard an anecdote relative to the part of tibalt which though trifling i cannot omit an itinerant barnspouting hero who had shipped too much beer aboard performing it forgot that he was to be killed and thereupon fought romeo furiously for near ten minutes nor would give up the contest till his lady cried out with tremendous voice from behind  dennis dennis  curse the fellow why dont you die  her tongue to him the emblem of thunder laid him flat immediately on coming off he was saluted with many reproaches for having forgot himself forgot myself no says he i knew what i was about and considered that tibalt was a stout young fellow who would take a great deal of killing to say truth the remark was not amiss for we may suppose as he is drawn tibalt himself seems to think so  after a series of scuffling the prince presents himself  indeed such a prince was never seen a justice of peace or a high constable to interfere where riots happen in the street is well enough but for a sovreign however petty to appear so often upon such occasions is a strange prostitution of dignity  besides in the first scene where no mischief is done he threatens their lives upon any future breach of the peace yet in this where two have lost their lives one of them his own kinsman he good naturedly talks of fines for punishment  we apprehend so much tilting and the purport of this scene would have been much better in relation than action benvolios account though fine at present would have had more merit if otherwise introduced  and the play would have been freed from a monstrous encumbrance of multiplied battles  juliets soliloquy beginning gallop apace is a little in the extravagant style but her situation and violent affection somewhat apologize for her flights nurses entrance gives an alarming turn of passion and pity puts on her plaintive countenance for the young ladys painful situation this scene is wrought up with most masterly judgment  juliets supposition that romeos dead is fine then hearing that a kinsman is killed by her husband and that in consequence he is banished  her charging romeo with a savage spirit and curbing nurse for casting reproach on him though she herself has done it are circumstances happily imagined and nothing can exceed the climax of impassioned expression in which juliet descants upon her misfortune the gleam of comfort given in expectation of seeing her husband concludes the scene well and unbends the sympathetic feelings good acting most unavoidably raise in an audience  romeos scene with his ghostly father is an effort of genius equal to any degree of praise and affords powerful expression a very copious opportunity of displaying itself so as to work irresistably on the human heart the fryars prudent advice is well contrasted to the distressed lovers frantic ravings and his whole behavior shows active cordial goodness of heart  the garden scene for that between capulet and paris contains nothing but appointment of juliets marriageday with the latter is poetical and pretty but as we apprehend cut rather too short in representation on account perhaps of relieving the performers which is a point should always be consulted yet not so far as to omit any beauties that may please and ornament the alternate desires and fears of romeos staying are natural effects of wishing and intimidated affection  the following interview between juliet and her parents places her in a very compassionable situation while capulet exerts a degree of parental authority too common we fear which reflects no great credit upon his head or heart  juliets appeal to nurse as her sole remaining friend is pathetically pretty but the unfeeling wretchs reply detestable  what passes between juliet and the friar at the beginning of the fourth act is expressive of affecting solemnity a crisis of the utmost importance is arrived grief assails her on one side and apprehension on the other while weeping love casts tearfilled eyes alternately on both in this perplexity her application to the friar is very natural nor can we blame in her circumstances those expressions of despair she lets fall however we think some arguments against the very idea of suicide would have fallen suitably and with force from her holy tender hearted confessor what he proposes of having her buried alive to escape paris is as wild and romantic a device as ever entered into any drama it might do in a novel but in a representation of nature is no way justifiable however we are apt to forgive even absurdity when it contributes to such an affecting catastrophe  we cannot help thinking that all through this act juliets entrances and exits are crowded upon one another too much there are but three lines spoken between her leaving the fryars cell and appearing in her fathers house the soliloquy she speaks previous to drinking the contents of her phial is beautiful beyond description terror and pity are alternately called upon in a most forceable manner  in the next scene capulet not only appears a mere old wife but also blunders strangely the curfewbell is an english institution by william the conqueror therefore improper for an italian to mention besides that bell rings at eight in the evening yet he speaks of three oclock in the morning and the second cock this might be easily rectified by saying the matin bell nurses remarks before she attempts to wake juliet are contemptible at such a crisis and commonly make an audience laugh when they should cry  what the parents and the friar say after the supposed death is discovered may pass without the censure of flatness but merits no degree of praise it deserves note that from what capulet here says great preparations have been made for the wedding though in the third act he declared it should be private on account of his kinsman tibalts recent death  though not absolutely essential nothing could be better devised than a funeral procession to render this play thoroughly popular as it is certain that threefourths of every audience are more capable of enjoying sound and show than solid sense and poetical imagination stagepageantry cannot be very pleasing at any time to judicious taste but if at all commendable it is upon this occasion  the dirge as it stands at present we diffidently conceive liable to some objections  in the first chorus dismal moan favors much of the ballad style in the succeeding air comparing juliets eyes to breaking day is but paying an awkward compliment of brightness and makes her like the morn greyeyed in the third air look down below is a tautologous mode of expression though somewhat countenanced by custom for it is impossible to look down without looking below or to look up without looking above  romeo pleasing himself with satisfactory dreams is very natural and a good preparation for that material change of feeling which balthazars heartrending intelligence occasions  the transition to astonishment of grief is amazingly fine and his dismission of the melancholy messenger by broken sentences very natural  nothing was ever depicted better in the whole scope of poetical painting than the apothecary and his shop yet we must think romeos recollection too coolly minute for a person in his distressed state of mind what passes between him and the apothecary contains some useful pathetic reflections  what occurs between the friars john and lawrence is merely to acquaint the audience that a letter to romeo of juliets situation has miscarried  we do not perceive any particular material use in bringing paris to the monument unless to sacrifice him in view of the audience without having committed any crime to merit death considered as a rival he is so unknown to himself and seems to have been sincere in his regard by visiting the grave of his intended bride  romeos speech upon approaching the monument has much tenderness assumed policy and real fire the brief yet cordial farewell he takes of a faithful domestic we have always considered as truly affecting  though pariss appearance gives room for some good acting we apprehend the scene would have been more uniformly solemn without him discovering juliet in her inanimate state by breaking open the tomb catches the eyes and romeos reflections previous to drinking the poison arrests the hearts of spectators nature is brought to her most critical feelings at the moment juliet awakes and her husbands affectionate transports forgetting what he has done fills the audience with a most cordial sympathy of satisfaction which is soon dashed in both by the poisons operating  romeos distraction and her tenderness are so excellently wrought up that we cannot suppose any heart so obdurate as not to be penetrated  her behavior after his death catching as it were his frenzy and passing from grief to distraction is a masterly variation in juliet what follows her paying the debt of nature is judiciously contracted into a narrow compass indeed we will venture to affirm that no play ever received greater advantage from alteration than this tragedy especially in the last act bringing juliet to life before romeo dies is undoubtedly a change of infinite merit  the whole dying scene does mr garrick great credit as being worthy the matchless author he has furnished it to and we must venture to affirm that his prejudice in favor even of shakespeares faults was the only reason why he did not retrench and add more which in particular places he ought certainly to have done  the plot of romeo and juliet is romantic and irregular the characters oddly conceived and strangely jumbled the scenes very unequal in matter  some extremely insignificant others enchantingly beautiful the unities are violently yet not offensively broken and the catastrophe which hangs in the balance of suspense as long as it should remain doubtful is equal if not superior to any in the english drama as it now stands in respect of moral some very instructive lessons may be drawn from this piece first from the lovers that disobedience in children or doing what they know is totally against parental inclinations brings a train of perplexities and produces the most fatal consequences  parents may learn that family quarrels are not only unsocially absurd but pregnant with misery to them and their offspring they may also perceive that compelling youth in the article of marriage is an unnatural dangerous exertion of authority and duellists may infer from tibalts fall that the sword of fate hangs suspended by a cobwebthread over a turbulent disposition  the hero of this piece is vested with very warm passions with much love and what in that case may well be expected little prudence he fixes his affections upon a particular object and determines to have her at any rate the two valuable qualifications of courage and friendship he seems happily possessed of but upon the whole shows rather an amiable than a great mind ardent in affection vehement in rage poignant in grief thus equipped and so circumstanced as he is no wonder he affords capital talents a fine opportunity of displaying themselves and a character upon the stage was never supported with more luxuriant merit than this by mess garrick and barry or barry and garrick for when those inimitable performers contested it sixteen or seventeen years since it was extremely difficult to say who should stand first we shall offer a comparison upon strict impartiality and leave decision to the unprejudiced reader  as to figure though there is no necessity for a lover being tall yet we apprehend mr barry had a peculiar advantage in this point his amorous harmony of features melting eyes and unequalled plaintiveness of voice seemed to promise every thing we could wish and yet the superior grace of mr garricks attitudes the vivacity of his countenance and the fire of his expression showed there were many essential beauties in which his great competitor might be excelled those scenes in which they most evidently rose above each other are as follow  mr barry the garden scene of the second act  mr garrick the friar scene in the third  mr barry the garden scene in the fourth  mr garrick in the first scene description of the apothecary etc fifth act  mr barry first part of the tomb scene and mr garrick from where the poison operates to the end  having seen this play three times at each house during the contention and having held the critical scale in as just an equilibrium as possible by not only my own feelings but those of the audience in general i perceived that mr garrick commanded most applause  mr barry most tears desirous of tracing this difference to its source i found that as dry sorrow drinks our blood so astonishment checks our tears that by a kind of electrical merit mr garrick struck all hearts with a degree of inexpressible feeling and bore conception so far beyond her usual sphere that softer sensations lay hid in wonder  after two such truly capital performers we can scarce mention any other adventurer with patience however to spectators who never had seen them messrs powell and ross might have given considerable satisfacttion their figures and voices suited well but powers countenances and judgment to execute the most interesting scenes were greatly wanting mr smith at present bustles through the part with most inexpressive monotony at covent garden and mr cautherly without one requisite whatever of a principal performer hobbles through it at drury lane such an attempt is hardly to be conceived under the disadvantage of awkward deportment limbs void of symmetry action without meaning voice without power and features of most defective expression  mercutio never was nor never will be in better hands than mr woodwards grimace and attitude which so often diminish that gentlemans merit in other characters are here of singular advantage and the peculiarity of style is admirably set forth by his peculiarity of expression especially in the capital speech relative to queen mab  notwithstanding mr macklin was extremely well received yet we cannot apprehend him in any shape qualified for the part a saturnine cast of countenance sententious utterance hollow toned voice and heaviness of deportment ill suited the whimsical mercutio they might have done for what otway has strangely metamorphosed him to a mere cynic but tended to mar shakespeares intention however the authors sense was critically preserved in this as well as all other characters by the theatrical nestor mr obrien undoubtedly stood second and the late mr palmer was not without considerable merit as to mr dodd we conceive him totally inadequate  mr havard rendered the friar extremely respectable nor was mr ridout far behind the former had more of characteristic placidity the latter showed more necessary weight of expression mr hull whose propriety of speaking is at all times unquestionable wants something of solemnity not through defect of judgment or knowledge of nature but a limitation of powers which often check in that gentleman very eminent degrees of capital merit  mr love  why have i occasion to mention such a murderer of blank verse such a cossac of tragedy  who bolts from a sonorous rumbling untuneable throat the smooth philosophic generous sentiments of the friar in a mode exactly resembling the harmonious notes of a newgate turnkey browbeating unhappy prisoners we must however allow him the merit of a figure and countenance very well adapted  mr bannister would do the play credit in this part indeed too much as it is now patched together  capulet had great justice done him by messrs sparks and berry but is at present wretchedly off whether we view him in that most tragical of all tragedians mr gibson or the less offensive though water gruel mr burton  benvolio suffered no damage from mr mozeen though a very poor creature but makes a better figure represented by mr packer as to that smirking selfimportant figure of an actor mr davis who speaks as he walks by a kind of instinct and whom to mention is a waste of words we wonder how even consummate ignorance with its constant companion could make him think of the stage or how any manager could ever use him in any other light than as a dumb eunuch in some of the turkish plays  the other male characters in this piece we presume not worthy remark  juliet bating too quick a susceptibility of love is a most amiable lady she is tender affectionate and constant possessed of liberal sentiments and delicate feelings rather romantic in some notions but justifiably so from age and situation of mind sensible of filial duty yet not firm enough in opposing it to passion her circumstances are deeply affecting and her catastrophe spiritedly affectionate though as an act of suicide not very moral  the competition between mrs cibber and mrs bellamy who had both great merit in this character seemed nearly to admit the same state of comparison as we have adopted for the contending heroes one excelled in amorous rapture the other called every power of distress and despair to her aid mrs bellamy was an object of love mrs cibber of admiration mrs bellamys execution was more natural mrs cibbers more forceable in the former there were traces of nonage in the latter too much of the woman  lady capulet is no body yet we once saw mrs pritchard make her respectable mistress nurse to whom we have objected as a character inconsistent with tragedy though highly finished from nature was most admirably represented by mrs macklin and we think her petulant impertinence is very well supported by mrs pit upon the whole this play is in a truly deplorable state of action at present in both houses and as sixteen years ago it was hard to say which company excelled most the contention now seems to be who are most contemptible  romeo and juliet though it exhibits none of the towering flights of genius yet has many poetical beauties expressed in smooth nervous agreeable versification and takes in several places tender possession of the passions it conveys very instructive admonitions rises by just degrees to a striking conclusion and must be allowed the candid praise of great merit whether seen in public or perused in private  the provoked husband a comedy altered from vanburgh by cibber the laureat in his preface to this play has taken considerable pains to do sir john justice by attributing the plan and most of the characters originally to him however a comparison between the provoked husband and vanburghs journey to london will prove that cibber showed great judgment and taste in the use of those materials which fortunately fell into his hands  though soliloquy is perhaps not the most commendable opening of a play yet what lord townley offers at the beginning of this comedy lets an audience well into the grounds of that uneasiness which sits heavy on his mind the alarm he expresses at the danger his wifes reputation is in from her course of life conveys a very instructive intimation to ladies in the gay world and his choosing calm measures first to effect a reformation shows a generous prudent tender cast of mind  the scene with lady townly exhibits much spirited gentility the debate is carried on with great good manners on both sides and a happy preservation of temper is maintained for though his lordship warms a little yet it is like a man of sense and rank his mode of presenting the bill is delicate and her manner of receiving it pleasantly whimsical as is indeed all she says through the remainder of the scene  the short conversation between lord townly and lady grace is well conducted and mention of manly falls in aptly of whom both give a good preparative character i cannot however help being of opinion that this gentleman rather seems too forward in advising rigid treatment when lord townly asks his advice nevertheless it occasions a sensible and instructive altercation between him and lady grace who argues against her own opinion that she may come more effectually at his  this scene takes a very agreeable turn where sir francis wronghead and his family are mentioned of whom manly gives a satirical and laughable account showing that he has a generous concern for their welfare though he cannot avoid despising their folly  if introducing such a person as john moody into the presence of a nobleman and his sister can be justified it may be truly said that he gives great life to the scene both from peculiarity of dialect and sentiment as to the propriety of his appearance we cannot think there is any breach of decorum lord townly being possessed of a sensible affability and having his curiosity raised by manlys picture of the wronghead family might very well wave general distinctions in favor of honest john who seems one of those unpolished natural productions well worth investigation if quality which is too often the case never stoops to a view of the lower ranks of life but like a lion with supercilious abstraction stalks only in its own circle it must be very deficient in a most essential branch of knowledge  human nature is a volume of great variety and he who studies it most is most likely to be practically wise wherefore we heartily join with lady grace in loving nature let her dress be never so homely  moodys familiar salutation of manly his intimation that his lady is in great good humor from a free circulation of cash his account of the equipage the disposition of the younger children at joan growses the misfortune of the coach its contents of live lumber within and nonessential lumber without the cargo of provisions the succession of cross events and the superstitious stress he lays on childermasday are ludicrous to the highest degree and as highly a finished piece of dramatic painting as we have ever met with nor can any thing be more in character than where john gives himself such superiority over his master as a shrewd and resolute husband indeed every line of this scene shows a rich vein of uniform humor  after johns departure the other characters are called off in an easy commendable manner by lady graces proposition of cards which occurs from the discourse without any appearance of design  manlys short soliloquy contains some delicate remarks and any where but concluding an act of a comedy we should say the following lines had merit but rhyme on the stage is certainly abominable except in prologues and epilogues  would women regulate like her their lives what halcyon days were in the gift of wives vain rovers then would envy what they hate and only fools would mock the married life one of those worthy gentlemen whose occasional chariots according to the counts own phrase roll upon the four aces is presented to us at the beginning of the second act with an old lady who lets lodgings the sharper like all of his kind from a duke to a linkboy seems bent upon his own emolument at any rate from his recommending sir franciss family to lodgings calculated for that purpose and his conversation with mrs motherly a very instructive lesson may be drawn of the caution which should be observed with respect to placing confidence of a serious nature in persons who are only externally known to us the counts intrigue with myrtilla is mentioned with a proper degree of impatience by her aunt but if she had left out or softened the following remark it would have been better when the count says he will marry her neice the reply runs thus  very likely  if you would not do it when she was a maid your stomach is not so sharp set now i presume the scheme struck out between these worthy personages is infamously politic and i believe entirely consistent with a depravation of nature too frequent in life  bassets short scene with myrtilla only confirms her imprudent conduct and conveys rather gross ideas  her soliloquy contains truth but not very proper to be told upon a stage  lady wrongheads ignorant affectation of politeness is extremely well described in her first appearance and sir franciss rusticated observations upon introducing his son and daughter are an excellent preparation for a more intimate acqaintance with his character nor are the young squire and his sister less successfully delineated in what they say  the unpolished roughness of the boy countenanced through sympathy by his father and the pert pettled forwardness of the girl equally supported by the mother exhibit a most diverting picture of parents foolishly indulgent and children consequently absurd  manlys scene with sir francis is pregnant with genuine humor and shows the baronet in a very entertaining view of stupid selfsufficiency his scheme of repairing his fortune by parliamentary connections both justifies his title to the name of wronghead and gives a very keen stroke of oblique satire to that abominable practice of prostituting the legislative capacity to mercenary private views it is impossible for any thing to be better applied or if rightly taken more useful than the ridicule here thrown in a masterly manner upon both the knaves and fools of policy manlys observations are all poignant without the least degree of superfluity and lead sir francis into a whimsical involuntary explanation of his designs his treatment of basset shows the gentleman and man of penetration while the gamblers unmeaning familiarity exhibits contrasted an empty impertinent coxcomb  agreeable however to those superficial notions of gentility formed by her shallow ladyship  his conscious feeling of manlys suspicion is very natural to an unprincipled rascal and his retreat welltimed  those remarks made upon manly by miss and her mama are extremely suitable to weak females who too often mistake plaindealing for rudeness and ill humor her ladyships contempt of pecuniary expectations is also very consistent with a vain heart elevated by visionary greatness and her intention of throwing a rub in the way of manlys marriage with lady grace manifests a mischievous bent which littleness of mind is ever prone to dicks impatient call of appetite the introduction of a full tankard the consequent remarks and john moodys account of the misfortune their coach has met with all happily concur to give this scene peculiar spirit  but we wish john had not retained the carters expression of kissing etc  the young squires advice of bringing him before the parliament is an admirable sting to the perversion of privilege  lord townly and lady grace begin the third act with some just remarks on fashionable excesses from which their conversation by an easy transition turns upon manly when we meet with the effect of lady wrongheads policy in a letter concerning that gentleman lady graces communication of it to her brother is commendable and his slowness to entertain a bad opinion without better grounds added to his remark that unknown friends for the most part prove secret enemies shows not only goodness of heart but a knowledge of life also the sequent interview between lady grace and manly is a piece of colloquial delicacy much to be admired the explanation which the lady is in want of rises upon her by very just degrees the gallant justifies himself upon the principles of conscious innocence which occasions an eclaircissement that agreeably embarrasses his mistress  her soliloquy after he goes off contains sentiments worthy of virtuous sensibility  lord and lady townly are well introduced by trustys account of them they are both warmed by difference of opinion and support their several arguments with characteristic spirit she takes the lead in justifying her own dissipated life and he very pathetically refutes her flimsy assertions which gives rise to a serious turn of repartee it appears greatly to his lordships credit that neither the prejudice of his own circumstances nor the solitary life he leads weighs so much with him as a jealous apprehension of his ladys reputation feeling strongly as we may suppose caesars excellent maxim that a wife should not even be suspected that critical point of resentment to which the altercation rises parting from her carries him off the stage with respect and leaves her in a kind of maze but insensibility coming to her assistance soon banishes useful reflection  lady graces appearance gives the fine lady a fresh opportunity of indulging her flow of spirits which she does in a vein of great pleasantry by describing what she ironically calls the comforts of matrimony her pictures of life and raillery of lady graces grave turn are as entertaining effusions of a volatile imagination as any our english drama affords and instruction is very well mingled with mirth in the prudent remarks delivered by the single lady to the married one  lord townly calmed from the occasional impetuosity we saw him touched with lately appears in conference with his friend after a full and satisfactory explanation of lady wrongheads mean device to prejudice manlys character his lordship assures that gentleman of his sisters affectionate esteem and ratifies manlys wishes with his own warm approbation  there is something very generous after such designed injury upon so tender a point in manlys resolution of saving the wronghead family from ruin even against their own inclinations  there is also a turn of considerable natural beauty at the conclusion of this scene where lord townly adverts to his own situation and mentions manlys prospect of superior happiness we think the act would have ended better without the couplet which is tagged to it though pretty enough  for the subject and sentiment are completed with these words  how much the choice of temper is preferable to beauty  mrs motherly and her niece informs us at the beginning of the fourth act that worthy count basset has palmed a forged note of five hundred pounds upon them the detection of which has occasioned the latter to let manly into the plan that is laid against sir francis what follows between mirtilla and the young squire is commonly omitted in representation not we apprehend through a deficiency of merit but to curtail the piece which certainly exceeds usual and desirable bounds  sir francis filled with fresh importance from having been at st stephens chapel displays his consequence perseverance and patriotism in very diverting colors to mrs motherly who in the true style of such obliging ladies echoes every thing the baronet advances with most courtly admiration manlys entrance gives rise to a scene of infinite merit  a scene we could wish read every morning after prayers in the house of commons though if it had as slight an effect as the devotion has it may as well be let alone it is impossible to describe a picture more strongly satirical than sir franciss interview with the ministers chimerical hopes of preferment from a squeeze by the hand and to a member of such importance who scarce knew like many others what side he voted on are subject both for laughter and pity  a man wading beyond his depth not able to swim and catching at twigs for support is highly emblematic of sir francis whose ignorance lays a snare to entrap himself  the ladies and their gallant attendant count basset change the conversation to more detached matters his intruding himself a second time upon manly who in a former scene treated him with contempt shows palpably the servile coxcomb sir franciss blundering misconception especially respecting the sharpers courage is admirably rallied by manly miss breaks out with an excellent specimen of her city improvement in the rhapsodical journal of proceedings which she repeats sir franciss remark on jennys snappish behavior to her mama  there is your fine growing spirit for you now take it down an you can is a very just reproof to the ridiculous indulgence which has encouraged it the jealousy conceived against the daughter shows her ladyship to be vicious as well as vain and silly  her laying hold of the promise sir francis fancies he has got of a thousand a year is very natural and produces a whimsical altercation concerning the expenses she has already run to squire richards constant attention to eating is characteristic and seems an inheritance from his wise father we apprehend the following speech of the baronets upon his ladys proposing to buy some lace as fine as a cobweb is an excellent stroke of political satire and forced feeling very fine here i mun fast till i am almost famished for the good of my country while madam is laying me out one hundred pounds a day in lace as fine as a cobweb for the honor of my family ods flesh things had need go well at this rate  the conclusive scene of this act relates to bassets plot of securing miss jenny to which the young lady herself seems most forwardly consenting  mirtilla who has hitherto appeared in a light of pity stands here an object of censure but we must consider what she says as calculated to draw her deceiver more deeply into the snare laid for him what he says of wanting to be busy with her again and her reply that he will soon have one to find him sufficient employment are sentiments not strictly delicate  the counts dissertation in soliloquy upon assumed rank and sharping principles is admirable we heartily wish what follows was conspicuously hung up in every capital gaming house throughout the kingdom  since our modern men of quality are grown wise enough to be sharpers i think sharpers are fools that dont take up the airs of men of quality  the conversation which passes between manly and lady grace at the beginning of the fifth act gives us a good and necessary idea of the interesting crisis his ladys conduct has brought things to in lord townlys family and their mutual desire of mitigating matters furnishes a favorable picture of their friendly feelings  sir franciss scene very judiciously shows a sense of error urging its way upon his dull comprehension and manlys laying hold of the opportunity to point out his frightful situation in its real colors shows good sense and a generous mind  the poor wellmeaning baronet is involved in such a heap of dilemmas that even the laughter which his ignorant confusion raises must be mingled with some touches of concern the means of his extrication are very artfully left in suspense at the end of the scene  what passes between lady townly and trusty at the toilet manifests the very essence of fashionable insensibility a vacant head and a callous heart  the description of what passed the night before is inimitable  taking the money from poundage shows a dishonest meanness which an infatuation to gaming and a want of money will subject the highest as well as lowest classes of life to it points out too most satirically the light in which tradesmen and their circumstances are held in by many of the gay world who being unprincipled themselves think none of inferior rank in life have any right to or occasion for punctual integrity  the squabble between poundage and the mercer is most happily imagined for bringing lord townly on with the true dignity of an honorable nobleman which is far above a right honorable knave and an injured husband one provocation is excellently grafted upon another to justify the violent agitation he appears in and his first reproach to the lady strikes home at one mainpoint of disgrace her dissipated folly brings on him his arguments are keen yet consistent with decorum and spirited without being outrageous while her replies consisting of faint sallies of false wit evidently show the badness of her cause and give his lordship such openings for conviction as afford reason triumphant admission to bear down all her principles but some embers of pride which light into a short flame  the crisis to which matters are brought when manly and lady grace appear alarms attention and even throws some gleams of pity on the character of her infatuated ladyship here the pathetic truly rises upon us and while we tremble for the unhappy wife we must applaud and sympathize with the determined husband who paints the guilt and pronounces sentence with all the tender firmness of a just and humane judge  lady townlys feelings of remorse advance upon us in a pleasing because an unexpected manner and so much as we have blamed her errors we are also prepared to receive her sensible recantation which works that happy agreeable effect upon his lordship it must do upon every generous mind as indiscretion is the highest crime chargeable against her the arguments of exculpation she offers are very admissible and the effect of reconciliation is i presume to the wish of every auditor in short this turn of affairs so gradually and with such probability brought about is far superior to sir john vanburghs original suggestion of turning the lady out of doors  the husbands authority is well maintained as the piece now stands without any exertion of hardening severity which may startle but generally renders vice more obstinate  though the first part of the masquerade scene is for sake of reducing the play to more bearable compass usually omitted yet it contains many excellent strokes of satire what follows deserves particular attention and praise in respect of those most irrational and prodigal assemblies lady grace sensibly observes  of all public diversions i am amazed that this which is so very expensive and has so little so show for it can draw so much company together to which lord townly replies  oh if it was not expensive the better would not come into it and because money can purchase a ticket the common people scorn to be left out of it  bassets choice of the masquerade for perpetrating his base designs is not only natural to such a character but also points out the danger of such a rendezvous where vice or villainy may play their game under cover manlys scheme of friendly detection is judiciously laid the wronghead family are well rescued and strict poetical justice is done by obliging the sharper to marry one he has debauched and would have imposed on an unsuspecting country lad  the last scene which is indeed but merely a conclusion contains nothing more than a more formal exchange of matrimonial engagements between lady grace and manly as it was necessary to introduce the serious characters once more we apprehend those lines which lady townly speaks at the end of their reconciliation scene would have been much better reserved to the last indeed those rhimes which at present conclude the piece are only an enlargement of the same thought  this comedy though not strictly conformable to the nicest rules of time and place is nevertheless sufficiently regular the scenes are well arranged the serious and ludicrous happily mingled the plot well digested and the catastrophe much to be admired the language of the polite characters is easy and nervous of the lower ones humorous and spirited the sentiments are adequate and instructive seldom trespassing upon delicacy and the moral is a most excellent one showing how follies of a different nature involve domestic concerns in different perplexities  lord townly is a character of very amiable qualifications sensible polite generous tender and resolute preferring indulgence till he finds pernicious effects arising from it his provocations are interesting and often repeated yet all borne with patience till the honor and dignity of a husband seem too much endangered and every trace of discretion on the female side vanishes  from this view it is easy to perceive that his lordship cannot be well represented by the requisites of mediocrity from a great variety of performers we have seen mr ross must be selected as manifesting much superiority in this character his figure deportment and expression are happily suited in the scences of least importance he shows polished ease in those of consequence pathetic feeling and spirited resentment he remonstrates reproves chastises and forgives with dignity  mr barry is not without considerable merit but as freedom either in action or expression never appeared about this gentleman in comedy he cannot safely become a competitor with one possessed of both where tears are mingled with embraces he must be allowed to stand foremost  mr ryan received and deserved much praise but he made lamentable use of the singsong manner and tragedized a great part of it abominably mr sheridan was as sententiously pedantic as any supercilious fellow of a college in christendom unvarying and insipid through the whole mr mossop haughty as a bashaw vulgar as a stagecoachman boisterous as a tavernkeeper and awkward as a country dancing master pumping up every sentence from the bottom of the stomach stalking backward and forward like a jacktar on the quarter deck and clenching his fists as if lady townly was every moment to feel the effects of them  mr powell had sensibility and was not void of ease but he wanted much of the nobleman and fell very short of the character except in the last scene mr holland was a perfect type of prim stiff the mercer from ludgate hill both in utterance and appearance we never wish to see such a pasteboard peer again mr smith has freedom and elegance but a most lamentable sameness of expression hangs intolerably heavy on the ears of an audience in his performance of this part in the essential of dignity he labors under a similar defect with mr powell  manly appears possessed of a sound understanding is friendly constant and discerning sarcastical and rather rigid in his opinions careful of his own principles and cautious of other peoples mr sparks whose figure and voice were both unfavourable to him for such a part had nevertheless a manner so significant that we have been at a loss ever to find his equal in those scenes where sir francis is made his butt he threw out his insinuations with such forceable meaning that while spectators laughed at one they could not avoid smiling with the other in the third act scene where lady grace shows the letter she has received to his disadvantage he supported a degree of genteel delicacy very little to be expected from his general mode of performance and indeed superior to any other person we have seen  mess clarke and packer wanting essential characteristic shrewdness and cynical pleasantry only reach that insipid medium which just avoids censure yet never can reach praise mr reddish would certainly do either this part or lord townly much better than they stand at present in either house  sir francis wronghead is an admirable portrait of false consequence ignorant selfsufficiency and undiscerning goodnature a tame husband a foolish parent and a credulous friend possessed of a genteel independency yet vainly grasping at imaginary promotion to the great prejudice of his real circumstances  mr macklin beyond all doubt filled the authors ideas of this part and conveyed them to the audience admirably consequential stupidity sat well painted in his countenance and wrought laughable effects without the paltry resource of grimace where he affected to be very wise a laborious emphatic slyness marked the endeavor humorously while the puzzles between political and domestic concerns occasioned much food for merriment  mr yates pursued the same track but with much fainter execution in him there was a kind of unaffecting petitness which much reduced the sterling value of propriety  mr arthur moved in a similar line of direction but still further on the decline  mr shuter forgetting every trace of character burlesques it with ten thousand unmeaning transitions of countenance and as many illapplied breaks of voice mr love is as insipid as the last mentioned gentleman is wanton the former shows an uncultivated luxuriance of humor the latter an abominable narrowness of conception united to a matchless dryness of utterance  one general deficiency which all the performers we have mentioned labor under in this part is making very imperfect attempts at the yorkshire dialect from which for the most part they are as different as if they were speaking the irish brogue  count basset a superficial forward gambling fashionable rascal possessed of cunning enough to form the knave but void of judgment to hide it gaping like a hungry pike for prey and snapping at every thing till at length he hooks himself pert without wit and shewy without elegance mr woodward used to do him strict justice nay indeed make more of him than could be expected mr dyer and mr dodd represent him without leaving any material wish of criticism unsatisfied  squire richard is an illeducated headstrong brainless boy taking advantage of the indulgence which has spoiled him and following his own wild inclinations without asking why or wherefore he cannot complain of his intimacy with mr hamilton at covent garden  but is much better in possession of mr william palmer at drury lane who possesses considerably more of the natural vis comica in such a cast than any other performer on either stage  john moody a very natural well drawn rustic not without sense yet possessing less than he imagines a kind of humourist fond of his own jokes which he passes without reserve from a freedom allowed him by his master his bluntness is pleasing and his caricature painting shows masterly though unpolished satire mr dunstall hits off the manner and appearance of this character extremely well but dialect is wanting in all the john moodys as well as sir franciss we have seen mr sparks makes an hibernian and mr burton nothing at all of him  lady townly is drawn a female of peculiar spirit possessing good qualities which however are all swallowed up in a vortex of fashionable follies yet not absolutely vicious though verging close upon vice a laughable yet melancholy an entertaining though a pitiable object mistaking elegance and vivacity for more valuable qualifications despising any concession to the authority of a husband yet a perfect slave to her own capricious inclinations  mrs woffington had a most suitable appearance and mode of expression but rather indulged too much coquettish pertness in the latter and somewhat of affectation in the former for which reason we must prefer mrs pritchard as preserving the true woman of fashion much better both of these ladies however were remarkably deficient in the tender part of the reconciliation scene mrs cibber and mrs bellamy each made romantic attempts upon her ladyship being most insipidly unvariable till the fifth act where indeed they had both merit  mrs clive gave criticism an idea that lord townly had married his cookmaid vulgar in the polite scenes and dissonant in the pathetic one mrs yates is a mere fifth act lady mrs abington all but the fifth and mrs barry more consistent through the whole than any one we have mentioned  lady grace appears a most amiable and pleasing contrast to her volatile sister possessed of reserve without prudery and solid sense without formality willing to partake reasonable pleasures despising extravagant pernicious and irrational ones the delicate ease and modest sensibility of this character were never better represented than by mrs elmy whose merit seemed almost totally confined to her and selima in tamerlane mrs bulkleys very amiable appearance easy deportment and unaffected delivery of her ladyships instructive sentiments have given us and we doubt not the public very singular satisfaction as to all others within our knowledge silence is the greatest favor we can show  lady wronghead is a bounceabout clumsey imitator of polite life without a single requisite for that sphere ignorant to a degree yet assuming knowledge superior to her important lord and master vain positive and not of very rigid virtue an impertinent wife a gossiping companion and a foolish mother  this odd compound never appeared more diverting than in the person and manner of mrs macklin who exhibited petulant bustling affectation with infinite humor  mrs clive looked and spoke many of the passages particularly those where contempt is thrown upon sir francis with a very eminent degree of merit in which she is closely traced by mrs green nor does mrs pit fall far behind as to mrs hopkins she wants both spirit and humor  miss jenny is a very natural sprout from the old stock already described talkative pert silly fond of herself and credulous to flattery a most excellent object for any smoothtongued coxcomical fortunehunting blade to make a prey of with just wit enough to play unbecomingly on the sufferance of her father and folly enough to ruin herself this vacant hoyden who certainly should have spoke yorkshire as well as her brother sits with a very pleasant portion of easy humor upon miss pope miss minors since mrs walker was happy in this as well as the whole girlish cast but for miss ward  we heartily wish she was well provided for off the stage why such languid dawnings of merit especially in the female sex should be plunged into so precarious and difficult a state of life is not easy to be accounted for especially where there is a parent who knowing the advantages sees also perhaps feels the reverse  to mrs pritchards great praise be it spoken she never gave her children encouragement to a theatrical station though she had reached eminence so conspicuously herself and supported it so well to the last that like an evening sun her setting though not so resplendent was full as agreeable as her meridian rays of excellence mrs palmers own strong inclination for the drama overcame not at all unhappily her mothers prudent prejudice  this comedy if not absolutely first yields precedence to very few on the english stage whether we consider its language characters humor spirit or moral and however mr pope who never could write a play himself and therefore envied cibber might anatomize that gentleman we very much doubt whether any play he ever wrote deplumed of fancy and harmonious numbers contains more useful instruction than this play which the laureat with so much taste and judgment fitted for the theater upon the whole we are bold to recommend the provoked husband as a very entertaining valuable composition both in representation and perusal  cyrus a tragedy by mr hoole this piece is the offspring of a virgin modern muse the word modern is introduced to apologize previously for any deficiency in the nobler flights of genius which may appear public taste has been impregnated with such gallic frigidity for twenty years past that the glow of a warm imagination would be rejected as too powerful wherefore most if not all the tragedies within the date mentioned have been as aaron hill emphatically observes elaborate escapes from genius cold creeping tales dragging a plot unaffectingly along through five tedious sleepinspiring acts mere correctness is the poor equivalent for that noble enthusiasm which shakespeare in particular and some other dramatic authors treated their sympathizing audiences with and at present offer to those who are not embarrassed with the enervating false delicacy of criticism  yet hold let us not even seem to hint that the play now under notice comes under such a charge but heartily examine and impartially decide  mr hoole does not wish to deny some obligations to that great italian dramatist metastasio how he has availed himself of such an original is not within our plan since we only profess examining and illustrating pieces as they appear unless where one is professedly called an alteration of another  our criticisms are meant to be as plain and useful as possible our desire being much more bent upon showing a knowledge of nature and an intention of promoting social welfare than pedantically to display learning in multiplied conjectures upon immaterial passages which from being temporary become obscure  cyrus opens with mandane daughter of astyages and aspasia daughter of harpagus the former who lost a son and thought him murdered twenty years ago mentions that she expects within the day to see her child her impatience at his deliberate approach is well expressed and paints a mothers feelings so situated in just colors  from what passes we find that astyages his grandfather who had devoted this cyrus to death while an infant now seems to countenance his public appearance the old monarchs determining to sacrifice the young prince even before his birth because of a dream which portended his usurpation of the kingdom shows him ridiculously superstitious and unpardonably cruel  in the first scene we also learn that cambyses was banished to prevent mandanes having any more children however we think aspasias mentioning what the princess had known so very long and ruminated on so much is merely making her a tool for opening the plot we are told too that mandane though her son counts twenty is herself but thirtytwo this may please a capital actress as few ladies like to acknowledge even that age till a dozen or fourteen years older but is at any rate a very trifling circumstance to mention aspasia also tells mandane another circumstance already well known to her and much better mentioned afterward indeed it is some introduction to harpagus but we wish the plot did not open so mechanically  by harpagus it appears that cyrus is arrived upon the borders of the kingdom but must not pass them till astyagess permission is signified this very justly stimulates maternal impatience and occasions mandane as it is improper for her to appear in person to send aspasia for intelligence of who the prince resembles if however she had only mentioned a likeness of his father without remembering herself the stroke would have been more delicately natural  besides the choice of her messenger is not we apprehend quite justifiable as things are circumstanced harpagus would certainly have been much fitter than his daughter however he stays to give the princess some gleams of double joy the return of her husband as well as son which he only hints and for what reason such obscurity is assumed we cannot perceive unless the statesman supposes mandane incapable of keeping a secret however important to herself or thinks happiness better administered by halves the lady nevertheless is satisfied with the bare suggestion nor asks once after probability though harpagus assigns no reason for his mysterious reserve  the statesman in his soliloquy intimates that revenge for a murdered son enflames his breast and that he wears an outside show of loyalty to make vengeance more secure we could have wished that the unessential obsolete scotticism ken though admitted by some leading authors had not been used in the last line to imitate the beauties of capital writers is very commendable but peculiarities are much better left to themselves  we find from what cyrus mentions at his entrance that mithranes his supposed father has made him acquainted with his real origin here a question obviously arises why the old man should so soon diclose this secret which it seems so necessary to keep since we cannot perceive that communicating it tends at all to forward the princes happiness nay rather unnecessarily changes his tranquil state to agitated perplexity a piece of useful information however accrues which is that an impostor has usurped his name and is ready to impose upon astyages the dream of that old monarch is told by cyrus to mithranes who knew it and the consequences before his birth this again seems strange fishing for revelation of a plot but what follows from where mithranes takes up the story is most agreeably imagined and suitably expressed the reception of cyrus in his infant state doomed to death by a savage parent is pathetic with beautiful simplicity and the princes desire of paying some tributary drops to the memory of her who adopted and took care of him as a son speaks tender laudable gratitude the following part of this scene apologizes for a cautious underhand method of working by representing the affected contrition of astyages suspicious as a proof of which his sacrificing harpaguss son upon supposition that the father had saved cyrus is very judiciously offered that speech wherein cyrus seems eager to assert his right shows a pleasing glow of spirited imagination and the two last lines of it contain a sentiment of intrinsic merit  that king will never guard his peoples rights who wants the courage to assert his own this is a truth no man can deny but least resolution should become rashness and firmness obstinacy a monarch ought without the aid of fallacious courtiers to know the exact barrier of separation between his own royal prerogative and just popular privileges filial duty seems to make a strong impression upon the young prince an impatient natural desire of seeing his unknown parents animates but the cool advice of mithranes checks him into a prudent and solemn promise to keep himself concealed under the name of alcaeus and his son till fit occasion serves  where the old man touches upon reproof and retracts as being no longer in the character of a parent with cyruss grateful tender reply are beautiful passages as is also what follows  i will seek yon hallowed roof to raise devotions voice and supplicate the gods to breathe a heros spirit in this breast that when the ripening hours shall bring to light the wished events of this auspicious day my soul enlarged to thoughts of conscious greatness may hail with virtuous pride its birth to glory   there is nothing more becoming of human nature than a just reverential reliance on providence to begin every deed with heaven is worthy a sound understanding a great mind and a pious heart therefore the author who inculcates such a principle without the least taint of enthusiasm who expresses it with such a noble engaging simplicity as mr hoole has here done commands the approbation of religion morality and taste  in the first speech of harpagus which acquaints us that astyages has sent him to enquire whether his grandson is arrived we find an unpardonable grammatical slip  to learn if cyrus yet approach the borders approach plural for approaches singular we would gladly have presumed this an error of the press but that the measure says otherwise wherefore we would recommend a change suppose thus to learn if cyrus touches yet the borders  by this transposition and change of a word concord is preserved without rendering the sense weaker or the versification less harmonious  from the conversation of mithranes and harpagus it appears that astyages bears his grandson no great good will wherefore they determine that an impostor who has usurped his name shall fall in the way of those perils aimed at the real cyrus the remark which harpagus makes that medias heir has been trained up to virtue in her safest school an humble station is pretty but not defensible because the virtues to adorn and support a throne require practical knowledge of life he who knows not vice nor has any opportunity of running into it can possess but negative virtue at best to be surrounded with temptation yet still to soar above it is the true purity of mind a man who cannot get strong liquors claims no merit from sobriety nor a female locked in a cloister from chastity positive virtue is the child of free election and we apprehend whatever pleasing pictures may be drawn from education totally abstracted not one in a hundred of such characters would make a tolerable king or even a useful member of society speculation presents us with many ideas very pleasing which practice immediately proves chimerical  the approach of cambyses is again intimated and they separate least from the kings jealous temper of mind some dangerous consequences might arise  at the beginning of the second act mithranes expresses apprehensions for the absence of cyrus but is interrupted by the appearance of cambyses whom he knows though in disguise yet does not seem to know the stranger solicits guidance to astartes altar where a grand annual sacrifice is that day to be held which the old man promises and mentions the expected appearance of cyrus some explanation seems approaching when the sudden appearance of astyages makes it necessary for cambyses to retire  the gloomy monarch sounds mithraness attachment on the principle of gratitude which is acknowledged  on mention of cyruss being preserved mithranes takes an extraordinary alarm we say extraordinary because there is no reason to imagine from his cordial beginning that astyages means any other than the fictitious character of cyrus indeed he explains it immediately after the listening of cambyses is a most pitiful condescension in any person of his rank though misapprehension of mithraness accepting the murtherous charge gives rise to somewhat interesting afterward the old mans mentioning cyrus under the name of alcaeus to perpetrate the monarchs command is natural and politic  the paternal impatience of cambyses which hurries him into the path of destruction on his sons account is affectionate and noble his appearance and the danger consequent thereto must agitate feeling spectators considerably the circumstance of being taken prisoner affords him a good opportunity of showing an invincible spirit which causes a discovery of his real character and furnishes him with reproaches of a very stinging nature against his cruel fatherinlaw  as tyrannic guilt is ever trembling for its own safety his threats of fatal nature might reasonably be expected as also cambysess contempt of them  the charge of assassinating cyrus is well levelled and strikes home also the hint he throws out of vengeance hanging over the royal persecutor is well imagined in short both characters are excellently contrasted through the whole scene confident innocence buoys up one cumbrous guilt staggers the other  cambyses departs with becoming spirit and moral dignity leaving astyages pregnant with apprehension of lurking dangers  in about fifteen lines after her husbands being carried off a prisoner mandane appears possessed of his disagreeable situation which seems a violent breach of probability being absent twenty years she but thirteen when he was banished how does the princess so suddenly amidst such bustling circumstances know him or if he was pointed out to her as the person is it possible to imagine but after so long an absence she would have forced an interview with him for an exchange of mutual tenderness as it is we must suppose she has flown by him without taking the least notice a passage in the third act intimates she has not seen him if not who has told her so suddenly of his situation the application to her father is of a very tender persuasive nature much in favor of capital performance and conducted without running into bombastic extravagance like that of almeria in the mourning bride when she pleads for osmyn in the fourth act of that play  astyages endeavors to alarm her feelings as a daughter by acquainting her of the danger he apprehends surrounding him yet grants security of life to the prisoner in compliance with her tears but expresses a firm resolution of renewing his banishment  the king no sooner departs than cyrus appears whom mandane charges with breaking importunely on her grief  the word importunely we can by no means approve  cyruss apology for so unceremonious an approach is danger which courses him at the heels dangers which arises according to his own account from selfdefence the sympathy of blood is hinted at in mandanes first speech to the startled prince who tells the circumstance of having rescued aspasia from threatened violation in terms becomingly modest his narration is interrupted by the appearance of that lady who urges information how he escaped with life from the danger her safety had involved him in  cyrus continues his tale with unadorned truth and signifies by a pleasing degree of natural painting his antagonists fall the name of mandane being mentioned her son as we might expect is struck with amaze at this very critical period an officer and guards are introduced who give the scene quite another turn by arresting the real cyrus for having killed the usurper of his name those beams of pity which so lately lightened over mandanes breast now turn to the clouds of rage against him who appears the murderer of her son cyruss solemn oath to mithranes prevents his revealing himself strong grief sways the mother anxiety for her perturbation agitates the son while aspasia feels commendable grateful concern for the unhappy situation of her deliverer  mandane unable to express or bear her complicated miseries hurries off with a speech expressing some touches of frenzy aspasias open unreserved declaration of apprehension for cyruss safety shows much generosity of temper even admitting what she herself after he is gone hints at love for his person this ladys soliloquy concludes the second act with tolerable spirit but we must be of opinion that the scene throughout is much more interesting from its circumstances than expression the former have too great a similitude to merope and the latter falls far beneath the impassioned ideas of that tragedy though mr hoole has happily avoided the strained metaphorical versification which incumbers aaron hills brilliancy of imagination  at the beginning of the third act mithranes dreading mandanes resentment against cyrus as alcaeus informs her of the secret so long kept from her but at the same time warns against an indulgence of those transports which might discocover it to her father maternal joy for having found a son so long lost and so lately to all appearrance killed is considerably damped by the situation of cambyses from some breaks it appears that mithraness prudent restriction is necessary to restrain mandane the heart violently agitated is ever prone inadvertently to disclose what undisturbed caution would teach it to conceal wherefore in such cases a friends assistance becomes essential  astyages true to his villainous principles seems much pleased at and grateful for the death of him he supposes his grandson this affords mithranes a good opportunity to consult the safety of cyrus as alcaeus which the king promises  tyrantlike in his soliloquy he determines to sacrifice those who have contributed to his murderous purposes hence arise fresh fears for the prince on whom death seems to have conceived innumerable and almost unavoidable attacks  harpagus comes in seasonably to avert some impending ills from our hero by showing himself warm in his attachment to astyages aspasias supplication in favor of alcaeus works an alarm in her fathers breast introducing cyrus to astyages as a prisoner serves no purpose that we can perceive except giving rise to a speech beautifully sensible when astyages makes a favorable remark on the princes personal appearance the statesman thus emphatically replies appearance often deceives not always does the polished court display the fairest forms and in the simple rustics homely cell nature sometimes assumes a nameless grace which greatness cannot reach   harpaguss ungracious address to cyrus when he approaches the king is also politically calculated to turn aside any suspicion of a disguised character but why astyages should call the son of mithranes a person of lowly birth or why aspasia in her soliloquy at the end of the second act should hint prides placing her above the offspring of a man who it appears had formerly been in favor at court and obtained the rural retirement he wished from royal patronage is hard to say mithranes though a voluntary exile from grandeur and bustling life by no circumstance appears a mean character therefore rusticity of birth should not be charged against alcaeus  harpaguss disguise of his real sentiments after astyages goes off even to aspasia shows cautious integrity he hints prudently also his suspicion of love in the warmth of his daughters solicitation and warns her of a passion attended by unseen danger  upon her departure we find the loyal statesman paying cordial homage to his prince quere whether freeing cyrus from his chains does not break in upon the cautious plan he has before pursued for suppose the king was to see or hear of such an indulgence shown to a prisoner even by the person who a few minutes before has rather behaved harshly to him must it not wake slumbering suspicion to a state of dangerous activity  paying some tributary tears to the memory of his own son and cyruss generous sympathy are pleasing transitions when harpagus represents private griefs as below the notice of royalty he draws as fine a declaration of noble humanity from the prince as ever fell from any pen   does royalty exempt the breast from every social tie which links mankind shall kings my harpagus forget that one inspiring breath to life awaked the prince and peasant and shall he the public voice proclaims his peoples father not feel those sorrows which his children feel the princes concern for his fathers imprisonment and his mothers grief is well adverted to and occasions harpagus to renew the charge of secrecy first given by mithranes this creates a perplexity in the following scene with mandane where she owns him as her son and he shuns her tender approaches which terminates the act in a critical and interesting manmer however we cannot help thinking cyruss behavior to a tender mother when it appears she has been informed of his identity a punctuality too rigid for nature and probability his mysterous reserve naturally throws her into a state of dubitation bordering on amazement  act the fourth begins with mandane alone  we have a strong objection to that passage in her soliloquy which styles suspense lifes deadliest calm in the first place we know not any calm that can be deadly unless the sleep of death be styled one and what relation suspense has either to deadly or calm is not easy to perceive suspense we apprehend to be an agitated state of thought possessing the mind where reflection hangs in a medium between hope and fear if the former is confirmed joy takes place of suspense  if the latter despair may come and that indeed deserves the epithet deadly but in each instance every idea of a calm vanishes for pleasure is as tumultuous as grief  that affectionate transport which a faithful couple so long parted as cambyses and mandane might be supposed to feel is interrupted by the formers supposing his son newly slain however he is informed otherwise and mutual satisfaction again displays pleasing beams the following description of cyrus by his father is as poetically expressed as it is fancifully conceived as i crossed the wood where you tall poplars shade the dimpled pool i late beheld a youth whose noble mien attracted my regard i turned to gaze while with light steps he bounded over the turff his auburn locks flowed graceful down his back quick was his piercing eye his manly shoulders a spotted tygers dreadful spoils adorned some gallant trophy of his sylvan wars   the turn which ensues from cambysess hearing that mithranes has informed mandane of her sons existence is truly fine as thereby the plot gains an alarming intricacy having heard mithranes promise the assassination of cyrus to astyages he very naturally supposes that the old man through ambitious views wants to palm his own son upon a wishing and therefore a credulous mother of this mandane is the more readily convinced by reflecting upon the unintelligible behavior of the young man in his late interview with her  the resolution of cambyses to take revenge on his own son in the character of alcaeus sets every tender fear of nature at work when cyrus approaches  by the bye  he appears too quickly  his mothers change of looks very justly alarms him and in his turn he solicits for an exchange of maternal and filial tenderness which occasions a powerful conflict of passion in her breast but viewing him both in the light of an impostor and her sons murderer she uses a kind of deceit and for sake of a more secret conference the prince appoints her at that very part of the wood where cambyses has fixed on to make him a sacrifice  mandanes soliloquy is in a disjointed style well suited to her situation but how she should hint the grief of alcaeuss mother on seeing him bathed in blood we cannot reconcile as the death of barce mithranes wife he himself being well known at court could scarce escape her knowledge  aspasias mention of alcaeus like water upon flames makes mandanes fury blaze the higher and carries her off teeming with the bitterness of revenge  what passes between aspasia and harpagus appears only calculated to give strong feeling a necessary pause however it is not without several pleasing sentiments agreeably expressed the ladys dutiful condescension to her kind fathers cordial advice even though that advice counteracts impassioned inclination furnishes the idea of a most amiable mind  mandane it appears has sought out mithranes and for some time dissembles her rage to make it burst forth with trebled fury which naturally throws the guiltless old man into astonishment nothing can be more strikingly imagined than the princesss mistaken triumph in supposing she shall have son for son mithraness distracted confusion to think the prince should be in such danger and by a fathers hand fills the humane breast with terror this whole scene is wrought up in a most masterly manner and every speech pathetic supplicative remonstrances on one side with furious unbelieving obstinacy on the other speaks most forceably to the heart which must throb with terror and anxiety  when mithranes goes off mandanes mind is thrown into a very different state of convulsion we have lately seen her filled with rage almost savage but behold her now on harpaguss assurance that alcaeus is really cyrus plunged into the utmost poignancy nay distraction of grief which barely leaves her power to speak the place and impending mischief this sends off harpagus on the wings of loyalty for prevention her soliloquy is beautifully wild and we may venture to say that no fourth act ever hung an audience more in suspense at its conclusion than this does which we deem a point of infinite merit if there is any fault it must be that there is no increase of feeling left for the scenes which are to come  the fifth act presents us at its commencement with mandane wandering she knows not whither under the impulse of distracted agitation to her mithranes enters after a fruitless search for cyrus the mention of whose name occasions an increase of his unhappy mothers frenzy on the return of reason she knows mithranes and sends him to astartes fountain cambysess appearance with his sword bloody strikes every tender idea with apprehension that he has effected the destruction of his son and totally overbears afflicted mandane cyruss entrance however gives a fresh turn though nature still trembles for his danger from a mistaken fathers rage the ladys situation should certainly have claimed some assistance from her husband previous to every other consideration when unassisted revival enables her to speak an ecclaircissement ensues of a very tender and pleasing nature yet in expression we rather deem it faint the play should undoubtedly have been so planned as to have concluded here yet we find a great deal of business to ensue astyages comes unawares upon cambyses and his daughter the former of whom is again made prisoner on being informed of a rebellious tumult by harpagus the kings rage threatens the late happy couple with death but they are preserved by a lucky thought of the statesman  cyrus next appears meditating prettily on his change of fortune and reveals himself to aspasia this whole scene must be deemed nonessential and very flat after what has preceded the princes determination of assisting his endangered grandfather shows dutiful tenderness and a very generous mind harpagus after long smothering revenge for a murdered son now openly attacks astyages and as the event shows they are reciprocally wounded the royal monster dies with some gleams of repentance yet strangely languid when compared to his enormous guilt harpagus expires recommending his daughter to cyrus cambyses and mandane now appear it is to be lamented that after all her sufferings a fathers death should render her happiness imperfect  aspasias being totally unprovided for is a great imperfection cyrus only recommends her coldly to his mother for comfort though in the preceding scene when she mentions his exaltation he replies rise fair aspasia and know the daughter of my harpagus in her defense may justly claim that life her fathers truth preserved   upon a general survey of this tragedy we find the plot pleasingly intricate agreeably regular and pregnant with many affecting circumstances to the conclusion of the first scene of the fifth act what follows is a mere sacrifice to partial justice which we apprehend might have been effected with more brevity and merit by some very practicable transpositions of incidents  the characters of this piece are in no respect striking astyages is a most unnatural tyrant more known by what is spoken of him than by any thing he says himself he is hateful to the audience without any acting merit to assist the performer he is most insipidly vile timorous cruel and credulous  mr clarke is much to be pitied when burdened with such an ungracious load what can be done for the despicable monarch in action he does and certainly deserves the authors thanks  cambyses is a very odd mixture of somebody and nobody  here  there  and no where brought from his exile to do nothing  taken prisoner  set at liberty in a most unaccountable manner taken prisoner again enlarged again merely for a happy catastrophe he seems to have some traces of a good husband and a good father but no other marking qualification whatever nor has he above half a dozen speeches which deserve notice  mr smiths performance gave him tolerable spirit and struggled successfully with an inconvenient situation  cyrus is amiable and utters many sentiments worthy a virtuous wellcultivated mind yet upon the whole we must deem him as unseasoned a hero as ever gave name to a dramatic piece some interviews with his mother are in respect of the unessential secrecy preserved ridiculous and throughout the piece he seems too much an engine of the plot  mr powells pleasing appearance and suitable powers raised the prince far above that degree of mediocrity in which the author has placed him had there been more favorable opportunities for execution we are persuaded it would not have been wanting but reaching even the languid term of praise agreeable was as much as any performer could hope to arrive at  mr wroughton has of late been most cruelly obtruded on the public in this part cruelly for himself and the audience since even those who force him to the undertaking must admit that his abilities are as much beneath even the languid cyrus as mr powells were beyond him but it seems to be a received managerical maxim at present to give the public neckbeef where they have a right to expect venison no very grateful return for that amazing encouragement which is afforded  harpagus appears to be a statesman of commendable principles he feels just resentment for the murder of a son yet suppresses his revenge till a regular train of events comes to place cyrus on his grandfathers throne his dissimulation with astyages is very defensible and his character equal throughout his death is not quite consistent with poetical justice but necessary mr hull though better calculated for exhibiting amiable and tender feelings than any which border upon gloomy and sanguinary designs represents harpagus with merit at least equal to any other male character in the piece  mithraness loyal and parental attachment to cyrus his anxious concern for the princes safety and the evident pains he has taken to instill principles worthy that elevated station his royal pupil seems designed for render him highly estimable he is thrown into very interesting situations and has a manifest advantage over every other character except mandane it would be injustice not to allow mr bensley considerable praise in the performance of this part yet we apprehend the play would have been much better cast at first if mr powell had done mithranes mr smith cyrus and mr bensley cambyses it should at present undoubtedly stand thus mr smith cyrus mr bensley cambyses and mr hull mithranes  though by the bye so rich is covent garden in merit we know not an apology for harpagus to supply such a change except mr gibson who might much more reasonably be trusted with the murder of such a part than siffredi and many others he stands in possession of besides getting rid of mr wroughton at any rate is much to be wished  conscious of mrs yatess very forceable expression the author has endeavored and not unhappily to furnish her several opportunities of displaying capital talents through every change of tenderness rage fear affection and distraction she shows powers which must work strong and natural feelings upon the audience tears apprehensions and even a degree of astonishment wait on her mandane judicious transitions of voice happy variations of countenance and picturesque attitudes unite to make this the most finished piece of female action we remember to have seen except mrs cibbers alicia and constance indeed it is so much beyond what we behold at present in general that it is not surprising to hear people say instead of we are going to see cyrus we are going to see mrs yates  aspasia is a very inoffensive though unnecessary young lady very loving and very dutiful introduced we know not why disposed of at last we know not how no abilities could make any thing of her in performance therefore mrs mattocks whom we cannot admire in tragedy is as sufferable as any one else  the plot of cyrus is in many places wrought up with pleasing perplexity but falls into a patchedup catastrophe the first second and fifth acts are languid the third and fourth striking and spirited the language abating some few slips chaste the sentiments just though not very poetical and the versification unaffected but nerveless in short mr hoole has successfully availed himself of a good original to fabricate a piece that acts prettily without being in any shape great it is in many respects pleasing  the strong similarity to merope and douglas with a comparison lessen its merit as it wants the sentimental pathetic dignity of the former and the pastoral picturesque simplicity of the latter public opinion has run much in favor of this piece in representation and the managers have substantial reason to call it a good play but we dare believe neither one side nor the other will contend for much merit in perusal  the clandestine marriage a comedy by mess garrick and colman we have either observed or meant to observe that spirit and propriety of character vivacity of dialogue wit and variety of incidents are the constituent parts of a good comedy many of late have got into the style of mere sentiment and chitchat picked up from novels which they are vain and idle enough to suppose complete dramas if such authors are right ben johnson wycherley congreve farquhar and cibber were undoubtedly wrong licenciousness it is true has disappeared but in general it seems as if wit and pleasantry who were too long united with so bad a companion had followed their old ally how far the child of poetical partnership now before us has fallen into or avoided the fashionable languor let candid consideration declare  fanny merchant sterlings youngest daughter is acquainted by the maid betty at the opening of the play that her husband is just come from london as fanny is fearful that any hint of her secret match with lovewell should escape she strives to check but with little effect the maids babbling impatience whose frequent mention of what she is desired to be so cautious of sprinkles the scene with laughter but we apprehend however natural in private the pregnant state of fanny need not have been so much insisted on  lovewell finding fanny in tears occasioned by her apprehensive situation sooths her in terms becomingly tender  she pressingly urges making their marriage public which he objects to both on account of her sisters approaching nuptials with sir john melville the mercenary vain disposition of her father and the ignorant ambition of her aunt mrs heildelberg however he promises to make the discovery soon and conceives favorable hopes from his affinity to lord ogleby this satisfies the lady who on going out is met by her father  the merchant charges lovewell with following his daughter and upon the young mans mention of himself as a husband for her sterling citizenlike hints a deficiency in pecuniary qualification lovewells arguments of persuasion are all answered and defeated by his not having the recommendatory stuff sterlings peculiarity through this scene is entertainingly expressed and the confusion that lovewell is thrown into by urging him to a promise of mentioning the matter no more is very natural his escape from the dilemma is also well conceived in promising that things shall go no farther  on being informed of lord oglebys speedy approach after some humorous remarks on the peers letter sterling breaks out with purseproud sufficiency respecting his own taste and ability for entertaining persons of the first rank ignorant ostentation is here shown in glaring colors and the whole scene is agreeably sustained the soliloquy of lovewell opens his design of making sir john melville a confidant that through him lord oglebys approbation and consent may be obtained  the ensuing scene between miss sterling and fanny exhibits a strong contrast of disposition the former shows coquettish extravagant vivacity the latter modest sensibility the ladies are supported in their different lights with considerable merit and miss sterlings raillery of her grave sister gives great spirit to the scene her notions of gay life are very happily expressed and one of her satirical strokes is excellent speaking of her finery she lets fall this tart and pleasant sarcasm on the folly and profusion of licentious gallantry  the jeweller says i shall set out with as many diamonds as any body in town except lady brilliant and polly  what do you call it  lord squanders kept mistress  mrs heidelbergs entrance produces a fresh vein of humor her opiniated consequence ignorant vulgarism of expression and impertinent bustle mark her character strongly her abrupt behavior to fanny and her partiality for miss sterling show further what we are to expect from the old lady from their conversation we may perceive that the favorite niece entertains some doubt of her lover sir john melville which mrs heidelberg endeavors to set aside by interpreting his coldness polite delicacy this occasions the young lady to give a pleasant sketch of lord oglebys amorous tendency  sterlings anxiety about the elegance of his entertainment his sisters instruction for polite behavior and canton the swiss domestics appearance all cooperate to end this act in an agreeable preparative manner for what is to come  the second act opens in an apartment adjacent to lord oglebys bedchamber brush the noblemans valet appears gallanting sterlings chambermaid in the true strain of imitative quality his coxcombry and the girls coming simplicity are extremely well supported  nothing can be more happily imagined or better conducted than the introduction of lord ogleby whose figure and manners make irresistible appeals to laughter nor is the swiss sycophant canton any way unequal to the ennobled oddity his master cantons insinuation that both the miss sterlings seem attached to his lordship is not only a fine attack upon the peers weak side but works up ogleby to a most ludicrous opinion of his influence amongst the ladies the merchants praise of the accommodation his house affords and his intention of hurrying the feeble peer from one spot to another for sake of viewing what he presumes tasteful improvements keeps up the dialogue with much pleasantry  sir john melvilles entrance is only to draw lovewell into a private conference which might have been effected as we apprehend much better without necessitating the baronet to come upon such a trifling errand  sterlings inadvertent attack upon oglebys constitution and appearance shows plainly the forward unreserved trader who will speak his joke at any rate a circumstance plainly irksome to his lordship though he seems to pass it off agreeably  the ensuing unfinished scene between sir john melville and lovewell seems a mere excressence the lopping off which would make no gap nor any way mutilate the piece in that between my lord the merchant mrs heidelberg and the two young ladies we apprehend sterlings clumsiness of taste is rather too much displayed the humor seems to confess a strain upon that point but takes an agreeable turn when his lordships vanity interprets the present of a nosegay from fanny as love and that of another from miss sterling as jealousy the silent situation of sir john and lovewell through so long a scene might and undoubtedly should have been avoided for though sir johns explanation affords some little grounds for action in lovewell when he finds the baronets affection placed on his wife yet the conversation is much too long for what it turns upon and rather damps that spirit which happily enlivens most other parts of this piece  sir johns interview with fanny shows that gentleman in no favorable point of view as thereby he discovers inconstancy to one sister and rudeness to the other this scene also is heavy though the lady shows good sense and commendable feelings  miss sterlings appearance gives an enlivening turn her resentment hurries off the false gallant in terms of natural confusion and falls in heavy reproaches on her innocent sister whose perplexed situation and delicate resignation render her an amiable object of favor and pity with the audience her soliloquy at the end of this act leaves matters in a state of tender suspense  according to that excellent rule of variety practiced in a particular manner by congreve the introduction of new characters in each of the three first acts we are presented with the lawyers who are to settle marriage contracts etc at the beginning of the third act of this piece their scene is an extreme pleasant and severe satire upon those maggots of the law as farquhar emphatically styles them who breed and live in the rotten parts of it  there is something peculiarly keen levelled against selfimportant old practitioners who pretend not to know young ones where flower addresses freeman concerning the length of his practice at the bar sterlings consequential boasting of his wealth and the serjeants methodical particularity concerning the marriage articles are highly characteristic  sir john melvilles entrance demanding a private audience of sterling sends off the lawyers and brings on a conversation in which the baronet gradually discovers his affection for fanny a circumstance which naturally surprises her father however by a proper application to his interested disposition that is by abating thirty thousand pounds of the fortune proposed with miss sterling he obtains the citizens consent this point is effected in a natural and laughable manner sir john appears to have no idea of delicacy where passion is concerned nor the citizen of honesty when gold preponderates the opposite scale a doubt arises about mrs heidelbergs consent and the merchant appears anxious to keep the transaction a secret from her  it is impossible for any thing to be more characteristic than sterlings soliloquy which ends with the following very sensible a truly satirical remark well thus it is that the children of citizens who have acquired fortunes prove persons of fashion and thus it is that persons of fashion who have ruined their fortunes reduce the next generation to cits  in the following scene we perceive that miss sterling has fanned the flames of her aunts passion by relating the discovery she made of sir john and her sister the old ladys resentment breaks forth in a torrent of whimsical expressions the baronets appearance occasions the young lady to retire when he is warmly reprehended by mrs heidelberg for slighting her elder neice in favor of the younger sterling makes his appearance and is thrown into a diverting state of confusion by being charged with his giving consent to the affair just mentioned this scene is executed with remarkable spirit and mrs heidelbergs declaration at going off that she will not give the family a farthing is a severe sting to the citizen who appears quite subservient to his sisters influence from pecuniary considerations which makes him paint the matter to melville as of great consequence who proposes to obtain lord oglebys interest in his favor here the act concludes leaving the audience again in a very agreeable state of dubitation  mrs heidelberg miss sterling and the merchant open the fourth act with the old ladys declared intention of sending fanny to town which sterling diffidently opposes but is treated in a very cavalier manner by his purseproud sister which draws from him a soliloquy of merit concerning the tyranny of females where they can safely usurp power at the conclusion of it we find this just remark  so absolute with her money  but to say truth nothing but money can make us absolute  and so we must even make the best of her  lord ogleby and his swiss confidant appear next conferring upon the circumstance of fannys being sent to town which occasions his lordship to make some humorous remarks upon all the family but her whom as it appears he thinks more than tolerable supposing she has a tender for him cantons adulation and the peers laughable vanity are most humorously displayed  the following scene between lovewell and his wife consists of a proposition from him to make lord ogleby acquainted with their marriage as the most probable method of removing their perplexity his lordship appears and the lady is left by her husband to open the affair  for some time their conversation is all preparatory for the main point and the amorous nobleman from the ladys very natural confusion draws some favorable conclusions concerning his influence upon her the expressions he throws out aside show a rich vien of humor the mention of sir johns addresses occasions a pleasing misconstruction as oglebys folly causes him to think that the ladys dislike proceeds from an attachment to him  cantons interruptive entrance is very well conceived to divide the scene which we deem to be highly and uniformly finished  his lordships soliloquy also is worthy of what precedes it  in his conference with sterling and miss the misconstruction is made excellent use of on both sides particularly as appearances deceive one party while vanity misleads the other from real truth lord oglebys manner of opening his design of marrying fanny to her father is executed with great judgment and the following scene with lovewell is a most interesting continuation of that misapprehension which furnishes such entertaining materials to this act  there is a very artful and regular climax of humor which rises with every fresh character and keeps the peer for an usual length of dialogue so far from palling that even at the end of the act we wish for more of him his triumph over sir johns pretensions to fanny gives a most agreeable variation of pleasantry and we are doubtful if any dramatic character was ever better supported so long together  the fifth act begins with lovewell and fanny at the crisis of their anxiety dreading a discovery which nevertheless it now appears absolutely necessary to make by mrs betty we are informed with her usual circumlocution that they are in danger from some eavesdroppers her taking miff is very suitable to one whom confidence makes pert  fanny upon returning from a lookout requests lovewell to retire which he obligingly complies with miss sterling full of envious jealousy and suspicion begins the next scene with her aunt on whose affectionate feelings she works by an artful appearance of violent grief it appears that she supposes sir john melville to be in fannys chamber lodged there with a design of running away with her next morning the approach of brush drives off these two ladies  this gallant valet elevated with liquor pays addresses to the chambermaid and speaking of the wine he has been drinking throws out coxcomically this stroke of wellconceived satire i am a little electrified that is the truth on it i am not used to drink port and your masters is so heady that a pint of it oversets a claretdrinker  his close attack upon the girl and her apprehension of being detected occasion some mention of miss sterling of whom mr brush expresses himself rather freely and in her hearing as she happens to be upon the listen this and his declaring an intention of entering mrs heildelbergs apartment if the chambermaid resists bring that old lady and miss sterling forward brimful of rage and reproaches brush however scampers off and leaves his sweetheart to encounter them supposing her in fannys plot they browbeat severely and examine her strictly however being totally ignorant of the matter they only put her into an unavailing fright  mrs heidelberg goes off to rectify her headdress and leaves miss sterling on the watch who seeing betty come out of her sisters room taxes her with having material secrets in her custody mr sterling and mrs heidelberg enter at this point of time the first enquiring why he is disturbed and the last acquainting him with the supposed villainy of sir john melvilles being in fannys bedchamber this alarms the father who is not willing however to have it made a public matter by awaking lord ogleby and the whole family  the citizens design of making sir john marry his youngest daughter privately in the morning throws the eldest into so violent an agitation of spirits that she and her aunt break out in spite of his interposition their cries bring forth canton and his lordship the lawyers etc in very laughable appearances  the ladies take great pains on his lordships cordial enquiry after fannys safety to persuade him that she is on the point of running away with his nephew sir john however the peers opinion of her being attached inviolably to him bars all the passages of belief his confidence even interferes so far as to call fanny out of the chamber just as he mentions his nephew as the concealed party sir john comes on at the opposite side which invalidates a main part of the charge  nothing can be more suitable than the lawyers making their remarks in terms of practice  betty now opens the door and lets out her mistress in a great flutter of spirits which operates so strongly as to occasion her fainting this incident draws lovewell from his retreat who in the warmth of anxiety avows his regard for her and after some altercation the marriage is declared this strikes all with astonishment and causes sterling to threaten them with being turned out of his house from which rigid determination arises a most pleasing stroke of generosity in lord oglebys temper which promises them an asylum with him the plot thus wound up to a crisis of explanation the young couple are made happy by the fathers consent the real good wishes of some and the seeming forgiveness of all  the language of this piece is spirited and in general chaste though not elegant the sentiments just without brilliance the incidents well ranged the plot pleasingly unfolded judiciously conducted and well wrought up to the catastrophe as to wit it traces natural conversation of the present day so close as not to have a spark throughout the five acts and for moral it has not the shadow of one which the authors seemed conscious of when instead of adverting to so essential a point they adopted the pitiful though classical mode of conclusion by begging applause from the audience which is a little like merryandrews bidding his audience shout when he has played tricks before them in an epilogue such a sugarsop may be dropped to sweeten the acidity of critical opinion but at the end of a play it must certainly be deemed a piece of poetical sycophantism  lord ogleby though pronounced a very near relation of lord chalkstone is most certainly as much an original and as much a child of laughter as any character on the stage  harmlessly vain pleasantly odd commendably generous a coxcomb not void of sense a master full of whim a lover full of false fire yet a valuable friend possessed of delicate feelings and nice honor the peculiarities of this difficult part are supported with eminent abilities by that most excellent comedian mr king who notwithstanding his chief praise derives from being a chaste delineator of nature here strikes out in the water color painting of life a most beautiful and striking caricature conceived with some degree of poetical extravagance yet so meliorated by his execution that thousands who have never seen such a human being as lord ogleby must amidst involuntary bursts of laughter allow nay wish there may be such a man whose foibles are so inoffensive  if mr king shows more merit in any one passage than another it is where sterling says to the young couple lovewell you shall leave my house and madam you shall follow him to which the peer with infinite good nature replies and if they do i shall receive them into mine  though it does not always follow that what an actor feels most he can express best yet we may venture to say a kind of sympathetic unison gives this short sentence peculiar force and beauty in mr kings utterance  sir john melville is chief confusionmaker of the piece of indifferent principles and insipid qualifications ease and gentility of deporment which are the only requisites necessary for this gentleman were equally wanting in the late mr holland and the present mr aickin however tolerable propriety is as much as this water gruel baronet deserves and so far he received no injury from these gentlemen  sterling is a well drawn uniform character mounted upon the stilts of property aiming at and boasting of taste he has not grappling at pelf of which he has a superfluity selfish and positive where he dare exercise authority ostentatious methodical and ignorant thus compounded he gives considerable life to those scenes where he is concerned when assisted by mr yatess inimitable talents for such characters but in the hands of mr love sinks beneath criticism and seems only calculated to lull attention to sleep it is a great pity this monotonous gentleman rose any higher than sergeant flower the florid unvarying importance of physiognomy he commonly wears being better adapted to a lumber headed lawyer than any other character  lovewell engages an audience by his tender sentiments and affectionate sincerity his situation affects and his manners please us mr powell never made a more agreeable figure in comedy nor perhaps so good a one as in this part which being placed in a station of life that he himself had filled not long before and being happily suited not only to his external appearance but his internal feelings also he satisfied most agreeably every point of expectation even mr cautherly though far beneath the original is not an insufferable lovewell  the lawyers are drawn in a masterly manner and for the reason assigned above we think mr love had merit in the sergeant  would he had never been removed however it must be allowed that mr bransby is a worthy successor as he supports at least the weight of the character with equal merit  canton is an admirable delineation of a foreign sycophant playing upon a vain english nobleman the picture is instructive and held to view in a very just advantageous point of light by mr baddeley who breaks expression well into the swiss dialect and cringes through the part in a very characteristic manner  brush is an excellent contrast of the assuming english valet and while in view claims some notice  the late mr palmer deserved and met more applause than could be expected to attend so short a character where tipsey he was highly laughable his successor and namesake if not quite so pleasant has nevertheless a considerable share of merit  as farquhar said in respect of sir harry wildair that when mr wilks died or left the stage he might really go to the jubilee so without exaggeration we may say that mrs heidelberg was lost to the public when mrs clive retired the ignorant affectation volubility of expression and happy disposition of external appearance she was so remarkable for will render it difficult to find an equivalent in many characters she proved herself mistress of a fund of laughter but was in none more luxuriantly droll than in this every line of the author was very becomingly enforced and many passages were much improved by emphatic illustration in such undertakings we have never seen her equal and doubt if ever we may mrs hopkins is scarce a shadow of her  miss sterling a character quite unfinished says a good deal to very little purpose is eat up with ambition and i am afraid with envy she seems to have no commendable principles about her her first scene indeed exhibits a considerable share of harmless spirit though what follows rather speaks malevolence  she is left at the catastrophe in a most undetermined and we may add notwithstanding her foibles an unsatisfactory state the authors have made something of her at first to drop her into nothing at last in this view she must rather be a dead weight upon any performer however miss pope surmounting disadvantages renders the young lady rather more than tolerable  fanny has a manifest advantage of her sister in simplicity of manners disinterestedness of affection and delicacy of feeling her situation also happily enforces the amiable parts of her character mrs palmer the original in this part spoke more both to the head and heart than mrs baddely either does or can do some lucky hits with a more pleasing figure make her pass off upon general opinion as well as her predecessor but where criticism interferes we must think much more favorably of the past than the present  betty will never again be performed with merit equal to the lady who with much justice declined the insertion of her name in the drama for so insignificant a character a character far below her capabilities almost as far as it is above mrs loves execution of whom it was literrally cruel to make an actress  yet by some unaccountable fatality this unhappy lady is shoved on for many things which would have been much better in other hands and could not be worse in any  why why will managers so far mistake the judgment of an audience as to venture the intrusion of such creatures as understand little and express less  the chambermaid according to what is said of her was as well figured and played as ever she will be by miss plymm  to speak of the piece in a complicate view it certainly has a great deal of acting merit  a thorough knowledge of life and character is essential to draw comic scenes successfully of this the clandestine marriage is a pleasing proof however some of the scenes are heavy and a few trifling the dialogue is not so spirited and easy as farquhars nor so luxuriant and nervous as congreves yet agreeably disengaged the satire well pointed and the sentiments lively though not generally instructive if standing the test of closet criticism be the fairest and most estimable degree of merit we must not venture to place this piece among the foremost but in representation we are willing to allow it every point of approbation which the indulgent public has favored it with and much more than many others can claim which possess those very requisites the clandestine marriage wants  the fair penitent a tragedy by mr row this dramatic composition was wrote at a time when genius received nourishment from the beams of royal favor ere the muses of this isle were germanized into stone and stands to this day in estimation at least equal to any except those of shakespeare it opens with horatio and altamont two persons of rank in genoa from whom we learn that it is the latters bridal day there appears to be strong links of friendship between these two characters and that sciolto a nobleman father to altamonts bride has shown particular marks of favor to horatio on account of being altamonts brotherinlaw and friend his attachment to altamont arose from a peculiar mark of filial duty shown by him to a dead father in yielding himself to prison that his fathers corpse which had been arrested by rigid creditors might obtain the usual rites of burial  sciolto at his entrance expresses himself in terms suitable to the feelings of a tender parent on the day which disposes of a favorite daughter according to his wishes and as he imagines of her own this scene is mere congratulation except where altamont mentions the coldness and concern of his bride this the father naturally interprets to arise from the real or artificial coyness of her sex and conducts them off with some lines of poetical yet we think exceptionable expression  lothario a young lord of dissolute principles with his confidante rossano appear next from the expressions at first dropped by lothario we find there is a rooted enmity subsisting between him and scioltos connections chiefly on account of calista of whose unfortunate credulity and his own triumph over her virtue he gives a most fanciful but highly censurable description vice is here adorned with irresistible charms to an unguarded mind and therefore presented to public view in her most dangerous garb reason and judgment commiserating the betrayed must condemn the betrayer yet we fear the luxuriance of fancy here works a quite contrary effect less merit in the writing would have lessened the danger either in perusal or representation gross licentiousness disgusts but the refined sort like palatable poison introduces destruction unperceived  lucilla appears on message from her mistress calista and addresses the gay deceiver in pathetic terms his replies are much in character and the scene has considerable spirit in action but we doubt whether delicacy and just reserve are not too violently offended by the maids proclaiming her mistresss situation before a third person horatios unexpected approach shortens their conference and in the hurry of retiring lothario drops the letter just received from calista by her maid  this the friend of altamont takes up and though good manners would have taught him to decline perusal of it as seeing the superscription  to lothario  yet a curiosity stimulated by friendship occasions him to examine the contents which afford a most alarming and painful discovery not only of calistas previous but subsequent guilt by soliciting an interview with him who has undone her even with a man who is known as the determined foe of altamont  the soliloquy occasioned by this fatal letter is well suited to a man in horatios critical and disagreeable situation reflection seems more to embarrass him and he is wrapped in the perplexity of thought when his wife appears  lavinia at her entrance makes a very natural enquiry why horatio has left even the marriage ceremony for this no apology is offered as we do not perceive a reason to suspect calista before discovery of the letter just found nor any other cause for absenting himself from the immediate celebration of his friends nuptials the resolution of not acquainting altamont with the dreadful discovery is tender generous sensible and friendly  lavinias concern at her husbands confused unintelligible behavior is prettily expressed but we conceive an exception against the following passage in the midst of sympathetic anxiety which naturally speaks to the point at once she utters the following superfluous simile  the sick man thus acknowledging the summons of his fate lifts up his feeble hands and eyes for mercy and with confusion thinks upon his audit   horatios reserve of a subject which seems to affect him so deeply increases the alarm which his wife has already taken and occasions her to touch him on the tenderest points of affection which however only draws from him warm declarations of regard without coming to any point of explanation these operate properly upon lavinias good sense which declines farther enquiry and change her request to his appearing amidst the jocund proceed of the day this produces from horatio some fine reflections upon vicious and inconstant women whom he contrasts delicately to his wife with which the first act ends  calista swelled with perturbed agitation of mind begins the second act with refusal of comfort from lucilla who offers but in vain some cordial sensible advice the wretched bride prepossessed against her new husband indulges the most gloomy ideas and expressions of discontent her description of what she should deem an eligible abstraction from the world is extremely picturesque but too poetical it breathes the air of romantic rather than natural grief the pride of heart which had not power to check fatal delusion and the loss of virtue yet soars above worldly censure and urges her to entertain thoughts of death rather than public shame this we believe has been too often the case in reality and is therefore a commendable picture held up to startle young minds from similar indiscretion infatuation is admirably depicted in her resolution to see lothario though it forbids any claim to the character of penitent and shows it is not so much a sense of guilt as an impatience of being crossed in her wishes that agitates her  this is no doubt natural but renders her much less an object of pity than real contrition would have done female weakness influenced by illgrounded love is finely and instructively described in this scene  upon altamonts approach calista forms the resolution of guarding her real thoughts from discovery the amorous bridegroom addresses her in terms of rapture to which she makes a cold and dubious return and even goes so far as to tell him their union is not founded on the principles of happiness sciolto replete with parental joy gives directions for every mark of festivity and pronouncing an emphatic nuptial benediction retires with all the characters except horatio who in soliloquy canvasses again the subject which sits so heavy on his heart he supposes and wishes the letter to be forged but seems to draw very unfavourable conclusions from calistas confused and gloomy deportment this occasions him to throw out a general and therefore illiberal reflection against the whole sex adverting to the strained similitude of original sin in eve  lothario now comes forward acquainting rossano with his loss of the letter which villainlike he does not regret as it may be the means of infamy and wretchedness to the unhappy woman he has ruined but as he wants to make it an instrument of his antipathy against altamont  horatio here enters as it appears in search of lothario their encounter is natural and their dispute is wrought up not only by just degrees but in terms suitable to the dignity of those who are disputants the cool determination of altamonts friend is beautifully contrasted to the petulant ostentatious impatience of his antagonist the one reasons like a man of sense and virtue the other prevaricates like an unprincipled coxcomb when the charge of forgery is brought home which lothario only answers in the doubtful style horatio utters a most beautiful sarcasm against him and all other pernicious reptiles of his depraved nature which we cannot avoid quoting away  no woman could descend so low a skipping dancing worthless tribe ye are fit only for yourselves ye herd together and when the circling glass warms your vain hearts you talk of beauties which you never saw and fancy raptures which you never knew legends of saints who never yet had being or being never were saints are not so false as the fond tales which you recount of love   the word fond in the last line is not of very obvious meaning unless to those who know that in yorkshire and some other parts of england it implies silly even in this sense we think either the epithet of foul or base tales would have suited premeditate scandal much better  in the progress of this altercation horatio shows himself not only a man of real courage but also the active warm friend nor does lothario fall short of commendable spirit if exerted in a better cause we think the strength of horatios feelings rather hurry him to indiscretion when he mentions the matter before a third person the challenge is well given though we disapprove lotharios gross reflection which provokes a blow from his antagonist there is much dignity and cool determination in horatios brief acceptance of the summons the conclusive speech of this act which conveys in some very beautiful lines excellent instruction to the fair sex is we apprehend exceptionable not only from being run so much into rhyme but because it necessitates the speaker to step out of character and address the audience a circumstance by no means defensible  at the beginning of the third act it appears that sciolto has discovered his daughters sullen behavior and reproves it in terms of high displeasure the simile which closes his first speech is strained and like most others in dramatic composition superfluous his threats are of a very serious nature and occasion calista to make some remarks upon the subordinate state of her sex which her proud heart seems ill calculated to brook horatio approaches and intimates how critical the subject he comes upon is therefore resolves to enter upon it in the gentlest manner whatever justice may appear in his design we agree with calista that stealing upon her is a breach of decorum inconsistent with persons of rank  calistas dislike of altamont is a very sufficient reason why she should hold his most intimate friend at distance her insinuation of this brings on the point in view upon horatios delivering that excellent sentiment to be good is to be happy and mentioning that guilt is the source of sorrow the author has shown himself well acquainted with conscious feelings by making the lady kindle at the word guilt it being certain that those who have done ill are most ready to catch at the imputation of it horatio seizes this opportunity to press the matter closer which only serving more to inflame calistas rage he at length as a proof of his assertion shows her the letter to lothario unable to resist so palpable a conviction she tries a very natural effort of female policy which is by tearing the letter to disarm him at least of positive proof  at this critical crisis while she is swelled with rage and his friend covered with confusion altamont comes forward with fresh declarations of love but takes a natural alarm at seeing his bride and horatio in such a situation calista here by throwing inflammatory materials on the mind of her husband and urging a quarrel of fatal nature between the friends shows herself highly capable of plunging into one degree of iniquity to screen another and that even a sacrifice of blood is not too much for her illfounded pride this we allow to be strictly in nature but the grounds of an execrable character at her departure she rages in some very poetical rhimes  the following scene between the friends takes a turn which may be expected the prejudiced bridegroom who thinks the object of his wishes free from every criminal imputation charges horatio with ill behavior who to exculpate himself is betrayed into an explanation respecting calista rather blameable yet from a person in his agitation of spirits probable enough fired by the charge of guilt levelled at her he loves a charge merely supported by assertion altamont indulges violent resentment even so far as to throw off all traces of friendship we have another blow given in this scene as such a circumstance generally creates laughter and is at any rate disgraceful to persons of rank we wonder an author of mr rowes delicacy could repeatedly introduce it  horatios reluctance to endanger the life even of an ungrateful friend and adverting to a likeness of his father are proofs of a great and tender mind which urged beyond all bearing at length acts on the essential principle of self defense lavinias seasonable interposition prevents fatal consequences yet cannot sprinkle any drops of patience on altamonts inflamed heart who behaves with almost as much brutal roughness to her as he has done with savage fury to his friend in short we must deem altamont through this whole scene both a fool and a madman had horatio been drawn with as little sense and tenderness poor wellmeaning lavinia must have brought herself into a most painful situation however the manly tenderness of her husband balms in some measure the stings a brothers unkindness has planted in her heart and she returns it properly by an affectionate declaration of attachment in the last speech of the act where however pleasing sentiments and nature are again injured by simile and rhyme though had the latter been avoided the former might have passed without objection nay perhaps with some degree of praise  a soliloquy begins the fourth act wherein altamont seems to stand selfconvicted of folly in quarrelling with his friend for a woman who repays his raptures with coldness and disdain upon his exit lothario and calista appear the gay gallant endeavoring to sooth his deceived and enraged mistress who shows a just resentment against the falsehood which has plunged her into misery his upbraiding her with having married the man he hates is an artful stroke of exculpation relative to himself and stimulates her rage considerably altamonts appearance at this period is well contrived and what calista says previous to his coming in view brings him forward in a striking manner lotharios fate is properly precipitated his dying words suit the tenor of his past conduct and he expires in the same character he has maintained through life  calistas desperation at his fall and the irresistible proof of her own guilt is a natural effect of strong passions altamonts immediate confession of forgiveness shows him to have at least as much weakness as humanity the voice of sciolto heard from without strikes his daughter with a fresh degree of confusion upon the old mans entrance the traces of blood alarm suspicion in him which being confirmed by what altamont replies his fury breaking all ties of paternal tenderness aims at calistas life which is saved by her husbands humane interposition even contrary to her strong persuasive supplications for death at a fathers hand scioltos start of phrenzy being passed off he indulges reflection and reproach in a truly pathetic manner the picture calista gives of her own retirement contrition and mournful catastrophe is extremely affecting  after she disappears we are struck with the idea of some fatal resolution and melted with the old mans tears who on hearing that lotharios faction are assembled threatening ruin seems pleased with an opportunity of carrying vengeance even among the friends of that young lord after a soliloquy of altamonts which indeed means very little lavinia enters in confusion and lets us know that she has just been rescued from a mob with whom her husband is still engaged at hazard of his life  horatio soon enters to dissipate her apprehensions but treats altamont with that just and firm contempt his behavior in the former act merited the sister pleads amiably for her brother and the unhappy man makes very tender concessions  horatio we think highly blameable for so gross a reflection as an infamous believing british husband to taunt him with so cutting a misfortune is inhuman and the stigma of british husbands though perhaps proverbial amongst the italians is very illiberal too much so to be adopted altamont is far too figurative in the speech which begins i have wronged thee much and lavinias carrying on the allusion with which it concludes is an unpardonable trespass upon serious feelings  altamonts tears touch horatio with sympathy and it is to be wished that they alone had wrought the desirable effect of tenderness as the pantomimical stroke of falling down is utterly contemptible and the two speeches occasioned by it rather laughable this whole scene is very inadequate to the rest of the play and the characters are carried off with a jingling tag spoken by lavinia which has more sound than meaning  notwithstanding good language striking characters and a well conducted plot may disdain the adventitious assistance of processions rooms hung with black etc we cannot help allowing that this latter decoration with lotharios body in view gives a necessary solemnity to the fifth act which calista opens with a soliloquy of most masterly composition scioltos appearance at such a time of night in such a place and what he says prepare us for a scene peculiarly interesting nor are our warmest expectations deceived in the progress of it the father and daughter now lulled from the turbulence of passion mutually unsluice their hearts and if the phrase is allowable let flow a springtide of sorrow  here in spite of guilt we must feel for the unhappy fair one and sympathize with the hoary wretched fire who sees him lift up the dagger with unresolved and trembling hand but shudders who hears his distraction at the thoughts of his daughters tasting death but feels pity vibrating in every nerve however recommending selfdestruction to his child is equally unworthy the christian the parent and the man  returning to the pleasure her infant years gave him and his forgiveness of her are circumstances thoroughly pathetic his parting carries the climax of tenderness as high as it can well go the succeeding scene between altamont and calista is extremely languid and seems to have little else in view than giving a fresh instance of that amorous weakness which so entirely rules the injured husband  horatio comes with the melancholy information of scioltos being mortally wounded which hurries calista into the tremendous act of suicide an example altamont seems inclined to follow but for the prevention of his friend calista lives to receive the blessing of her expiring father which is extended also to horatio and his son calista makes some atonement to her husband with her last breath altamont declares an indifference for life and horatio concludes the piece by rhiming forth an evident and very excellent moral  the title of this tragedy has by many critics been deemed a misnomer for say they the ladys behavior in no shape entitles her to the character of a penitent this charge we cannot wholly admit though we must in general in several places she speaks of contrition and very feelingly too notwithstanding that pride and her first love fixed on lothario seem to rule her heart in the fourth act scene with him she expresses herself thus the hours of folly and of fond delight are wasted all and fled those that remain are doomed to weeping anguish and repentance   after all a lapse in title suppose one proved is but a very slight object for criticism to fix on it is like faulcons preying upon flies especially in respect of this piece which exhibits a regular plot scenes well arranged characters happily delineated elegant versification and instructive sentiments  sciolto is a nobleman in principles as well as rank apparently nice in his honor delicate in his patronage and warm in his parental affection eager for the happiness of a darling daughter and the son of a valued friend whom he has married her to on the most generous disinterested principles his miserable disappointment in such a commendable expectation places him in a situation that wakes the tenderest passions  of all the performers we have seen in this character mr powell stood eminently foremost there was a degree of the pathos about this gentleman in old men never surpassed in our recollection except by mr garrick who must have carried every line of sciolto to the heart however the transitions of countenance the breaks of expression and melting cadences of grief were as happily supplied by mr powell as public taste could wish long very long will the parental parts in tragedy labor under the material deficiency of his untimely loss  mr berry used to blubber through the part from beginning to end and mr sparks was most laboriously uncouth mr aickin makes a very meagre figure in it at present in drury lane wanting both characteristic spirit and tenderness at covent garden there is not even a faint apology for the part  altamont is possessed of generous and sincere but very weak principles so much the dupe of love that every other feeling gives way he is introduced under such unlucky circumstances and plays so much upon himself that to an audience he appears much more languid than the author intended and for this reason he is in general given to some actor as insipid as they imagine him this stamps him contemptible and indeed lays him a dead weight upon the play we remember mr barry by exertion of singular merit making him as respectable as any other character in the piece though mr garrick did lothario and mr sheridan horatio upon the same occasion indeed he so much outfigured his competitors in the race of fame and illustrated so beautifully a character scarce known before that he appeared to great advantage we have also seen mr ross with particular satisfaction and undoubtedly if his fits of negligence could be kept off he has every requisite to bear up altamont agreeably  mr dyer who should never rise above tressel in tragedy has been often shoved on for him which has ever reminded us of a smart tavern waiter full of himself snip snapping the harmonious lines of row into fritters of poetry we could name some others equally trifling but not having words suitable to the wretchedness of their attempts we shall pass them as the managers should have done unnoticed  horatio is an amiable and valuable character yet hurried by the zeal of friendship into trepasses upon decorum his intention we approve but his manner of accosting calista and stigmatizing altamont is very censurable his reasoning seems cool yet his proceedings are precipitate mr quin was greatly admired in this part for what we cannot say unless mere weight and pomposity of expression were deemed a meritorious contrast to the spirited vivacity of lothario his person was no doubt suitably adapted but a laborious formality of action offended the critical eye and a monotonous cadence of voice palled the distinguishing ear  rowes golden lines hung heavy on his expression and by their measured harmony led him into most wearisome recitative of tragedy  one passage for which he gained loud applause deserved nothing but laughter we mean where he says to lothario i will meet thee there setting himself in a studied position to show protuberance of belly in the most striking point of view he gathered his hands toward his sides and after a pause of some seconds shoved them forwards very ungraciously to midwife his short reply into lotharios hearing this gentleman had a fine level and deep tone of voice but misapplied them so barbarously that he growled with the one and chanted with the other  mr sheridan whose voice and person as we have before observed rather speak against him especially in points of importance nevertheless made a more masterly figure in this part than any person we have seen he broke with chaste judgment the lines into good sense without violating just harmony he sustained the sedateness of the character and the spirit of it with equal propriety and had the merit of much greater uniformity than any competitor we shall or can mention cool without sameness firm without brutality  mr mossop with an excellent voice and a very just idea of his authors meaning was nevertheless uncouth painfully sententious when calm ungenteely violent when warm offensively consequential in deportment abominably austere in feature full of disagreeable consequence and moved methodically by the affected rules of premeditate deportment yet he too had his numerous admirers  mr barry was never more mistaken than in this character which in his representation wanted as much as a fine figure and a pleansig voice would admit he could not be disagreeable but was  what must he be now  most egregiously faint and insipid  mr bensley is very inadequate to what might be wished and expected yet tolerable enough for the present wretched state of capital acting which sinks below every idea even of moderate indulgent criticism if where there are many others we should particularise one fault it may be allowable to say that this gentleman is too fond of aiming at vehemence of expression without considering propriety of character or the unstrained extent of his natural powers we wish him to consider this as a friendly not a severe or prejudiced hint  lothario is the most reproachable character our moral author ever drew and indeed as dangerous a one as we know like the snake with a beauteous variegated skin which lures the unguarded hand to a poisonous touch this licentious gallant gilds his pernicious principles with very delusive qualifications especially for the fair sex which cannot be more plainly evinced than by a declaration which has often been made at the representation of this piece by volatile unthinking females who have not scrupled saying that they would rather be deceived by such a pretty fellow as lothario than countenance such a constant passive insipid creature as altamont yet upon examination we do not find one trace of intrinsic merit in his composition he is sprightly voluble amorous and possessed of some courage but the reverse shows him vain superficial inconstant and malevolent capable not only of ruining a credulous woman who loves him but on pretense of resentment against the man who has married her forward to expose her fatal weakness and his own inhuman triumph over her unsuspecting virtue  mr garricks execution of this part displayed very emphatic vivacity and placed him as much above competition as the extent of the character would admit mr barry was elegant but wanted fire mr smith looks the gallant well and does not speak him much amiss mr holland misrepresented him in every particular laborious in the declamatory scenes turbulent in the spirited ones and coarse in those of softer nature mr reddish is by no means adapted to this tragedy coxcomb figure and expression are both much against him however he has the satisfaction of overmatching any other male character in the play as it stands at present in drury lane we remember to have seen one mr lacy a most luxuriant uncultivated theatrical vegetable show great merit in lothario merely from expressive variety of voice and a marking countenance with perhaps less judgment to guide him than any person in a capital light ever possessed it being absolutely certain that he stumbled upon great strokes by a kind of instinctive impulse without knowing why or wherefore  calista is a lady of insuperable pride and violent passions easy of belief warm in affection precipitate in resentment she appears in no favorable point of view except from her credulity and though we contend for her being a penitent yet we readily admit she is a reluctant one she is one upon compulsive not voluntary principles and therefore from circumstances peculiarly distressful alone excites pity great powers and deep feelings are necessary to do her justice on the stage  mrs cibber beyond every point of dispute surpassed not only contemporary merit but what has succeeded even to this day the idea of haughtiness she rather failed in yet her pungent and unequalled distress made ample amends in the first scene of the fifth act her countenance so aptly painted horror and despair her thrilling voice so penetrated the heart that we may say from experience the height of critical pleasure strained nature into a degree of mental pain  mrs bellamy wanted consequence still more than mrs cibber was less expressive in features and more limited in voice yet the passages of tenderness were well supported by her of these two ladies we must make one general remark equally chargeable to both that is having a strong taint of the old fashioned titumti utterance  mrs woffington through an unaccountable turn of public caprice was very well received in calista though all her merit was comprehended in elegance of figure she was a lady townly in heroics and barked out the penitent with as dissonant notes of voice as ever offended a critical ear we allow she was very pleasing to the eye but highly offensive to cultivated taste  mrs yates happily conveys the pride and violence of calista but as we apprehend falls very short of her distress in this character as well as some others we are to lament that the lady just mentioned should indulge a masculine extravagance of frenchified action that she should saw the air with her arms and labor for attitude where it is rather superfluous this may please the million but is no point of real merit and can only be deemed a pitiful trap to catch prostituted applause  mrs barry notwithstanding the disadvantage of an inexpressive though engaging countenance stands in our view next to mrs cibber if she is fainter in the pathetic than that lady and less consequential than mrs yates yet she is certainly more uniform through the whole than either and has a very evident advantage of both in figure and deportment  lavinia is a mere makeshift to eke out the piece amiable and what she says is pretty enough we dont remember to have ever seen her rendered more agreeable than by mrs stephens who in this as well as all other medium parts marks the authors meaning with very just and agreeable sensibility  the genius of row seemed to consist in richness of fancy purity of language justness of images and harmony of numbers but was undoubtedly too poetical for the drama of which every piece he wrote as well as this is an evident proof indeed the absurd manner of theatrical speaking in his time might lead him to monotony in composition and jingling rhimes at the end of acts the only censurable part of the fair penitent we have pointed out in our animadversions upon lothario if no prejudice is done by him to young minds we must pronounce this one of our best tragedies considered in the several lights of character sentiment regularity plot spirit and pathos  the merchant of venice written by shakespeare we have neither affixed the style of tragedy comedy nor that of the mingled species to this piece because it does not properly come under any of those denominations at the opening we are presented with antonio who confessing himself lowspirited is rallied by two friends as being thoughtful on account of his merchandise which charge however he denies bassanio lorenzo and gratiano enter upon their conversation the latter also attacks antonio upon his gloomy visage and jests very pleasantly on the affectation of gravity worn by some men as a semblance of wisdom the exit of this humorist is so whimsical and sudden that it would seem as if he was only brought on to teize the merchant with his rhapsodical lecture  the manner of bassanios disclosing his necessitous condition is very pleasing and suitable to confidential friendship his assimilation of venturing a fresh proof of the merchants kindness after some he has already made away with to the schoolboys shooting one arrow in search of another is fraught with beautiful simplicity antonios reproof for his friends using such circumlocution is affectingly generous as is the manner of promising assistance when he hears bassanios design to lend even when we have the means in immediate possession is a very liberal act but to strain credit for a friend as antonio here proposes lays an enormous weight of obligation upon gratitude  the scene between portia and nerissa is wrote with much vivacity and great good sense there is a pleasing peculiarity of sentiment with pregnant brevity of expression from the conversation of these females we find that portias father by will has fixed the determination of her marriage upon choosing right from three caskets of gold silver and lead the fame of her riches beauty and the oddity of winning her by a kind of matrimonial lottery has drawn many suitors of all whom separately portia gives a very ludicrous and sarcastical account especially of the english baron and the scots lord upon nerissas mention of bassanio her opinion softens into the favorable  bassanio and shylock approach next the former as it appears soliciting a loan of three thousand ducats on the credit of antonio as the jew is a very peculiar character shakespeare according to the custom of his unbounded genius has furnished him with a peculiar mode of expression his pondering upon the hazards attending property at sea is the usurer to a hair  upon antonios entrance the israelite makes us acquainted with his motives of antipathy against the merchant the first of which his lending out money gratis shows shylock to be flintyhearted indeed hating his nation and personally reviling him lay a just foundation for dislike however we find that like a thoroughpaced villain he accosts antonio with a fair face when mention is made of neither lending or taking money upon advantage shylock enters into the defense of usury by a scriptural allusion here our author though he highly supports character deviates from delicacy concerning the sheep in antonios reply there is a most veritable stroke of satire upon those who justify not only error but infamy from holy writ mark you this bassanio the devil can cite scripture for his purpose   shylock like other purseproud knaves who take liberties with those who borrow money of them rather rates the merchant who by generous and spirited contempt reduces the mercenary sycophant to subtle fawning the penalty he proposes on the bond shows him so provident a villain that he prepares even for a possibility of wreeking his mortal hatred there is something very artful when bassanio declares against the merchants signing such a bond in shylocks throwing an imputation of villainy on christians through their suspicion of other men  the second act begins with a scene omitted in representation but why we know not between the prince of morocco and portia as preparative to his trying the caskets  lancelot the jews man in a very whimsical soliloquy communicates an intention of running away from his master the contention between his conscience and the fiend is truly laughable old gobbos introduction means no more than to give lancelot an opportunity to display his quibbling wordcatching humor we wish the scene had a better tendency than mere whim upon bassanios entrance the father and son attack him in a very odd manner to take the latter into his service which he good naturedly consents to this piece of good luck occasions a dissertation upon the ridiculous study of palmestry divertingly satirical  when gratiano comes to solicit the liberty of going to belmont with bassanio he is warned to check his skipping spirit to which he makes a very ludicrous profession of gravity  when lancelot appears taking leave of jessica we do not approve the expression of her fathers house being hell and he a merry devil nor do we relish launcelots insinuation of her being got by a christian after he goes off the young jewess signifies her hopes of delivery from bondage by the assistance of her lover lorenzo the next short scene is nothing more than preparative for putting the said design into execution  in the scene between shylock lancelot and jessica we find the jew so much alarmed at the idea of masking in the streets that he gives jessica a very punctual and positive charge to shut out even the sound of shallow foppery as he calls it  we wonder our author did not make the jew mention having antonio bound which with exulting hopes of getting the forfeit would have made him much more respectable in this scene wherein he is now rather languid telling his daughter the circumstance might have agreeably contrasted her humanity to his malevolence  the introduction of a song by lorenzo under jessicas window affords her more suitable time for change of dress than the author has allowed and is pleasing enough yet we hold it rather inconsistent with the essential privacy of stealing her away however she gets safe into her lovers arms well furnished with jewels and ducats morochiuss trial of the caskets affords some very noble flights of fancy and plausible though fallacious reasoning for his fixing on the golden one which instead of the lady furnishes him with an excellent lesson in the following lines  all that glisters is not gold often have you heard that told many a man his life has sold but my outside to behold gilded wood may worms enfold  etc etc in the short succeeding scene between salanio and solarino an admirable description is given of the jews distraction at his daughters elopement some hints are thrown out judiciously to wake our apprehension for antonios bond and a most amiable picture is drawn of his unlimited friendship for bassanio  the prince of arragon appears next as a suitor of portia this scene as well as those of morochius is omitted in representation and we think very blameably as the progressive regularity of design is thereby interrupted and many excellent reflections withheld from the audience on a train of sophistical deductions the first candidate persuaded his erring judgment to fix on gold the second has sense enough on reading the label who chooses me shall gain what many men desire to reject external ostentation yet is so vain as to think highly of his own deserts and therefore chooses where the inscription of the casket runs thus who chooses me shall get as much as he deserves presuming that the lady only can be the reward of his exalted merit the satire couched in his finding the portrait of an idiot is keen and comprehensive  at the beginning of the third act salanio and solarino acquaint the audience with antonios loss of a rich ship shylock foaming with rage joins them never were transitions from one passion to another better supported than in this scene distraction grief and malevolence succeed and cross each other admirably nor can any thing be more happily conceived than the jews justification of his own cruelty upon the common rights and sensations of nature equally incident to his tribe and christians upon tubals appearance his agitation rises still higher and every line that passes between them is excellently imagined to display the united powers of action and utterance  bassanio now appears as the third candidate for portia and has the advantage of her good wishes for his success his reflections previous to fixing a choice are most sensibly argumentative and beautifully just fancy and judgment form a cordial union  he succeeds happily to himself and agreeably to the lady by rejecting the caskets of glaring and mercenary show by fixing on humble and unpromising lead this justifies the seemingly odd design of portias father who it appears meant by the proposed choice to get her a husband of solid understanding the courtship of gratiano and nerissa is somewhat odd portias prejudice in favor of bassanio arises naturally enough from previous knowledge of him but for the other couple to make so sudden a matrimonial contract strains the bounds of probability and for gratiano who moves in the sphere of a gentleman so instantaneously to pick up a waiting woman for his wife is rather a precipitate and unaccountable piece of matchmaking however a double wedding is fixed on to the satisfaction of all parties  the introduction of lorenzo and jessica before they could be ascertained of bassanios authority to entertain them is rather exceptionable however the letter brought from antonio acquainting his friend with the state of bankruptcy he is reduced to gives a fine turn to affairs bassanios method of unfolding the lamentable case to portia is pathetically delicate and her desire of paying the bond even twenty times over to avoid the fatal penalty amiably generous as is also dispatching her destined husband for the rescue of his friend even before marriage rites are celebrated  the ensuing scene where antonio sollicits shylock has nothing more in it than a confirmation of the jews unrelenting determination to abide by his bond we are certain our author might have very much improved both characters in this interview had extending them occurred to his imagination characters of importance should never be brought on for trifling purposes  the scene where portia gives charge of her house and family to lorenzo that she and nerissa may go to a monastery during her husbands absence is prettily devised to keep the intended metamorphose secret and at the same time to apologize for her absence the intimation she drops to her confidante of assuming masculine appearances awakens curiosity in an audience and at the same time leaves that curiosity in suspense there is an indelicate insinuation at the beginning of portias speech when she mentions the change of habit which we wish was omitted by the last line of this scene it appears that twenty miles will carry them to venice yet upon bassanios setting out for belmont we hear of his embarking on ship board this seems one of the inconsistencies our author was very apt to slip into  launcelots witticisms with jessica are in a strain of drollery but his allusion to scylla and charybdis is rather too classical for such a character and his very impertinent behavior is hardly justifiable in a servant the circumstance mentioned by lorenzo relative to his amor with a moorish woman has no wit or humor to apologize for mentioning the matter before jessica  on shylocks being introduced to the court of judicature to which he has applied for the penalty of his bond the duke pathetically interposes in the merchants favor to which the israelite replies with all the shrewdness of determined cruelty urging his antipathy as a sufficient reason for casting aside every humane principle persuasion only seems to invigorate his hellish resolution which not even the offer of enormous pecuniary advantage can alter when matters are at this crisis the appearance of portia as a lawyer recommended by doctor bellario brings on the trial however portia previously gives a most nervous and beautiful recommendation of mercy which is so worthy the approbation and recollection of every individual that we should be blameable in not quoting of it  the quality of mercy is not strained it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blessed it blesses him that gives and him that takes it is mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown his scepter shows the force of tempral power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein does sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptred sway it is enthroned in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power does then show likest gods when mercy seasons justice  therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation  we do pray for mercy and that same prayer does teach us all to render the deeds of mercy however we may admire the expression and benevolent tendency of this speech yet an obvious objection lies against the passage marked by italics which as it evidently refers to the lordss prayer ought not to be even hinted at where a jew was in question as it would rather work an irritative than lenitive effect  shylocks servile and rapturous adoration of the supposed lawyer for sustaining the solidity of the bond is inimitably expressed by exclamations and the cause works up against antonio to a very pathetic crisis when a very natural and most agreeable turn of portias defeats the jews bloodthirsty hopes frees the merchant and gives general joy there is not any incident in any drama which strikes so sudden and so powerful an effect the retorts of gratiano are admirably pleasant and the wretched state to which shylock is in his turn reduced is so agreeable a sacrifice to justice that it conveys inexpressible satisfaction to every feeling mind the lenity of antonio is judiciously opposed to the malevolence of his inexorable persecutor  upon the jews leaving court gratiano speaks thus to him in christening thou shall have two godfathers had i been judge thou should have had ten more to bring thee to the gallows not the font in this speech our author has made a very censurable slip by furnishing gratiano who is a venetian with an observation that refers to the english mode of trial by jury which the words quoted certainly imply  what follows to the end of this act is only a stratagem of the ladies to get those rings from their husbands which they had made them swear not to part with hence arises some matter to eke forward a piece which should undoubtedly have ended with the trial as no event of equal force could follow the merchants acquittal  at the beginning of the fifth act lorenzo and jessica in a strain of tender dalliance play upon the idea of a serene moonlight night very agreeably till they are interrupted by a messenger signifying portias return and lancelot roaring out in simple ecstacy his masters approach lorenzo however willing to enjoy the beauty of the night indulges fanciful speculation in the following elegant strain how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank here will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony sit jessica look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with pattens of bright gold there is not the smallest orb which thou beholdst but in his motion like an angel sings still choiring to the young eyed cherubims such harmony is in immortal souls but whilst this muddy vesture of decay does close us in we cannot hear it   what follows upon jessicas remark that music does not make her cheerful we venture also to give our readers as the subject of general approbation among the tasteful admirers of poetical excursions  the reason is your spirits are attentive for do but note a wild and wanton herd or race of youthful and unhandled colts fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud if they perchance but hear a trumpet sound or any air of music touch their ears you shall perceive them make a mutual stand their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze by the sweet power of music thus the poet did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods since naught so stockish hard and full of rage but music for a time does change its nature the man that has no music in himself and is not moved with concord of sweet sounds is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils the motions of his spirit are dull as night and his affections dark as erebus let no such man be trusted though the lines in italics have been often quoted and received as conveying an irrefragable maxim we must contend that there is considerably more fancy than truth in them as experience sufficiently proves from a multitude of instances of bad ears being annexed to good hearts let it suffice to say that one of the greatest writers one of the deepest scholars one of the most moral and peaceable men of the present age has so little relish for music that being carried to hear alexanders feast as set by handel he shook his head and said the performance only convinced him that insipid jingling sounds might spoil the best written piece in the world from hence we may deem shakespeares compliment to harmony rather partially enthusiastic were it really the case we have no reason to fear any thing from our political commotions while music is so much admired as to join processions attend dinners etc nor can a libel if sung have any treasonable effect never was britain more musically inclined than at present therefore consequently free from all apprehensions of stratagems and spoils  upon portias entrance she sees a light burning in her own hall which by a stretch of propriety she assimilates to a good deed in a bad world had the candles beams been enveloped with a deep nightly gloom the allusion might have been allowable but when the moon has such power as description gives it in this scene the tapers light must have been very dim and imperfect  keeping the characters so long out of doors when they might as well have been housed is a wanton breach of probability however there they are and we must enjoy the moonshine with them after some very short congratulations a quarrel starts up between gratiano and nerissa concerning the ring which she obtained from him as the lawyers clerk  there is an abominable expression in the third line of gratianos first speech on this matter  this dispute catching portias ear she justifies nerissas resentment which occasions gratiano to rap off that bassanio gave his ring away here fresh and very entertaining perplexity arises from well assumed jealousy on the part of the women and the arch cause they give for real jealousy to their husbands the discovery of who really got the rings and the characters the ladies assumed brings the piece to a very natural pleasant and satisfactory conclusion  this play breaks in upon the unities of time and place materially however the plot is not very irregular and the scenes fall into a tolerable arrangement we must consider the fifth act but as a kind of aftergame though agreeably supported and repeat our wish that shylocks defeat with a discovery of the ladies in court had formed the catastrophe  though we cannot trace a general moral yet from many passages useful instructive inferences may be drawn particularly the choice of the caskets which shows that humility and judgment obtain meritoriously what ostentation and vanity lose from the jews fate may be learned that persevering cruelty is very capable of drawing ruin on itself  in those scenes where sentiments and expressions of dignity are requisite we find them amply provided in less material passages both are trifling  shylock whose peculiarity of character and language we have hinted is a most disgraceful picture of human nature he is drawn what we think man never was all shade not a gleam of light subtle selfish fawning irrascible and tyrannic as he is like no dramatic personage but himself the mode of representation should be particular as to figure and features any person and countenance by dress and other assistance may be made suitable however there is no doubt but mr macklin looks the part as much better than any other person as he plays it in the level scenes his voice is most happily suited to that sententious gloominess of expression the author intended which with a sullen solemnity of deportment marks the character strongly in his malevolence there is a forcible and terrifying ferocity in the third act scene where alternate passions reign he breaks the tones of utterance and varies his countenance admirably in the dumb action of the trial scene he is amazingly descriptive and through the whole displays such unequalled merit as justly entitles him to that very comprehensive though concise compliment paid him many years ago this is the jew that shakespeare drew  we remember to have seen mr sheridan in this part with great pleasure he seemed to have a very happy conception yet fell somewhat short in the executive part through the first scene we deem him quite equal to mr macklin and in that speech where the jew tells antonio of the abuse he has vented on him we must allow him some little superiority but in the third and fourth acts comparison must show him to disadvantage  however we admire mr king in a great variety of his undertakings we cannot so far warp opinion as to think him capital in the jew weight design and extent of powers are wanting the cruelty does not sit easy on his features nor the violent passions on his voice which though agreeably distinct and happily voluble in comic dialogue cannot trace nature through any violent transitions to this we may attribute his estrangement from the tragic walk had he utterance equal to his judgment easy figure and marking countenance he would be as conspicuous a favorite with the queen of tears as he now most justly is with the queen of smiles after all his shylock is by no means so deficient as many principal parts which might be pointed out at both houses  mr yates to the disgrace of propriety and the utter disgust of critical taste apologized for this part at drury lane for several years and as a high feast has entertained his particular friends with it lately at covent garden it is laughable enough to see how on benefit nights performers thrust themselves into the most ridiculous undertakings as if it was the best way of showing gratitude to obtrude their own deficiencies on those persons who immediately come for their emolument there are many parts in which mr yates claims much respect scarce one in which he could be more contemptible than shylock a quaint snip snap mode of expression enervates the authors meaning a dissonant harshness of tone mars every line and a total barrenness of power causes insipidity to flag every scene if he does conceive the authors meaning as we doubt not he may his performance leaves it an unrevealed secret to the audience  may this gentleman never mutilate a line of blank verse again  mr sparks and mr berry both figured the merchant well but wanted that smooth elegant placidity with which the character is drawn the latter was drowsy the former industrious to make something of the part which he could never hit off we have heard of barrys doing the part in dublin and form a very favorable idea of him as we also do of mr rosss capabalities but of all who have come immediately under our notice we must considerably prefer mr reddish though justice directs us to allow mr clarke a commendable share of merit also  bassanio in our opinion has not for several years been happily disposed of mess ryan and havard canted him very much in the old style and were not at all adequate in external appearance mr bensley at present wants greatly that mellow flow of expression which several of the beautiful passages that occur in this part require in the trial scene he wants as well as the gentlemen above named did that pathetic expression of voice and countenance which tender friendship so deeply wounded claims indeed it is very common for the performers during this awful transaction to be wholly inattentive except when speaking which is a most unpardonable fault as every word that passes should be reechod by the features of persons so materially interested  mr cautherly  why do we meet with this misapplied young man staggering under the weight of shakespeares pregnant sentiments and nervous lines if there is any respect due for the public any pity left for him we request that his inadequate parroted abilities may never be incumbered with any thing more important than a mere walking gentleman his vacant look and unvarying delivery of bassanios reflections are a flat contraction to the tenor of them we have seen him much better performed in the country and never worse any where  gratiano is a sportful blade who received great spirit from the animated and characteristic performance of the late mr palmer mess dyer and dodd who considering difference of age manifest a very similar degree of merit preserve the whim of this part agreeably enough but to do him strict justice he should be in the much abler hands of mr king  lancelot another child of laughter was represented with extreme pleasant propriety by mr woodward why he should grow too great to do it at present we know not the archness and simplicity requisite were blended by him judiciously mr shuter as in many other things touches the risible faculties with his humourpregnant face but moved upon no principles except those of mere mummery so much himself that he very seldom can be any thing else  mr william palmer of drury lane theater who fortunately possesses the naivete of low comedy exhibits this quibbling simpleton with extreme pleasant propriety and in appearance justifies his complaint of having ribs easily felt from shortness of commons while comical ned of covent garden contradicts that observation by very evident externals of good cheer  old gobbo has no claim upon mr parsons for any deficiency we dont recollect any other person worth notice  portia has fallen to the lot of several capital ladies and indeed she not only requires but merits the exertion of eminent abilities mrs woffington whose deportment in a male character was so free and elegant whose figure was so proportionate and delicate notwithstanding a voice unfavourable for declamation must in our opinion stand foremost her first scene was supported with an uncommon degree of spirited archness her behavior during bassanios choice of the caskets conveyed a strong picture of unstudied anxiety the trial scene she sustained with amiable dignity the speech upon mercy she marked as well as any body else and in the fifth act she carried on the sham quarrel in a very laughable manner to sum up all while in petticoats she showed the woman of solid sense and real fashion when in breeches the man of education judgment and gentility  mrs abington treads so much in her steps and has so many of the happy requisites just mentioned that we make no scruple of placing her second upon the whole nay in some particular places we think her equal  miss macklin undoubtedly speaks the part in an unexceptionable manner but we deem her rather too petit in person and expression mrs clive who obtained no small share of applause was a ludicrous burlesque on the character every feature and limb contrasted the idea shakespeare gives us of portia in the spirited scene she was clumsy and spoke them in the same strain of chambermaid delicacy she did lappet or flippanta in the grave part  sure never was such a female put into breeches before  she was aukwardly dissonant and as if conscious she could not get through without the aid of trick flew to the pitiful resource of taking off the peculiarity of some judge or noted lawyer from which wise stroke she created laughter in a scene where the deepest attention should be preserved till gratianos retorts upon the jew work a contrary effect  mrs yates with an amazing degree of condescension has lately vouchsafed to perform portia for that night only  that night only the phrase is so modest that we repeat it  if she can do the part better than any body else the public in general and the managers in particular have a right to expect her in it whenever the play is done if she is not so capable as the person in possession of it why should she impose upon her friends even for one night this is one out of many low theatrical finesses thrown out as baits to catch gudgeons however if this lady thinks criticism has any cause to languish for a repetition of her portia she is utterly mistaken since it is certain that deducting her great name and some merit in the fourth act she has shown nothing more than that capital talents may occasionally dwindle into very middling execution  nerissa as a mere foil to portia is of so little consequence that we shall only mention the horrid impropriety of managerical conduct at covent garden to push on mrs vincent for her a lady so much advanced in years and who in the bloom of life was but very ill calculated for representing any thing in boys clothes  shame where is thy blush   from a critical retrospect we may assert that our author has not only well chosen but also well supported the several characters in this piece that the incidents are affecting many of the sentiments sublime and the versification worthy of shakespeare some of the prose dialogue sinks into the word catching so fashionable in his day and which according to our apprehension he meant to ridicule there is an alteration of this play called the jew of venice by lord landsdown who has taken pains to preserve regularity yet in so doing like other alterers has greatly enervated the piece he meant to improve our author has as few superfluities or censurable passages in his merchant of venice as any piece he ever wrote and if it is not among the most powerful efforts of his genius it certainly yelds precedence to very few either in the study or theater  the commissary a comedy by mr foot criticisms upon authors or performers who have paid the debt of nature are apt to be considered by many persons as the effect of prejudice good naturedly weak or enviously severe those upon living persons of either character are generally supposed as the offspring of interested views personal attachment or partial antipathy however as we have heitherto endeavored and we hope successfully to hold the balance with an unbiassed hand as we disclaim all connections with or personal influence from the pieces or actors considered as we have indiscriminately praised the same authors and performers in one place whom we have censured in another it is ardently hoped we shall stand through our whole undertaking unimpeached with servile flattery or illiberal censure and that what we offer will be received as real though often perhaps very fallible opinion we have already shared the common fate of all similar productions that is being deemed too mild by some too tart by others as it is impossible to please all we shall still steer a steady medium course and prove ourselves strict friends of the drama though some of its sons and proselytes should look upon us with indignant eyes  if to laugh vice and folly out of countenance is a more certain as well as more pleasant method of reforming national conduct into prudence and virtue than dry declamation or browbeating authority if to shoot folly as it flies and to catch living manners be the grand taste of merit in comic writings we must examine how far the gentleman now before us has in the piece we are going to consider answered those valuable purposes  some persons of low extraction low capacities for any thing but gain low fortunes and lower principles having accumulated princely fortunes by plunder from their bleeding country and those hardy sons of war who were fighting for the common liberties of europe became so extravagantly vain of their sudden ill gotten pelf that they wanted to shine forth what nature never designed them for and art could not make them accomplished gentlemen one particularly though in the vale of years aimed as ignorantly at cutting a figure in the gay and great world unbounded riches secure such reptiles from legal punishment who then can be fitter game for dramatic satire to hunt with her keen lash through the mazes of ridicule  availing himself most happily of such a luxuriant subject the author of the commissary has titled his piece from the very station in which some of the rapacious bloodsuckers moved and lays the scene of it in the house of a lady mrs mechlin for whom if we are rightly informed there is an infamous living original her handmaid jenny remarks upon loud knocking at the door that the commissarys lodging in their house occasions business enough for a porter upon her letting in simon who enquires for her mistress a conversation ensues by which we learn that the good gentlewoman of the house has summoned him in an earnest manner being as appears a practiced and useful agent for her underhand iniquitous purposes upon expressing himself rather disagreeably the maid gives a warm rhapsodical account of her mistresss character and consequence which he adds spirits to by timely interruptions of a sneering ironical nature at length when she has run herself out of both words and wind he in the selfsame manner reverses the picture she has drawn while she supports the force and vivacity of his description as he did hers this is a very pleasing pit pat and judicious manner of revealing mrs mechlins or any other character infinitely beyond the dull narrative mode adopted by many dramatic writers  simons striking portrait enflames jenny who on hearing her mistress at the door puts him into an apprehension that she will reveal his sentiments however she gives the matter a whimsical turn and brings him off  nothing can be more naturally characteristic than mrs mechlins importance displayed in weariness and fretful breaks the coachman is also furnished with expressions highly suitable and though the craving extortionate disposition of such fellows may be deemed a trifling it is yet a just object of exposition and is here placed in a very laughable point of view  what ensues when mrs mechlin enquires if any body has called upon her may be called the scorpions sting of well merited satire darted at those in the great world who bestow through such vile agents even church preferments upon those who will flatter or help to conceal their vices by marrying a cast off mistress or making any sordid concession an honest mind must necessarily start at though wrapped in a rusty cassoc and the impoverished drudge of a penurious cumberland curacy  the stroke of a pearl necklace belonging to a lady who is gone to mrs cornelyss is an exquisite remembrance to many of the fair sex who lavish health beauty and fortune not only in soho square but in many other places of polite resort which reduce them often to the shameful resource of pawning not only their movables for a little present supply but also their honors for the indulgence of a little credit from fortunate antagonists  upon jennys going out her mistress is entering upon the communication of an important concern but is interrupted by the appearance of widow loveit this amorous elderly lady comes as we find upon a matrimonial errand to provide herself with a comfortable husband by the kind able assistance of her matchmaking friend mrs mechlin the folly of age and especially in the female sex hunting after a matrimonial connection with youth is very humorously set forth in this scene pretended grief for one husband attended by warm wishes for another is poignant satire against hypocritical sorrow and we know not any passage of equal length which contains more useful meaning than the following remark i wonder they dont add a clause to the act to prevent the old from marrying clandestinely as well as the young i am sure there are as many unsuitable matches at this time of life as the other  after the widows departure mrs mechlin opens the commissarys character circumstances and peculiarities to simon whom she engages in a design she has formed of uniting her opulent lodger to a niece of her own who has been debauched by a musician the part she assigns him to appear in is a domestic of miss dollys under the character of a scots earls daughter part of his instructions she refers to another opportunity and in soliloquy reflects upon the precariousness of her own business which occasions her to drop severe though oblique hints against some dissolute persons of fashion  upon dolly mechlins appearance the provident aunt urges her to sign a conditional bond in return for helping her to so advantageous a marriage the nieces hesitation upon this matter enflames her so much that she enters into a warm recapitulation of the favors she has conferred and stigmatizes the character of dr catgut with just severity this intimidates the young woman to compliance the approach of isaac fungus brother to the commissary breaks off their conference  this rough citizen having met with nobody but a frenchman who cannot speak english to give him an answer vents his rage upon the alarmed valet upon mrs mechlins appearance he complains of the unintelligible domestic and in cynical terms throws out a very commendable sarcasm against those who are so fond of exotic reptiles  isaac being dispatched upstairs to her brother paduasoy a silk mercer is introduced to mrs mechlin from what passes between them we derive a pleasing and useful exposition of tricks which are often played upon the credulous admirers of foreign manufactures mrs mechlins device of having some old silks seized at her house as contraband that by being publicly burnt they may serve as a kind of advertisement where such goods can be had is excellent such impositions are a glaring mark of fashionable folly and if there must be such a prevalent weakness we entirely agree with mrs mechlin that persons of her sort who sell goods of home fabrication under foreign titles deserve a premium rather than censure  the two brothers and mrs mechlin begin the second act when the commissary teeming with ideas of gentility rates the more rational cit in a ludicrous style and by having the lady of his party whose business it is to flatter his peculiarities he humourously triumphs in his supposed advantage of taste and judgment the extreme folly of a man advanced in years putting himself under tuition for those accomplishments which only appertain to youth is here exposed with infinite pleasantry the dissertation upon fencing the supposed quarrel the confusion of wilkins hopkins and jenkins as names of the person quarrelled with isaacs interruptions and at last fencing with mrs mechlin who proves too many for him are passages of as much humor as can well be imagined indeed their effect in action prove it  the transition to zac funguss marriage is a variation of merit and his account of the ladys pedigree makes a strong satirical appeal to risible faculties the latter part of this scene is sustained with great spirit and throws out some excellent hints of the wretched dependency a person of inferior rank must reduce himself to who ridiculously marries a woman merely for the pride of blood  the introduction of mr gruel a master of oratory gives a fresh turn to conversation and sets the commissarys whimsical weakness in a diverting point of view it is impossible not to feel strongly the account he gives of those means by which we speak and of the distinctions between a small mouth and a large one illustrated by whistling and bawling  gruels pedantic methodical mode of expression is a keen reproach to those who undertake to teach others what they are not capable of themselves and the oration which fungus delivers as a specimen of his abilities is a truly laughable piece of circumlocution mention of his ridingmaster being in waiting carries off this oratorical pupil who apologizes for his abrupt departure by observing that his desire to be a finished gentleman as soon as possible puts it out of his power to stick long to any one thing  gruels teizing mrs mechlin with an explanation of female eloquence confirms his character as a formal opinionated coxcomb  some persons have thought that too great contempt is thrown by our author upon oratory but we can by no means find out any design of that nature the art of speaking in public is certainly deserving of high estimation and it is to be wished it was more happily cultivated but enthusiasm upon every occasion merits ridicule if sanguine or interested professors pretend to make orators of persons who have neither conception nor expression for the purpose if in general they only teach people to expose their follies by rule certainly such instructors deserve to be stigmatized as knaves or fools and their deluded pupils become fit objects for laughter  dr catguts scene with mrs mechlin paints in strong colors the absurdities of a man whose genius will be long admired but whose conduct has much obscured it with a cloud of indiscretions to give them no worse a title his declining the profession in which the public has allowed him peculiar merit to commence poet for which character he has not the smallest capability is well hit off and the two stanzas introduced are an excellent burlesque upon the insignificant nambypamby style of modern songwriting so much admired when equipped with a tune at the latter end of this scene we find the doctor meditating a cheat on his good acquaintance mrs mechlin under the semblance of friendship  the third act opens with harpy a lawyer young loveit the widows son and jenny it appears that the honest attorney knowing mrs mechlins abilities to find provision and employment for both sexes has brought loveit for her assistance which she promises and immediately points out the means a rich widow of sixty who wants a husband this proposition proving agreeable to all the young adventurer and harpy go off to make room for the commissary and his ridingmaster who now advance upon us  fungus full of his matrimonial transaction and no doubt to give mr bridoun a more exalted idea of his approaching consequence questions mrs mechlin in a whimsical manner about his intended bride whom he touches up with ladyship in every short sentence having promised to improve his dress after a short lesson he and mr bridoun proceed to business  his ambition of riding a longtaild horse in hyde park or in clouds of summerdust on the kings road his asking if the carpenters have brought home his new horse his suggestion of naturalborn gentlemen and the introduction of his palfrey are a fund of satiric drollery his preparation for mounting taking his position and falling off are extravagantly laughable it has been objected by some overnice critics that this scene is too pantomimical for comedy but we think not if every man as tristram shandy observes has his natural hobbyhorse why should a woodenheaded commissary be denied his artificial one besides the whim is not at all inconsistent with other parts of the character which keep within the bounds of probability  mrs mechlins announcing the approach of lady sacharissa terminates this scene and makes room for the amorous widow who comes to know how her matrimonial expectations are likely to succeed when she receives intelligence much to her satisfaction this short interview is not without considerable pleasantry  dolly as lady sacharissa and jenny the maid have a short teteatete previous to funguss entrance in which the latter solicits employment as servant to the former when married but is refused on account of their knowing each other too well this repulse suggests a resentment which jenny hints just as the commissary appears new rigged  the following scene of courtship is excellently wrought up the ladys caledonian precision funguss awkward servility his studied address and the artful conduct of mrs mechlin all cooperate like lights and shades in painting to render the picture expressive and pleasing when our commissarys grand nuptial concern is settled young loveit comes according to appointment and prepares to encounter his gilded unknown bride  but lo to dash their mutual hopes his mother steps forward he sustains the shock with some pleasantry but the old lady dissolves into tears a circumstance which surprises mrs mechlin and occasions some confusion till the matchmaking lady promises to settle matters some other way for this purpose when fungus and dolly appear she attributes mrs loveits agitation of spirits to the ill behavior of her son  matters being brought now to the grand crisis unluckily both for mrs mechlin and her neice dr catgut comes in abruptly accosts his intimate acquaintance dolly with great freedom at which fungus naturally pricks up his ears but with great confidence still asserts his ladys nobility of blood and richness of pedigree till the doctors perseverance and his brother isaacs appearance more awaken him and necessitate mrs mechlin to acknowledge the imposture which she does with more assurance having zachary bound in a penal obligation to consummate the proposed marriage this occasions him to make a sharp reflection upon her harpylike disposition which she answers with a satirical stroke of great keenness and general tendency intimating  we wish the rhimes had been omitted  that she only preys on the follies of mankind while the commissary tribe devour the vitals of a whole nation with unrelenting rapacity  aristotle himself could not have desired a stricter preservation of time and place than is maintained in this comedy the plot is regular and the scenes intermingled well but we think there is a lapse of poetical justice at the catastrophe in suffering such a woman as mrs mechlin to go off triumphant though at the expense of a fool isaac fungus might have been furnished with some discovery relative to her that might have given him an opportunity of retaliation we think also that making the commissary himself renounce his childish pursuits would have sustained the part better at last and shown a conclusive effect from the dilemma he has escaped and the penalty he has brought himself under  we do not remember to have perused or heard any dramatic author whose dialogue shows a greater degree of spontaneous entertaining spirit than mr footes if it is not enriched with absolute wit there are nevertheless many peculiar emanations of sentiments and much pregnancy of expression his characters are always alive his incidents nouvelle his satire poignant and all his scenes free from that languor which most writers occasionally fall into his personages at least the striking ones are all drawn from life and with such a happy degree of execution that they are not more generally seen than known and this we are bold to affirm is the true way to make the stage a salutary school of manners  zachary fungus and his brother are most excellently contrasted the one a dupe to extravagant notions of gay life the other pent up in the narrow compass of mechanical ideas the former a coxcomical fool the latter a rational though unpolished trader  mr footes performers being as transient as swallows who appear only in summer and almost every year change their station we cannot pretend to enquire into the merit of any but those most known  the author of this piece has not a greater flow of imagination in writing than he has of force and rapidity in representation as no man can compose so no performer can act in his style except by very faint and inadequate imitation his features and utterance are equally well calculated to tickle the livelier sportive feelings which is evident from the laughable effect he works upon numbers of spectators who frequently cannot comprehend the allusive meaning couched in what he says but admire it as boniface does greek for the facility with which it is spoken  in the commissary he manifests indescribable ease and vivacity literally observing shakespeares rule of suiting the action to the word the word to the action particularly in the riding scene where it is hard to say which excels most his gesture his looks or his utterance in short though chiefly confined to his own productions at present we will venture to assert that if natural disposition had not bent this gentleman to write in a peculiar manner and to support that peculiarity by his own performance he would have done many characters much more justice than they have met from other hands as it is both as author and actor he may justly cry out with richard though upon a far more comfortable principle  i am myself alone  isaac fungus it is true requires no very material talents in representation however mr sowdon deserves praise for supporting him in a characteristic manner and of this gentleman we must add that when in drury lane theater as well as on the dublin stage he sustained many characters of capital importanee much better than the present possessors of them do in any of the houses  mr shuter played the old widow with singular humor and mr sparks was not much amiss in the representation of her mr parsons was much better in doctor catgut than probably we shall see again though as to the sick monkeyface mr summers looked it inimitably  mr weston is so well in the coachman that we heartily wish for more of him and mrs gardner hits off the convenient mrs mechlin with talents worthy warm applause this lady is much wanted at drury lane to save several of mrs clives parts from the dreadful mutilation they undergo at present as to all other persons we have seen in this piece they are totally effaced from the table of memory  it would be a point of critical injustice not to say that mr wilkinson who possesses good imitative faculties may give pleasure in the commissary to those who have not seen the original but for our parts we must declare against foot as well as garrick at secondhand  we shall take leave of this comedy with heartily wishing for public good that the authors patent was a winter instead of a summer one the mental gloom for which britons are so remarkable is not materially prevalent in the sunshine as the cloudy season wherefore it would be better if this dramatic electrician was to practice when enthusiasm spleen and suicide most commonly lay baleful siege to the human spirits and understanding  venice preserved a tragedy by mr otway otway has been deservedly distinguished as a tragic writer by the epithet tender indeed his two living pieces the orphan and that we are now entering upon never fail to call a melting tribute from the heart evidenced by tearfilled eyes yet we may justly compare them to a couple of females possessed of bewitching features manifesting offensive deformity of shape  among the exceptionable passages and circumstances we must pass previous censure at large upon every scene where aquilina is concerned as superfluously prejudicial to regularity offensive to decency impotently ludicrous and contemptibly absurd as a justification for the author it is said the buffoon senator antonio was introduced to caricature the earl of shaftesbury by order of charles the second a monarch more remarkable for unessential humor and licentious dissipation than moral feelings or solid sense his late majesty we have been informed once ordered the scenes we condemn to be restored in action which is not so much to be wondered at if we consider his very limited knowledge of the english language however the audience exerted their undoubted right to critical authority and snatching them even from royal influence sentenced most justly such vile excressences to oblivion we wish they were omitted in print as well as on the stage  venice preserved opens with priuli a senator upbraiding jaffier as the instrument of disgrace and perplexity to his family by having stolen his daughter the old mans taunts are severe and in some places illiberal jaffiers defense is the real delicate offspring of a modest mind deeply affected his description of the circumstance which engaged belvideras affection is poetically interesting and justifies her stealing into a match with the person who gallantly preserved her life at the hazard of his own priulis unrelenting nature as well as the poverty of his soninlaw are laid open with natural striking propriety from what he says in his last speech of this scene we are apt to pronounce dressing jaffier in rich clothes an impropriety it is not to be supposed that a man who is upon the errand of solicitation for pecuniary assistance should equip himself with splendid garments or if he had done so priuli must naturally have said instead of reduce the glittering trappings of thy wife reduce thy glittering trappings  yet we have often seen the authors meaning reversed  jaffier wearing a superb suit and belvidera equipped with a plain black velvet which is as humble an appearance as any lady can assume on the stage one point we think the author might have availed himself of in this scene which would have prevented the charge of disobedience against belvidera and the abuse of confidence in jaffiers clandestinely marrying her that is to have made it appear priuli had denied his consent to make them mutually happy the fathers carrying his resentment even to the second generation and wishing that a helpless infant may want bread is a shocking and therefore blameable picture of depraved nature he might have been drawn an obstinate without being pictured a savage parent the following line of jaffiers is a gross breach of measure  but i might send her back to you with contumely the account of jaffiers circumstances given by himself in his soliloquy after priulis departure speaks to a feeling heart affectingly pierre at his entrance and in some speeches afterward makes us agreeably acquainted with his own character the dissertation upon villainy and rogues in power are admirable however something further on where mention is made of aquilina pierre sinks much in our esteem therefore the mode of representation by omitting all those passages does our author a piece of justice he should have done himself  there is a great degree of dramatic policy in making pierre unite jaffiers sufferings with those of the public the feelings of poverty are an excellent ground for artifice to work upon an honest mind incumbered with care may be very susceptible of such impressions as in a state of freedom it would effectually resist the picture drawn both of the national and jaffiers private sufferings is very distinct and highly finished the different parts of pierres narrative are finely imagined and powerfully enforced his mention of priuli as having signed the legal authority for plundering jaffiers dwelling falls in well to rouse that unfortunate mans mind into a state of desperation which purpose he more effectually compleats by his introduction of belvidera as the capital figure in that group of distressful images which he has presented to view jaffiers manner of receiving the melancholy tidings his melting only at the sufferings of her he loves recommends his character much and his reluctance to enter upon vindictive measures of a public nature though irritated by private wrongs is commendable however we find that pierre so far touches the masterstring of his heart as to precipitate him into a sympathetic degree of resentment in consequence of which an assignation is made to meet on the rialto at midnight which pierre very improperly calls his evening walk of meditation lonely would we apprehend suit the season much better than evening  after his friends exit jaffier in a short and apt soliloquy descants on his own distressful state justly remarking that sensibility in such a situation must be a source of pain belvideras entrance immediately after the excellent preparation we have just received for her is happily designed she comes upon us in the double view of a most oppressed daughter and unhappy though amiable wife the tender treatment she affords her afflicted husband amidst misfortunes as it stands forth an indisputable test of inviolable affection so it conveys an admirable lesson to the fair sex intimating that she who will not endeavor to smooth the thorny pillow of adversity does not by any means deserve to participate the luxuriant down of prosperity indeed this scene abounds with those soft sensations which our author in every view expresses so beautifully and it closes with a striking assimilation of jaffiers misfortunes to a shipwrecked merchant in which is couched a delicate compliment to his faithful partner yet exclusive of pitiful jingle there never were more indifferent lines than the triplet which carries them off the stage  having disavowed all connection with the scenes of aquilina we shall begin the second act where it commences in representation here we find jaffier on the rialto uttering in soliloquy those gloomy sentiments consequent to his desperate circumstances but his adverting to the old womans notion of satans personally appearing for the work of temptation is ridiculous  the cynical encounter between him and pierre before they know each other is suitable and in a direct compliment to canine fidelity throws an oblique yet cutting and just sarcasm on human hypocrisy pierres contemptuous mention of priests and praying though somewhat founded in truth is censurable religion should not be treated lightly even by a profligate upon the stage but otway unfortunately lived when genius was employed to sneer or laugh every degree of decency out of countenance nor indeed was such depravity of national taste to be wondered at when the court was an absolute fountain of iniquity  pierres enquiry for belvidera and giving his friend some money for present exigence is an artful preparative for his main design though we cannot think the purse so delicately introduced as it should have been indeed jaffiers observation upon it shows that he esteems it as a bribe and for no very amiable purpose pierre however pursues his plan and by mention of priuli again agitates jaffier to the purpose in view who vents his passion in terms very illiberal even allowing for peculiar provocation his readiness to blast with curses almost the whole city is a touch of madness and his insinuation respecting the wives and daughters of senators abominably gross pierres method of explaining his purpose is well conceived in his friends reply to the proposed oath of secrecy there is another line contemptibly low green sickness girls etc and we would prefer a material objection against jaffiers wild declaration that he could kill even an honest senator through the antipathy he has entertained against knavish ones  from some passages in this scene we are led to consider the conspirators as men of sublime characters how far their principles and conduct fulfill the idea we shall discover on a general survey of the piece the place of this conference a public bridge seems though at midnight but ill chosen for the subject which engages their attention a subject of such deep concern as required the most cautious impenetrable secrecy yet from the tenor of their words the characters speak out as if indifferent who heard them  by the book we are told that the next scene lies at the house of aquilina a noted greek courtezan which place of rendezvous we cannot deem very reputable for persons aiming at the glorious characters of heroes and patriots in such a house however renault a capital character in the conspiracy presents himself ruminating in some emphatic lines upon that dangerous and turbulent impulse of the mind  ambition which with great propriety he assimilates to a beautiful elevation of prospect placed on a sandy precarious foundation  from his reply to spinosa we perceive the old gentleman is of a testy disposition indeed so important a transaction should not be dallied with therefore his impatience for the other conspirators is a natural and prudent feeling his reflection upon elliot as an englishman is beneath the tragic muse it serves the purpose of occasioning a little miff which bedamar reconciles this bedamar as the author has drawn him might very well have passed for an untitled knave but that history informs us he was the spanish ambassador who officially fomented the conspiracy with a view to ruin the state of venice wherefore it is strange that our author did not make him a more conspicuous acting personage  the compliments reciprocally paid by the conspirators to each other in the roman titles they appropriate is truly whimsical as to brutus and cassius they may be admitted patrons of liberty but for cataline and cethegus who were notorious sons of faction they seem an odd couple to introduce renaults description of the venetian state is very striking and fully justifies taking violent measures for redress however we can by no means approve the following exultation of pierre which seems the cruel effusion of a mind delighting in mischief  how lovelily the adriatic whore dressed in her flames  will shine  devouring flames such as shall burn her to the watery bottom and hiss in her foundation a man of public spirit must ever enter upon such transactions with reluctance though necessary and lament the inevitable distresses consequent to civil commotions his preparative speeches for the introduction of jaffier are pleasingly expressed and jaffier himself except where he too talks of setting the city in flames shows a considerable share of spirit  his offering belvidera as a pledge of his faith is as strange and uncouth a circumstance as ever we met in the first scene of this act he tells pierre that he has lodged her at the house of a friend it now appears that aquilina is that friend a very ill chosen one for the delicate and modest belvidera who from her own account has been asleep in the house of a courtezan a house too frequented by a number of dissolute persons there is however something so seriously affecting in the sacrifice jaffier makes of tenderness to his new connection such melting matter to steal upon the heart in belvideras expressions that an audience and almost a reader must forgive the palpable breach of propriety we have just pointed out  after the ladys departure little could be said to engage attention wherfore the author has judiciously brought the act to a speedy conclusion but there is great reason to wish that he had not disgraced his genius by exhibiting such a group of strained images in eight or ten bombast lines which contain little poetry and less meaning the last speech carries off the friends laughably we wish something more suitable was substituted  jumping over the jackpudding senator and aquilina who intrude themselves for three bartholomew fair pages upon us in print we commence the third act with belvideras soliloquy which on account of a material objection against some part of it we choose to transcribe  i am sacrificed  i am sold  betrayed to shame inevitable ruin has enclosed me no sooner was i to my bed repaired to weigh and weeping ponder my condition but the old hoary wretch to whose false care my peace and honor was entrusted came like tarquin ghastly with infernal lust o thou roman lucrece thou could find friends to vindicate thy wrong  i never had but one and he is proved false he that should guard my virtue has betrayed it the five lines marked by italics in the foregoing soliloquy are superfluous without any degree of beauty to plead an excuse for inserting them there is no reason to think belvidera would tell herself of the ill usage she has received from renault and as to informing the audience they are much better made acquainted with the circumstance by her necessarily opening the matter afterward to jaffier  upon her husbands appearance she complains very justly of his cold and culpable behavior to which he returns some tender but unsatisfactory expressions belvidera plays every engine of female artifice to wind into the meaning of his mysterious conduct which he resists till she mentions the villainy of her occasional guardian this leads to the discovery we cannot express sufficient abhorrence of the savage entainment he proposes for her in seeing her father and threefourths of the citizens massacred  what idea he must have of his wifes humanity we know not but what follows would disgrace the mouth and feelings of an obdurate scalping indian  nay the throats of the whole senate shall bleed my belvidera he amongst us who spares his father brother or his friend is damned  how rich and beauteous will the face of ruin look when these wide streets run blood i and the glorious partners of my fortune shouting and striding over the prostrate dead still to new waste whilst thou far off in safety smiling shall see the wonders of our daring and when night comes with praise and love receive me we apprehend saying these wide streets is an error as they are in a room during this scene admitting jaffier pointed out of a window to show the seat of action those would be the grammatical term but we should prefer the word our to either however this is a blemish little worth notice where the whole passage is shocking to humanity  a delicate woman to praise and love her husband for playing the assasin even upon her own father to place such a one as a pleased spectatress of outrageous cruelty makes her in idea a rival to roman tullia who after causing the death of an aged sire whirled her chariot triumphantly over his mangled limbs  belvidera very naturally shrinks at what she has heard but in reproving her husband for associating with such an abandoned bloodthirsty crew she descends to some mean unbecoming epithets his paltry because illgrounded panegyric upon the conspirators leads her to a directly full and positive charge against renault which shudders jaffier though we really cannot find the amorous old gentleman so much to blame he received upon very odd terms a woman who had been lodged in a brothel by her husband it was not a very unnatural supposition that a lady so circumstanced might be adapted to his purpose nevertheless upon hearing his attack jaffier who having acted as fool or knave or both now determines to play the madman breaths the spirit of revenge from which belvidera seems to draw some comfort her affectionate departure and repetition of remember twelve please much  when pierre approaches he rallies his friend as being uxorious in the following passage hunt a wife on the dull foil we have often seen it printed and sometimes heard it spoke soil but the change is totally absurd and breaks the allusion which evidently points to the chase that jaffier should reveal to his friend as an object of strict confidence what he has just heard from his wife is probable but that any author should have the assurance to affront an audience with such gross stuff such fulsome description as we find in this short scene is surprising it should be much softened or much curtailed  pierres desire of having the matter rest for sometime is prudent and jaffiers consent to bear the wrong for the present commendably reluctant renaults entrance produces as might well be expected a seriocomic encounter which seems just kindling to a flame when the conspirators entering put a stop to the matter  during renaults charge which is delivered with politic energy jaffier manifests that dislike to his associates and their measures which the invasion of his wifes virtue has created he who a small time since seemed to triumph in a general effusion of blood now calls renault a horrid slave for uttering such sanguinary orders and slinks away from the conclusive meeting in a very strange manner renault who wishes him dead on account of his wife immediately pronounces him an object of suspicion and danger this alarms the generous feelings of pierres friendship who asserts his merit and mentions the circumstance of belvidera much heat ensues general destruction to their scheme and lives seems impending when renaults peevish retreat and a mighty odd concession of the other conspirators restores harmony  pierre shows to considerable advantage in this scene as being a rogue of some principle but the triplet with which he concludes the act is truly lamentable  by what passes in the first scene of the fourth act we perceive that belvidera has influenced jaffier to discover the conspiracy which though a breach of faith she paints and with some justice in a virtuous light for most certain it is that moral and social honesty directs us rather to break than obscure an engagement of evil tendency the anxious suspense of his mind is very natural till removed by the mention of renaults attack upon his wifes virtue her picture of the impending dangers is drawing in striking colors and her persuasion determines jaffier however the author to soften his breach of faith by making it in some measure an act of necessity introduces an officer who takes him prisoner in consequence of an order from the senate by him they are conducted off  the duke and senators in council appear next to whom priuli gives a general intimation of surrounding perils his information comes he says from unknown hands this takes some blame from jaffier also when introduced he addresses himself to the court with that bluntness which a mind agitated like his might well suggest and his contempt of their threats show commendable spirit by the book it appears that he has brought a written list of his friends which we have also seen performers produce on first mentioning the matter this is improper for we cannot suppose that when such an ample discovery is in their view and may be seized by force that the senators would put themselves under the obligation of an oath wherefore jaffier instead of showing a list when he utters these words whose names are here enrolled  should at the word here clap his hand on his breast  by which the senate may be led to think the secret lies beyond their reach except through his voluntary confession  though antonios speeches in this scene are ludicrously impertinent yet they occasion a fine sarcasm upon authority which instead of maintaining impartial justice meanly bends to indulge vicious greatness we mean where the duke orders aquilinas house as she is a senators mistress to be searched with decency  jaffiers compunction for what he has done carries on his character with uniformity upon his being ordered off pierre and the other conspirators appear in custody which cannot proceed from jaffiers information which has been only just delivered in so that though he may be said to confirm their crimination yet he is not the original cause of their ruin pierres address is specious and spirited he wears his chains with an admirable grace and by a kind of popular sophistry turns ignominy into ornament  nothing was ever better imagined for action than confronting the friends pierres cordial undisguised address upon seeing jaffier in custody diminishes the latter greatly he lessens in our view and by the confession of his guilt becomes contemptible while the other rogues by an unbending spirit of perseverance claim some allowance of pity and praise  after the court breaks up jaffier and pierre are judiciously left to a conference wherein we find them contrasted in a masterly manner conscious guilt clothes one with contrite submission deeply provoked resentment warms the other to violent disdain each is sustained with the genius of ability and we are alternately prejudiced in favor of both jaffiers great and tender anxiety for the life of his friend is amiable and pierres generous contempt of an existence under the burden of disgrace is truly noble nor can we deem his passion rigorous when easting aside all jaffiers concessions he swears never to hold friendly intercourse with him again  every spectator or reader who is acquainted with the human mind who can see and forgive the failings of a fellow creature plunged amidst inextricable toils of perplexity must here sympathize in the perturbation of jaffier who is now wrought up to look upon his beloved and loving wife as the great source of his most pungent misery the conflict between love honor and injured friendship rises to the borders of distraction when belvidera appears who conscious of the dagger she has planted in her husbands heart fears to see him yet has no other guardian no shelter but his love that she can fly to in this lamentable state they approach each other when jaffier gives a pitiable relation of the rough treatment the opprobrious terms he has received which draws from belvidera an aggravating account of the sentence passed upon pierre this works upon jaffier in a powerful manner and his passion gathers like those hurricanes which lie sometime embodied in a gloomy cloud before they rush forth with irresistible impetuosity vengeance points a sanguine dagger toward the unhappy belvidera the affectionate husband wishes her away yet resolves upon a sacrifice and even aims the fatal blow till beautifully disarmed by the melting embraces of the woman who apparently rules amidst the utmost turbulence of passion his captivated amorous heart  this turn of the scene has a very pleasing and forcible effect it seldom fails to draw from sensibility tears of joy and deputing belvidera as a mediatrix to intercede with her father for his friends leaves an audience in agreeable suspense at the end of the fourth act  priuli opens the fifth act with reflecting on his own painful situation by his soliloquy it appears that family pride is the foundation of unnatural behavior to his unhappy daughter what the author meant by putting on a veil to obscure belvidera we know not but she approaches her father shrouded in one and addresses him for some time as a suppliant unknown when discovered the sight of her works parental feelings in the old mans breast which she improves by reminding him of the likeness she bears to her mother mention of her husband however calls forth a start of resentment but it soon passes off when she relates the danger her life is in her story is told with great persuasion and operates successfully to the point she has in view priuli relents with unlimited tenderness and promises to save the conspirators there is a pretty tender concession at the close of the scene in the fathers acknowledging his past harshness and promising future protection  aquilina and antonio as to what they say here intervene again very absurdly however something is certainly wanting to prevent jaffiers immediate entrance upon the departure of his wife and fatherinlaw as examination of what follows will plainly evince his soliloquy borders too much upon the bedlamite strain and carries presumptuous horror with it admitting pungent distress capable of such execrations it is a natural extremity which should not be given to the public ear on belvideras approach overjoyed we may presume with what she supposes agreeable tidings jaffier turns from her and immediately mentions that priulis mercy exerted itself too late this is the circumstance which calls for a separation of the first scene from this for if jaffier appears the very instant that priuli goes off the stage how can he know that he has promised to save the conspirators or how is there time for priulis making the trial which according to the following line he has done though unsuccessfully  thy fathers illtimed mercy came too late to remove this inconsistence which we cannot blame the author for as he wrote an intervening scene which gave time for jaffier to be acquainted with the matter we would recommend an alteration of the passage to such gentlemen as hereafter represent the character to the following or similar effect thy fathers mercy should he now relent would come too late  the doom is fixed of all my poor betrayed unhappy friends they are summoned to prepare for fates black hour yet i still live   the shock of this information causes belvidera to court fate even from a husbands hands which she does so much in the melting manner that his distraction softens into sympathetic tears and the scene becomes inexpressibly pathetic especially where he pronounces a blessing on his unhappy wife and she stung with the thoughts of parting parodys it into a curse mention of their tender infant carries grief to its utmost extent and the final separation of this wretched couple engrosses all the tenderest feelings of humanity  belvideras soliloquy we think would be better omitted as it runs into a strain of bombastic madness not properly deducible from or suited to her situation what she speaks also when her father enters is contemptible and truly deserves gays burlesque which though we are not fond of burlesque in general we think deserves notice here murmuring streams soft shades and springing flowers lutes laurels seas of milk and ships of amber are thus laughably ridiculed by kitty carrot in the what do you call it bagpipes in butter flocks in fleecy mountains churns sheephooks seas of milk and honey fountains   we now encounter pierre at the place of execution where as the author has wrote the part he expresses some disrespectful ideas of religious preparation for death these speeches which otway certainly wrote to flatter a licentious age are commendably omitted in representation for there are too many persons ready to slight sacred institutions without the countenance and information of dramatic poets  exclusive of what we thus object to pierres deportment is gallant and praiseworthy jaffier on whom sorrow has impressed her deepest seal to mark him as her own comes to take a final leave of that friend who as he thinks has been wholly brought to infamy and death by his ungrateful breach of confidence the pungent contrition of one character and the generous forgiveness nay tender condescension of the other are most interestingly mingled we wish jaffiers proposition of killing not only his wife but infant also did not occur pierres desire of evading an ignominious death is very natural to a brave man and though as a christian jaffier has no right to take life especially his own we cannot see how a mind so frenzied as his could have acted otherwise however we think our author might have furnished his piece with a better catastrophe as in the proper place shall be pointed out  pierres expiring with a laugh of exultation is peculiar and well imagined jaffier also concludes characteristically with those pathetic sensations of conjugal affection which seem to have effected his ruin  in the next scene belvideras madness is much better supported than where it first seizes her as every expression points at her husband from an invincible antipathy to all embodied ghosts except that most pardonable one of hamlets father we think the appearance of jaffier and his friend would have been more justifiable as the effect of imagination than rising through trapdoors with whitened faces and bloody shirts those childish finesses of the stage belvideras dying so suddenly of distraction which is rather flighty than raging seems an exaggeration of physical consequences however she terminates an object of that pity which through every preceding scene she has so powerfully excited priulis resolution of retiring from the world is natural but his speech and the piece are disgraced by a most miserable concluding couplet  we observed that the catastrophe of this play might have been thrown into a better form though perhaps not with such rigid adherence to poetical justice if we consider that not one character except the duke priuli and the officer is left alive venice preserved must appear a most sanguine production a mere theatrical shambles wherefore it is apprehended that if the author just when jaffier is lifting the dagger had introduced priuli with a pardon for pierre the surprise and change must have been very pleasing to an audience by this the father would have essentially softened his character the affectionate couple would have been made happy and pierre the most pardonable of the conspirators would have been saved to serve the state which evil connections had urged him to destroy the senators also would have been partly relieved from the positive and general charge of perjury which now lies against them for the breach of their conditional oath so solemnly given to jaffier  among fifteen male personages in this play not one moral character appears  what an unfavourable picture of human nature calculated to make us hate not only a part but the whole of our species out of so large a number there are but four of any acting merit those only we shall consider the others being underengines of the plot  jaffier is weak irresolute rash affectionate cruel friendly treacherous an unnatural compound of such contrarieties as never were jumbled in the heart of man yet he is introduced under such circumstances and is furnished with so many fine passages for capital utterance that we know but few parts in which a first rate actor can more deeply engage the attention and applause of an audience  messrs garrick and barry had such an equality of merit in the representation of jaffier that to place either first would rather be partial and to draw a fair parallel requires the nicest equilibre of criticism as they have severally made us feel so we shall present them to the public and hope such great originals may not suffer from our inadequate painting in the first scene mr barrys appearance strikes particularly his externals strongly apologize for belvideras attachment exclusive of gratitude for saving her life when he describes plunging after her into the adriatic there is a scope an expansion of figure which fills the idea conveyed in this passage like a rich conquest in one hand i bore her and with the other dashed those saucy waves which thronged and pressed to rob me of my prize   indeed through the whole first act and the first scene of the second this gentleman could not be surpassed but where belvidera is delivered to the conspirators we must give mr garrick considerable preference for looks most powerfully expressive and piercing notes of expression in the first scene of the third act equality again took place the short subsequent interviews with pierre and renault were manifestly on mr garricks side whose merit has caused us to lament that what the author has written so censurably should be rendered so agreeable in action before the senate and through the following scene we must also place him first from a superior significance of feature to express violent agitation of mind upon belvideras entrance mr barry must be admitted to lead till belvidera tells him of the torments which are preparing for his friends then mr garrick steps forward and beggars description by an amazing variety of transitions tones and picturesque attitudes the distracted confusion which flames in his countenance and the gleams of love which shed momentary softness on the stern glow of rage exhibit more complicated beauties than any other piece of theatrical execution we have seen in the last speech of the fourth act mr barry was peculiarly happy through the whole fifth act we must lean to mr garrick whose peculiar excellence in breaks and half lines is universally acknowledged and of such jaffier is in this act chiefly made up if ghosts must appear we shall acknowledge mr barry the most striking we have seen  mr ryan was deemed very respectable in this character yet exclusive of the last scene of the fourth act where we admit his merit he neither spoke nor looked in our remembrance characteristically  messrs powell and ross were as near a parallel as the two great competitors above mentioned the one deserved praise for tender the other for amorous expression however neither could reach the violent passions of jaffier by many degrees want of power prevented the former and negligence or dullness of feeling the latter  pierre describes himself as a fine gay boldfaced villain and a villain he truly is laboring for the destruction of his native country on the most paltry pretense of provocation no other than being rivalled in a favorite courtezan yet he has the assurance to talk of liberty indeed from the picture otway has drawn of this conspiracy he seems to have had a political view which was to throw an odium on all those who had resisted the first charless measures and those who had spirit enough to complain of his sons proceedings a courtly poet and that otway was such vide his mean sycophantic dedication will ever show popular spirit in an unfavourable light nothing could tend more to this than making the conspirators a set of complete desperate scoundrels as a proof of our suggestion we refer to the epilogue and if such be the tendency of the piece it is unworthy countenance in a free state  when three of the following names are perused it will possibly appear strange that we venture to place mr sheridan foremost in pierre but as we either have or ought to have pronounced his judgment at least upon an equality to that of any performer within our knowledge as in this part his powers operate more happily than in any other of equal fire as in the descriptive the persuasive and the disdainful parts the vindication the reproach and the forgiveness of jaffier he was equally excellent it is but just to give him precedence of those competitors who struck out only a few occasional beauties though perhaps in them particular places superior to him  mr mossop has the capability of excellence but having either an erring or laborious judgment misapplies his talents grossly in the two first acts where open genteel generous freedom is required he toils through a strained insipidity of expression in the third where jaffiers honesty is impeached he totally loses the gentleman and bullies the conspirators like a bravo there is a delicacy even in the rapidity of passion which he seems unacquainted with before the senate and in the subsequent scene with jaffier his natural contemptuous aspect and his uncommon extent of voice operate happily but in the fifth act he forgives his friend with a countenance as if he was going to knock him down  mr barry was a very agreeable but in the critical view indefensible pierre a mellifluous flow of expression and harmonious consonance of features much better suited to jaffier lessened an essential contrast and rather contradicted the idea we have of this bold militarian the eye and ear however were pleased while judgment sat covered with a reluctant frown  mr quin who was by many esteemed a standard of perfection rolled most heavily through the part he recitatived the calmer and bellowed the more spirited scenes in the line i could have hugged the greasy rogues they pleased me his execration of the senate and a few passages in the dying scene he was very fortunate but through all the rest much more like a heavyheaded methodical saturnine pedagogue than what the author meant  mr bensley is as formal though not so important as the last mentioned gentleman and aims much more at lavished applause than critical proprietry forgetting this indisputable truth in public life that he who modestly steals through an arduous undertaking is much more commendable than the person who confidently exposes inadequate abilities and endeavors to pass them current by the stamp of selfsufficiency  mr holland in the character of pierre gave evident marks of the school where he originally studied acting we mean the spoutingclub stiff without dignity and sonorous without meaning totally void of originality mounted and hobbling on the awkward stilts of imitation mr aickin in a modest prologue lately placed himself beneath this gentleman but he need not have paid his abilities so bad a compliment  renault was admirably supported by mr sparks who showed something in the representation of him that we have never seen hit off by any performer but himself in giving the charge in professing sycophantic friendship for jaffier and in the confusion occasioned by pierres reproaches he far outstripped all competition mr burton gets through him without deserving praise yet does not incur censure if the part was about half as long again there would be danger of his setting an audience asleep but as as it is he passes off an inoffensive relief to attention we appehend renault to be more in mr gibsons compass than any other tragedy part whatever  mr havard was as pleasing in priuli as the part would admit nor was mr ridout void of considerable merit mr bannister at present sustains it with ability at drury lane and mr hull should rescue it from less able talents at covent garden  belvidera is an amiable consistent character constant and rational in affection superior to the frowns of poverty yet possessed of quick and delicate sensibility she towers above misfortunes while they affect circumstances only but naturally sinks under an accumulation of unhappy effects wrought by them  mrs cibber and mrs bellamy had each singular merit in this part however the former who had a countenance most exquisitely formed to express anguish and distraction far surpassed her competitor in those scenes where deep and violent feelings occur while the latter from an amorous glow of features and utterance excelled in the passages relative to conjugal affection her description of the madness such as it is was preferable to mrs cibbers because more disengaged  mrs barry treads close on the heels of the two ladies mentioned and if not so strikingly conspicuous in particular places as either she is more equal through the whole than both what her countenance wants of expression she makes up in a considerable superiority of figure being possessed of a more amiable dignity of appearance than any theatrical lady we remember  to sum up our opinion of this tragedy we shall observe that otway seems to have had little else in view than catching the passions at any rate which most certainly he has effected breaches of decorum and delicacy were no objects of his caution he wrote to the heart without properly remembering the head wherefore his plot though tolerably regular will we apprehend from what has been observed appear defective his language is free and his versification flowing but the latter is not always correct nor the former chaste his sentiments are lively and pathetic but in many places strained and in more licentious as to his characters we cannot offer a better general criticism than that of mr addison who writes in one of the spectators as follows  the greatest characters in venice preserved are those of rebels and traitors had the hero of this play discovered the same good qualities in defense of his country that he shows for its ruin and subversion the audience could not enough pity and admire him but as he is now represented we can only say of him what the roman historian says of cataline that his fall would have been glorious si pro patria sic concidisset had he so fallen in the service of his country  the minor a comedy by mr foot the author of this piece has always been allowed a pleasing peculiarity in his dramatic writings they evidently discover that excellent definition of wit a quick conception and an easy delivery the comedy now before us was ushered originally into public view by a prelusive scene between mr foot in his private capacity and two buckish critics of his acquaintance in the first part of their discourse some very sensible and spirited remarks on those objects most proper for ridicule occur we may discover that a charge of too much personality in his satire led the author into this able defense of himself it being also a ticklish point to expose even most egregious and prejudicial enthusiasm on the stage he prepared the audience for what they were to expect and has in the following passage beyond confutation justified his design not only as free from censure but as worthy national countenance and applause  speaking of that burlesque upon religion and common sense methodism he says emphatically this is madness which argument can never cure and should a little wholesome severity be applied persecution would be the immediate cry where then can we have recourse but to the comic muse perhaps the archness and severity of her smile may redress an evil that the laws cannot reach or reason reclaim  sir william wealthy and his brother richard open the first act a difference of opinion relative to education is the subject of their conversation the baronet is lectured with a considerable share of good sense by the merchant for giving his son a fashionable education and he judiciously retorts upon the cit those prejudices which arise from contracted ideas and a defective knowledge of life from the latter part of this scene we find that one is a liberal the other a rigid father that sir william has tenderly laid a scheme for the reformation of his son while richard has discarded a daughter for some trifling trespass  capias the attorneys letter is humorously characteristic and shift who is recommended as a proper agent for sir williams design gives in his conversation with that gentleman a most ludicrous account of his birth parentage and education the picture of his progress through life is in the true hogarth style of dramatic painting and the ludicrous account of his own abilities makes sir william lay open his design for the reformation of his dissipated heir a design commendably laid as severe feelings of those ill consequences which gaming in particular produces are most likely to work a change of conduct in thoughtless youth shifts readiness to enter upon any service for his own emolument and the design expressed in his soliloquy of sticking to the most profitable party fulfill the idea furnished by his name  the minor and one of his gambling friends appear next the former displays elevated notions of fashion elegance and false honor the latter expresses himself happily in a kind of knowing cant the intimation of mrs coles having called is a good preparative for her appearance and some poignant strokes upon her hypocritical connection are thrown out sir william entering as the baron gives a new turn to conversation and shows the son in a fresh view of vicious prodigality that of taking an italian operasinger into keeping upon most extravagant terms which he deems moderate a most excellent stroke of keen satire occurs from the minors observation that he only knows her to be a handsome woman by report against those children of fashionable profusion who expend large sums for unenjoyed surperfluities upon loaders going off to conduct mrs cole the young gentleman lets fall a remark which we apprehend many persons of distinction might justly apply to themselves to say truth i am sincerely sick of my acquaintance but however i have the first people of the kingdom to keep me in countenance death and the dice level all distinctions  never was a better picture drawn of debauched enthusiasm than presents itself in the old bawd whose whole conversation exhibits a natural laughable jumble of affected sanctity and real vice the conscientiousness she boasts in her infamous profession of not tipping sir timothy totter an old trader is admirably suggested and advertising in the registeroffice to decoy young girls into a state of prostitution is well levelled against places where we doubt not most sinister practices have been carried on to the ruin of many an unsuspecting female this scene must afford real entertainment to all ages and considerable instruction to the younger part of an audience upon whom externals frequently make prejudicial impressions what sir george says of the new birth teachers well deserves quotation no wonder these preachers have plenty of proselytes while they have the address so comfortably to blend the hitherto jarring interests of the two worlds  at the commencement of the second act our minor and transfer a money jobber meet for the purpose of raising some cash for sir georges present occasions in this scene the usurer is supported much in character the difficulties he relates of meeting any ready money the expedient he proposes of furnishing some goods are in the true usurious strain the young baronets resentment of such a strange and to him unintelligible proposition is natural and loaders interposition when transfer disappears plainly manifests the bloodsucking gambler who having got a pigeon determines to unfeather him at any rate upon transfers second appearance the precipitation of prodigal youth into any terms that may supply its cravings and the rapacious advantages taken of it by avaricious knaves are set forth in a masterly manner loader also is conspicuous for so readily giving away what is not his own  richard wealthy comes to expostulate with his nephew upon the life he leads and says some very rational things his remark upon what are usually called debts of honor is pregnant with useful truth here is a prostitution of words  honor  sdeath that a rascal who has picked your pocket shall have his crime gilded with the most sacred distinction and his plunder punctually paid while the industrious mechanic who ministers to your very wants shall have his debts delayed and his demand treated as insolent  the minor however deaf to reason treats his uncles advice with levity which occasions the latter to start another topic relative to a proposed marriage with his daughter by the by he calls her an only daughter though we find by the piece he has three lucy whom he has turned out of his house charlotte whom he mentions in the first scene and margery named by sir george in this this however is not a very material slip  the young gentlemans behavior on mention of the march shows the taint he has received of family pride and the conversation is pleasantly conducted till the cit rouses into a commendable feeling of the light treatment he has met and utters some very home truths  the barons behavior on hearing a soapboiler mentioned as sir georges ancestor is in the true style of germanic pride which is idle and impertinent enough to value antiquity of descent more than personal merit by mr loaders assiduity to raise cash we have shift introduced as an auctioneer named smirk from him we collect several strokes of sterling humor his relation of the accident which occasioned him to succeed mr prig is a fund of mirth and his debate about what wig to wear in his public capacity appeals strongly to laughter there is not perhaps a greater degree of imposition than at auctions especially the middle sort and it is to be wished that our author had enlarged more upon the folly of numbers who frequent such places and the knavery of a great majority of such as conduct them however he seems to have aimed at a little more than exposing the coxcombly insignificance of a particular well known person  at the beginning of the third act we find our minor has embarrassed his circumstances most violently however his reflection is interrupted by mrs coles introduction of a young female as a mistress for sir george his first approaches to the lady savor of the rake but upon her pathetic address he indulges her with patient generous humane attention she relates her artless yet affecting tale with such success that she works an intended instrument of her ruin into a kind and disinterested protector this scene not only raises tender sensations but also a curiosity in spectators to know more of lucy than she chooses to discover it gives us most amiable impressions of sir george who appears not to be vicious for want of virtue but for want of reflection and prudence and it stands an incontestible proof that our authors genius though the parent of smiles can produce matter of a serious and important nature with a glow of expression equal to that which clothes the lighter and more spirited parts of his compositions  sir william wealthy and his brother richard now appear signifying that matters are brought to a catastrophe shift acquaints them that the minor has discovered loader and another gamester in the act of fraud upon his words the two worthy disciples of cinque and quatre are driven in with keen reproaches and deep threats sir william is attacked too as the baron by his enraged son and pious mrs cole meets as severe a rebuff in her turn constables being introduced sir william is necessitated to discover himself upon being proved his father the young gentleman acknowledges him with dutiful affection the gamesters through sir williams connection stand convicted and young wealthy acknowledges himself in fault but pleads a strong argument of exculpation or rather reconciliation which on his going off shift explains to render his generous treatment of the young lady more engaging a most beautiful incident strikes us in the discovery of her being mr richard wealthys banished daughter who has been reduced to such a perilous state by her fathers rigidity the cit being convicted of and repentant for unjustifiable behavior consents to make the young couple happy in a matrimonial union thus the piece agreeably slides into a termination upon the strictest principles of moral and poetical justice  the epilogue by shift is an excellent and pleasant burlesque upon the strained rhapsodical figurative mode of expression adopted by the saints of tottenham court and moorfields to supply the place of that reason which nature has denied them or enjoying they suppress for venal impious purposes  the author at present under consideration among many other dramatic excellencies has one not to be found in the writings of many who enjoy a great share of public estimation that is never incumbering his audience with makeshift explanatory scenes all his personages appear to some pleasing and essential purpose those of ten lines speaking as much for the station they are placed in as those who have a hundred or more to repeat there are no forced incidents no labored sentiments but a regular succession of scenes a dependant connection of events a judicious contrast of characters a constant and copious supply of keen satire solid sense social benevolence or pleasant rapartee above all he most successively proves that the pitiful resourse for humor in charless days is totally unnecessary where there is real genius to emanate spontaneously thus much we have thought due to mr foot but as we profess neither to praise nor censure without reason on our side let us examine from the view we have just had of his minor whether he merits such approbation or not  the minor conveys a forcible and extensive moral the two brothers as parents show that a kind patient prudent father is more likely to work salutary effects for his child than a rigid impetuous and positive one from lucys happy deliverance we may learn that persevering virtue can disarm vice and create a protector when least expected by loader we perceive that a time of discovery shame and punishment waits upon the most plausible villainy and mrs cole discovers that hypocrisy is at best a paultry veil which rather hides the wearer from selfperception than from the penetrating glance of reasons eye and that enthusiasm is parent of vice making supposed sanctity an atonement for the breach of every obligation human and divine  young wealthy in point of character is an easy sensible well principled but dissipated gentleman capable of discovering his unworthy attachments but not resolute enough to break through them till stung to the quick by the terrifying frown of impending ruin and an absolute discovery of fraud when this comedy was done at drury lane mr holland represented the minor but was egregiously defective in ease and vivacity we have seen two or three others whose names we forget figure away in it very inadequately mr j aickin last summer seemed to convey the authors meaning with propriety but wanted an essential showiness of person and fell rather short in point of spirit  sir williams acting merit lies entirely in the baron assumed which mr baddely hit off with a very masterly degree of execution if mr castle does not rise up to an equality of merit he yet deserves considerable approbation richard wealthy was never so well as in the hands of mr burton who looked and spoke him very respectably  loader who is the best drawn gamester we know sat easy upon mr davis whose conception and expression as an actor seem best adapted to the characteristic jargon of this part there is a kind of bastard gentility in his deportment and a becoming effrontery of countenance to delineate happily a sixtofour gentleman mr kearny reduced loader last summer to such a prickinthebelt fieldlane sharper that the minor must be considered as a fool to be one moment imposed on by so legible a knave  shift is a part of extreme difficult execution every line of which tells from mr footes unequalled rapidity of expression however mr bannister has great merit in his first scene but when he introduces his happy imitations we are sorry to recollect a passage in the prelusive scene which condemns mimicry of performers in very just terms in the auctioneer there is a most laughable peculiarity struck out by mr foot  transfer is a welldrawn usurer he was well represented by mr blakes much better by mr weston excellently well by mr parsons  mr footes excellence in the transitions and contrast parts of mrs coles character is so well so universally known that we shall not attempt to describe particularly that merit which we cannot find words equal to  lucy though a short character made a most delicate and engaging part of the evenings entertainment when personated by miss pritchard afterward mrs palmer nor does she appear the least languid when represented by mrs jefferies  upon the whole we apprehend it cannot be deemed an error of judgment or partial favor to pronounce this comedy one of the most entertaining original and useful pieces now in possession of the stage  we have seen and with concern the minor lately advertised at drury lane in two acts it is illiberal to farcify the comedy of a living author so distinctly situated as mr foot and we hope the managers will never again countenance such unfair theatrical depredation  king lear a tragedy altered from shakespeare by tate and colman the person who enters upon dramatic alteration without being a slave to his original should nearly as possible confine himself to pruning luxuriances correcting irregularity rationalizing bombast and elucidating obscurity cautious of adding unless where unavoidable gaps are made and connection consequently wanting it is most allowable that shakespeares king lear very much wanted such assistance as we have mentioned  tates opening of the play we apprehend preferable to that adopted by colman for the bastard makes us much better that is much more decently acquainted with his illegitimacy in the soliloquy spoken by him than glosters account the antipathy he bears to edgar as standing before him is also well intimated and lears character is properly opened in the short following scene between gloucester and kent wherein also the former expresses strong resentment against his son edgar and warm attachment to edmund by whose cunning his passion is raised  where lear divides his kingdom upon the childish principle of asking which daughter loves him best colman has preserved that unjustifiable cynical roughness which shakespeare has stamped upon cordelia in the barren churlish answer she gives her father this tate has considerably softened by making her attachment to edgar the cause of such reply we think however that the whole affair might have been thrown into a much better light by making the old monarch divide his kingdom on the marriage of his daughters with those persons he approved cordelias refusing the person of his choice from a secret inclination elsewhere would have rescued him from the extreme folly now chargeable against him and the successful daughters might have made professions equally flattering from a seeming gratitude as they now do from affected duty lears seeing into and declaring a knowledge of cordelias attachment would have furnished strong additional reason for edgars flight the rough honest interposition of kent is a circumstance extremely pleasing in this as well as many other scenes of the play tate has enervated the versification by endeavoring to give it a smoother flow wherefore colman has shown greater judgment and more modesty by only retrenching not altering the original  we can by no means agree with the lastmentioned gentleman that the love episode of edgar and cordelia is superfluous or unaffecting we must rather contend in opposition to the frigidity of criicism that natural and very pleasing sensations are raised by it without any invasion upon the main distress of the piece to enter into a minute defense of this opinion is not consistent with our plan we only advance it for the readers consideration and arbitration appealing to audiences as mr colman in his preface has done from whose feelings we imagine abundant proofs will rise in favor of what we thus take upon us to approve  what goheril and regan say after lears departure is judiciously omitted by tate as their characters are thereby unnecessarily and too soon laid open his introducing the bastard in color of friendship to edgar is also judicious and lets us well into the scope of his design the following scene between gloucester and edmund however he has mutilated abominably by improper omission and pitiful versification the bastards excellent soliloquy he has strangely mangled nevertheless we think without losing any part of the spirit mr colman might have rendered the last sentence of it more delicate  we can by no means conceive why kents first speech when disguised should have been curtailed as to the short preceding scene between goneril and her steward we deem it trifling and unessential as what it relates to needs no such preparative therefore we commend tate for leaving it out but we must immediately after censure his curtailing what the original author so happily penned for kent and the king the introductory passages to gonerils ill treatment of her royal father are much better in shakespeare than in either of the alterations  as a comparative view renders it impracticable to trace the story in the manner we have done in other pieces it will we hope be deemed allowable to remind our readers that after improvidently parting with his all abandoning his only dutiful child and banishing his firmest friend old lear now presents himself before his eldest daughter who on mere pretense of injury behaves with ungrateful insolence here the kings natural impatience is justifiably wrought up even to a bitter and pathetic execration of his undutiful child though tate had considerable merit in his transposition of the last scene of the first act yet we think mr colman has shown more critical knowledge of nature and the stage by restoring some passages which were omitted and by concluding the act with lears curse as nothing could be said after to any effect  at the beginning of the second act we find the bastard with most villainous hypocrisy carrying on his design against edgars life which gloucester credulously comes into this scene is much better in colman than tate as is the following interview where kent so characteristically cathechises gonerils insignificant gentleman usher  the duke of cornwall and his wife regan appear next upon a visit to gloucester whose misfortune in the supposed unnatural behavior of his eldest son they condole and offer their authority to punish the offender regans laying a stress upon his being an associate with her fathers riotous knights as she calls them is a good opening of her intended behavior to the good old king mr colman objects to making the daughters entertain a criminal passion for edmund but if we can once suppose them capable of filial ingratitude all other vices as dr young emphatically has it may seem virtues in them for this reason we approve the intimation tate has furnished regan with of her prejudice in favor of edmund when kent and the gentleman usher appear colman has again judiciously preserved several passages which the laureat strangely slipped over or wretchedly metamorphosed we know not any scene written with more spirit and originality than this kents honest sarcastical bluntness is finely contrasted to the courtly waterflys supple nothingness however decorum is certainly intruded upon for such language to be used in presence of a joint ruler of the state is unpardonable and we heartily agree that kent deserves some punishment but much regret so farcical an incident as a pair of moveable stocks so conveniently placed in a noblemans castle as to be forth coming on the instant kents going to sleep in such a situation is ludicrous also we are amazed when alteration was on foot this incident was not changed for one more probable and equally conducive to the plot especially when such a change might be made with the greatest ease imaginable we have seen the gentleman usher make a very pantomimical stroke by pushing at kent when his legs are fast such a maneuver cannot fail of causing laughter but are such violations of the fine feelings sufferable  in edgars soliloquy as altered by tate we find that he does not fly his enemies as in colman from a paltry fear of the danger which hangs over his person but from a generous laudable motive of waiting an opportunity of serving the woman he loves and who has made so great a sacrifice on his account for this purpose he has resolution to put on the wretchedest appearance and to encounter a situation worse than death this places him in a degree of estimation with the audience which otherwise he could not have obtained  the stocks again present themselves to view merely as an object of inflammation to the old king who being already nettled fires at the treatment his messenger has met and indeed well he may not knowing what personal provocation that messenger had given the appearance of cornwall and regan brings matters to a pathetic and striking explanation shakespeare in this scene has particularly summoned the amazing powers of his genius to exert themselves the transitions of lear are beautiful from passion he falls to condescension and tenderness mingled with grief then flames again while the two unnatural hags as he justly calls them alternately stab a dagger in his aged heart  mr colman by sticking closer to the original than tate has an advantage in this scene but is in our apprehension unpardonable for omitting the following beautiful thought suggested by shakespeare and thus commendably expressed by tate  the wicked when compared with the more wicked seem beautiful and not to be the worst stands in some rank of praise the old mans second condescension in what immediately follows should not have been neglected as humanity therefrom feels a very affecting sensation now goneril thou art innocent again  i will go with thee thy fifty yet does double five and twenty and thou art twice her love   concluding the act with the old kings exit is so obviously right that we are astonished shakespeare should have added so much phlegmatic stuff as he has done  at the beginning of the third act we find unhappy lear shelterless struck with phrenzy wandering through a most tremendous storm over a blasted heath without friend or consolation but what he finds in old faithful kent and the unhinged state of his mind which renders him insensible of external injuries though severe a number of beautiful moral sentiments adorn his distracted ideas particularly where he warns concealed guilt to tremble at elementary threatenings and justly makes his own innocence a shield against fear  as we have inclined to admit edmunds intrigue with goneril and regan so we approve his soliloquy and the complimentary notices he receives from those ladies glosters conference with him concerning a mode of relief for the old king we prefer in tate cordelia is prettily introduced and the sentiments she utters render her extremely amiable so material an object of the plot as she is should not be left long unseen her filial duty is pleasingly displayed and we wish that so meritorious a speech as what follows should have been overlooked by tate when he might have so much improved the acting merit of cordelia by putting it in her mouth it occurs in the first scene of the third act as shakespeare wrote it and displays a most fanciful picture of lears deplorable situation a few verbal alterations would suit it to the purpose we mention and the introduction of it is recommended to any lady who performs cordelia  suppose it run thus oh gloucester i have heard the poor unhappy king contending with the fretful elements bids the wind blow the earth into the sea or swell the curled waters bove the main that things might change or cease tears his white hair which the impetuous blasts with eyeless rage catch in their fury and make nothing of strives in his little world of man to outscorn the to and fro conflicting wind and rain this night wherein the cub drawn bear would couch the lion and the bellypinchd wolf keep their fur dry  unbonneted he runs and bids what will take all   the preceding speech is a poetical gem which most undoubtedly should not be lost especially when it may be preserved with so much propriety the great defect of shakespeares cordelia is that she makes too inconsiderable a figure is too seldom in view and has not matter for a capital actress to display extensive talents in colman has too implicitly maintained this poverty of character and even tates improvement falls short of what might have been every alterer of shakespeare should remember there were no female performers in his days and improve according to the present time such parts as necessity not want of genius or knowledge made him abbreviate  edmunds villainous design upon cordelia fills up but cannot blacken the character of a man who is savage enough to premeditate the death of his own father and the circumstance is well conceived to raise a tender anxiety in an audience for the safety of so dutiful and amiable a princess whose pious affection makes her determine amidst many perils to seek for and cherish that very father who has treated her with such unprovoked severity  lear and kent again offer themselves to view when it appears that an interval of calmness a ray of reason breaks in upon the former who after some very pregnant and affecting remarks upon his own condition and the shocking cause of it  filial ingratitude submits to the persuasion of his trusty follower and consents to take shelter in a hovel their approach to this wretched refuge for distressed royalty calls edgar in his bedlamite garb and expression upon the stage it was a most masterly thought of shakespeare to make the assumed madman cause an instantaneous return of lears frenzy indeed the beautiful distinction he has made between real and affected madness cannot be sufficiently admired in all edgars flights we may plainly perceive a labored diffusion of ideas a methodical strain of images and a studied wildness adverting to no particular leading subject in the execution of this our author has been amazingly successful beyond imagination luxuriant from lear we have not a syllable but directs either to the original cause of his frenzy or collaterally alludes to it among many other matchless beauties which occur in this scene we cannot find words to express our feelings of the kings supposing that nothing could reduce nature to so wretched a state as edgars but unkind daughters consequently that he like himself is an unhappy father that speech which begins a serving man proud of heart we deem inimitable as well as that of lear which follows it  the incident of edgars saving cordelia from the bastards ruffians it not only as we think defensible but worthy of praise as a happy thought and well calculated for action as is the princesss cordial and becoming deportment to her exiled deliverer when he makes himself known this scene ever has and ever will have except upon unfeeling stoical criticism a very engaging effect it enriches and recommends both the characters so much that we must pronounce mr colmans objection to it as the whimsical offspring of judgment too squeamishly chaste especially where in his preface he sneers at cordelias embracing the ragged edgar we are sorry for that gentlemans notions of love and gratitude if he thinks they are confined to externals if the princess through false delicacy had shunned edgar merely on account of his mean attire she must appear unworthy the regard of him or any other worthy man the matter appeals to us in so fair a point of view that we are bold to say if shakespeare that competent and liberal judge of human nature was alive he would consider this addition as an ornament also critics upon the drama should not only have good heads but feeling hearts if either requisite is wanting we should choose to spare the former and try nature at her own bar without aristotelian legislation  we heartily with that the insignificant cruel offensive scene where glosters eyes are put out had been left to narration the subject of it while in action is shocking and cornwalls scuffle with his domestic ludicrous both circumstances would have approached well in description and so the stage would have been saved from very unbecoming transactions however both the alterers through a reverence even for shakespeares blemishes or want of invention have preserved what we thus object to  we are not much pleased with tates first scene of the fourth act where the bastard and regan are produced for no purpose but for her to give him a picture and for him to drop a note he has received from goneril which latter proves a motive of jealousy mr colmans attaching himself to the original and beginning with edgars soliloquy is commendable glosters contrition for the harsh usage of his dutiful son and edgars pious concern for his fathers situation are pleasingly expressed it is astonishing that what follows should be neglected by one alterer and so mangled by the other it is addressed by gloucester to edgar and is the conclusive part of a speech the beginning of which is retained by colman  heavens deal so still let the superfluous and lustdicted man that slaves your ordinance that will not see because he does not feel feel your power quickly so distribution shall undo success and each man have enough tates introduction of cordelia with kent still in search of her father is pleasingly imagined what passes between them and poor dark gloucester deserves approbation and the mention of a popular rising in favor of the old king is well thrown in gonerils succeeding interview with her steward and the duke of albany her husband is much more explicit and satisfactory in colmans than tates it gives likewise more time for edgar to change his frantic habiliments into those of a peasant  in the next scene the description of dover cliff engages and gratifies taste abundantly though making gloucester fancy he has fallen down such a precipice is a bold it is no unnatural stretch of imagination where a mind is agonized like his by a combination of painful and distracting events and wishes to put a period to woe by terminating existence splenetic persons we know by a multitude of instances conceive and credit as great absurdities and why the mere matter of falling on the stage should be laughable we know not of this we are certain that a gloucester otherwise respectable would never occasion even a critical smile but mr colman judges perhaps from some instances at covent garden and if these influenced him he would have been prudent in cutting out threefourths of the part besides as the matter appears in his alteration gloucester stands within a foot of the extreme verge of the cliff yet upon hearing the king whom he knows to be mad he never mentions safer footing nor ever after mentions the resolution of ending his life in such a manner now in the original and tate there is a very good reason for not continuing such a determination supposing himself preferred by a providential interposition he resolves to bear his afflictions with a becoming resignation if this incident was less defensible in point of probability it gives so fine a warning against the worst of crimes suicide and inculcates so useful so moral a lesson of bearing up under temporal affliction that we cannot entertain any doubt of the propriety in retaining it  lears madness is finely though not quite so characteristically supported in this scene as in the third act though women have been the cause of his wretchedness we with what he says of them in the speech that begins in both the alterations behold yon simpering dame had been totally omitted it is indeed considerably softened from shakespeare but as raising fulsome ideas is its only tendency we wish it struck entirely out  the encounter between edgar and gonerils gentleman usher we by no means like it brings an unnecessary death upon the stage the ladys attachment to edmund and murderous designs upon her husband might have been discovered in a much more suitable manner  colmans beginning the fifth act with lear upon his couch is certainly better than making it end the fourth as tate has done however the scene is very much indebted to that gentleman for the merit we find in it nor do we remember one of more affecting nature upon the single feeling of pity mr colman certainly did right to adopt it we deem him also commendable for omitting the short interview between goneril and an attendant where she mentions the design of poisoning her rival sister  by the bastards soliloquy we find him in fresh designs of villainy we do not see why gloucester should be brought in merely for edgar to leave him beneath a tree however tate has given him a respectable speech which colman for what reason we cannot tell has curtailed eighteen lines furnish a better pause for the skirmish that is supposed than seven especially when they are suited to the circumstances  the turn of king lears being defeated is theatrically conceived from this point the alterers go pretty near hand in hand together to the catastrophe wherefore we shall now only trace the following scenes in their succession as tate has ranged them when edgar disguised has given a challenge to his brother edmund we are presented with lear kent and cordelia in prison where a happy stroke occurs in the kings being overpowered at the discovery of kents being his trusty caius though this scene is not very striking it still commands attention  the encounter between the two brothers is very spirited and making edgar the successful instrument of edmunds punishment is a pleasing instance of poetical justice we could have wished the ladies absent for their contention about the bastard is rather laughable this colman has prudently avoided  lear in prison attended by his faithful daughter again calls upon our feelings the attempt to assassinate him alarms human apprehension and the happy effect of his desperation raises a degree of satisfactory astonishment  edgars approach with albany confirms the royal prisoners safety and different events fall in very naturally we must not only give tate great praise for bringing about a happy catastrophe by probable circumstances but in point of justice endeavor to prove that his distribution of the characters is much better than that in the original or that in mr colmans supposed amendment of the alteration  that lear as a rash and rigid father deserves punishment is very obvious this is sufficiently inflicted by his madness therefore saving his life was undoubtedly just gloucester comes under the same predicament of blame for pursuing even the life of an innocent son the ungrateful daughters deserve the rigor of justice and could not fall more properly than by the barbarity of each other and the bastard loses his life most righteously by the hand of his injured brother cordelias piety merits the highest reward of temporal happiness which tate has given her by a connection with the man of her heart the becoming a queen through frances generous behavior as we do not hear of any previous attachment in his favor cannot be deemed so delicate or adequate a compensation for her virtues as bestowing her on edgar who is thereby also recompensed in a peculiar manner for both the love and loyalty he has manifested the old kings consent with glosters and kents hearty blessing shed a brilliance on tates last scene highly pleasing to every good and tender mind it adds great force to the old kings restoration and furnishes to our apprehension as satisfactory and complete a catastrophe as any in the whole scope of dramatic composition  we perfectly join in opinion that lear should speak last but think mr colman might have avoided the trouble of patching up a concluding speech when that we find in tate preceding edgars is sufficient without any alteration or addition it is matter of no little surprise that the solicism of bringing cordelia to view as queen of france without any mention of her royal consort or any attendance equal to her station should not have struck mr colmans critical observation  upon the whole we must remark that in respect of the two alterations tate had no guide but his own judgment which though very fallible in many places has yet operated successfully upon the whole mr colman had his labors as well as the original to work upon and has showed great modesty in avoiding additions considerable merit in restoring so much of shakespeare but has certainly weakened the piece both for action and perusal by rejecting so justifiable pleasing natural and relative an episode as the loves of edgar and cordelia for the credit of shakespeare tate colman and advantage of the stage we wish an able critic mr garrick for instance would undertake a third alteration upon medium principles between the latitude of tate and the circumscription of colman  king lears character as a man we know nothing of except from the concise picture of his being choleric and rash there are no opportunities of displaying either virtues or vices the impetuosity of his temper first makes him a very culpable father and afterward mingled with pride runs him into distraction the unnatural cruelty of his daughters renders him an object of pity and shakespeares irresistible genius has drawn him a character of admiration  to enter upon the representation of this odd and violent old monarch is a daring flight of theatrical resolution a wide and various complication of requisites are essential to placing him in a proper and striking point of view especially an imagination possessed of the same fine frenzy which first drew him into light his situations sentiments and language being peculiar so must his tones looks and gestures be mechanical acting which may pass agreeably enough in other smaller creations of the brain must here flatten idea to a very palling degree  come forth the man whom nature has happily formed to animate with unrivalled excellence this her most favorite theatrical production  garrick come forth fearless of severest criticism we who have singularly and repeatedly felt the most indescribable sensations from this gentlemans performance of king lear are obliged to confess that had he pleased us less we should have been able to say more there is a transcendant degree of merit which checks the boldest flight of praise and here most certainly we have encountered it but the more danger the more honor  therefore we rush fearless amidst an abundance of beauties hoping we shall select with some judgment though satisfaction is bewildered with variety  it must be remembered that lear is a monarch who amidst the infirmities of age has all the pride of royalty about him and consequently aims at supporting external dignity as far as the decline of strength will admit this natural struggle between vanity and debilitation is as happily displayed as possible in the consequential feebleness of mr garricks deportments strength and activity of spirit are by him most judiciously united to nerveless limbs in the sudden starts of passion you perceive the quick flow of blood giving momentary firmness to his sinews which passing off an increase of languor succeeds in his execration of goneril at the end of the first act his face displays such a combination of painful enraged feelings as scarce any countenance but his own could describe though so happily pictured that the dullest mind must conceive and feel  in the second act where he parlies between goneril and regan who alternately reject him rage and tenderness suppressed fury and affectionate condescension are mingled happily till the conclusive speech where his breaks of voice and variation of features surpass the finest conception that has not been impressed by him and leave those who have seen him without words to describe  at the beginning of the third act we plainly perceive the elementary conflict reimaged in his distracted looks while the eyes are also feasted by a succession of expressive striking attitudes but a peculiar beauty is the unparallelled force with which he speaks have his daughters brought him to this pass and many other similar passages which pass almost unnoticed from the mouth of every other lear we have seen in short through the whole of the madness he cuts competition short by most evident superiority through the fifth act especially in the couch and prison scenes his critical judgment and happy powers unitedly exert themselves with equal though not such unparalleled success however where he says pray do not mock me etc to cordelia and did i not fellow after demolishing the ruffians we conceive his merit to reach beyond all expectation after these faint outlines of excellence so strongly felt by the heart and so fully approved by the head permit us reader to prophecy that as no man will ever draw a character of more importance and variety than shakespeares lear so we apprehend no person will ever show a more powerful correct affecting original and chaste piece of acting than mr garricks performance of him has done  mr barry with a commendable degree of ambition entered the lists of competition as we think sixteen or eighteen years ago and met with an extensive share of deserved applause like a plausible showy piece of painting with fine tints and a few masterly touches of the pencil he entirely gratified some judgments and for a while captivated those of more penetration but to carry on the allusion when harmony of parts and strict propriety of expression were minutely sought after the piece lost great part of its effect and sunk in value in short this performer to whom nature was prodigally kind in many requisites wanted what his great competitor eminently possessed we mean original perception his acting especially in lear was too dependent upon instruction and presented itself the offspring of a hundred critical opinions jumbled it was very evident he felt more the ideas of his instructing friends than what the author furnished him to say however it is but justice to allow that he availed himself happily of friendly intimation and was in many parts of the first second and fifth acts truly striking nay through the whole he stood in high respect unless when compared with much more capital merit  we cannot help smiling to hear the sanguine admirers of mr powell for many that excellent young actor had justly gained say that he was near as great as mr garrick one at first would suppose the expression ironical satire but as we believe some had persuaded themselves to believe it really was so it becomes our duty from the most impartial and we hope liberal dissection of merit to say that his deserving sunk amazingly from a critical comparison his deportment was abomible not a trace of majesty in it his transitions in the violent parts wanted essential volubility and most of his attitudes were injudiciously disposed in the tender strokes and feebleness of expression especially those which occur in the first scene of the fifth act he was excellent but if most part of the third and fourth acts had been omitted when he performed the character it would not have diminished satisfaction we allow him more nature but less expression than mr barry but place him far far beneath mr garrick in both  mr ross exhibits his usual and disgustful inequality remarkably in this part one scene deserving approbation the next contempt in short we deem it too ponderous a weight for his abilities to sustain with just grace mr digges whom we have somewhere mentioned did some scenes of lear the madness in particular great justice but was rather tedious and unaffecting upon the whole we have heard but hope it is not true that the poor old monarch has suffered theatrical assassination from the relentless attempts of messrs quin and mossop who we are confident must have tortured every syllable of him  edgar as drawn by tate is an amiable and interesting character dutiful to his father unsuspecting to his base brother constant in love steadfast in loyalty resolute in danger messrs ryan and havard supported this character with great abilities and with such parallel merit that we hardly know how to grant a preference yet are rather inclined to the former as throwing more wildness of expression and extravagance of action into the assumed madness mr smith and reddish particularly the latter give considerable pleasure at present and we think upon just principles the former however is injured as a performer by mr colmans palpable mutilation of the part in his alteration  gloucester is a character of no conspicuous qualities the bastard justly calls him credulous and we are willing to consider him as a weak honest man upon the stage mr sparks made him extremely respectable and mr berry was not far behind at present  oh heavens  he is in the feeble hands of mr burton at drury lane and incumbers the tottering abilities of mr gibson at covent garden do kind condescending managers relieve these overburthened gentlemen by putting mr hull and mr mr bannister in their places  kent we admire as a worthy undisguised uniform miracle of a courtier bold enough to speak truth where she seldom comes in the presence of a king and honest enough to follow that kings fortunes when deprived not only of his power but even the common comforts of life the character is finely imagined and happily introduced we dont remember nor indeed dont desire to see it better sustained than by mr clarke who hits off the cynical roughness well and yet preserves the gentleman mr bransby must excuse us if we say he rather puts us in mind of a reduced lifeguardman than a disguised peer  the bastard is a complicated villain of the deepest die performed with some degree of merit by the late mr palmer who had however too much levity of figure and deportment in him the present mr palmers appearance is much better and his acting as well mr bensleys idea of edmund is just and his expression adequate nor was mr clarke any way deficient in the representation of him  the gentleman usher was formerly exhibited with a fund of exquisite whim by mr woodward and is pleasantly enough situated with messrs dyer and dodd but set forth by mr cushing he is the exact type of coming up sir  gentlemen did you call   goneril and regan are characters infamously black but not as dr warton seems to doubt impossible or even improbable for we have too many originals of filial ingratitude in real life to verify such mimic representations of it shakespeares strong painting and placing the circumstances in the first sphere of life may make the matter from apparent exaggeration dubitable but human transactions prove in this point as well as many others what benevolent feelings reluctantly admit and with great difficulty conceive  in the light of female monsters which undoubtedly they appear it would be a coarse compliment to say any ladies looked or played them thoroughly in character therefore we shall not criticize any who have appeared in the two elder sisters what they uttered has come no doubt against original feeling and it would be rather cruel to try their merit in such disagreeable undertakings possibly no two were ever more unlike the barbarity they represent than mrs stephens and mrs w barry nor any two more agreeable to the audience under such ungracious circumstances ungratefully cruel to a benevolent father faithless to their husbands and vindictive to each other all representation must fall short of what the author apparently designed and indeed we are glad that what must shock nature in the faintest view cannot come forth with the addition of richer coloring we also think that such pictures of the human species as represent a complication of vices without one gleam of virtue should be seldom shown to the public  cordelia is finely opposed to her sisters and shines with double luster from their darkness dutiful under severe provocation to the contrary firm and disinterested in her attachment to edgar there is nothing extraordinary of acting merit in tates and much less in colmans in compliment to lear she is generally given to the first actress whether fit for her or no delicacy of figure and tenderness of expression are all the requisites which seem necessary for her mrs cibber was no doubt very pleasing but during our remembrance too much of the woman as mrs yates is at present with the unsufferable addition of an imperious uncharacteristic aspect mrs bellamy looked the part amiably but tuned the words most monotonously mrs barry speaks and feels it extremely well but rather outfigures it and we apprehend that very deserving young actress mrs bulkeley  why is she so neglected by the managers  would render cordelia more agreeable than any other lady now on the stage  this tragedy in its original state exhibits a beautiful collection of poetical flowers choked up with a profusion of weeds the unretrenched produce of luxuriant fertility and it was an undertaking of great merit to root up the latter without injuring the former how far tate the first adventurer and colman his suvervisor have succeeded we hope the reader may collect from our animadversions  the language of king lear is of mixed nature verse and prose where the former occurs we find it bold nervous figurative and with some few exceptions flowing the latter is compact pregnant and spirited the characters are various and mostly very interesting well grouped to show each other the plot is rather disjointed and the scenes frequently intrude upon the unities of time and place but the catastrophe so happily conceived by tate attones for all the unreformed irregularities and we may venture to say that from his hands the public have received a dramatic piece which appeals so powerfully to the passions that when performed with suitable abilities it proves rather a degree of painful pleasure and shrinks nature back upon herself  in the closet it must furnish particular gratification to critical judgment but will always be caviare to the generality of readers  man and wife a comedy by mr colman the comedy we are just entering upon is introduced like mr footes minor by a prelude but has had a manifest advantage of this in the propriety and force of action by the authors viva voce appearance to represent himself besides it will appear by comparison that there was not only much more occasion for the one than the other but a far greater share of executive power also manifested we shall not draw a parallel as every reader may do that at pleasure by turning a few leaves back  jenkins and townly the one a partridgeshooter as he says himself the other any thing you please commence mr colmans prelude with reading the bill of the play which occasions one to ask and the other to hint who the author is when immediately the bard appears clothed in mourning obviously to excite two sensations extremely consonant to comedy grief for a deceased friend and pity for the authors ticklish situation however melancholy this sable figure made us when first exhibited we cannot help smiling at the idea of introducing mirthful scenes with so melancholy an object somewhat similar to a hearse preceding the lord mayors show  but what is the purport of mr dapperwit and friends conversation first a facetious stroke upon mr colmans singular good fortune in having annuities repeatedly bequeathed him second an unnecessary intimation of the loss sustained in mr powell which the audience well knew without being so informed of the matter third a promise which has not yet been fulfilled of diligently improving public entertainment fourth a pitiful compliment to public good nature fifth a most extraordinary defense of mr garricks ode and a laborious unintelligible assimilation of mr footes satirical wit to fullers earth which we can reconcile no otherwise than in the following roundabout matter gay says gold is the true fullers earth to take out every spot and stain now as mr footes wit is universally allowed sterling his brother manager catched the idea perhaps from thence  the managerical parley founded in this exquisite scene to sweeten mr garrick for anticipating his pageant was very justly compared by a wag to the caresses of a prostitute who while she embraces her gallant picks his pockets as mr colman is deemed and indeed has proved himself a classical writer in general we wonder how the following hibernicism among some other slips could escape his pen dapperwit speaking of the pageant and masquerade says those you shall see sir and perhaps they may appear to more advantage and be seen with more satisfaction at the theatresroyal than stratford itself what liberal elegance of phraseolocry itself  having stretched this prelude which by no means incurs the censure of being too witty we are confident enough to pronounce the favorable reception it met as an almost unparallelled proof of critical lenity indeed it contains such petitioning supplication that mercy could not refuse her smiles however impartial understanding was obliged to frown as to the performance of messieurs hull dyer and wroughton bore up a dead weight of insipidity agreeable enough  the first scene of man and wife opens in a public house full of that bustle and confusion which an overflow of company occasions a gouty landlord hobbles about exerting his lungs though he cannot make much use of his feet luke the waiters directions to his substitutes and naming the rooms after shakespeares plays are pleasant enough the introduction of buck and his conversation with the waiter have nature and spirit snarl seems introduced for nothing but to complain of his bed mention of the little army that walked over him is not strictly delicate after the departure of these three fresh hurry is occasioned by the arrival of the birmingham coach which as we are informed has been overturned from this incident some humourous remarks arise especially those made by the seafaring passenger whose idea of flying as it is called conveys a whimsical effect indeed all the passengers though short are well supported and the landladys account of the jubilee is very laughable  we do not much approve the stage coachman who is drawn a civil creature contrary to the wellknown behavior of such gentry his hastening the passengers should have been in a more peremptory style when the other passengers are gone we perceive colonel frankly remaining who on being told the coach is setting off declares he will go no further from his soliloquy we collect that a loveaffair has brought him to stratford and that his mistress has reached it the day before  marcourt a coxcomb of the current year and rival to frankly now enter in the tip of the riding mode his dialogue is pleasant spirited and satirical but we apprehend his intimate mention of peers with a very slight alteration is borrowed from clodio in the fops fortune the common affectation of riding though scarce out of the streets the journal of visiting on horseback the sarcastical strokes against enormous clubwigs lilliputian hats and some other peculiarities of the reigning fashion are humourously conceived and adequately expressed the following stroke met with particular applause and in a great measure deserved it where frankly says do you intend to show yourself as one of the characters of shakespeare marcourt replies no faith such an original did not exist in his days we agree with our author that perhaps an exact similitude cannot be traced but are not ostrick lucio etc marcourts an observation which immediately follows we think more significant though it passed unnoticed one must have a wife you know if it is only for the pleasure of getting rid of her this is levelled with commendable poignancy against the divorces so shamefully prevalent amongst the great world  in the ensuing conversation between marcourt and the colonel an account is pleasantly given of mr and mrs cross father and mother of the young lady who is the object of their mutual attention we are also made acquainted with kitchen a third gallant the favorite of mr cross this rival is described so well that we cannot avoid presenting his picture in the authors words  he is dull dull as colonel grin who has got joe miller by heart and is always teazing you with a story  no splash in the world  his conversation is all tabletalk  made up of eating and drinking  he is a mere walking larder  his mind is a great pantry from which he is always serving up some choice dishes for the entertainment of his friends and acquaintances marcourt appears confident of the young ladys favor and intimates her joining with him and mrs cross in defeating her fathers intentions  the disciple of epicurus kitchen upon his entrance adverts the ruling passion of eating and drinking which furnishes fresh matter for observation when marcourt objects to a jubilee from not liking one he has seen at rome the landlord makes an excellent stroke there is no popery in our jubilee though it began with going to church  mention of rome occasions kitchen to remark its fallen state which he illustrates by a very characteristic simile of a sirloin of beef to a spoonful of macaroni this occasions an altercation between the coxcombs foreign taste and the cits nationality wherein the latter has a very manifest advantage particularly in this sentence as for you fine gentlemen you skim the cream of europe as you say and bring home nothing but froth and whip sillabub the dispute about shakespeare occasions a very tolerable apology for the most obvious blemishes of that admirable author and they are most excellently summed up in the following passage which has as much merit as any one of equal length we ever met with shakespeare mr marcourt shakespeare is the turtle of literature the lean of him perhaps may be worse than the lean of any other meat but there is a deal of green fat which is the most delicious stuff in the world  after the critical disputation charlotte is mentioned when each seems so sure of gaining her that a wager is laid and put into the colonels hands after which marcourt and kitchen depart to gratify their different attachments of gormandizing and foppery  the second act begins with mr and mrs cross at breakfast both most thoroughly disposed to contradiction in the true spirit of matrimonial contention they browbeat each other for trifles and designed misinterpretation one finds fault with every article and the other vindicates the whole till cross at length repents coming to stratford which he justly calls a ridiculous journey but the lady maintains warmly her taste for fashion and consequence which draws from her husband a stroke of well applied useful satire because a countess who has a room as long as pall mall gets the whole town together at her route you must have a route too and squeeze all your company into two closets and a cupboard  nay last winter when the town run masquerade mad you got a ridiculous party of fops and flirts to make fools of themselves and called it a masquerade  several other observations occur previous to mention of their daughters marriage upon which a fresh and material difference of opinion arises which the author has thrown into a well adapted dialogue which at last rises into a state of natural welldescribed aggravation which kitchens approach opportunely checks a little immediately after a message intimates that marcourt is come to wait on mrs cross this draws her off the stage and leaves the two gentlemen to a teteatete in which cross mentions that he has taken such steps as may expedite his daughters marriage with mr kitchen it is a strange thought however for a father who has disposal of his child and does not seem afraid of his wife to take a house at such a time in stratford for a month that his daughter being a parishioner may thereby have an opportunity of being married by banns but we imagine a painful necessity in the plot called for this strange shift  when charlotte approaches we do not find her a sighing despairing damsel because parents design disposing of her against her inclination but a daughter of political finesse pretending acquiescence on each side that she may have the better opportunity of deceiving both for this purpose she cordially closes with mr kitchen and her father but urges warmly the propriety of acting with secrecy this mr cross and the imaginary husband come into readily when the young lady urges that the jubilee affords a good opportunity for putting their scheme in practice kitchen throws out the following very sensible remark intrigues carried on in the face of the world are always least liable to detection and nowadays most people seem to act upon that principle after this an assignation is made by charlotte for kitchen to meet her when she has slipped on her masquerade dress a blue turkish habit  when the gentlemen disappear charlotte speculates on the weight and intricacy of business which engages her attention comparing herself to a minister who under various appearances attends to nothing but his own separate interest is well enough but likening a young lady to the directionpost of a high road is certainly  excuse the pun a piece of wooden wit  that indispensible utensil in loveaffairs the chambermaid now approaches with intelligence that colonel frankly is arrived and has sent a letter by her which she delivers on being asked if any person saw it delivered to her she replies no one but sally charlottes youngest sister of whom she gives an arch description just previous to her entrance yet what the young lady says when before us we must pronounce much in the strain of mediocrity she is curious indeed and forward but utters nothing that we can perceive to raise a laugh or fix attention her desire to be concerned in what she supposes mischief is natural enough and lettice seems prepared to gratify that girlish inclination but intimates they are not sufficiently abstracted from company the proposition of sallys telling a fib or two is right servantmaid instruction but when lettice calls her a little devil it is rather the language of a cook or scullion than that of a waiting woman and there is an unpardonably fulsome idea conveyed in miss sallys knowing parody on hodges song of the sheeps head and carrot without the least degree of humor at least perceptible to us thus strangely concludes the second act which has so little spirit or business that we find nothing commendable in it after mr and mrs cross except its brevity  five pages of the book between the second and third acts are filled with the older of that astonishing introduction the pageant which has apparently as little connection with the general tenor of this piece as any other and seems only to have been an occasional device for skimming the rich cream of curiosity which for a few nights of anticipation it certainly did with some degree of success but vanished quickly upon the appearance of that at drury lane  having thus had occasion to mention the jubilee it becomes our duty to say that a most extraordinary madness has this winter seized the london audience for repeatedly in crowds following near ninety nights what will by no means bear critical dissection the real jubilee at stratford if not politically intended as an introduction to what has since been exhibited here deserves no better title than theatrical idolatry the mimic one carrying a wooden or pasteboard representation of shakespeare about the stage in a kind of lord mayors show triumph and pantomiming those excellent characters which he has so richly supplied with affluence of language and sentiment is not only a mere moneytrap but a severe though oblique satire also upon public taste which hence seems more to enjoy empty unmeaning parade than solid sense or the noblest flights of powerful and luxuriant fancy  it must be confessed there is an agreeable dish of dramatic salmagundy dished up at drury lane in which an excellent admirably performed hibernian is the most highrelished ingredient garnished with some very tolerable ballads that the characters are well disposed and in dumb show tolerably well supported we also acknowledge but that public appetite should feed so long and greedily upon one dainty is almost beyond the bounds of credibility and for managers to run it so enormously as far beyond the bounds of justification for admitting there are fools and children enough to answer the end of such unparallelled repetition what apology can be made to the many sensible distinguishing friends of the theater who must either absent themselves half a season or have this mummery imposed upon their taste and feeling in conjunction with many of the feeblest wornout plays which have neither written or acting merit to up down without some such popular sugarplumb to sweeten them  oh shakespeare shakespeare what a spectacle art thou made how is thy muse of fire cabind cribbd confined by such mechanical representation methinks if thou were alive again the shallow justice who prosecuted thee for stealing venison would be sooner forgiven than those who make thy great name a bait for gudgeons  having said thus much in warm sincerity against the very nature of what has so much engaged public attention we must return to man and wife only observing that at covent garden the pageant was ill regulated faintly represented and insipid to the last degree however it eked out a piece not longer than some farces to the principal part of an evenings entertainment though the author has since with great modesty reduced it properly to an aftergame acting upon the same principle they are guided by in the royal dockyards that is of cutting down a ship or the line when she does not navigate well into a frigate  at the end of the second act we had some small intimation of a plot in favor of charlottes marriage with colonel frankly and now at the beginning of the third we find her prepared for the masquerade while lettice the trusty confident appears for the purpose of deception in the blue turkish habit which was mentioned as signal for kitchen from what charlotte says in this scene we find that her mamma aiming at high life has invited the masks to her house previous to their going to the amphitheatre and that from this circumstance the amusing marcourt and kitchen must arise while the young lady pursues her own inclination with the colonel sallys part is to make a fool as she phrases it of the beau while lettice plays upon the turtle merchant  marcourts approach hurries off charlotte and lettice leaving sally to play her part who in a short soliloquy professes great dexterity in the art of fibbing and comparing her sisters lovers inclines her approbation to the colonel what passes between this sprightly young sprig of intrigue in point of dialogue is mere whip syllabub much froth very little substance one turn of marcourts is well enough when she throws out  not very modestly some encomiums upon him he says what a sensible little creature it is the scheme she has been taught to manage is putting marcourt upon a wrong scent by suggesting that her sister is bent upon deceiving him in favor of kitchen therefore advises strict attention to the lady in the turkish habit there is at the conclusion of the scene a little stagetrick of sallys laughing as marcourt is going off and when he turns to salute her assuming gravity of countetenance which told extremely well in action being happily executed  mrs cross and lettice now appear the former in high spirits first from an idea of consequence in the masks assembling at her house and next from a supposition that her favorite is sure of charlotte penurious extravagance and awkward elegance are admirably touched upon in this speech of the city lady have they stuck the ends of spermaceti in the girandoles and have you sent to the apothecarys for a sufficient quantity of cream of tartar to make lemonade  seeing some masks she goes off and leaves lettice to entertain the audience with a soliloquy of very little purport and less humor kitchen comes forward to whom the maid discovers herself and imposes upon him an insinuation that charlottes inclination is entirely with him but that mrs crosss prejudice infavour of his rival makes a little policy essential kitchen also swallows greedily the bait of delusion and is going post haste to meet his mistress near the great booth but seeing marcourt at hand lettice desires him to stay upon the smarts entrance a slight altercation concerning the supposed miss charlotte ensuing between the gentlemen marcourt not only pressing by words but using force to make lucy unmask she screams which brings mr and mrs cross the former of whom reproves the forward gallant the spirit of contradiction between the man and wife now again exerts itself pretty briskly concerning whether the lady shall unmask or no however lucy removes her concealment this surprises cross who asks for his daughter some confusion ensues and from what kitchen has privately intimated he triumphs over mrs crosss disappointment  here a mr fleece appears who comes for the very purpose of telling that charlotte is married to colonel frankly this mr fleece we find was appointed agent to take the house to make charlotte a parishioner and to have the banns of marriage published but was imposed on by the young lady to act diametrically opposite to the inclination and intention of both her parents the unlucky rivals bear their disappointment with patience but mrs cross threatens turning her daughter out of doors which cross warmly opposes and to thwart his wife says he will receive them with open arms the happy couple appear next and matters are agreeably compromised  one expression of kitchens we cannot pass unnoticed speaking of himself and marcourt he says i have been roasted a little it is true but not so much as my friend here  he got into the wheel and turned himself  oh glorious hibernicism exactly parallel to captain oblunders expression of not being by when the tailor took measure of him for a suit of clothes who ever imagined before our author that a turnspit puppy in office roasts himself  what pity that he did not add to give the wit additional brilliance and basted himself  upon a retrospect of this comedy if it must be called so we find the first act at least the former part of it animated by laughable bustle though rather farcical the latter is satirically pleasant the second act begins agreeably but is afterward egregiously insipid the third act consists of laborious intricacy without nature to authorize humor to support or incident to gratify the suspense aimed at the plot is founded upon a most pitiful device and unravelled poorly we find that the author seems unacquainted with canonical hours which are precisely observed in marriages by publication of banns nay by license unless it be special we are presented with two characters habited for the masquerade and hear of others being come is it probable that they could be thus prepared when the forenoon was engaged as at the jubilee or indeed any where for a masked ball before seven oclock at soonest  yet colonel frankly and his bride just come from church at this time though the matrimonial ceremony under such circumstances as we mention cannot be celebrated unless between eight and twelve in the forenoon perhaps the author might have been led into this mistake by entering the honorable state himself in the evening through special authority  in point of character there is variety but nothing very original the dialogue is easy and in some places spirited the humor rather trite yet entertaining and as to the moral we shall give mr colmans words at the conclusion we derive says cross speaking of his daughters marriage from this incident one material piece of instruction that no family can be well governed where there is a disagreement amongst those who are placed at the head of it  and that nothing is so necessary as harmony amongst those whose interests are so intimately connected as those of man and wife by the words particularized it will appear this sentence is not remarkable for elegance or compactness  mr colman in a previous advertisement has paid a genteel compliment to the performers for their great excellence in the representation this we think extremely liberal considering him in the double light of manager and author though we could wish the word great had been omitted indeed we have heard his approbation interpreted differently first as a design to recommend the house second as a verbal bribe to engage the actors on his side in the contention with his brother patentees and last to approve his own great talent in writing for and adapting characters to the executive faculties of each performer however we are apt to interpret his praise more ingenuously and shall justify in general the idea he thereby inculcates  cross is a peevish silly fellow who after his first scene becomes mighty inconsiderable and an insipid engine of the plot mr shuter being freer from grimace in this character than any other is extremely deserving of applause but we apprehend the dryness of humor aimed at would have found better support in mr yates  marcourt by mr woodward has not as we remember one touch of harlequin his degagee pertness is admirably expressed and no part that we have ever seen was better figured or better dressed  kitchen who has more novelty and uniformity about him than any other character in the piece fell most happily into the hands of mr dunstall through him nature articulated every line with agreeable unaffected humor without grimace or finesse of any sort he sustained the author becomingly and without one laborious effort gave every intelligent spectator singular satisfaction  the landlord who could be little else than bonniface in the gout was hobbled through well enough by mr morris luke the waiter received great spirit from and stood much indebted to mr jews whose voluble and spirited expression rendered so short a part very conspicuous buck and mr davis did not disagree he looked the riotous bacchanalian well and expressed his inebriated state with some degree of pleasantry mr wignel tragedized snarl so laughably that for the few lines he spoke it becomes matter of great doubt whether he was not the most comical personage of the drama mr quick spoke the hostler well enough but was far too petit to figure such a character mr barnshaw would have looked it exquisitely mr fox in the first passenger performed the ceremony of dispatching a toast and some mulled wine dexterously nor was he at all amiss in delivering the blunt expressions put into his mouth as to mr herbert there surely never was such a lifeless fresh water sailor seen before  mrs cross is as positive as her husband but rather more silly and violent devoted with ideas contemptibly narrow to a lavish imitation of persons in high life fond of what she does not understand and opiniated of judgment she has not a perverse wife and indiscreet mother such are her outlines however the picture is but very faintly finished it received considerable animation from that correctness and vivacity which always distinguishes mrs greens performance of such characters charlotte is considered in the theatrical view as mere a trifle as ever hung heavy on the drama with just cunning sufficient to pick up a husband and insipidity enough to set an audience asleep sally her younger sister is in no shape comic except in some strokes where considering her age a charge of couched licentiousness may be brought against her she was performed with very considerable merit lettice sat easy enough on mrs mattocks but is such a chambermaid as never appeared before extremely eager to forward intrigue without having any thing to do or say worth notice the landlady is well drawn and had great justice done her by mrs gardner whose capability is equal to much more material undertakings as to the two female passengers we have really forgot them and therefore avoid offering any opinion as we would be equally tender of those who play one as those who play ten lengths  as a farce man and wife may do on the stage after a tragedy by no means after a comedy and in the closet can never gain any degree of estimation  zenobia a tragedy anonymous opening the drama with soliloquy unless what the character speaks appertains peculiarly to self we cannot entirely approve and what zelmira offers at the beginning of this tragedy we deem an unessential faint trite effort at description what she says to her husband zopiron concerning the havoc which ambition causes is expressed in terms commendably humane a most hateful picture of pharasmanes is given and we are informed that he holds in captivity a beauteous dame distinguished by the name of ariana for whose virtue zelmira conceives tender apprehensions the entrance of zenobia is well prepared by mention of the distress her mind appears to wear and her fainting under a load of sorrow when she comes in view affects the tender mind there is something pretty in her sense of obligation for the tender assiduity of her attendants and their disinterested attachment but we think them very strange very improper messengers to supervise and bring intelligence of the impending battle it must convey an amazonian idea to suppose them capable of such a charge besides zopiron who now disappears so oddly might have either undertaken the matter himself or recommended a proper messenger  in the conference between zenobia and zelmira pharasmaness brutal bloody character is set in a clearer light by the direct charge of fratricide in murdering mithridates an amiable monarch whose virtues exclusive of natural ties should have secured him from such violence it appears too that the tyrant illegally holds the crown of armenia given to his eldest son rhadamistus by mithridates a crown pharasmanes seized by force of arms pursuing even the life of his plundered child on zelmiras charging rhadamistus with the murder of his wife zenobia gives a nervous and pathetic account of the affair from whence we learn that prince was sent when young to mithridates court where an early affection grew between him and zenobia to whom he was married at length driven to despair by the unnatural rage of pharasmanes the royal couple determined to seek an asylum in death for which purpose they plunged into the river araxes in the transport of relation zenobia known to zelmira only as ariana slips out her real name which seems to promise further explanation but the entrance of tigranes an officer and creature of pharasmanes stops it  the appearance of some captives strikes zenobia with apprehension that the romans have been vanquished but tigranes informs her they are only some persons who were intercepted going to the roman camp for which the king has sentenced them to be impaled alive the latter end of this line we think liable to objection they suffer death in misery of torment  the word misery seems superfluously annexed to torment as not tending to add any force but rather furnishing a poverty of idea there may be misery without torment but there cannot be torment without misery upon viewing the unhappy objects of unrelenting tyranny zenobia tenderly recognizes megistus for whom she professes most friendly regard as he does for her and on the authority of being beloved by pharasmanes she takes him under her protection this meeting is extremely well conceived and the cause of her esteem for the old man judiciously concealed  in the scene between tigranes and zelmira we are informed that teribazus the younger son of pharasmanes loves zenobia a short sketch of that young princes character is given by tigranes who afterward drops a distant intimation of being himself a foe to zenobia here teribazus presents himself and makes kind enquiry of zelmira for ariana zenobia comes in upon his words and enquires concerning the fate of war when she is informed that the king has condescended to treat of peace and that an ambassador from the roman camp is to have audience in pharasmaness tent from this zenobia cannot draw any presage in her own favor however proceeds to an immediate and warm intercession for megistus whom she calls more than father she drops also some unfavourable hints of tigraness officiousness in the act of crimination the prince glad of an occasion to oblige the object of his affection promises not only life but liberty to the old man and reproves tigranes with considerable asperity  this desirable point gained zenobias mental gloom appears for some time gilded with the enlivening rays of heartfelt satisfaction in the full slow of her feelings and to account for being so interested for megistus she reveals herself at large and relates how the good old man rescued her when floated far from rhadamistus rescued her just expiring from the flood and with her saved a boy of which she then was pregnant the remainder of this scene where she mentions living with megistus separation from her child captivity with pharasmanes and the grief of her husband lost is poetically pathetic well calculated for capital action without any strain or exaggeration of nature  that dramatic writers forty years since when actors chaunted according to the flow of verse paying more respect to harmony of expression than meaning should tag their acts with those paltry unnatural clap traps rhimes is not at all surprising but for a poet of this day to intrude them upon public taste is what we could not reasonably expect and must therefore blame in this play especially those at the end of the first act which are servilely similar to one of andromaches speeches in the distressed mother we have also an objection to speaking of spirit in the style of a distinct sex when the most ignorant must know that the corporeal composition only admits such a distinction the passage runs till you shall bid this sad world weary spirit to peaceful regions wing her weary flight   there is another line in this scene censurable as being both in idea and expression exactly similar to a passage in drydens virgil zenobia speaking of her husbands fatal catastrophe says  the last dismal accents that trembled on thy tongue came bubbling up  speaking of a seanymphs departure under water dryden has it thus and her last words came bubbling up in air  at the beginning of the second act tigranes presents himself ruminating in a short soliloquy upon some terms of reproach uttered against him by teribazus which occasions him to declare resentment against the prince marking zenobia also as an object of hatred pharasmanes approaches this ministerial tool of tyranny and like the true man of blood regrets that proposed negotiation from the roman camp has stopped the glorious havoc of impending battle then enquires whether the captives have suffered death according to his sentence this gives tigraness malevolence an opportunity of accusing teribazus by insinuation of suspending their fate thus he touches the monarchs impatience who expresses himself in terms of severity against the prince just as zenobia enters who supplicates in pathetic terms mercy for the captives this suit from an amourous inclination pharasmanes grants the persuasion of one and the compliance of the other are agreeably conducted in this scene upon mention of megistus as a parent the monarch proposes not only giving life but raising him to a state of splendour which zenobia prettily declines  being acquainted by teribazus that the roman embassy is arrived pharasmanes after hinting resentment to his son and rhiming out a compliment to the lady goes off to grant an audience this gives teribazus an opportunity of urging again his passion to zenobia which she admits with respect but cannot return the real cause of her coldness is well and naturally concealed as it occasions teribazus first to suppose his father is the happy rival and afterward leaves him strongly agitated with impassioned doubt to say truth the prince is here pictured a kind of drawcansir in love ready to kill any and every body who dare thwart his darling inclination when he seems left in a strange state of confusion without a syllable of any consequence to say zopiron comes in and gives him a short account of the embassy and of the senates resolution concerning armenia which teribazus supposing himself immediate heir to rejoices at and with some justice though not strict filial duty wishes his fathers defeat  one obvious point of enquiry arises here how zopiron should know what the roman ambassador has in charge before the public audience has taken place as he knows not that flaminius is rhadamistus nor has had any previous conference with him the general idea of peace is publicly known but the reserved claim upon armenia pharasmanes himself is not acquainted with till made so by the ambassador  though it is something odd that a representative of the roman senate should enter upon private conversation with an unknown person before he has fulfilled his public charge yet we find rhadamistus in his assumed character unattended joins zopiron to converse as we perceive upon very interesting matter in an open camp after asking for the monarch he expresses himself in very indelicate terms of pharasmanes which is amazing in one who bears the olive branch whatever his thoughts might be sure it must be deemed not only impolitic but highly censurable to speak in such a manner before one who for ought he knows may relate it to the prejudice of his humane errand however he accidentaly lights on a most convenient person in zopiron who advises him to speak home truth this seems to awaken rhadamistuss reason which though he has already spoke in a most unreserved manner he thinks not so well adapted to pharasmaness camp zopirons visage linking a favorable impression he asks zopirons name and quality which certainly should have been known before he had vouchsafed conference on being told that he is delegated to plead the rights of armenia rhadamistus seems to have heard of him and mentions his own real name without revealing himself  zopiron professing warm attachment to his lawful prince though unknown and even supposed dead he receives information of the unhappy youths being alive here rhadamistus gives a strong lively and affecting picture of his own wretchedness and mentions zenobia in a melting manner but when the author throws him into a swoon we are surprised at the misplaced extravagance of passion which represents the prince rather as a child than a hero incapable of checking that grief which unrestrained so palpably tends to set aside the disguise he thinks it necessary to wear besides falling and grovling about the stage on such an occasion is rather a mean theatrical trick than any flight of nature a kind of frenzy succeeds the fainting fit merely calculated for action without any trace of propriety from this rhadamistus discovers himself and relates his design of perishing with zenobia but that chance and the humanity of some romans who had found him inanimate on the araxes banks had preserved him to toil through a life of woe the assistance promised by rome on knowing his real character is mentioned on hearing that the armenians consider his brother teribazus as heir to their crown his grief makes a strange proposition of yielding to another what the romans are generously endeavoring to recover for him in short this scene which concludes with a gingling resolution of scolding pharasmanes is extravagant in some parts flat in others and much too tedious upon the whole we think also it might have been much more happily introduced after than before the first scene of the next act  when pharasmanes receives on his throne rhadamistus as the roman ambassador we find the former entertains most contemptuous notions of republicans however his expressions are tolerably decent till rhadamistus forgetting his peaceable errand and indulging an ungovernable spirit of speaking illtimed truth offends him the monarch with great color of justice fires at reproachful accusations and hence arises verbal contention unworthy of and disgraceful to private gentlemen much more such exalted characters pharasmanes contrary to the law of nations draws upon the brawling ambassador and rhadamistus urges his fury by an unlimited license of expression we much approve the following passage relative to mithridates death the hand of heaven shook from the blasted tree the withered fruit but at the same time cannot help supposing it borrowed from a much more beautiful one to the same purpose spoken by aegeon in the last scene of the fourth act of oedipus the whole conference now before us is a most indelicate piece of political squabble leaving matters nearly in the state they were before it took place  zenobia and magistus now appear to discuss a tender point the safety and situation of her infant son maternal anxiety and faithful attachment are pleasingly set forth impatient to see her child zenobia proposes flying from pharasmaness camp but megistus objects to the danger of such a measure and prudentially hints that revealing herself to the ambassador of rome is a more probable method of answering her purpose the suggestion strikes her and furnishes a fresh gleam of comfort their conversation is interrupted by tigranes who comes as messenger from the king to know when zenobia will make her royal admirer happy by marriage this rouses her indignation which she vents in spirited terms her refusal is imputed by tigranes to a prejudice in favor of teribazus which however she disclaims and leaves him with some stinging observations on his own base character which makes him afresh declare his intention of working her ruin to him rhadamistus approaches who somewhat cooled himself supposes the kings intemperance may by this time be moderated also his sentiments are very pacific but tigranes assures him of vindictive resolutions upon the side of pharasmanes however promises to convey the princes humane sentiments to his royal master  in a succeeding soliloquy we perceive nature checking rhadamistus for waging war against his father though a cruel one apprehension of meeting and perhaps destroying an unknown brother in battle also shakes him during this agitation of mind teribazus joins him and utters in his first speech this strange accumulation of epithets wherein the just gradation of climax is forgot a wretched ruined miserable prince besides the dissonance of four rs jarring in this line what occasion after telling us that he is wretched is there for adding the word miserable but our author seems fond of this mode of expression in the progress of this conference we are again therefore superfluously made acquainted with pharasmaness crimes upon teribazuss mentioning rhadamistus with affection though an unknown brother sentiments of tender nature arise and as flaminius the latter proposes assistance to the former who however declares that filial duty will not suffer him to assail with violence even a tyrannic parent one material apprehension he mentions that of losing the lovely captive ariana wherefore he requests rhadamistus to convey her from the camp this favor is readily and cordially promised with an entreaty that teribazus will also retreat to the roman refuge this is declined and he goes off to send the idol of his affection while he watchfully prevents any interruption of her interview with the ambassador  megistus now leads on zenobia and a few lines are spoke before rhadamistus fully perceives what object stands before him transported doubt for some time agitates him after he has recognized her features and person during which she perceives knows and yet doubts also the husband she has long thought dead  these meetings are so frequent in tragedies the mourning bride oroonoko etc that the author must possess uncommon abilities who strikes out any thing new or more affecting than we have seen whatever possibility there is of working such an effect we cannot compliment the piece before us in that light the prince as usual stands in an attitude and the lady faints besides the incident hangs too long upon attention when the faithful pair are realized to each other zenobia presents megistus as the preserver of herself and child upon which occasion we think rhadamistus too languid how much stronger is the glow of love and gratitude in oroonoko who forgives even the villain who has kidnapped him as being the means of finding his beloved imoinda without forceable action this scene especially as a child is in the case is much fainter than any one we know of a similar nature indeed the poet seems conscious that his muse flaps her pinions heavily by hurrying the act to a conclusion tigranes being seen rhadamistus goes off to meet him megistus briefly mentions the pleasing accomplishment of his prayers in zenobias happiness and she promises him singular regard  would she did not deliver herself in rhyme  act the fourth commences with the two princely brothers teribazus thanking rhadamistus for his promised care of the captive and warning him against any amorous impressions this precaution occasions some dubious expressions to fall which alarm the suspicion and inflame the impetuosity of teribazus who nevertheless cools upon being desired to continue the beauteous object within his amorous fathers reach and choosing rather to trust roman integrity requests again the conductive care of flaminius here tigranes enters and gives information that the king is approaching to have a private interview with the ambassador this sends off teribazus and the monarch soon appears  after a few preparative lines pharasmanes mentions that rhadamistus is alive to flaminius knowledge therefore demands his head from paulinus the roman generals hands here the tyrant if possible gives his character a deeper tinge of guilt and rhadamistus though in vain expostulates with him on the principles of parental tenderness and general humanity these failing to touch his inexorable heart the parley is broken off and vengeance denounced on either side  pharasmanes determined on the decision of war resolves during the intermediate hours of peace to prosecute his impassionate purpose on ariana and asks tigranes if she has consented to make him happy on being informed of her peremptory nay scornful refusal he declares that love itself shall be his slave however a gleam of generous feeling shoots across the gloom of his dusky mind and lights him to the milder path of persuasion for which purpose he orders megistus whom he supposes the father of zenobia to be brought before him the old man at his entrance speaks in the style of hesitative apprehension to which the monarch replies in terms of friendly profession for sake of his imagined daughter speaking of the distress which preys upon zenobias mind megistus mentions an absent husband long separated as the cause of her woe this alarms the monarch who declares he will remove by violence such an impediment to his own uncontrolable passion and desires an immediate interview with his beauteous captive ordering megistus to conduct her which charge he respectfully declines and when urged by pharasmanes with the glaring argument of royal splendour he expresses himself in the following agreeable passage which without much originality has yet some share of poetical and philosophical merit it might naturally flow from an humble station yet it is by no means unworthy an exalted mind oh not for me such splendour  i have lived my humble days in virtuous poverty to tend my flock to watch each rising flower each herb each plant that drinks the morning dew and lift my prayers to the just gods on high  these were my habits these my cares  these hands sufficed to answer my desires and having naught yet naught was wanting to me   pharasmanes ill calculated to parley with his own turbulent passions contemns cool reason and threatens the most fatal measures if his desires are not complied with leaving megistus to ruminate thereon the old man might have been furnished with an excellent soliloquy and indeed one of eight or ten lines seems necessary to place the exit of pharasmanes and the entrance of zenobia at a proper distance from each other as it is she treads upon the heels of incensed royalty the princess hurries off her faithful guardian appointing a place of meeting that suspicion may not arise from their being seen together teribazus enters upon the old mans departure and renews his suit to zenobia which she interrupts and overturns by a most unaccountable declaration that the idol of her love is in the camp nay upon further question she still more surprisingly and we may add inconsistently declares without reserve flaminius is that rival from what precedes it would seem as if she had interested the prince to recommend her flight to the roman camp under care of the roman ambassador that flight being ready for execution how is it possible she should so palpably strike out the means of prevention nay even the hazard of either discovering rhadamistus or subjecting his life to danger from a tempest of jealousy raised in his brothers breast yet such is her conduct and rhadamistus entering upon the discovery is justly accused by teribazus the dilemma zenobia has reduced herself and husband to is manifest as in this bungled scene she speaks but two lines and a half and those with little or no meaning  teribazus though almost frenzied with rage so far remembers the sacred character of an ambassador that he postpones his resentment to the next days battle this is polite and generous but how can we account for his leaving the woman he loves with a professed rival who is as he knows going to quit the camp and has his own request to take the fair one with him how to reconcile such contrarieties we cannot tell and suppose nothing could urge an intelligent author into them but the utmost distress and penury of plot or an implicit compliance with mr bayss maxim that to elevate and surprise is eligible at any rate  soon after teribazus goes off zopiron enters and hastens the departure of rhadamistus with zenobia who scarce disappears when pharasmanes with his obsequious tigranes approach the monarch declares his intention of abiding the event of war and sends for his son teribazus to whom on his appearance he urges an accusation of giving countenance to his foes this the prince denies with becoming spirit and respect on a second charge of thwarting his fathers amorous inclination he disclaims any attachment to zenobia and points out ambition as the present ruler of his heart tigranes who was dispatched to see that the roman ambassador had left the camp returns and informs pharasmanes that zenobia and megistus are fled with the ambassador this rouses the tyrant who orders a pursuit which point of service the irritated teribazus takes upon himself considerably in the quixote style not in respect of words but the inconsistency of the behavior to say truth there is a laughable mixture of consequence and weakness rage and childishness set forth in the monarch also whose conclusion of the act is as much below the temper of mind he has hitherto shown as possible  at the commencement of the fifth act pharasmanes presents himself to us in a state of agitated reflection jealousy and vengeance fire his imagination to a desperate resolution when teribazus brings him the agreeable intelligence that he overtook and has after faint resistance made prisoners the fugitives they are brought on chained and sustain with becoming fortitude threats of a sanguinary nature from the enraged monarch rhadamistus throws out a hint to his brother that he will repent the forward zeal which has brought them into such a situation teribazus wild with resentment having heard zenobia declare the supposed flaminius her husband treats his brother with disdain and vows eternal hostility with rome rhadamistus pleading the privilege of his station for safety is answered by pharasmanes that he has forfeited all title to respect and protection zenobia remonstrates in favor of her husband with force and feeling which rather seems to precipitate his fate nothing can be more languid than rhadamistuss behavior through this whole scene when dragged off to execution his wife softens into supplication and on pharasmaness declaration that her compliance with his amorous desires is the only path to mercy she very pathetically offers her infant son as a plea for milder treatment finding the monarch inexorable she gives full scope to the distraction of grief here teribazus appears and seems disposed to sooth her notwithstanding he has been the cause of the pungent woe she feels  on the hint that flaminius is his brother rhadamistus teribazus entertains strong and natural surprise and with a great deal of justice asks why so important a secret was kept from him on zenobias answer which contains but a weak apology the prince resolves affectionately to save his brother for which purpose he goes off zenobia however does not draw any favorable consequence from this unexpected turn but seems to think her husbands fall is inevitable which melancholy reflection is confirmed by zopiron who brings intelligence that rhadamistus is leading forth to execution this very alarming crisis inspires zenobia with a desperate remedy which she hastens to put in practice but leaves the audience in doubt what it may be  rhadamistus appearing guarded teribazus joins him and enters into a private conference the explanation of affinity gives the former a fine opportunity of manifesting fraternal tenderness by granting unlimited forgiveness to the person who has effected his ruin indeed the picture he gives of his own disingenuous policy is a powerful exculpation of teribazus and places him in the fairest point of view that their conduct and circumstances will admit however his brother on the proposal of a rescue even at the expense of their inhuman fathers life shows true filial dignity most amiable persevering tenderness in rejecting the idea of preserving his own life and even his love by the sacrifice of a parent tigranes with a fresh sentence from pharasmanes orders the guards to plunge rhadamistus into a dungeon where his generous brother detertermines to attend him  tigranes in a short soliloquy after the princes are departed seems to plan great matters for himself but is so much the embrio of a villain that we scarce know what to make of him zopiron now appears with a suspension of rhadamistuss sentence by order of the king and as he says the queen mention of the queen surprises tigranes from whose enquiry we find that zenobia has consented to be and actually is by a very short ceremony the wife of pharasmanes zopirons account of the transaction has some share of merit and gives to critical perception a gleam of the catastrophe  when the royal pair are discovered the monarch expresses himself in affectionate terms while zenobias words wear a cold and mysterious gloom on soliciting freedom and safe conduct to his friends for the roman ambassador pharasmaness impetuous brutal temper kindles and mention of an interview makes him not only reverse the pardon he so lately granted into a fresh order for immediate execution but also treat his unhappy bride with the most severe indignity till at length by the operation of poison he has drank from his nuptial cup his feelings are changed from rage to agony zenobias triumph at his approaching fate is most certainly founded in justice and affords an excellent transition in acting but we must contend that it savours rather too much of masculine ferocity especially in those lines of exultation she speaks after pharasmanes dies  upon the entrance of rhadamistus freed from captivity and danger he flies with rapture to the embrace of his beloved zenobia who seems like romeo to lose awhile the remembrance of poison in rapture rhadamistus in one line pays the tribute of filial sorrow to an unworthy father and the next moment warmly applauds zenobia for the virtuous action of murdering him  when zenobia feels the deadly draught working in her veins some pathetic strokes occur but so inferior to those of the last scene of romeo and juliet which they evidently though faintly resemble that comparison shows them in a trifling point of view our heroines conclusion would lose much of its effect but for the mention of her child rhadamistus is very feebly supported for his circumstances and making the impetuous hotheaded teribazus amidst such a scene of confusion woe and the disappointment of his own heart draw the cool moral inference which the author fixes from his piece seems rather a compliment to the performer than strictness of propriety which would have given the conclusive speech to megistus or rather zopiron as the character least interested consequently fittest for speculative remarks the six lines of rhyme are also as impoverished jingle as ever we met in any decent piece  the unities of this tragedy are well preserved there are some surprises and many interesting events in the plot which is well conducted for stage business the versification is neither elegant nor flowing however by rising very little above measured prose it has no taint of bombast the sentiments are trite yet in several places happily applied and we readily admit that there are many strong appeals to the tender passions insomuch that we know several pieces much more poetical and correct which cannot draw so many tears what light it shows human nature in and how the great purpose of instruction is fulfilled we shall discover by an investigation of the characters  pharasmanes is one of the most complete royal villains we remember to have met with capable of crimes thoroughly attrocious without one generous feeling his love is evidently sensual his fame barbarity the sanguine slave of ambition with every other hateful turbulent passion he moves before us from beginning to end an object of consummate detestation the author intending to exhibit nature in a state of the utmost depravity has well fulfilled his design as to the acting of this obnoxious monarch there are opportunities of exerting considerable talents to advantage and we imagine mr mossops executive powers might make him a very conspicuous character while mr aickin stands deficient both in dignity of deportment and extent of voice which latter defect is rendered more palpable by a laborious wildness of exertion by vain uncultivated attempts in short he reminds us of an unbroken steed which is constantly upon the grand paw without any grace or propriety of motion a little restraint would throw him into more agreeable regularity and mend his paces much  rhadamistus is an honest man and tender husband in point of filial respect also he is commendable but as to heroism he cuts a very poor figure being as is apparent timorous and disingenuous in these failings he seems to be a mere tool of the plot which greatly depends in its present form on his censurable conduct the part was indisputably written for mr barry whose performance happily sustains the author wherever he has done justice to himself but as many of the scenes manifest great inequality we are not to be surprised that capital abilities in such places should so far border on insipidity as to pall one third of this character omitted in action would render him more interesting to an audience and more advantageous to the performer  teribazus we may justly style the squib and cracker of tragedy possessing an undisguised generous and affectionate heart yet precipitated by a violent degree of fretful impatience there is an oddity of composition in this impetuous prince which mr holland delineated with masterly execution his transitions were rapid and his expression forceable that power of voice which on many occasions he was too lavish of here operated pleasingly and made sound literally an echo to the sense  mr palmer appears in the situation of an unskilful rider on a high mettled horse the part runs away with him and he is as near tumbling heels over head as possible we wish from real regard to this rising performer that he would before habit takes too strong possession of him clap a check rein on his expression for it is a strict critical truth that being under is better than over the mark and that many natural deficiencies are softened by a prudent limitation spirit should enliven but not wage war with propriety  megistus is a very amiable personage humane and parental in his attachments humble in desires and resolute in danger we think the poet might have made him much more considerable however as mr havard far in the decline of life was designed for the part it was probably adopted in point of length and feelings to his impaired faculties it is certain that gentleman did him great justice a tender sensible placidity of countenance and expression gave the sentiments due effect  mr jefferson who has taken possession of the old man does not affect us so much as his predecessor though neither languid nor disagreeable  zopiron seems little more than a filler up of the drama he appears to possess some virtues but has no opportunity of exerting any and what he says through the whole play is of so little significance that we are surprised mr packer can walk through him without setting the audience asleep this is one of many makeshift characters which if totally omitted would occasion little or no deficiency  tigranes seems to be a thorough paced pupil of tyranny ready for all the dirty work his master can suggest teeming with mischief which however he cannot bring about mr hurst does him no injustice except by a mossopian pomposity of utterance which hangs too much about him in every character he performs we think proper to intimate that every imitative performer is sure to catch the defects of that person he aims at much sooner than his beauties and as the latter at second hand grow much fainter so the former rise to a stronger degree of disgust  zelmira is as water gruel a character as her husband zopiron and affords no opportunity for cutting a conspicuous figure being no more than a foil she cannot rise above the agreeable and this mrs w barry reaches  zenobia engrosses more approbation than any other character as a princess wife and mother she commands our applause her situations are well varied alarming and interesting we heartily concur with the author that mrs barry gives her many additional charms that her action is a kind of promethian heat to the princess and that we have not lately seen so strong a degree of passion and pathos exhibited  this tragedy with adequate performers may nay must always please on the stage but as to private perusal we think it will afford very little pleasure and less instruction  cymon a dramatic romance anonymous the title of this piece prepares us for an invasion of critical rules being professedly in the extravaganza strain we are to consider it as a child of unrestrained imagination rather than the offspring of nature and propriety what has been already objected to ghosts spirits witches etc even decked by shakespeares luxuriant fancy must lie much more forceably against the enchanters and enchantresses of inferior pens but while public taste shows such an unacountable eagerness to encourage sound and pageantry it is not wonderful that authors and managers should throw out the most propable bait of folly by calling any sort of monsters to their aid  merlin and urganda two persons possessed of supernatural powers open the first act from their conversation it appears that the former has entertained a passion for the latter without meeting a suitable return he charges her with loving cymon and upon her prevaricating urges her having stolen that prince from his father in search of whom an hundred knights are employed what is a romance without knights  by what merlin says urganda instead of fulfilling her appointed trust which was to guard the peace and innocence of the arcadians has sunk them into folly and vice here a song occurs founded on that most hackneyd thought that an impure fountain must produce tainted streams and so of ill examples from a throne  merlin proof against the solicitations and remonstrances of urganda declares revenge against her and in the mysterious language of a conjurer says that cymons cure shall be her wound this alarms the enchantresss apprehension she ponders on his words when her attendant fatima appears who seems to form dreadful ideas of merlins displeasure and urges her mistress to avoid impending ills by marrying him this her attachment to cymon prevents from which several pleasant remarks on female weakness arise and cymons state of idiotism is set forth at large the inequality of magic to the power of love is tolerably well explained in a song we meet here  among other spirited remarks we think what follows deserves quotation it is the business of beauty to make fools and not cure them even i poor i could have made twenty fools of wise men in half the time that you have been endeavoring to make your fool sensible on seeing cymon at a distance fatima proposes to retire but urganda desires her assistance to divert him and in a song very like all others which relate to enchantment invokes not only her attendant spirits but the power of music to influence him here the prince appears clouded with melancholy a conversation ensues wherein many lines are spoke yet very little is said urganda sooths and fatima rallies the simple youth who answers with such dubious insensibility that no direct inference can be drawn through five pages in order to waken his feelings urganda shows him a delightful prospect of which cupid and his suite make a part however the blind god owns his inability to conquer cymon and seems rather nettled at being called on such a fruitless errand  cymons falling asleep amidst exhilerating entertainment is a powerful proof of dullness on being awakened he expresses a desire of going and makes a pretty allusion in song of his own case to that of an encaged linnet at length urganda by way of working on his gratitude grants him liberty and gives him a magical nosegay which cannot create but is capable of improving passion he receives both with a kind of puerile joy and concludes the first act with a song on liberty very much in the namby pamby strain but well enough for a simpleton  two shepherdesses present themselves at the beginning of the second act one in full fret at being forsaken the other offering conciliatory advice urgandas fruitless passion though an enchantress is mentioned from further explanation it appears that one sylvia is the object of jealousy as her beauty seems to be an object of general admiration among the rural swains after a very womanish resolution of making her as uneasy as possible deriving pleasure from her pain the sisters are accosted by linco a merry blade who gives a specimen of his disposition in a spirited song his contempt of sighing lovers is well expressed his contrasting of sylvia who shuns gallants as industriously as other girls follow them is also pleasing lincos second song is not a bad receipt for disengaged peace of mind but as to the poetry it is as moderate as may be  upon being told by the angry shepherdess that his prescription wont effect her cure he thinks her case deserves only to be laughed at in a few lines further he mentions that sylvia has seduced damon her sisters swain here the scale is turned and she who preached patience being now touched herself breaths terrible threats at length both females are so disconcerted at lincos light treatment of their serious concerns that they go off and leave him to enjoy his laughter in another song which has more spirit than poetry more sound than meaning  merlin next appears and in soliloquy acquaints us that he has sown the seeds of mutual affection between sylvia and cymon by a touch of his magical wand he communicates to a basket of flowers the power of inspiring the heart with love then goes off uttering the same line concerning cymons cure he pronounced to urganda in the first act soon as he disappears the simple prince approaches with his bird to which he determines giving liberty having obtained the like happiness himself on seeing sylvia as she lies reposed on a bank he confesses astonishment and in a speech of much natural simplicity gives us to understand that new sensations have entered his mind the air he sings is in a suitable style and affords very good opportunity for action  sylvias waking occasions a very pleasing and diffident interview her song is pretty and the astonished hesitation between her and cymon has an agreeable natural effect but is rather too great a similitude to that of hypolita and dorinda in drydens tempest  the progressive explanation of their artless passion is very happily conducted her giving as a token of remembrance the nosegay enchanted by merlin and his exchanging that presented him by urganda are well conceived incidents for continuing and embarrassing the plot the duet which concludes the second act turns upon a fanciful application of inconstancy to fading flowers which charm the senses for a short season and soon grow obnoxious  urganda enters with her confidant at the beginning of the third act making enquiry after cymon and is again rallied by fatima for so eagerly pursuing such worthless game we apprehend this convenient ladys scheme for making matters easy by the enchantresss marrying merlin and retaining cymon as a gallant is too licentious besides merlin must be as little of a conjuror as thousands of his neighbors not to find out his own cuckoldom  cymons rapturous entrance with a nosegay occasions a very apt mistake in urganda which is that the young man has at last conceived a passion for her according to her wishes hence she conceives the most agreeable sensations and on the conclusion of a very rapturous air which he sings comes in his view at sight of so hateful and terrible an object conscious too of the danger her resentment is pregnant with he endeavors to hide sylvias nosegay and when urganda urges an explanation of the change that appears in him he prevaricates till being forced to show the flowers the enraged enchantress discovers her mistake and by dissembled mildness makes enquiry how he came by the present fatima causes him to slip out that it was given by a female while urganda to make vengeance more sure not only stops further inquisition but gives transported cymon full liberty to follow his own inclinations however after he goes off she discovers very vindictive feelings and having ordered fatima to watch his motions makes her exit with a song of furious import  sylvia now appears at the door of dorcass cottage with cymons present in her hand in a soliloquy and two airs she confesses singular satisfaction somewhat mingled with occasional doubt linco listens while she is singing and pays a delicate compliment not only to the harmony of her voice but the innocence of her disposition she is rather startled at lincos overhearing her private thoughts upon such a subject he acquaints her that she is to appear before the deputy governor to answer some complaints which have been lodged against her by a shepherdess however he promises his friendly assistance ignorant of any crime but that of being too handsome she readily consents to attend his summons  dorcas a deaf old woman in whose care sylvia had been left appears and expresses several jealous apprehensions concerning her charge but upon sylvias apparent willingness to go and lincos promise of protection she agrees the old womans affection is well described and from what she says sylvias identity appears doubtful dorcass song on the danger young inexperienced females stand exposed to in these days compared with the time of her own youth is truly humorous however we doubt whether there ever was an age of absolute general constancy in love but satire makes it a rule to prefer things past to the present  dorus the magistrate hearing a shepherdess and promising redress of her complaint is next produced his worship in a very few lines exhibits amorous inclinations which the female either through fear or cunning seems to favor artfully introducing sylvias name against whom being wound up by the present complainant he utters severe threats linco entering while dorus is kissing the shepherdesss hand protests against prejudiced favor and to corroborate his argument sings an air pregnant with good sense as well as humor which the magistrate seems nettled at and the shepherdess intimates that linco being a friend to sylvia is her foe this occasions the magistrate to insist upon sylvias immediate appearance the interruption given him by linco who at least goes out for the supposed culprit is whimsical here the shepherdess departs with full and warm assurances of protection  there is something extremely well imagined in making sylvias charms instantaneously strike the the old son of vice for certain it is that he who makes justice give way to one set of features will also make her subservient to another that has more force or novelty he attempts questioning with authority but is unable to abstract his ideas from her beauty consequently utters himself in very incoherent sentences this scene is conducted with particular pleasantry at length linco advises sylvia by way of making her cause more sure to sing this she complies with and so powerful an effect is wrought upon the overwhelmed dorus thereby that he throws off all disguise and expresses himself in the tenderest terms at which critical point of time the shepherdess reenters to enquire if sentence is passed this nettles dorus who answers fretfully but promising to speak with her in the justices chamber sends her off then renews his professions of favor to sylvia with which and a spirited song by linco the third act concludes in a very pleasing manner as suspense is judiciously sustained and the humor well varied  urganda hurricaned with violent perturbation of mind commences the fourth act and after a soliloquy or rather incantation raises a demon of revenge who like a very complaisant fiend echoes his mistresses purpose in a song which calls up some of his infernal associates after performing certain mystical rites they follow the enchantress  linco draws in damon and dorilas by force charges them with being jealous of cymon and sylvia which makes them so forward to carry that helpless fair before urganda upon being rallied severely by linco and pinched rather too close the shepherd seems to hint as if he could not exculpate himself to the governor for such behavior however the laughing blade seems to treat such an apprehension very lightly and even when dorus personally orders him to join in the search for cymon and sylvia he makes several very ludicrous evasions jesting even in the face of authority this irritates the magistrate to dismiss him and in return he gives dorus a severe rub as never doing justice but in conformity to his inclinations or passions in obedience to which also he sets her at defiance the loss of his place sits easy on this disengaged humourist who seems to think as matters stand it is of little consequence we apprehend his song points at our political disputes for some years past however they are touched with a very gentle hand  fatima now appears upon the watch for cymon in obedience to her mistresss orders merlin comes upon her and on account of her mischievous errand determines to punish her the conjurer being invisible he very conveniently hears what this female spy remarks concerning cymon and sylvia his changing what she has written to letters of blood and quite a different purport from what she intended gives a good opportunity for descriptive action on seeing merlin she confesses strong fear and sooths his compassion in pitiful terms this he will grant on one condition only a positive injunction of silence which fatima seems to think as nine tenths of the female world would do a terrible tax upon loquacity however according to the trite proverb that needs must when somebody drives and upon merlins persuasion she consents as a defeat to urgandas curiosity to answer no otherwise than by the monosyllables ay and no  on the magicians departure in his dragondrawn chariot the terrified waiting woman descants on her deplorable situation in soliloquy and seems to think his cruelty in taxing the tongue so unmercifully is without precedent a song upon the words she is confined to carries her off agreeably  cymon and sylvia now come forward and renew their vows of constancy with much fervor upon her hinting apprehension of urganda he fortifies her spirits with merlins promise of assistance the air sung by sylvia which we may call the sweet passion of love is in the true pastoral strain and does not want poetical merit either in versification or sentiment  while cymon and sylvia are interchanging mutual endearments they are beset on every side by dorus damon dorilas and a parcel of their mirmidons who first taunt and afterward attempt to take them prisoners this enflames cymon to resistance he repels force by force but while he is pursuing a part of the runaways others of them with dorus at their head surround sylvia who is hurried off by them to urganda cymon returning perceives the loss of his mistress and utters his anxious feelings in an air bordering upon frenzy  at the beginning of the fifth act we meet urganda and fatima the former glowing with curiosity the latter laboring under merlins limitation of speech the enchantress tries interrogation in every shape without being able to obtain a satisfactory answer from whence the scene has some humor but is indisputably too long fatima is at length dismissed by her enraged mistress to whom dorus enters who meets but a rough reception till he mentions sylvia the thoughts of having her in captivity sooths urganda she enquires after cymon and being informed that he could not be taken she determines to glut her resentment on the unhappy object of his love for which purpose she first dooms sylvia to death but on second thoughts changes her sentence to confinement in the black tower one of her enchanted castles  the innocent victim appears is threatened and shown the gloomy spot of her destined captivity which she looks on with becoming intrepidity and sings an air which turns on this pretty instructive though common thought that innocence is an impregnable shield against the most gloomy terrors of fate as they are forcing sylvia to the tower the dreary prospect by means of merlins superior power changes to one of comfort and magnificence this strikes the defeated enchantress with shame and terror she tries her wand but finds its power blasted and is ridiculed by her triumphant competitor a flourish of martial music is heard which causes her to enquire the meaning of it to which merlin replies that the hundred knights sent by cymons father in quest of him have been drawn together and are preparing to grace the nuptials of cymon and sylvia he reminds urganda that her ill treatment of him has counteracted all her schemes however he shows some dawning of pity for her fallen state which she contritely thinks herself unworthy of then breaking her wand retires with a just remark that power abused deserves to be so annihilated  here a grand procession of the knights is introduced and indeed the execution of this pageantry on the stage is equal to any idea we can form of such an affair but from this and many other pompous attractions thrown out to catch public curiosity of late years we are under a necessity of remarking that such luxury of show indicates a lamentable decay of taste when the eyes usurp the place of or too much influence the ears in dramatic exhibitions judgment is reduced to a deplorable state of servility however this is criticizing rather unfairly while we review a piece founded upon magic in that light the author of cymon has been remarkably modest and introduced as few monstrosities as possible  after the procession merlin gives a kind of nuptial benediction to the happy lovers a chorus is sung to merlins praise after which linco recommends humourously the old proverb be merry and wise this brings on alternate singing with intermingled choruss by the several characters and so ends the romance  we have already hinted that our bard upon so imaginary a plan might if he would have overleaped the bounds of criticism nature and probability much more than he has done without any violent apprehensions of censure as to the style all supernatural agents are insipid except those written by shakespeare therefore merlin and urganda cannot be supposed to utter any thing much worth notice indeed they sometimes entertain us with rhyme which we grant unnatural enough but their prose would do as well for any other personages  upon the whole we cannot greatly applaud our author for purity though we allow him spirit of style nor say much for novelty of sentiment notwithstanding it must be admitted he has made good use of some established maxims his plot has not much intricacy yet is pleasing the scenes are placed in tolerable succession and if there are not the most poignant strokes of humor there is little danger of attentions drowsing  the songs might have been much better or considerably worse mediocrity is the most impartial character we can give notwithstanding a moral was very little to be expected from a piece of this kind yet we find one both pleasing and instructive which is that persevering innocence need not despair under the most apparent and terrifying difficulties of finding effectual assistance that power derived from evil principles is of very fallible and perishable nature and that unspotted virtue is the most valuable possession of life  in respect of the characters we find cymon by enchantment a fool and by the same means restored to a state of sensibility mr vernon who has singular merit as an actor supports him in both situations with commendable ability  merlin is as good natured a conjuror as ever we have met however his interposition on the side of distressed innocence does not proceed so much from sympathy as from jealous resentment conceived against urganda for preferring cymon to him in the ideas of love hence such favorable events arise as render him an amiable agent what he says or does requires very little force of action he depends upon plain level declamatory utterance and stood so far respectable in the hands of mr bensley yet we think him considerably improved by mr bannister  dorus is a good because too true picture of such magistrates as hold justice in the leadingstrings of their own passions and wind her about as caprice or interest directs his amorous inclination throws him into laughable circumstances and mr parsonss performance of him sustains the authors intentions most happily it is considerable merit for action to keep equal pace with the writing but to heighten it as the gentleman now before us does in this part deserves a greater stretch of praise  linco is a character of great vivacity uniformly pleasant from beginning to end not only agreeable from the aptness of his expressions but from their animating benevolent tendency upon this view it is not to be wondered that mr king should dilate the brows of severest criticism and obtain the pleasing tribute of general applause we dont recollect a more disengaged chaste piece of acting and though we dont pretend to determine musical merit yet we are bold to assert that the songs of linco come with as much meaning and entertainment to the ear as airs in their style possibly can do  the damon of revenge has only a song which we apprehend mr champness executes much to the satisfaction of his hearers the shepherds are so inconsiderable that to praise or censure the performers of them would be a waste of criticism  mrs baddeley has merit in urganda but has too placid a set of features and too melodious a voice for the passions and gloomy sentiments of such a part mrs scott though inferior makes a tolerable shift in the enchantress  fatima is composed of spirited archness and is supported with a very capital degree of pleasantry by that excellent comic actress mrs abington we apprehend if the author instead of the trifling upon yes and no had thrown a kind of amorous intercourse between this character and linco both parts would have received considerable addition and two performers of general estimation would have been presented to the audience in a more striking light  sylvia though she did not absolutely die with mrs arne has fallen into very evident consumptive symptoms not but we allow miss radley merit both as an actress and a singer  the shepherdesses cannot be in better hands than those of miss reynolds and miss plym nor is miss burton unworthy favorable notice in one of them at present mrs bradshaw in dorcas fills up the authors idea and gratifies any expectation spectators may form  this romance was certainly intended as a mere theatrical representation and as such it affords very agreeable entertainment as to the closet it can only amuse very young or very weak minds on each of which the notion of enchantment must work a prejudicial effect and therefore we cannot justly recommend it to perusal  cato a tragedy by mr addison the moral tendency of all mr addisons works the strength of expression the harmony of versification the purity of sentiment and the afluence of idea which so eminently distinguish his productions have stamped great estimation on his name as an author perhaps his independent circumstances and station might to the obsequious or ignorant add some luster were we to judge of the play now before us by the complimentary copies of verses which precede it we should naturally presume it one of the most correct and amazing efforts of genius yet mr dennis a bold and laborious critic undertook to point deficiencies in every scene and though his remarks wore in general the appearance of snarling yet many of his strictures and those very severe ones were indisputably just his review however we have not been able to procure a copy of and retain but a very slight recollection of it therefore what we offer will neither incur the censure due to his apparent malevolence or rob him of any praise his ingenuity may deserve we shall trace the piece as we have done others not hunt after trifling slips nor on account of a great name slip over material ones we confess an exalted idea of the author but will not be blind to his faults  cato commences with portius and marcus the former cooly and the latter impetuously lamenting the perilous state of their father and their country they are both furnished with observations worthy of great and patriotic minds but marcus diminishes much by introducing his amorous passion when matters of so much deeper concern claim attention and portius disgraces his dignity by mean dissimulation the advice he gives marcus is worthy a philosopher but when we consider it springs from a desire of weaning him from the object of his own affection it sinks under the denomination of plausible artifice thus the elder brother becomes less an object of estimation in this scene than the younger on the appearance of sempronius marcus retires to prevent his mental agitation from being discovered  sempronius not immediately seeing portius hints at a conspiracy but goes to no point of explanation as the youth catches his eye under a previous profession of dissimulation he speaks as a son of liberty mourning her approaching fate a fine compliment to cato occurs that of his virtues rendering the penurious and shattered remains of romes senate awful it is astonishing why our author should have blended so much love with a subject so foreign to it yet sempronius mentions his passion for marcia as does juba sometime after so that there are four swains employed in sighing even while caesar is at and ready to storm their gates portius indeed justly mentions that it is a most unfavourable season to court his sister and goes off with a spirited resolution of encouraging the soldiers to fulfill their duty as romans  on his departure sempronius in soliloquy gives us to understand that he expects syphax a numidian chief to grant him assistance in matters of mischief then informs us that catos refusal of marcia to his wishes rouses resentment and thence intimates a design of giving up cato to caesar syphaxs appearance brings this point to further explanation the numidian general declares his troops ready for a revolt but at the same time acknowledges and laments jubas firm attachment to the virtuous roman sempronius however urges a fresh trial to bring over that young prince we admire mr addisons idea of hypocritical patriotism where on the principles of deception he makes sempronius speak thus i will conceal my thoughts in passion it is the surest way i will bellow out for rome and for my country and mouth at caesar till i shake the senate your cold hypocrisys a stale device a wornout trick  would thou be thought in earnest cloth thy feigned zeal in rage in fire in fury   he goes off to cultivate a spirit of mutiny amongst the roman soldiers and leaves his friend to work if possible upon juba the young prince immediately appears and taxes syphax with looks of gloomy coldness desiring an explanation the old man in a short blunt reply throws a sarcastical charge on and disclaims roman dissimulation this draws from juba a liberal compliment in favor of his allies in return syphax enters into a spirited comparison of numidian worth but confines himself to martial excellence while juba very sensibly contrasts the moral and social virtues this warms the rough impatience of the old general who gives his expression such scope that the prince is under a necessity of giving a check which stomachs the veteran and causes him to try the pathetic by making mention of jubas dying father afterward he touches upon jubas love as the foundation of his other attachments and paints the superior charms of those beauties who may be met with in his own court of zama but the royal youth most sensibly returns that his regard is fixed upon internal not external merit here marcia and lucia appear which causes syphax to retire execrating the former as being conscious that a smile from her can overturn all the power of his persuasion  the intercourse between juba and his mistress we deem extremely insipid the lady indeed judiciously reproves her lovers whining at such an interesting point of time and sends him off to more material concerns with becoming resolution lucia who seems to have softer and less noble ideas than marcia upbraids her with giving the goodnatured prince as she oddly styles him such treatment catos daughter however manifests great good sense in proceeding upon the principles of selfdenial rather than effeminate the public cause lucia confesses herself unequal to such fortitude hence arises a discovery of her attachment to one of marcias brothers which on enquiry proves to be portius this makes marcia commiserate and plead the cause of marcus lucia confesses great perplexity between the two lovers which marcia strives to soften by a friendly and pious observation that present sorrow under celestial influence may lead to future happiness she concludes the act with a very beautiful simile harmoniously but unnaturally expressed in rhyme  act the second introduces the roman senate in expectation of cato who after a few prefatory lines appears in his address to the senate he informs them with just dignity of sentiment how affairs stand and observes the necessity from caesars near approach of determining upon defensive or submissive measures sempronius according to what he mentions in the first act delivers himself with all the impetuosity of a zealot for liberty he draws an irritative picture of past transactions and concludes with a bold figure of being called to vindictive measures by the mourning shades of departed citizens  cato in return with political as well as philosophical moderation observes that impassioned arguments and resolutions are seldom founded in reason and that those who are entrusted with the lives of fellow subjects should avoid waste of blood upon principles of false fame the opinion of lucius runs in a mild and pacific turn which occasions sempronius to drop a malevolent insinuation against him however cato maintaining a just equilibrium of deliberation draws a just and instructive line of distinction between an overheated rapidity of opinion and a frigid coldness wisely observing that though it is necessary to avoid romantic rashness it is incumbent on brave men and free spirits to use with becoming intrepidity all those means which providence has put into their hands from what he says resistance upon prudential and virtuous principles seems to be his resolution which he closes with a glorious observation upon the intrinsic value of incorrupt liberty  being acquainted by marcus that an ambassador from caesar demands admittance with the senates concurrence he orders the admission of decius who greets him in friendly terms and is answered with a most elevated reserve where they only appertain to himself but with much forceable and expletive dignity where public concerns are touched upon  through the whole of this admirable interview our hero throws aside the paltry consideration of self with princely contempt and his spirited terms for the good of his country outstretch all praise the author has also contrived to sustain decius in so agreeable a light that it requires almost stoical firmness not to think with him that catos unshakeable perseverance is rather too rigid and that he speaks more in the style of conquest than unequal competition  upon the departure of caesars representative sempronius is forward to thank cato for his resolute conduct and takes an opportunity of being rough with lucius for which he receives an elegant reproof from cato seeing juba approach the senators retire when a short interview succeeds between that prince and cato who tells the numidian what resolution the senate have taken after approving what he hears juba by a diffident round about method makes absurd mention of marcia to which her father replies with keen and suitable brevity leaving the lover in a state of astonished perplexity  in this condition of mind syphax finds his royal master and artfully tries therefrom to work up the passion of resentment for which deep purpose he sooths his vanity with praise and again recalls the idea of his father then comes plump on the object of his affection pointing out a way to make her his in spite of cato which expedient we find to be carrying her off by force this juba rejects with laudable and consummate disdain giving syphax some very severe and just reproofs for so unworthy a proposition these warm the old man into expressions improper for a subject and juba is in consequence irritated so far as to give him the stinging appellation of traitor a term which awakens his caution and warns him of having overstepped the bounds of prudence this indiscretion he endeavors to repair by humble concession which not taking immediate effect he most artfully disclaims all approbation of the scheme he proposed and says the design of carrying off marcia by force was only suggested to palliate the pains of his princes love this works happily on jubas tender unsuspecting nature and the practiced politician worms himself into an additional degree of confidence by speaking in high terms of catos precepts and example falling into this trap of deception the prince offers kind reconciliation and withdraws however syphax in a short soliloquy points out the difference of age and youth with respect to affronts and resolves upon an entire attachment to caesar  semproniuss entrance brings on further explanation and upon syphaxs enquiry how cato deports himself amidst surrounding perils he receives the following answer replete with poetical beauty  thou have seen mount atlas when storms and tempests thunder on its brows and oceans break their billows at its feet it stands unmoved and glories in its height there never was a finer idea struck out of a great man remaining unshaken amidst many violent assaults of frowning fortune syphax mentions the impossibility of gaining juba to their side to which sempronius makes a kind of ludicrous reply and the design of gaining marcia for him occurs upon comparing notes they seem to think every point of the prospect favors their design as an assistant to the roman mutineers syphax promises that the numidians under his command shall be ready at the moment and he draws a most fanciful similitude between the storm of sedition and those overwhelming whirlwinds which often rise in the african deserts nothing can be more elegantly expressed but the jingle is very offensive to criticism founded on nature  the third act opens with marcus and portius conversing upon the love affair which we have already condemned as a very censurable intrusion upon the dignity of this piece  we find marcus as at the beginning overheated with passion and portius endeavoring to mitigate him the former deputes the latter to be his advocate to solicit lucias favor for him this the latter attempts to decline and seems to feel some touches for playing a double dealing part however he dare not speak openly therefore upon lucias appearance is left by his brother to plead the cause of his love and how does he do it by advising the lady to act as hypocritically as himself this however she generously declines and vows not to enter the nuptial tie with portius however warmly inclined thereto while such family affliction is likely to flow from their union this resolution alarms the impatient feelings of portius who charges the fair one with coldness and exclaims in terms frantically inconsistent with the idea we have hitherto formed of his character the ladys fainting is a most laughable circumstance and the whole scene which ends as it began is such a labored unfinished aim at unessential passion that we heartily wish it annihilated  when lucia retires marcus comes forward to enquire his fate and forms an explanation of it from the confused countenance of his brother this interview is made up of as strange and uninteresting materials as the former nor can we think how the author could have carried them off with any grace had not a martial symphony roused their attention it is some plea in favor of the young heroes that love has not totally enervated patriotism but that as portius observes they are warmed to action by the trumpets voice  sempronius having ripened his mutineers to action now appears at their head encouraging them to persevere this is promised when cato enters with philosophic fortitude he questions the mutineers concerning the motives of their base conduct and rates them with irresistible proofs of their ingratitude sempronius who perceives their spirits sinking curses their timidity and when lucius recommends their contrition to catos mercy urges severest execution evidently to screen himself however cato declining every trace of cruelty dooms them to death in the mildest manner observing with great propriety when by just vengeance guilty mortals perish the gods behold their punishment with pleasure and lay the uplifted thunderbolt aside   when this matter is settled and cato goes off we perceive the mutineers have considered semproniuss behavior as calculated to deceive cato in their favor however they find too late that their imperfect dastardly behavior as well it might has sired him to the most eager resentment and are carried off to meet an ignominious fate indeed they are the strangest instruments of sedition we have ever met and seem to be introduced for no other reason than to give cato two or three good speeches and to insinuate that his awful presence was sufficient to look men out of their lives  this scheme being rendered abortive syphax enters tells sempronius that his numidian troops are all mounted and advises an attack upon the gate where marcus holds watch by seizing of which they may gain caesars camp here cupid interferes again and reminds sempronius that marcia is left behind this difficulty started syphax like an adept in the arts of intrigue as well as those of political treachery proposes carrying her off and for prosecuting this matter with more certainty promises to furnish sempronius not only with the habit of juba but his guards also by means of which he may gain easy access to marcias chamber this delightful masquerade scheme so consistent with tragedy and this in particular is highly relished by sempronius who draws from it the most favorable omens of success and concludes the third act with a pompous highflown assimilation of his projected adventure to the rape of proserpine  the two ladies favor us with their appearance at the beginning of the fourth act lucia still complaining of her wonderful perplexity reminds marcia of her similar situation between juba and sempronius but places those lovers in a faint point of view when compared with her inimitable portius it is true love will be partial but need not be made unpolite marcia declares dislike of sempronius and approbation of juba but dutifully supposes she has no will of her own during catos life at the sound of approaching feet these female friends retire and make way for sempronius as juba to appear during his exultation at the near completion of his bold wishes juba to his utter astonishment enters thus confronted nothing but the death of one or both can decide their contention this lot falls upon sempronius who dies with a vindictive execration in his mouth while juba goes to acquaint cato with so strange and interesting an event  lucia and marcia alarmed with the clash of swords again come forward when the royal habit of numidia being perceived on a dead body marcia with the precipitate fears of love immediately concludes it to be juba and throwing off all reserve proclaims her passion in the warmest most undisguised terms at which critical juncture her living lover comes within hearing and becomes a transported witness of her amorous explanation till unable longer to contain he presents himself to her astonished view and heals her poignant woe she seems to regret that her heart has been so fully set to view but generously confirms the princes happiness by repeating her declarations of regard thus they are sent off the stage tolerably happy after the most ridiculous bopeep transactions that ever disgraced any piece of serious composition the whole love episode is indisputably pitiful but this last mentioned scene deserves sovereign contempt  cato and lucius next come forward the latter expressing surprise at semproniuss conduct the former like an able practical judge of life declaring that general depravity takes away all subjects of surprise  portius with looks indicating deep concern approaches and is questioned by his father if caesar has shed more roman blood an interrogation animated with the true spirit of greatness signifying that no other cause should move such apparent anxiety on being told of syphaxs perfidious retreat and that an attack is made upon marcuss post heroically forgetting the apprehensions of a tender parent he is only concerned for his sons behavior and sends off portius express to see that his brothers duty is fulfilled on the appearance of juba covered with shame for his generals treacherous behavior cato manifests great liberality of mind in softening a charge of guilt the young prince levels against himself as being a numidian of which character syphax has just given so abominable a specimen  portiuss return and abrupt mention of marcus alarms our heros fears least his son has been any way deficient but upon hearing the manner of his fall after a very gallant defense the illustrious roman utters a most noble and comprehensive exclamation in two words  i am satisfied  never did any author suit expression to character and circumstance better than mr addison has done in this welladapted stroke of significant brevity syphaxs fate is a pleasing sacrifice to justice and draws from cato a line of real dignity mixed with paternal tenderness  on meeting the corpse of his son in such a mangled condition any father possessed of mere natural feelings would manifest a weakness though an amiable one but cato buoyed up by uncommon resolution and the love of his country supports the shock of so affecting an object with admirable firmness nay draws a pleasing picture of death obtained upon so glorious an occasion and speaks of it in such inspirative terms that the frowns of the king of terrors melt into smiles  pointing out the example of the dead to the living son is judicious and affecting and we are of opinion that an almost unparalleled magnimity of mind is manifested in letting sorrows melting tribute fall for the miseries of his country though he refused it to the decease of a beloved son  his description of romes decay rises in a beautiful climax and concludes with a severe stroke upon caesar as a political parricide the disdain he shows at any idea of soliciting or receiving caesars mercy is noble his advice to portius worthy of a philosopher the attention paid to the safety of his friends generous and the leave he takes of them pathetic if he had not been carried off by the monotonous jingle of meter we do not perceive one idea or expression throughout this scene which we could wish altered in any shape nor do we know where rational sensations can be more profitably gratified than by an adequate representation of it  though we cannot admit of an equality with hamlets celebrated soliloquy yet we readily place that of cato at the beginning of the fifth act before any other we have met the chain of reasoning is well compacted the sentiments reach a very uncommon degree of elevation and instruction pours forth from every line the intrusion of portius through filial anxiety for his fathers safety is reproved rather sternly by cato however he soon calms and collects himself against the worst events that fortune may have in store gives his mourning son hopes and retires to take the refreshment of some sleep to recruit his exhausted spirits  marcia joins her brother portius who comforts her with the idea that cato is more composed and has determined to live for the service of rome when lucia comes on we find her still harping on the love affair amazingly out of season as we think especially as she seems to draw an uncouth inference in her own favor from the melancholy circumstance of marcuss death a circumstance not very fit for an affectionate sisters ear lucius coming on gives an account of catos pleasant situation in his sleep which we think rather too close upon catos exit for him to fall asleep and lucius to watch him so minutely as he has done besides orders were given that no person should approach him but this even in the view we place it is a very venial slip by intelligence portius brings there are hopes of succors to relieve utica and to place cato in a probability of redeeming the glory or staying the fate of rome but this transient dawn of comfort soon passes off on the wings of an alarm raised by hearing a groan from catos chamber  by the suddenness of this after luciuss account one would be almost led to think cato had stabbed himself in his sleep that he has given the fatal wound is confirmed by his appearance in an expiring condition the address he makes to his afflicted children and mourning friends is very consonant to his character benevolence paternal tenderness and invincible resolution attend his last moments and he falls into eternity an object of admiration though a very dangerous and censurable subject of imitation for any man in any station  lucius concludes the piece with deducing a diffuse general moral from catos fall which observed in a national sense as the author undoubtedly meant it furnishes very useful political instruction and warns us against the perilous consequences of civil commotions which with undistinguishing rage sweep away the most virtuous as well as the most vicious characters nay indeed oftener fall heavy on the former as foes to licentiousness than the latter who thrive in and consequently are most active to support it  having thus gone through a piece which at its first representation from several causes made a great noise and met uncommon approbation even from contending parties we cannot help observing after due acknowledgment of its useful political and in many places moral tendency that the author has in several scenes trifled with his subject strangely and we confess much surprised that a person of mr addisons judgment should have enervated his genius which had much more dignity than softness with such insipid love scenes so incongruous to the rest of his piece especially when a more uniform plan could have been pursued by introducing caesar in his camp dispatching decius on his embassy making him treat the proffered treacherous assistance of sempronius with contempt and bringing him after catos death upon the stage to offer some just strictures on the impropriety of his killing himself which even as a roman caesar might have done since it is very certain that a life of so much public consequence should not be sacrificed to selfish pride admitting that suicide in other cases might be justified   we are sorry that selfdestruction is placed in so fair a point of view and therefore think the catastrophe of this tragedy highly censurable because evidently pernicious  in point of character as a man cato strikes us with awful yet agreeable sensations he is a cool philosoper a warm patriot a resolute chief an eloquent senator a tender parent and an affectionate friend but as the brightest composition manifests specks so we find this great man tainted with such a degree of inflexible pride that when he should stand most collected he gives way to that powerful principle and rashly flies from his country children and faithful associates into the arms of death  to personate this character happily requires consequence both of person and countenance a melifluous extensive fullness of voice and depth of judgment theatrical chicane cannot be of any service we doubt not but it will seem treason against the majesty of established criticism to doubt mr quins superiority within the last thirty years yet we must venture the bold assertion that deducting his figure aspect and suitable voice he was as erroneous as such attributes would admit his action had a labored sameness in it his utterance appeared more subservient to the cadences of measure than the periods of sense and his tones frequently swelled into offensive pomposity in some of the lines to decius he struck out beauties in receiving the news of marcuss fall he was fine and wept for his country in the following scene like a great man but his soliloquy and most other parts of the character were chaunted in a very culpable manner so far that we will be hardy enough to assert to a nice ear he proved himself more of the methodical spouter than the affluent orator  mr sheridan wants face and figure much but speaks the author unexceptionably and by keeping his voice more within its compass than in parts of greater force and variety must render impartial criticism great pleasure for a dumb cato we should have given mr quin great preeminence but for a speaking one prefer mr sheridan with all his imperfections as coming nearer the author and nature  mr mossop from what we have observed can never be admired as a declaimer such emphasis hunting as he is guilty of shames oratory and stiffened awkwardness of deportment ill supplies the place of ease and dignity mr ross was too much of the gentleman too little of the hero in externals and as to speaking the part his utmost merit only reaches the praise of delivering his part in the manner of a welltutored schoolboy at mr rules or any other academy mr walker discovered four or five years since at covent garden a very considerable share of merit but not enough to serve as a standing dish for public entertainment  as we cannot remember all the persons we have seen in the several parts of this play it is hoped that mention of those who strike our recollection will suffice  portius appears to be sensible and virtuously inclined but dissembles shamefully with his brother and is in action very insipid mr bensleys representation of him gives us tolerable satisfaction  marcus is of an undisguised generous warm temper and if tolerably supported always claim respect on the stage mr ryan did him originally and we doubt not with great merit but was too much in the vale of years when we saw him to look any thing like the character however we suppose he did it for the same reason a strolling player of sixty once gave for retaining the part of the school boy i have done it says he forty years ago and therefore think i have a right to do it now mr dyer has afforded us satisfaction in this character and mr wroughton though la la was more sufferable than in any other part we have seen him play  juba is a welldisposed young prince and seems to have ideas of establishing same on worthy principles his attachment to cato would however redound much more to his honor if there was not reason to suppose his love for marcia the foundation of it in point of action he cannot be rendered very striking being too much in the style of mediocrity the best we remember to have seen was mr digges who gave him much more force and variety than mr smith though we think the latter a tolerable numidian prince  sempronius is a rogue of very black dye who does not scruple to attempt giving the last stab to expiring liberty and who wants to betray the most virtuous citizen merely on account of being refused the object of his amorous passion he is a fairfaced villain and couches dark designs under the veil of patriotic professions extent and weight of expression are essential to this part wherefore we are induced to pronounce mr mossop the best within our knowledge mr sparks was extremely respectable and we have received some pleasure from mr clarke in this treacherous senator  syphax is a rogue also and disloyal to his prince but he is so upon rather a stronger principle than sempronius for having conceived a fixed antipathy against the romans whose polished manners he interprets effeminacy and being enraged at jubas attachments to cato he endeavors to persuade him therefrom which being declined with harsh terms the testy old numidian takes the personal affront close to heart and thoroughly connects himself with semproniuss views this character we deem better drawn than any other in the piece and supported with great uniformity of spirit  mr the cibber in our judgment formed a more adequate idea of syphax than any other performer his dissimulation and testiness was described excellently by that judicious comedian but he retained so much of the cant which is now happily exploded that we could only applaud him for what he meant not what he did mr gibson is a mighty lukewarm representative of the old numidian but unless mr hull should venture on him is as well as any other person at present in covent garden indeed to say truth take it for all in all there never was such a mangled spectacle seen at a theater royal as this tragedy was in april    0 at that house and however strange the assertion may seem it is strictly true that mr gardner manifested more characteristic merit in lucius than any other person in the whole drama of all the deciuss we have seen we dont recollect one sufficiently to authorize particular mention  marcia is a lady possessed of just and elegant sentiments a worthy offspring of the great cato except where she is rendered rather ridiculous by the metamorphose and fall of sempronius mrs woffington gave that importance to the character by her figure and action which mr addison left for the actress to supply mrs bellamy sustained the part very well so did mrs hamilton as to miss miller lately she was inoffensive and that is as high as most of the young performers can reach  lucia is a very tenderhearted fair one violently enamoured yet says or does very little worthy the the least notice a good tragic actress might be rendered insipid by such a part no wonder then that mrs mattocks should move through it without any degree of praise mrs stephenss manner and expression is better calculated to make things of this sort agreeable than any other theatrical lady we know  party is of a very dangerous nature to dramatic representations but both whigs and tories taking this piece as a compliment to themselves strenuously supported it and gave a sanction it never deserved for we must absolutely deny its theatrical excellence it is certainly a moral colloquial poem of great merit but a tragedy full of defects it should be immortal in the closet but cannot justly claim possession of the stage  as you like it a comedy by shakespeare this pastoral comedy for such it may properly be styled opens with orlando and adam the former a young gentleman recounting to the latter steward of the family the scanty provision made for him by the will of his father and the cruelty of his elder brother who treats him with much contempt not only neglecting his education but putting him under the severe necessity of associating with menial servants this he confesses rankles in his mind and he expresses a commendable determination to bear it no longer here his elder brother oliver appears and accosts him in a churlish manner to which he replies at first with complacence but upon irritation makes spirited retorts and their conference rises to a quarrel which the old man endeavors to soften orlando claims his small patrimony or more respectful usage the former seems most agreeable to oliver who partly promises it and then not only dismisses his brother with much malevolence but forbids adam his house also  from an interview between oliver and charles the wrestler we find that duke senior is banished by his brother but that rosalind on account of the affection celia duke frederics daughter bears her does not go into exile with him upon charless mention that he hears orlando has a private intention of wrestling with him suggests to oliver a most brutal idea no less than the destruction of his innocent brother and this he cultivates by bribing the wrestler to exert all his superior strength against him with the utmost malevolence and after this ready agent of his malice disappears gives a most extraordinary reason for his hatred of orlando no other than the many amiable qualities of that youth which he is either unable or unwilling to imitate  rosalind and celia succeed this worthy blade the former expressing a dejection of spirits on account of her fathers exile the latter offering cordial consolation which prevails and produces sportive mention of love which celia rather seems to think dangerous to play with some speeches when fortune is proposed as a subject of their mockery we cannot help transcribing on account of the truth and pleasantry of those ideas they create benefits says rosalind are mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind lady does most mistake in her gifts to women to which celia prettily replies it is true for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest and those that she makes honest she makes very illfavored however we think according to a custom of shakespeares they play too long upon words and wear imagination threadbare the clown appears as a messenger and desires celia to go to her father in that familiar style adopted by such gentry his assuring the truth of what he has said upon his honor occasions an egregious but laughable quibble of terms  when le beu enters he acquaints the ladies that they have lost much sport upon enquiry into the nature of the amusement they have missed it appears to be a wrestling match wherein three young fellows have had many bones broke are in danger of their lives while their aged father is distracted with grief at their misfortune which as the clown sensibly observes must be notable sport for ladies  duke frederic with orlando charles etc enter the duke humanely pitying orlandos inequality of person for an athletic contention has endeavored to dissuade him from the trial but in vain wherefore frederic desires the young ladies to try their persuasion this kind task they readily undertake and delicately enter upon the subject however the young man appears to be under a gloominess of mind which makes life or death a matter of indifference to him the ladies seeing him so hazardously bent afford him all they can good wishes for success  the wrestler vaunts his superiority with great apparent confidence while orlando shows engaging contrast modesty this contention though an odd incident for the stage occasions an agreeable anxiety and the effect of it orlandos victory very pleasing sensations making rosalind and her cousin extend favor to the weaker party is a just and genteel compliment to female generosity  upon enquiry who orlando is and finding him the son of sir rowland de boys duke frederic seems to entertain strong prejudice against his father and goes off abruptly rosalind here mentions the affectionate regard her father had for sir rowland which prejudices her in favor of orlando to whom she and her cousin offer congratulation for his escape and unexpected success upon their going off he drops a hint in two lines of a particular effect rosalind has had on him here le beu enters and acquaints orlando that whatever fair appearance duke frederic might wear his temper is of a dangerous uncertain nature and cannot safely be trusted therefore advices his departure  orlandos enquiry which was the dukes daughter is answered by information that rosalind the taller is daughter of the banished and celia of the reigning duke who by le beus intimation entertains a dislike of his niece which is soon likely to appear orlando thanks his friendly adviser and they go off severally  celia and rosalind reenter from what occurs between them we perceive that rosalind has suddenly conceived more than a friendly regard for orlando the duke now makes his appearance in great wrath though from what immediate provocation we know not and dooms his niece to sudden banishment rosalind modestly pleads her innocence and celia urges her friendship as motives for remission of so harsh a sentence but the duke seems immovable in his whimsical severity and even limits the extent of rosalinds stay celias determination to share the exile of her cousin and friend manifests most amiable and tender generosity of mind they determine to seek duke senior in the forest of arden agree to disguise themselves rosalind as a man celia as a shepherdess and go off with a composure of mind truly philosophical  the second act commences with the old duke and his faithful followers as forresters we have more than once objected to frequency and length of quotation notwithstanding considerable pains might have been saved thereby however we are now come to a speech so replete with moral meaning and poetical beauty that we cannot avoid presenting it as a treat to the reader  now my comates and brothers in exile has not old custom made this life more sweet than that of painted pomp are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court here feel we but the penalty of adam the seasons difference as the icy phang and churlish chiding of the winters wind which when it bites and blows upon my body even till i shrink with cold  i smile and say this is no flattery  these are counselors that feelingly persuade me what i am  sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous wears yet a precious jewel in his head and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in every thing jaquess account of the sequestered stag which follows this excellent speech the satire therein couched against that most abominable perversion of nature ingratitude is pathetically pleasing but we are resolved to resist the temptation of transcribing it and therefore refer those to the play who wish a perusal of it assuring every competent judge that taste cannot have a higher or more valuable gratification  when these rural philosophers as we may call them retire duke frederic and some attendant lords appear the duke intent upon finding out his eloped daughter as we remember this short scene is omitted in representation and in perusal seems of very little importance unless we receive it in the light of mere connection nor can it be then very material however search is ordered for the runaways and as orlando is supposed of the party his elder brother is called upon  the scene changing to olivers house orlando appears knocking at the door and is answered by adam a most feeling conversation ensues wherein adam speaks powerfully to every generous sensation his offering the small sum his economy has saved to orlandos use is truly affecting his reliance on that general providence which caters for beasts of the field and birds of the air is worthy a pious sensible heart and the distinction he makes between temperate and licentious youth admirably instructive orlandos grateful sense of this good and affectionate old stewards behavior is by no means inadequate and their going off stamps a regard which must render them both acceptable to the audience whenever they appear  rosalind in her masculine habit with celia and the clown now present themselves much wearied with their journey however the clown indulges his quaint witticisms corin an old shepherd and sylvius a young one come forward the latter mentioning his love for phoebe the former advising him to a moderation of his passion rosalind sympathizes with sylvius they ask corin for his assistance in respect of some refreshment and receive an hospitable answer upon his telling them that the farm and flocks he belongs to are to be sold rosalind and celia express a desire of becoming purchasers and constitute the old shepherd their agent for that purpose  a very insignificant scene between jacques amiens etc ensues indeed there is a song which by the help of dr arnes very agreeable music renders it tolerable  we next perceive orlando sustaining adam who faints for want of food with very tender care and promising to procure something he desires the good old man to rest under some shelter till he comes back  duke senior and his lords appear next to whom jaques comes with mirthful aspect occasioned as he says by a conference he has had with a motley fool of which he gives a beautiful and instructive account upon their sitting down to a rural entertainment they are accosted by orlando whose sudden unreserved attack occasions the duke to enquire what the cause of such an abrupt intrusion may be which he explains by a plea of necessity on receiving a cordial invitation to sit at the table he softens into grateful gentleness and expresses himself in the following truly poetical lines  i thought that all things had been savage here and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment  but whatever ye are that in this desert inaccessible under the shade of melancholy boughs lose and neglect the creeping hours of time if ever you have looked on better days if ever been where bells have knolled to church if ever sat at any good mans feast if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear and know what it is to pity and be pitied let gentleness my strong enforcement be in the which thought i blush and hide my sword notwithstanding the evident beauties in this speech we conceive two objections one is to the word inaccessible which puts us in mind of what an irish judge once said to the high sheriff of a county really mr sheriff the roads to this town are impassable to which the sheriff very properly replied pray then how did your lordship get hither so might the duke ask orlando how he got into the inaccessible place  the word desert also seems very much misapplied when speaking of a forest for as we apprehend the term properly implies a waste tract of country with scarce any trace of vegetation our second objection to the manner of placing the words lose and neglect they should certainly be transposed  the dukes replying to orlando upon those ideas he has suggested is prettily imagined and the young mans attention to his old friend extremely amiable this unexpected guest and the account he has given draws from the duke a most useful consolatory and philosophical remark that however unhappy we may be there are others as much or more so jaques here delivers that masterly picture of human life commonly called the seven ages which we should think it our duty to transcribe but that it has been so often quoted and parodied that scarce any person can be unacquainted with it  orlando entering with adam they receive a kind welcome and partake of the entertainment while amiens sings that agreeable and sensible song blow blow thou winters wind the duke learns who orlando is and mentions in the conclusive speech of this act the regard he had for that young mans father  duke frederic appears at the beginning of the third act demanding orlando of his brother oliver in angry terms and upon not receiving a satisfactory answer he orders a sequestration of olivers effects with banishment of his person this short scene is often omitted in representation but we think it should always be retained  orlando now constituted one of duke seniors followers as a tribute to his love hangs up a copy of verses addressed to rosalind in a tree expressing his passion in an agreeable soliloquy  corin and touchstone entertain us with a conversation which exhibits several strokes of sensible though whimsical satire but delicacy is much offended by several passages however the following speech of corin makes amends for many slips sir i am a true labourer i earn that i eat get that i wear owe no man hate envy no mans happiness glad of other mens good content with my harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck  rosalind comes in reading orlandos verses on herself which the clown very humorously burlesques celia enters reading another poem of amorous tendency after sending off the clown and corin she enters into a conference with her cousin rosalind upon the verses and the writer of them and after teizing her with suspense informs her that orlando is the man which throws rosalind into a pretty natural palpitation of heart seeing orlando and jaques approach they draw back while a short discourse passes between those gentlemen the latter of whom cynically rails at the formers soft amorous tendency which brings on retorts from each side not of the civilest nature when jaques goes off rosalind approaches with confidence under favor of her disguise and rallies orlando with very pleasing vivacity her distinctions respecting the paces of time are peculiarly pleasant  the picture drawn of a lover and the method of cure for amorous feelings show a just idea of nature rosalinds mode of drawing in orlando to woo her as his mistress is an agreeable device for this purpose she takes him off to show him her cot that he may call every day  a scene of some little laugh succeeds between the clown and audry which is generally concluded in representation by a most pitiful and fulsome rhyme to the womans name rosalind and celia succeed expressing some doubts concerning orlandos constancy the old shepherd comes on and acquaints them that the lovesick swain silvius whom they have often enquired after is at hand with his hardhearted mistress when the sylvan pair enter they listen on finding phoebe obstinately bent against silviuss solicitation rosalind steps in to his assistance and catechises the scornful shepherdess with great humor checking him also for prostituting his praise to increase that vanity which damps his suit phoebe throws out a few hints of tender regard for rosalind which are treated with disdain and silvius is ordered to pursue her after rosalind and celia go off we find phoebe lavish in praise of the former as a captivating youth however she softens so far in favor of silvius that she admits of his wooing then expresses some resentment at the freedom with which rosalind treated her determines on writing a sharp letter in return which silvius promises to deliver and thus the act concludes  in the first scene of the fourth act we are entertained with a good deal of spirited quibble and wordcatching between rosalind and orlando one passage is so peculiarly beautiful that its merit will sufficiently apologize for its appearing here when orlando says he will love for ever and a day she replies say a day without the ever no no orlando men are april when they woo december when they wed maids are may when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock pidgeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more new fangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey i will weep for nothing like diana in the fountain and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and that when you are asleep  when orlando goes off to attend the duke at dinner rosalind professes regard for him even to a romantic degree of warmth and she gives a whimsical account of cupid here a short scene between jaques and some other forresters intervene but is omitted in representation so that silvius comes on directly to rosalind with phoebes letter which is no sooner perused but rosalind styles it rank abuse however on communicating the contents it appears the enamoured shepherdess has strung together several jingling couplets of compliment silvius is confounded by his message and the strange interpretation of it which causes rosalind to send him with a charge to phoebe that she must love him  here oliver approaches the ladies enquiring for their cottage celia points out its situation however from appearance he judges them to be the persons he seeks for upon being confirmed in this opinion he presents a bloody napkin to rosalind and orlandos excuse for not coming according to appointment the description of his own perilous situation and the generous interposition of orlando to save his life are set forth with much poetical beauty but absurdity in point of circumstances strikes our perception plainly for how could all he mentions have happened during the short interval of orlandos absence particularly how has he had time to change from the wretched state of being ragged and overgrown with hair in which be lay under the oak to his present appearance indeed he talks of being led to the duke who ordered him array and entertainment but upon the whole we think matters are oddly hudled together merely to favor a flight of fancy  the hurt orlando has received in his skirmish with the lioness overpowers the spirit of rosalind that she faints under the depression and is led home by celia and oliver  at the beginning of the fifth act touchstone and audry offer themselves to view and are joined by william a simpleton upon whose weakness touchstone indulges his own supposed wit very liberally an account of audry at last he breaths out most terrible threats if william should entertain any thoughts of that amiable creature this is a scene which makes us laugh without our knowing why and consists more of mere whim than good sense or useful satire upon a summons by the old shepherd they go off  orlando and oliver next appear the former as well he may expressing some surprise that celia as aliena should have so sudden and forceable an effect upon the latter it is indeed an affair of much haste however oliver not only acquaints us with his own passion but also informs us that aliena has exchanged love with him when duke frederic banished oliver order was given to sequester all his possession and from the condition in which orlando found him it is reasonable to think those orders had been amply fulfilled yet here he proposes giving his estate to orlando and turning shepherd himself for the sake of aliena  when rosalind comes on after expressing concern for orlandos accident she confirms olivers account of the love affair between him and celia we wish a hint with which her observation upon the proposed marriage concludes was made delicate on orlandos expressing concern that his happiness is not so near as his brothers she comes to the point and promises if he is so inclined that when his brother is married he shall marry rosalind silvius and phoebe joining company the several parties express themselves prettily as their dispositions lead their conversation is a sort of cross purposes which rosalind ends by satisfying all parties with a string of oenigmatical promises  in representation duke senior with his followers come next to them enter rosalind silvius and phoebe the heroine under favor of disguise urges a previous compact on all sides from her father she extracts a promise that upon restoring his daughter he will give her to orlando from orlando that he will receive her from phoebe that she will marry her or declining that silvius then goes off as she says to make all doubts even  touchstone and audry coming forward the company are entertained with some free significant remarks by the former his proofs of being a courtier and his dissertation upon quarreling are admirable we have not met a severer reproof of the false fire and romantic honor of formal duellists than this affair of touchstones upon a cause seven times removed  rosalind restored to the customary appearance of her sex enters is recognized by her father and lover rejected as a woman by phoebe and thus her compact with all parties becomes fulfilled matters being brought to this agreeable conclusion jaques de boys comes on and acquaints the duke of his restoration duke frederic having been checked in the career of his wickedness and persuaded to resign the dukedom by a religious hermit with this favorable account and a prose epilogue which never fails of working a very pleasing effect the comedy of as you like it concludes  this piece considered at large has a very romantic air the unities suffer severe invasion several scenes are very trifling and the plot is hurried on to an imperfect catastrophe we hear something of olivers being punished as an unnatural abominable brother but have a strong objection to crowning such a monster with fortune and love an interview between the dukes would have afforded an opportunity for genius and judgment to exert themselves commendably however with all its faults there is not a more agreeable piece on the stage the characters are various and all well supported the incidents if not striking are certainly pleasing the sentiments with very few exceptions are pregnant with useful meaning and the language though quaint in some places shows in general strength and spirit worthy of shakespeares pen  duke senior is an amiable character sustained with philosophical dignity turning the frowns of fortune as every man should do into the means and motives of instruction what he says is not of sufficient length to constitute a very conspicuous part in action but if a performer has any declamatory merit he may show it to advantage here we have no objection to mr burton in this noble exile but wish mr ackman may never think of him except as a feast upon his own benefit night that happy season when annuals vegetate into characters of consequence in the drama and large capital letters in the bills  duke frederic is a notorious villain of whom no performer can possibly make any thing wherefore we shall not mention any body jaques a cynical speculatist possessing much good sense with great oddity mr quin was an object of much admiration in this part but from the opinion we have already delivered of that gentlemans declamatory abilities it is impossible to admit that praise the partial misled public allowed him mr sheridan wants nothing criticism can demand he looks the part well enough and speaks it with the same degree of emphatic descriptive feeling with which the author wrote mr digges did it considerable justice mr sparks and mr berry both had merit but were too laborious and heavy mr loves utterance of jaquess fine flowing periods puts us in mind of liquor gurgling through the dissonant passage of a narrownecked bottle  orlando without any striking qualifications is an agreeable personage and never can appear to more advantage than through the late mr palmers representation of him there was a degree of spirited ease manifested by him not easily met with and his personal appearance was most happily adapted mr dexter a performer of merit in several parts rendered this young man very pleasing and mr ross gave as much satisfaction upon the whole as any audience could reasonably expect as to mr reddish he does not look at all like the character and speaks it too sententiously wherefore we cannot allow him that approbation he mostly deserves and we are glad to give him  adam is a most interesting old man and though little seen must always remain in the recollection of a distinguishing spectator we dont recollect to have received greater pleasure from any body than mr moody in this faithful steward whose tender sensibility must sit well also upon the feelings and expression of mr hull  touchstone in sentiment and expression is made up of whim a character quite outre therefore in action cannot be tied down to any exact line of nature mr macklin marked the meaning of this character very strongly but wanted volubility mr woodward is extremely pleasant and indulges an extravagance not censurable however in respect of pointedness and spirit properly mixed a forceable yet free articulation mr king stands foremost in our estimation  we remember to have had the singular pleasure of seeing no less than five ladies perform rosalind with great merit whose names we shall set down in the succession allotted them by our judgment mrs barry mrs pritchard mrs woffington miss macklin and mrs hamilton the three former had a very evident superiority over the two latter and the two first we deem so equal in merit that we only prefer mrs barry as having a more agreeable characteristic appearance mrs woffingtons figure was unexceptionable but her utterance and deportment were too strongly tinctured with affectation especially for the rural swain there is a peculiarity and embarrassment of expression in this part which requires good natural parts or able instruction to hit it off happily  celia has a good deal of pretty unimpassioned speaking as well calculated for mrs baddely and mrs w barry as possible nothing is wanted in the part which those ladies cannot agreeably furnish and audry in mrs bradshaws hands deserves the tribute of laughter for being well figured and as well spoke  it is almost needless to remark that as not one of shakespeares pieces is without abundant beauties so not one can claim the praise of being free from egregious faults however in as you like it the latter fall very short of the former and we make no scruple to affirm that this piece will afford considerable instruction from attentive perusal with great addition of pleasure from adequate representation  we are now come to the end of our first volume with the very singular satisfaction of not having one material objection either public or private offered against our humble endeavors notwithstanding that living authors and performers have been treated with undisguised and we hope liberal freedom if any person mentioned in the foregoing sheets can prove a trace of partial interested friendship unbecoming timidity or determined malevolence if the praise and censure alternately bestowed on the same persons do not appear founded upon reason and nature or at least the offspring of involuntary error the authors of this work will then give up all claim to the unbiassed veracity they originally professed and they once again declare that no connection or view whatever shall in the continuation of this work warp opinion several attempts have been made for that purpose but without effect which they hope will prevent any future ones critics like the roman should exercise justice even upon a son  it was intended to add an investigation of each performers particular requisites and defects but by respectable advice which we shall always follow that part of our design is deferred to the last number of the second volume to which also we shall add a dissertation upon public elocution in general and lay down rules by which most of our criticisms on performance may be tried  we have nothing further to add at present but cordial gratitude for the very candid reception we have met and hope that our slips as several there must be in such a variety of considerations may be pointed out with the same spirit of kind censure we have used to others in the fullness of heart we declare that praise in every instance has given us considerable pleasure and the irksome necessity of finding fault has furnished an equal degree of pain  the list of theatrical mushrooms is also by desire postponed to the end of the next volume when it will no doubt be considerably enriched  the end of the first volume index to the dramatic censor volume i as you like it
