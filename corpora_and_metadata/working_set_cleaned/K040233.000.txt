fun a paroditragicomical satire  as it was to have been performed at the castletavern paternoster row on thursday february         but suppressed by a special order from the lord mayor and court of aldermen  london sold by f stamper in popeshead alley cornhill and by all other booksellers  mdcclii  price one shilling  advertisement the publication of this piece would not have been so long delayed but for the expectation of performing it as at first intended which however by the same indefatigable opposition was still frustrated  preface the father of the following little offspring being very well convinced of the natural weakness of this his puny child did never intend to trust it abroad without the leading strings of action had not the fear of those who like cowards are afraid of their own shadows assiduously opposed the representation being terribly apprehensive that the strength of a poor baby monosyllable might affect the magnanimity of a drawcansir  such is the force of selfconviction  but as this infant is obliged to walk alone by many who are resolved on it is appearance it is father most humbly desires the goodnatured town will not tumble the little creature into the dirt but that they will help it forward over the kennels of detraction and in compassion to the tenderness of it is age keep the barking curs the critics at a distance  and to excite them to this benevolence here follow the memoirs of the cruel and affecting period of its birth etc  this piece of fun son to the father and grandson to the grandfather of the same name was conceived in a fit of laughter about the  th of february in the year       his mother advanced happily in her pregnancy and there were great hopes of a fine offspring but unhappily just before the time of her delivery measures were taken by a certain great man to make her miscarry excited as some say to this piece of barbarity by an old womans prophesy which he keeps by him cast in leaden characters in a chest of brass secured like the fortunate tickets of a lottery by seven locks and of which prophesy the following is a transcript  when fun has a son then drawcansirs race is run however childish and ridiculous it may seem for a man to be affected with such idle stuff as this it is not unprecedented or extravagantly strange since tradition tells us that saturn father of jupiter the great grandfather of cyrus and many other august personages were equally moved by such instigations to much the same absurdities  notwithstanding however all such malignant measures were taken the full time of pregnancy advanced and the child was hourly expected when a positive order came down that mrs fun who then lay at the castletavern paternoster row must not be brought tobed within the walls lest the child which was suspected to be a bastard should bring a scandal on the dignity and chastity of the city upon this even while the lady lay crying out the father waited on the chief personage of the liberties with remonstrances that the child was very honestly got and that none but very creditable people were at the labor complaining at the same time that the same privilege had been permitted an old woman of a very bad character one mother midnight who had often practiced her profession there though it was now denied others  twas all in vain the gentleman though he behaved with a great deal of politeness and goodmanners was so prepossessed against the whole family of fun which had been falsely represented to him as of no character or reputation that he not only forbid the men midwives doing their duty but sent others to see his orders duly executed  what could now be done  mrs fun was in the midst of her travail removed and nobody daring to give her assistance her poor offspring almost perished in the birth but nature had been liberal the stamina were sound and branched out for life it is true indeed its features were so defaced that the strong likeness in them was almost lost and a weakness which will be lasting as it is life is the consequence of the usage it then met with  if after all then it should fail of answering those expectations the town had of it in embrio it will undoubtedly be thought there is reason enough to excuse all the imperfections and failings it is unhappily afflicted with since these are so far from being its faults that they are misfortunes which must infallibly engage the protection of every candid tenderhearted christian reader  prologue as dying sinners hope to get to heaven and beg and pray to have their crimes forgiven so i come here with humble supplication in hopes you will kindly save us from damnation for you must know the whole of this design the plot the manner sentiment is mine it is true we must confess our

she taught me to distort the face and sneer at every thing but want of grace at twelve years old she sent me first to school my tutor ignorance a coxcomb and a fool little i learned it is true but every day the truant played at length ran quite away proud of my freedom rambling up and down folly a jilt that ruins half the town spreading those arms which every fool admires caught me to satisfy

justice and the good of community than the perfect amity of people of power and fortune and which it is necessary they should preserve in order that the lower part of mankind should meet with the punishment due to their offenses  if you will do me the honor with his lordship to step into the next room a moment i will attempt to clear up this affair in which i am sure as you are men of fortune
