letter from mr francis to lord north late earl of guildford  with an appendix  london printed for j debrett opposite burlington house piccadilly  they who were present at the debate in the house of commons on tuesday the twentythird of april      will see the propriety and necessity of the present publication arguments founded on the principles maintained in these papers may possibly appear to the public to have deserved some consideration at least they ought to have been heard  to the right honorable lord north etc etc calcutta   th sept      my lord   i take it for granted that whenever it shall be thought advisable to form a new arrangement for the future government of bengal and for the general security of our acquisitions and establishments in india on some determinate principle and under an united authority the substance of our public letters to the court of directors and of the several minutes signed by sir john clavering colonel monson and myself as far as they may appear to relate to those objects will be duly considered we spared no pains to procure useful information nor neglected any opportunity of communicating it to the company and to government not confining our reflections to the particular subject before us but extending them generally to the political interests and internal administration of the country as far as the occasion would permit and i trust that however our efforts in other respects may have been disappointed of their immediate aim the inquiries we made and the knowledge obtained by them will not be found useless to our successors to execute this part of the duty of our appointment as completely as i can and to enable government to take such measures hereafter for a final arrangement of india affairs as may include every case fit to be provided for and not be defeated in the execution i beg leave to submit to your lordship some important questions on which we have had no proper opportunity of delivering our opinion and which i presume cannot be left undecided at home without great inconvenience to the public service here many of these questions are obvious and will without doubt have already occurred to your lordship i think it necessary nevertheless not to pass by any point whatever on which your lordship might possibly desire an opinion or expect information from me    the first question in the solution of which that of many others will be included is of so much importance and united with political considerations so remote from the immediate interests of bengal that i do not presume to state it in any other shape than simply as a question viz to what extent and in what form the actual sovereignty of great britain over these provinces shall be avowed a higher judgment than mine must determine whether any plan of measures for the internal government of bengal can be perfectly regular systematical or secure which does not suppose and establish a unity of dominion the operations of that power descending from a single source would flow with regularity in their natural channels and never clash with each other    in this observation the object is considered as it stands a country in which the principal branches of the sovereign power are exercised by the east india company where justice is administered partly under the authority of the subadar and partly under that of the king of great britain and where the natives in general acknowledge no king but the mogul whose rights as sovereign are admitted by all indostan under whose authority the revenues are collected and in whose name the current money of bengal is coined the wisdom of his majestys council will determine in what manner these several rights and powers can now be reconciled or adjusted or whether the actual condition of the object will admit of any institutions completely free from exception    if measures already taken and the effects they have produced had no influence on those which must be pursued hereafter the safest the most simple and the least invidious principle on which this territory could be held would have been that of a fixed tribute from the native prince of the country an armed force sufficient to insure his dependence and one strong post for security or retreat on this principle an interference in the internal government would have defeated our own plan and deprived us of the benefit of it acts of power not necessary to the security of the dominion are most felt by the conquered people who once submitting to the dominion itself will not repine at measures indispensibly necessary to preserve it such measures do not invade the laws religion manners or prejudices of the people obedience is their sole object and that government will be best obeyed under which the people are limited the least in the enjoyment of their private rights a wise prince who had made such a conquest as bengal would probably have endeavored to make this use of it    by bringing this policy into view i do not mean to propose it for present practice facts not to be resisted oblige me to banish that idea but though the institution alluded to be in itself unattainable it does not follow that some of it is component principles may not be selected and preserved in raising another edifice    circumstances inseparable perhaps from the constitution of the east india company disqualified them in every sense for the duty and office which the acquisition of a territory in india imposed upon them a body of merchants had interests to provide for besides those which belonged to them in their assumed character of sovereign profit being the only object of a trading company became the sole object of government when the two characters were united commercial principles of the worst quality as derived from the constitution of an exclusive company were all the principles which the india company brought with them into the government of a great kingdom and it has been governed accordingly after raising the revenues as nearly as possible to the level of the rents for the support of their government they monopolized the produce and labor of the country for the support of their trade to obtain the highest possible revenue from the land they were obliged to avow or countenance a principle subversive of all national prosperity and not less false in fact than absurd in theory and dangerous in practice that the ruling power was proprietor of the soil on this principle they universally dispossessed the hereditary and lawful owners and farmed the country to strangers in a few instances where the proprietors were employed it was not in their true character but as farmers of government there is no example i believe of such an act of power in the history of indostan    the companys system supposing it to have no view but the advantage of the body corporate must have ruined bengal without the assistance of their servants though not in so short a period  montesquieu of all despotic governments there is none which oppresses itself more than where the prince declares himself proprietor of the soil and heir of all his subjects it always follows that the cultivation of the earth is abandoned but if besides this the prince is a merchant every species of industry is ruined    the internal jurisdictions of the country fell with the rights of the zemindars who were naturally and by institution the magistrates of the people in the ordinary detail of justice and answerable for the peace of their respective zemindaries great cases were reserved for the decision of the prince    it is true that no attempt has been made to interrupt the natives in the exercise of their religion much less to give them an idea of a better the spirit of persecution or conversion is foreign from the english character nor could any additional profit have been derived from it but the decline of the zemindars has in a great measure deprived the lower classes of one of their principal enjoyments  the shows processions and pageantry of a ceremonious superstition at the same time that the sources out of which many charitable and religious institutions were supported have been reduced or annihilated   0 your lordship will soon perceive how much it is the general object of this representation to establish an opinion that to make the possession of bengal beneficial and permanent we should revert to the ancient institutions of the country as far as we are acquainted with them and present circumstances will permit if it were not for the experience of some years past it might be superfluous to say that we provide for our interests when we consult the happiness and prosperity of the people who labor for us     it appears to have been the companys original policy or that of lord clive to govern these provinces through the medium of the subadar and the best they could adopt supposing them to interpose in any shape in the internal government this system was soon violated in fact and not long afterward avowedly renounced the predominant power of the council at calcutta necessarily reduced the subadar to a cipher and left him and his subjects as it always will do a prey to individuals forms and appearances were however in some degree preserved till the death of syefuldowla in    0 from that period we see nothing in the administration of public affairs but enormous abuses on one side and an absolute want of power or perseverance to correct them on the other but these are topics on which i need not enlarge occasional acts of vigor on the part of the court of directors were little felt or regarded in bengal and neither did nor could produce any lasting improvement in the conduct of their representatives abuses which belong to the nature of the thing and rise directly out of it are not to be corrected by regulations even if the professed intentions of the court of directors had been constantly and sincerely supported the companys government was founded on a falfe and clashing principle and would at all events have produced the effects it has done though perhaps by slower gradations a fortunate choice of men and a firm administration might have checked the rapid growth of abuses and delayed the necessity of an entire change of system to a remoter period under the companys government even this casual resource was not to be expected their servants could not rise to high situations without having spent their youth in the service their minds in general unprepared by education and softened by the climate were open to the impressions of example the extraordinary temptations to which almost every degree of power in this country is exposed has too direct a tendency to corrupt the hand to which it is entrusted but temptation is converted into necessity or may plausibly assume the same colors when high stations are not united with avowed emoluments proportioned to them among other maxims which belonged to the companys commercial institutions and which they transferred to their political government one was not to allow their servants directly even a subsistence on this principle they treated ministers of state and rulers of provinces as they had done clerks and factors they were themselves too powerful to be just and neither did nor could reasonably expect that their servants would not follow their example it was in vain therefore that they sometimes endeavored or pretended to reconcile regularity and justice in the detail of their administration with injustice in its fundamental principle  i mean that of uniting the character of sovereign and merchant and exercising the power of the first for the benefit of the second   montesquieu      a government cannot be unjust without having hands to exercise its injustice now it is impossible but these hands will be grasping for themselves peculation therefore is natural in despotic states     the subadars authority since the companys acceptance of the dewanny has been gradually reduced under three successive nabobs and is now merely titular in the person of mobarekuldowla the administration of criminal justice is however still exercised in his name by the naib suba mahomed riza cawn and we sometimes avail ourselves of the pretense of his authority in our differences with the foreign factories divested of all power and wholly dependent on the companys pleasure he has nevertheless such rights and claims to plead as may embarrass any new arrangement in which the office of subadar is not included his situation and the difficulties likely to arise out of it deserve to be considered     by the treaty concluded between him and the company in march    0 they engage to secure the subahdarry to him and to support him in it against all his enemies they also engage to pay him an annual stipend of thirtytwo lacks out of the revenues the administration of justice in his name is an acknowledgement of his authority as representative of the sovereign the company approved of preserving the succession in the family of mere jaffier but ordered his stipend to be reduced to sixteen lacks a year during his minority  0th april       it is not determined at what period the minority is to end nor by what authority the company could reduce the stipend fixed by the treaty the nabob has been marriageable some years and has several children his age admits of no pretense to consider him as a minor nor if it did would the company in their assumed quality of guardian be the less accountable to him for the savings created by the reduction of his stipend we have yet received no instructions whatsoever on this subject the nabob does not submit without reluctance to the restraints laid upon him i have reason to believe that he has made private applications to the governor and may repeat them to the board for the removal of mahomed riza cawn and to be allowed the enjoyment and exercise of whatever rights are left him he may then demand the full amount and arrears of his pension and it is not unlikely that failing of relief from government he may be advised to institute a suit against the company in the supreme court of judicature if the decision should be favorable to him the company i take it for granted will throw the burden on the territorial revenues notwithstanding they have appropriated the savings already made by the reduction of his stipend to the provision of their investment     with respect to the nabob the principal points to be determined are first whether the office of subahdar shall be continued and on what footing secondly at what period the nabobs minority is to end thirdly what measures are to be taken in the case of his death  mahomed riza cawns conduct in his station of naib subah has been hitherto unexceptionable but it is not to be expected that he should act with freedom or be able to render us any essential service while the terror of the governors actual power and of a clashing jurisdiction with the supreme court is hanging over him     in sixing the future establishment of the subahdar and naib subah it must be taken into consideration that the circulation of their pensions is beneficial to the country that they support a number of mussulman families of distinction which would be reduced to beggary if the pensions were withdrawn and that the fouzdarry courts now under mahomed reza cawn comprehend almost all the offices in which mussulmen can be employed     the sovereignty assumed might authorize his majesty to remove the subahdar but i know not on what principle the mogul shaw alum can be divested of his sovereign rights unless some satisfactory compromise can be made with him the company hold the dewanny by his grant the treaty concluded by lord clive in august      not only acknowledges him as king of bengal but secures to him the full possession of korah and illahabad as a royal demesne for the support of his dignity and expenses and by a particular agreement between him and the company of the same date they engage themselves to be security for the payment of twentysix lacks a year out of the territorial revenues in consideration of his majestys having been graciously pleased to grant them the dewanny of bengal your lordship knows how little these treaties have been regarded his tribute was stopped and his country though avowedly entrusted to our good faith and accepted as a deposit sold to sujah dowla     it was invariably the opinion of sir john clavering colonel monson and myself that the honor of the nation required that justice should be done to the mogul in some shape or other and that it might be made conducive to our interest to support him considering his present distresses it would not perhaps be very difficult to form a plan in which his satisfaction and the general tranquillity of the empire might be equally consulted     after the internal settlement of our own territories the next object should be to lay the foundation of a general peace through indostan and if possible to give or restore an active constitution to the empire bengal cannot flourish while the neighboring states are perpetually in arms against each other returns of wealth are not to be obtained from nations which have no industry of their own or that languish under the dominion of the sword as the first step to peace the authority of the emperor should be in a considerable degree restored and means given him to support it in return for an acquittance of his claims upon the company a respectable demesne might be found for him out of the countries lying northwest of oude of which delhy might be the center this step might lead to and facilitate a general pacification in which the rights of every subordinate power might be determined and to which they should all be invited to accede the predominant power of the english should be employed to cut through difficulties and to guarantee the observance of the treaty as far at least as the success of such a plan may be attainable by negotiation it certainly deserves to be encouraged from home and recommended to the administration here     the british power is now unquestionably the first in india at least for defense to make it respectable in itself and beneficial to mankind it must be guided by solid judicious principles of policy and they must be steadily pursued enough has been done to establish the reputation of our arms if we mean to keep what we have acquired some care must be taken to establish an opinion of our steadiness and justice a continued division in this council besides many other dangerous effects produces one which i conceive would have had great weight at home if it had been foreseen and considered it exposes the measures of government which at least in every fundamental point ought to be fixed and uniform to perpetual alterations as the actual power may accidentally fluctuate from one side to the other the death of colonel monson produced not only a change of administration but a total change of system the death of mr hastings or mr barwell might have restored the course of public measures to their former channel other cases may now be foreseen in which a future majority may neither revert decisively to our principles nor completely execute the resolutions of their immediate predecessors the event will depend on the temper character and views of the men who compose it and the new difficulties they may have to contend with diminution of dignity is not to be separated from a fluctuation of councils but changes of system which shake the foundation are never accomplished without extraordinary difficulty and hazard nor is it always open to the wisest men to do perfectly right after much wrong has been done a new position of things creates a new question in which facts as well as principles must govern the decision   0 the present condition of the nabob of oude and the state of his dominions is the principal instance to which this reasoning is meant to be applied your lordship will soon see what an important share belongs to it in the political interests of bengal     on the death of the late sujah dowla mr hastings delivered a formal opinion to the council and afterward to the court of directors consultations   th september       that we could not with justice make any further demands upon his successor he admitted that the treaty concluded by mr bristow was very advantageous to the company but he recommended that their orders might be such as might tend to conciliate the mind of the nabob and to remove the apprehension of any future encroachments on his dominions     the arguments which prevailed with a majority of the board against the first opinion of mr hastings appear at large on our proceedings we resolved that the engagements which had subsisted between sujah dowla and the company were personal and expired with him on this principle denied by mr hastings and mr barwell and since disavowed by the company who have availed themselves of the consequences derived from it the treaty of fyzabad with the present nabob of oude was concluded in may      the terms of it were as favorable to us as our real interest demanded and more so than could have been obtained in other circumstances in return for the cession of ghazipore we granted him nothing but a guarantee of the dominions originally possessed by his father with an express exclusion of his late conquests for the defense of these dominions we agreed to continue a brigade in his service but obliged him to make a considerable addition to the former subsidy his own undisciplined troops were however a greater burden to him and drained all his resources without the possibility of doing him any service to leave his army on this footing was in effect to expose him and his country to destruction and he was sensible of it the resolution to supply him with a moderate number of british officers was subsequent to the treaty a corpse of thirteen battalions of sepoys and three regiments of cavalry was formed out of his disorderly troops and put under the command of these officers but it was still his army a considerable number of the rest were reduced this was the utmost extent of the interposition of our government in the nabobs affairs and at this point we were determined to stop the internal administration of his country might be exposed to abuses but we were perfectly sure that they would never be corrected by our taking charge of it     since the power of this council devolved to mr hastings other ideas have prevailed the recall of mr bristow and the appointment of mr middleton were the first steps to the new system an entire change of conduct toward the nabob was talked of very soon after colonel monsons death i know not by what secret motives mr hastings has been guided nor how far the anxiety of his mind and the delicacy of his situation may have influenced his conduct at points of time when apparently it was too late to deliberate the notorious fact is that in all his late arrangements of the nabobs government he has resolved hastily and executed slowly the resolution to transfer the nabobs troops under british officers to the companys establishment did not appear till may last though it was publicly known several months before and near three months more have been suffered to elapse before the new officers were appointed general claverings remonstrances and mine against the measure were scarcely listened to though accompanied with urgent and repeated representations to mr hastings not to neglect the defense of bengal while he was providing for that of rohilcund and other distant countries in which the company had no concern in a few days after the governor resolved to insist on the nabobs dismissing some persons in his service who were obnoxious to us and on his committing the internal administration without reserve to a minister named by the board the next step was to offer the companys protection to sadut ally the nabobs brother who had fled from his court and was the immediate object of his jealousy and to invite him to reside within these provinces by the latest letters from mr middleton it appears that under pretense of securing the companys debt he has taken the collection of the greatest part of the revenues into his own hands     the result is that the nabob is reduced to a cipher that all power is vested in mr middleton that the country delivered up to aliens who neither understand its interests nor have any concern for its prosperity is falling into irretrievable ruin that the revenues have long been unequal to the expenses and that nothing is collected but by military execution on this footing it cannot last long the personal character of the nabob offers no resource against the continuance of such mischiefs i fear he has neither virtue nor capacity to make a proper use of power if power was restored to him certainly not in circumstances which demand an extraordinary proportion of both such is the situation we stand in at present on the  th of august when mr hastings recommended the appointment of the new officers he was pleased to declare that if the administration of the companys affairs should finally rest in other hands what he now did would be of little consequence as it would be undone of course and the whole system of which it was but a part annulled on the principles on which it was opposed     without admitting the necessity of this conclusion from any act or declaration of ours and deeming it highly unjustifiable to carry measures of such importance into execution under any expectation of their being speedily reversed i am compelled to confess that the whole state of facts taken together constitutes a question beyond the reach of any degree of wisdom existing in bengal we shall probably be governed by events for a short period and i fear obliged to abandon the country at the end of it     before your attention is drawn directly to bengal permit me to state to your lordship one question more in which the general security of the british empire in india is concerned the controlling power vested by parliament in this government over the other presidencies is either not extensive enough or not defined with clearness and precision sufficient to answer the purposes intended by it we have not only met with slight and disobedience in the exercise of our authority in india but i am sorry to observe that the court of directors themselves seem to view it with jealousy and distrust your lordship cannot but be apprized of the support they have given to the presidency of bombay in opposition to the measures unanimously resolved on here for concluding a peace with the mahrattas in their letter of the   th of december last paragraph    they charge us with exceeding our lawful authority when we prohibited the presidency of madras from sending troops out of their own districts to aid the settlement of bombay and they disapprove our interference in that case i apprehend that the power of declaring and making war includes that of determining in what quarter it shall be conducted with the greatest general advantage and prospect of success but every arrangement of ours may be defeated if the other presidencies are permitted to alter the disposition of their respective forces without our consent and of course without regard to any general plan of operations whether this observation be well or ill founded it is plain that the court of directors sought for an occasion to limit our authority and to discountenance us in the eyes of the other presidencies the fact in question was of too old a date and of too little moment in itself to be revived for any other purpose in their letter of the  th february last paragraphs  0                 they censure us for relinquishing some of the cessions made by ragoba in his treaty with the presidency of bombay concluded several months after our arrival in bengal not only without our consent and approbation but without our knowledge they also instruct us to take advantage of any failure on the part of the mahratta government in the execution of the late treaty with them and to renew the alliance with ragoba on the same terms which the presidency of bombay had obtained from him it is but too probable that with so much encouragement from home the governor and council of bombay may soon find pretenses for resuming their favorite projects and involve us in a general war with the mahrattas whether that consequence follows or not your lordship will judge from these instances how ineffectual and hazardous any endeavors of ours must be to preserve the peace of india as long as the determination of peace and war is subjected to a clashing jurisdiction if it was the original intention of the legislature that the whole force of the british empire in india should be united under one direction and move together i must submit my opinion to your lordship that other provisions more strict and decisive than any that exist at present are indispensably necessary to carry that intention into effect the latitude still left with the other presidencies to make peace and war where they shall have received special orders from the company without any communication with us or control on our part defeats the general view of uniting the political measures of the three governments under one system and authority because the exception must always be too powerful for the rule     i have already in my representations to the company declared my opinion so fully on many of the most important branches of the internal administration of bengal that very little remains for me to say on this subject with respect to the amount and collection of the revenues the court of directors and government are in possession of all the lights and materials i have been able to collect and these i hope will enable them to determine on what footing the land tax of the country shall be settled hereafter the principal questions are whether the lands shall be restored to the hereditary owners whether the revenue payable to government shall be fixed immutably at a certain sum and by what rule or standard that sum shall be ascertained to the two first questions i have invariably given an affirmative answer founded on reasons which i deem incontrovertible the third must be determined by the capacity of the country estimated from an average of the actual collections and combined with the indispensible demands of government     the farming system was adopted as the act of a proprietor with a professed view of discovering the ultimate value of the estate or the utmost that could be obtained from it your lordship will judge how far the end supposing it attainable could justify the means to general clavering colonel monson and myself it always appeared an arbitrary unexampled act of power without a shadow of right to support it the principle on which it went annihilated every idea of private property while in fact it has been ruinous to the country for the sole benefit of the companys servants and their banians but even if the farms had in every instance been fairly allotted to the highest bidders the measure could have produced no other consequence than that of forcibly alienating the whole landed property of the country in favor of indigent strangers and adventurers equally ignorant of the value and circumstances of the farm and careless how much they offered for immediate possession the last settlement made by the committee of circuit promised an immoderate increase of revenue at a time when the famine had swept away one third of the inhabitants and when the country was represented to be in a general state of decay extraordinary merit was pleaded with the company for this imaginary addition to their resources what the real object of the measure was may be collected from the success of it the balances and remissions on the settlements of the last five years amount to the enormous sum of two hundred and thirty lacks of sicca rupees the plain truth is that overratement and remission play into each others hands if the country be exorbitantly taxed the governor and council must be trusted with a discretionary power to make remissions this latitude once given or assumed it may be impossible to determine in what manner it is applied or where the remissions center at last since the distribution may be so formed as to interest all parties in concealing it if we had no facts or experience to guide our conjectures it is apparent that a country exposed to arbitrary variations in the annual assessments at the discretion of a council of state especially at this immense distance from the seat of empire offers temptations to the members of such a council which will not be always resisted improvements in such a state of things are not to be expected for who will employ his money or his labor in the cultivation of a soil that does not belong to him or when he has no security that the whole produce may not be extorted from him by a new assessment the wealth of bengal was so great that the severest oppression has not yet been sufficient to beggar it entirely but the richest mines may be exhausted and i am most deliberately of opinion that if private property be not once for all secured on a permanent footing the public revenue will sink rapidly with the general produce of the country the same system of taxation which annihilates the property attacks the industry of the subject invades the sources of production and in the end obliges government to depend for it is revenue on the fidelity of farmers and agents who have no interest in the prosperity of the object or on the precarious perishable resources of direct violence and extortion     the last orders general letter  th feb      par    of the court of directors are favorable to the zemindars and other hereditary proprietors of the lands and amount to an indirect acknowledgement of the injustice they have suffered they express a satisfaction at finding it in their power to yield proper relief to the natives without involving the company in the least inconvenience and they direct that such zemindars or renters as have fulfilled their engagements to our satisfaction shall not be dispossessed of their lands or compelled to pay an advanced rent without the most substantial reasons  without questioning the sincerity of these professions it is apparent that the latitude taken in the expression will soon defeat their intention in a case determinable by fixed general rules it is equally unsafe and unnecessary to rely on accidental motives of action such as the firmness ability or integrity of the persons entrusted with the administration what real appeal have the natives of bengal to the directing power in england against acts supposed to be beneficial to that power and adorned with flattering representations in which justice and profit are apparently united your lordship will judge by what sort of tenure the natives hold their property while the convenience of the east india company and the discretion of the rulers here are to regulate the standard by which it is to be taxed the conclusion to which this argument leads is too obvious to be mistaken if i am not greatly deceived the truths i am endeavoring to establish are selfevident and proved the moment they are stated   0 the annual demand of revenue once fixed on a reasonable and permanent establishment would operate to the benefit of the country in other senses besides that of immediate relief security and improvement it would stop one of the principal sources of litigation and facilitate the administration of civil justice by the country courts the weight of the revenue presses so heavily on almost all ranks of people that it becomes every mans study how to shift the burden from himself and of course to harass his neighbor let the cause of action be what it may it seldom happens that the public revenue is not some way or other concerned in the origin of the suit or liable to be affected by the issue on the other hand the introduction of a mysterious science under the title of the farming system with its endless train of principal farmers nominal farmers securities counter securities agents and cutkinnadars has not only perplexed the busisiness of the collections but increased the number of suits in the dewanny courts and the difficulty of deciding them this difficulty is so great and the causes determined are so few in comparison with the multitude that remain unheard that in reality it amounts to a general denial of justice the little that is done perhaps is too often mixed with motives of influence or favor if the revenue were once fixed on a moderate footing and the people made tolerably easy in their circumstances the spirit of litigation must gradually subside at the same time the disputes between government and the proprietors of the lands and of the latter with their undertenants and ryots would either vanish entirely or admit of an easy and summary decision the amount of the rents being unalterably settled would reduce the present intricate accounts of demands receipts and balances to a simple account current the balance of which might be authenticated beyond the possibility of a dispute it must be understood however that proper measures are taken by government to extend the plan of fixing the rents to every class of people concerned in paying them in other words that the same security which government gives to the tenant in chief should for the same reasons descend to the undertenants in their several gradations so that every rank of society and every member of it may have something to call his own a great part of this business which seems difficult and perplexed in the detail will gradually execute itself when once it is perceived that a wise and solid system is adopted at the fountainhead and steadily adhered to but it is in vain to correct abuses of administration while the principle of the government is itself an abuse     general clavering colonel monson and i had on many occasions but more particularly in our minute dated the   st of march      declared our deliberate opinion that under the general application of the british laws or of any form of justice administered generally to the natives by the judges of his majestys supreme court of judicature bengal cannot be held by great britain the truth of a similar proposition has already been so ably defended by mr verelst that i need not attempt to establish our opinion on other ground the dewanny courts undoubtedly require reformation and i conceive that it would not be difficult to fix them on a footing of such independence at least until the zemindarry jurisdiction can be gradually and completely restored as would remove the most plausible objection made by the judges to the institution of such courts viz that as they are at present constituted the most powerful of the parties in every revenue cause is in effect the judge     the zemindar as lord of the manor might immediately administer justice in petty cases between his tenants an appeal from him or the original suit in cases where he himself or his officers might be parties should rest with the dewanny or superior civil court of the district this court should be placed under the superintendance of an english gentleman properly qualified with sufficient appointments under an oath to act faithfully and not removable during his good behavior he should have judges of the hindoo and mahomedan laws to assist him and his decisions under a certain amount should be final for greater sums an appeal might be allowed to the governor and council or to one superior court established centrically by their authority and formed on the same principles of independance i mean only to trace the outlines of a clear and simple plan for the benefit of the natives not resident in calcutta and would recommend that the execution or improvement of it should be referred to the governor and council here with power to establish such institutions as they may deem advisable and to put them in force until farther orders can be received from england but in whatever hands it may be thought fit to place the administration of justice i am clearly and immoveably of opinion that the constitution and manners of the natives fixed as they are to the soil which gave them birth and never to be removed from it without the severest oppression do indispensibly require that justice should be carried home to their doors my wish is to revert as nearly as possible to the ancient institutions of the country which however perverted by the occasional violence of an arbitrary government or corrupted by abuses will i believe be found judicious in themselves and better accommodated to the genius of the people than any system forcibly introduced from the other side of the globe whatever grievance they might have suffered by an abuse of their own institutions it could not be greater than those which belong to an administration of justice supposed to be guided by other principles and pretending to be gratuitous it is not in england at least that justice is administered without delay or vexation or perhaps ever obtained without exorbitant expenses inconveniences of this nature if felt in westminster hall must unavoidably be aggravated on the natives of this country who from their ignorance of our language laws and customs and of the forms of the court are left entirely at the mercy of their interpreters advocates and attorneys  when these important questions come to be considered i trust they will be decided by men qualified to give laws to nations and on principles more liberal and extensive than can be derived from any degree of skill in the interpretation of acts of parliament or from the practice of our courts     the zemindars have for some years past been affectedly and for a purpose sufficiently obvious styled collectors of the revenue this idea seems to have been adopted for the support of another equally ill founded that the ruling power is proprietor of the soil a doctrine which annihilated private property must find some cause to account for the existence of such persons as the zemindars it converted them into collectors vide appendix  without venturing to deny their hereditary possession of the lands or the reality of their tenure under the mogul government by an unalterable quit rent the facts and the doctrine are not to be reconciled the history and constitution of the country if they had ever been attended to would have removed all difficulties the zemindars it is true were officers and magistrates obliged by their sunnuds to the performance of certain civil duties which relieved the prince in the administration of his internal government but it was the possession of landed property which naturally imposed those duties on the zemindars and ipso facto made them the magistrates of the country there could not be a wiser policy either for the prince to whom the men of property were made responsible or for the people who had justice brought home to them and administered by men who had a stake in the country and a natural permanent interest in its prosperity     i have nothing farther to add on this subject to our minute of the   st march      and to our letter to your lordship of the   th may following to which i beg leave to refer you     on the state of the coinage and the expediency of establishing one silver coin for the general currency of the provinces every thing has been said in our representations to the court of directors which the subject has hitherto suggested to us the main questions to be determined at home are what the standard and weight of the coin shall be  what name or title shall be stamped upon it and whether a gold coin shall be admitted as a legal tender vide general letter   th may      par      one of these questions depends on the declaration of the sovereignty and must be decided by it the second must be submitted to men of knowledge and experience and proper persons and instruments sent out to execute whatever plan may be resolved on the third is more easily determined in theory than in fact the current coin ought to be confined to one of the precious metals but in the present condition of bengal i doubt whether there be a sufficient quantity of silver in the provinces to answer the ordinary demands of circulation without the assistance of a gold coinage this point i apprehend must be left to the discretion of the governor and council     supposing the several articles already touched upon to be now in some degree explained and understood i may assure your lordship that there still remains a number of abuses to be corrected which though of less comparative importance are sufficient to distress and perplex any government and to harrass the people subject to it  first the mode of keeping public accounts here besides that they are kept in a barbarous unknown language some in persian and others in the bengal dialect is involved in obscurity by a confused reference to different aeras and to different systems of dividing the year few persons can fairly find their way through such a labyrinth but every man concerned either in paying or receiving the revenues may some way or other find his account in the confusion that arises from it  secondly the barbarous terms affectedly made use of in all our records constitute a separate science which though not difficult to learn upon the spot tends to make our letters unintelligible in england this practice might easily be corrected the best remedy perhaps for the confusion in the accounts and mode of reckoning would be to introduce the christian era at once into bengal so that the ruling power and their subjects might compute by one and the same measure of time i suggest this idea rather as a question than as an opinion desiring only that it may be considered     if with the christian era the english language could be introduced into the transaction of business as the persian was by the mogul conqueror consimiliter gallici post eorum adventum in angliam ratiocinia de eorum proventibus non receperunt nisi in proprio idiomate ne ipsi inde deciperentur fortescue cap     i conceive it would be attended with convenience and advantage to government and no distress or disadvantage to the natives to qualify themselves for employment they would be obliged to study english instead of persian if schools were established in the districts with proper encouragement to the masters a very few years would produce a set of young men qualified for business whose example and success would spread and graft the institution gradually into the manners of the people the natives would soon find it one of the most effectual barriers against the oppression of europeans every man then would be able to speak for himself and every complaint would be understood     i come now my lord to the most delicate and hazardous part of my task with an unlimited confidence in your lordships candor and in your approbation of the principles on which i act i cannot be insensible of the danger of always appearing in a character of hostility to the interests of individuals and of incurring personal enmity without a certainty of personal support my late colleagues and i frequently met this danger whatever it might be and i must disregard it now in a more important instance or not acquit myself of perhaps the most essential duty implied by my appointment     supposing that in a future arrangement the trade to the east indies is not to be laid open for if it were the present question would be altered it must be considered in what manner the companys commercial interests are to be provided for and whether any and what degree of influence over the internal government of bengal shall be reserved to them in delivering an opinion on a question of such delicacy and importance i shall not stop to guard and qualify my expressions your lordship will distinguish the substance from the form and allow for the strong impressions which an immediate view of facts has made upon my mind   0 the return of a permanent tribute to great britain whether it consists of specie or manufactures and whether exported on the companys account or that of individuals is an evil attached to the political situation of bengal under which i fear it will sink at last it is impossible that the internal resources of any country should answer a constant demand on one side without a proportionate supply from other quarters the fact is against bengal in both instances even economy and good government if such things existed would not alone be sufficient to avert the consequence a country that gives must receive or its power of giving must soon be at an end but our principal india markets are lost in the ruin of persia and indostan and europe returns nothing it is unnecessary to enter into a detail of the disadvantages under which the internal traffic and industry of this country labor the same principle of government if it deserves that name which unites the sovereign and the merchant in the supposed person of the company naturally extends through every branch of their commercial administration and communicates some portion of their own arbitrary power to the lowest agent or factor in their service the abuses that follow are minute in their operation and spare nothing they reach to persons and property which no other system of power could descend to but which cannot escape the penetrating eyes of men acquainted with all the little channels through which the lowest order of manufacturers derive their subsistence to this unprotected class of men no money has been shown nor could it be otherwise in a country where the sovereign has views and interests incompatible with that character and professes them  where the same power or they who administer it take the rents of the lands as proprietor  engross all the merchantable produce as monopolist and all the industry of the manufacturer for the pretended supply of their investment  general letter  d march      par          not longer ago than march      the court of directors after expressing an unwillingness to return to the former coercive system of providing an investment expressly ordered us to prohibit all persons whatever under their protection from trading in any of those articles which compose their investment directly or indirectly until it was completed this among other regulations was ordered to be forth with published throughout the provinces and considered as a standing order of the company in all time to come     you will judge my lord what kind of power devolves to the companys commercial servants under color of such instructions if at any time it should be thought necessary to investigate this subject with greater particularity a petition from the merchants of dacca entered on our revenue consultations of the   th of september      with the papers annexed will afford a thorough insight into it the system itself united with the increase of taxes could produce no other consequences but those which the company themselves have felt and complained of  the ruin of the manufacturers a considerable debasement in the quality of the goods and an equal advance upon the price for the purpose of this representation it is sufficient to mark the principle on which the company have acted without pursuing the practice through all its operations in stating the cause we ascertain the effect the nation is not less interested than the company in removing both under the present system the manufactures must gradually sink to the level of the demand for the europe markets or very little more but all this investment whether exported by the company by their servants or by the foreign factories being really paid for by the money of the country adds nothing to its stock or ability to supply many other channels through which its wealth is extracted     i apprehend that the decline of bengal takes its origin too high to be recovered by any vigor of administration or even by a correction of abuses a new principle must be assumed for the government of the country or it must fall measures of any other quality may perhaps delay the crisis but cannot prevent it i must be permitted to suppose that the government is not to be continued in the hands of a mercantile body since i cannot admit the possibility of uniting such power any longer to such interest without destruction to the object on this supposition permit me to state freely to your lordship my ideas of the terms which ought to be settled in favor of bengal i confine my view to this point only not presuming to enter into any of the other considerations which must naturally influence a general arrangement between government and the company the whole subject may be comprehended under four general questions    what proportion of the net territorial revenues shall be reserved for the provision of an investment    in what manner such investment shall be provided    whether any and what sums shall be appropriated to supply the other presidencies    whether the company shall monopolize any of the productions or manufactures of the country   your lordship has seen an estimate sent home by me in january      in which ninetythree lacks of current rupees are allotted to the investment and all commercial charges and twenty lacks to the other settlements that estimate compared with accounts sent home in former times is moderate in stating the resources of the country the distribution of them must be confirmed or corrected by a higher authority than mine your lordship will observe however that the court of directors in their letter of the   th of december      par  0  though very well satisfied with the above appropriation of     lacks to their service seem inclined to reserve some of the articles on the credit side of the estimate under pretense that such deductions fall upon the unappropriated surplus but still leave part of it after all establishments and services are provided for among the articles so intended to be reserved by the company are the produce of the europe cargoes here and the amount of the bills which they have allowed their servants to draw upon them and which the estimate supposes will be continued equal in all to twentyfive lacks of current rupees but i submit it to your lordship that they have not treated the estimate fairly a considerable reserve against unforeseen emergencies is as necessary to be provided for as any article of established expense and more so in this country than any other on the least alarm of an invasion it is morally certain that every rupee in the hands of the natives would instantly disappear without an unappropriated surplus of thirty lacks no prudent man would undertake to answer for the safety of the government much less to insure an investment of ninetythree lacks against all accidents if therefore the company do not think fit to throw the amount of the articles above mentioned into the general fund it will be indispensibly necessary that an equal sum should be dedicated from the allotment made to them out of the revenues the annual supply of twenty lacks to madras and bombay is a ruinous drain to bengal and ought to be the first article of retrenchment the remainder must fall upon the investment     if the company should resolve not to allow their servants to draw upon them to the usual amount of one hundred and seventyfive thousand pounds some consideration must be had of the consequences and of the difficulties to which individuals may be driven those difficulties will in the end be surmounted and possibly by means equally prejudicial to bengal to themselves and to the company that is by loans to the foreign factories or by the direct extraction of specie a remittance in bengal manufactures is so disadvantageous owing to the advanced price here and the state of the europe markets that no private persons could afford to remit their fortunes by that channel if they were openly at liberty to do so the company at present are not sensible of the loss they sustain between the cost and sale of their investment because the whole is given them by bengal your lordship will judge from the decline and poverty of the country on one side and the wealth of individuals on the other how far it may be probable that the enormous sum charged upon the revenues on account of the investment has been fairly laid out the commercial board have now above a million sterling annually at their disposal     the second question in what manner the investment shall be provided will depend on the influence reserved to the company over the internal government of the country in whatever degree such influence is continued it will assuredly be employed as it has been hitherto in promoting the views of individuals under the formidable name of the companys commercial rights and interests and forcing the measures of government to bend to that single consideration if the company are no longer to govern directly it will be no less necessary that their right to engross the industry of the manufacturers or to provide an investment by force should not survive their political power their present servants i fear have been too long in the lucrative habits of monopoly and command to submit to any terms of equality between the manufacturers and themselves they follow the path of their predecessors and inherit their ideas but my lord this is not a time to consult the passions or prejudices or interests of individuals the plain and simple remedy and indeed the only one for abuses of power in a case where power however exercised is itself a violation of right is to oblige the company to revert to their original principles to renounce the unnatural character in which they have lately acted and if it be possible to become merchants again     before the company obtained a political influence in the country their investment was provided at calcutta and dacca by contract with native merchants called dadneys present circumstances may require that such contracts should be open to merchants of all denominations the company will benefit by the competition of sellers at calcutta as the manufacturers would do by the competition of purchasers at the aurungs in a few years even contracts would be unnecessary no tolerable reason can be assigned for not reverting to a practice apparently safe and oeconomical to the company and equally beneficial to the country it may not answer the purpose of their servants it does not admit of expensive establishments in the districts where chiefs superintendants and banians detached from the presidency and armed with despotic power to support the pretended commercial interests of the company have taken possession of the markets excluded all competition enslaved the manufacturers and in some instances obliged private merchants to purchase from themselves at an immoderate advance of price the same goods which they had seized and set the companys seal upon in the loom under pretense that they were wanted for the public investment     i do not mean to intimate that practices of this nature have been carried on with equal violence in all the districts but i am well assured that more or less they have generally prevailed and have not been confined to the companys servants adventurers of the lowest order have frequently found their way into the districts assuming a lawless dominion over the people who have lost the protection of their native prince and in fact have no other to appeal to if it be seriously meant to restore the trade of the country the manufacturers must be relieved from this oppression and left at liberty to work for whomsoever they think proper regulations pretending to check the misconduct of individuals will have no effect in my judgment there is but one course to be pursued the investment must be provided by contract as it was heretofore until the general increase and improvement of the manufactures will admit of its being provided by readymoney purchases the employment of europeans in the districts whether with or without authority or even gomastas with authority must be stopped at all events and this in my opinion is a measure of indispensible necessity that will admit of no qualification i do not affirm that no difficulties or inconveniences will attend it at the outset but if it be seriously meant to prefer the companys true and permanent interests to those of individuals the court of directors will listen with reserve and suspicion to any representations they may receive from their servants on this subject if the measure should be adopted the burden and odium of it must not be imposed on the administration here much less must we be loaded with an exclusive responsibility for the event a simple approbation or permission will not arm us with power sufficient to resist and defeat the general combination that would be formed against us the orders from home must be positive and binding on all parties it is a gross and daring fallacy to assert that the manufacturers would not have sold their goods as readily to the company as to any other merchant provided they had been paid for them if the companys servants had been compelled to do equal justice to the natives and to their employers it is not possible that power or privilege should have been wanted to insure to the company every commercial advantage they ought to aim at the superior weight of their purse would naturally have secured to them or to the persons who contracted with them a preference in every market and defeated any competition for the articles which compose their investment the free vent and exportation of the remaining produce of the country cannot be too liberally encouraged i submit my opinion to higher judgment that the custom houses should be new modelled if not abolished they check the operations of foreign trade in a country which properly sells to all the world and buys nothing except some raw materials of manufacture and necessaries from england for the consumption of europeans the inland customs fetter the industry of the natives in all its minutest branches the revenue collected by these establishments is either not worth the attention of government especially at the expense of oppression to the subject and of many embarrassments to the export trade or supposing it necessary the amount might be levied with less inconvenience directly from the land     when these capital discouragements are removed the productions of industry will increase their quality will improve the country then having something to sell to other nations will have something to give to england and though a time must come when the nominal revenue can no longer be realized when the investment must be retrenched and every establishment contracted in other words when a great and wealthy state which ought to flourish by its expenses can only exist by its economy still it is not a point of little moment to protract that event if possible to a distant uncertain period the actual choice lies between a disease which threatens immediate dissolution and a remedy which at least gives time for deliberation we know not what favorable turns may appear during an interval of repose but at any rate we should not hasten a crisis at which neither prudence nor fortune can save the object     the annual supplies of the other presidencies in time of peace amount to about twenty lacks of current rupees i have submitted my opinion to the company that bengal in its present circumstances is not able to bear the continuance of so great a drain of its resources the future amount of this supply will i presume be considered in the allowance reserved for the investment out of the territorial revenues and determined by it the revenue acquired on the malabar coast by the late treaty with the marattas if faithfully applied to the support of the companys establishments at bombay ought in a great measure to relieve bengal from any further demand for that service since the first of may      we have remitted to bombay alone the sum of current rupees     0     i will not pronounce decisively on the uses of maintaining that settlement at so exorbitant an expense but the question deserves an attentive consideration notwithstanding this great supply from hence they have incurred a debt of thirty lacks chiefly in the above period which carries an interest of nine per cent     fort st george in time of peace ought to support itself china will be sufficiently supplied by individuals here without an extraction of silver from england if the company think proper to open their treasury at canton and grant bills at a reasonable rate if not the money they refuse will be lent to the french danes and swedes whose imports from china stand in immediate competition with the company even for the consumption of the british dominions the supplies sent from hence to fort marlborough and st helena are not worth notice   0 the fourth and last question whether the company shall monopolize any of the productions or manufactures of the country would perhaps be more properly stated and better understood if it were expressed in the following terms is bengal incapable of a greater produce than the companys investment requires or shall it be prohibited from producing more than will supply that demand this state of the question is in effect the true one and includes the answer no man will affirm that the companys investment is equal to the actual produce of the country much less to what it is capable of producing and if it were bengal having no surplus to sell would in a very short period have nothing to give it is not even true that the portion of the revenues appropriated to the purchase of the investment returns undiminished into the provincial circulation from which it was taken in the expenditure of an immense capital agency will pay itself and every man will make something whatever this annual defalcation may amount to whether a fifth or a sixth of the net sum allotted to the investment it is the worst of all taxes because it is taken directly from the sources of production but if this evil be no more avoidable than the obvious consequences of it the wisdom of government is so much the more powerfully called upon to qualify abuses by improvements and to balance a weight which no policy can remove     i have supposed the merchant to be no longer sovereign nor charged with the general protection of the people  shall he retain the power of oppressing them in detail my lord i am sirm in my opinion that the very monopolies which the company have appropriated to the supply of their investment or to the increase of their revenues and which they were ready enough to condemn in the hands of individuals would ere long defeat the purposes they were intended to promote they are now in exclusive possession or think they are of the raw silk saltpetre opium and salt manufactured in bengal at the same time the produce of the loom is apparently at their command if the practice had been strictly and entirely conformable to the principle the resources of bengal instead of declining by any gradations must have sunk precipitately a partial remedy or palliation of some of the evils attending the government instituted or exercised by the companys servants has been derived from its excessive severity and injustice when positive laws are opposed to every dictate of natural justice humanity and right reason it is not easy to carry them by any degree of power into complete execution even private frauds which considering their quality and extent denote a want of vigor and fidelity in the administration have in some degree defended the country against public institutions this i conceive is the last state of misrule into which a nation can fall while any forms whatsoever are preserved  fundamental errors of institution counteracted but not removed by abuses of administration by deviations from principle and by uniting all ranks of men in a regular connected system of fraud against government     i have already taken notice of the orders received in december      for prohibiting all persons under the companys protection from trading in any of the articles which compose their investment until it was completed which never could happen as the investment proceeds the whole year round with little relaxation these orders have since been qualified in consequence of strong representations from hence but under such limitations and with conditions so hazardous to the persons whom the court of directors supposed to be in possession of the government that even if the change they expected had taken place their last instructions could have produced no effect general letter   th dec      par  0 they empower the governor general and council to suspend the execution of such part of their orders as impose restrictions on the commerce of individuals provided we are absolutely certain it may be done consistent with the due provision of an ample and wellchosen investment for the company and without risking the timely provision of their investment the amount whereof must on no account be hazarded even for a single season     under conditions of this nature their most favored administration could not have acted with safety but when they add that to indulge their commercial servants in every branch of trade not prohibited by law is a measure which nothing but the greatest fidelity in their servants can render consistent with the interest of the company i apprehend they at once mistake the fact and preclude the remedy their servants derive too many advantages from the companys monopoly to wish for an avowed and general freedom of trade in which others might participate and what assurance have the company that the trust reposed in their servants is not as much abused under apparent restrictions and as effectually for their own interests as it could be if all restrictions were abolished the first prohibitory orders dated the  d of march      still remain in force without any attempt whatever to correct them by the last     the question of the salt trade has been sufficiently canvassed in england and ought to be thoroughly understood the company it seems have received new lights on this subject your lordship knows how long and with what vehemence the monopoly of salt had been reprobated by them in may      they thought it neither consistent with their honor nor their dignity to promote such an exclusive trade they could not suffer themselves to indulge a thought toward the continuance of it on any conditions whatsoever and that no regulations could be effectual to prevent the like consequences which they had seen  they considered it too as disgraceful and below the dignity of their present situation to allow of such a monopoly and that were they to allow of it under any restrictions they should consider themselves as assenting and subscribing to all the mischiefs which bengal had presented to them for the four years past     in their letter of the   th of december last paragraph     they say that the monopoly on its present footing can be no grievance to the country and they direct that for the present the plan adopted by their late president and council be continued this plan is a rigorous monopoly for the supposed exclusive profit of the company in the first two years of the contract it raised the price above fifty per cent to the consumer and produced an immoderate importation of foreign salt by which the company has been constantly undersold in one of the staple commodities of bengal at their own markets in consequence of this importation frauds in the management smuggling etc the company have gained nothing by their contracts in the third and fourth years and now they have an enormous quantity upon their hands which can only be sold at a long credit and never without a considerable loss these notorious facts have determined mr hastings himself to renounce the monopoly even against the companys instructions     with respect to salpetre the companys monopoly or rather that exercised by their servants has produced the effect which it always must do of diminishing the produce until they at last find it difficult to procure even the trifling quantity wanted for their investment the scarcity perhaps is exaggerated for private purposes but saltpetre ought naturally to be one of the most cheap and plentiful productions of the soil and would be so if the natives were allowed the free use of their own lands and the free disposal of their own industry     the opium of bahar has been for many years monopolized formerly by the favorites of the country government with some degree of justice and lenity to the riots and in later times by the companys servants out of whose hands it was taken by mr hastings in the year      and engrossed for the benefit of the company it was not likely that any abuses in the former practice or any of the usual effects of a monopoly should be corrected by this alteration the servants of government might possibly have been restrained by checks which cannot be imposed on government itself a doubt whether in the present state of things the trade could be really and effectually laid open and whether it would not revert in fact to the gentlemen in station at patna produced an early difference of opinion between sir john clavering and myself on the expediency of continuing the opium contract but by no means touched the general principles on which we invariably concurred in condemning monopolies we agreed that whenever there was a government sufficiently firm and independent to execute its own resolutions and to enforce obedience to them the monopoly of opium should be abolished the deplorable state of bahar makes it necessary that this should be one of the first measures of such a government the company have lately general letter   th dec      par    authorized us to give up this commodity as an article of commerce but the contract was already disposed of for the three ensuing years before the receipt of their orders     raw silk is not subject to a declared monopoly at present the quantity of this article is greatly increased the state of the india markets throws it chiefly into the companys hands without competition the demand seems to increase in europe     one general objection occurs in this country to monopolies exercised by government which does not perhaps exist in any other the commodity to be engrossed is always provided by advances of money out of the public treasury a proportion of these advances must be paid at an early period before the seed is sown as in the case of opium or before the work is undertaken and must be continued as the business proceeds the risque of the capital advanced which is not inconsiderable and the value of the interest ought to be calculated and deducted from the ultimate profits of the monopoly a number of accidents may occasion partial losses on the money advanced an invasion or any general calamity would be the loss of the whole the company have experienced the truth of this opinion in another part of their practice their outstanding desperate balances arising on advances made to the weavers amount to a very considerable sum on the other hand it makes a wide difference to the country whether advances to be repaid out of future production are made by government or by individuals in the first case a multitude of persons are precluded from engaging in the business engrossed by government and from employing to advantage whatever means and credit they have left the circulation of so much private property is lost and the proprietor compelled to live with parsimony on his capital at the same time the sums issuing from the treasury to the contractor flow in one large stream under the direction of a despotic monopolist whose ease and convenience lead him to contract with as few people and to confine his advances to as few places as possible this is the fundamental principle of monopoly on the contrary a free trade invites numbers to engage in it who in the face of a general competition could never succeed but by fair dealing and superior industry and whose fortune circulating in a variety of little channels might extend to the remotest corners of the country and act directly on the industry of the lowest orders of men   0 it is not for me to attempt to lead your lordships opinion on the general question of monopolies by any other information than that of the facts before me in this country the exercise of them under the direct authority and for the supposed benefit of a despotic government has manifestly united an interest and a power which ought never to have met in the same hands such a union in the case of oppression whether real or pretended constitutes the plaintiffs parties against government and leaves no indifferent tribunal to administer justice to them i submit to judgment whether it ought to be abolished or continued     i will not my lord add a useless apology to the trouble i have already given you if the contents of this letter should not justify the length of it i have nothing to plead but the same error of judgment which has uniformly governed my conduct and from which no man has hitherto suffered any thing but myself  i have no personal interest immediate or remote in the success of this representation before it can produce any effect in bengal the period of my appointment will probably be expired  i have the honor to be etc philip francis  the following paper was drawn up by mr francis about tbe end of the year      very soon after his arrival from india at the request of mr dundas  an inquiry into the administration of the east india companys affairs in bengal and into the effects it has produced may properly be divided by the four following great departments of government and pursued in the same order   poltical   foreign   domestic

augmentation of expense   successive changes in the establishments   present establishment    foreign policy the first general head may be subdivided into particular subjects of inquiry viz    whether the company had any professed fundamental principles of policy relative to the princes and states of india to negociations and treaties with them to war and peace with them and in general to the extension or limitation of their territorial acquisitions  what those principles were and at what periods and in what terms they were communicated and prescribed to their representatives abroad as rules for their conduct    whether these rules have been observed or slighted in what instances and with what consequences or effects  whether the court of directors have enforced their own orders or punished the breach of them and whether they themselves have constantly adhered to or in any instance departed from their professed principles these questions of course lead to an inquiry into facts the most important of which seem to be    the treaty of illiabad between the king shah aalum and the company made the   th of august      and still stubsisting in       the treaty of benares concluded by mr hastings on the  th of september      at an interview with the late vizier suja ul dowla subadar of owde and the secret verbal engagement entered into at the same time by mr hastings to assist him with a body of the companys forces to invade and subdue the rohillas in consideration of the sum of forty lacks of rupees    the sale of the provinces of corah and illiabad to the vizier    the causes conduct and consequences of the rohilla war in         the conduct of the court of directors and the company and the successive orders given by them when these transactions came to their knowledge    the causes conduct and consequences of the mahratta war begun by the presidency of bombay in december      when they took possession of salsette and caranja ended by the definitive treaty of peace concluded at poona in february      between the governor general and council of fort william and the peshwa of the mahratta state recommenced in      by the march of a detachment from the

of bengal is or is not obliged by treaty agreement or otherwise to comply with all requisitions of the court of directors in matters relative to the government of the country or administration of justice  legislative power in the civil department the first object seems to be to ascertain whether any sovereign or legislative power exists in bengal and where it resides or rather whether bengal be not at this time and has not been for many years a country without a sovereign or a legislature and with what consequences such defect has been or may be attended    by what regular and avowed

have taken place in the mode of collecting the revenues since the time when the last report from the committee of the house of commons which sat in      was concluded    what increase or diminution appears in the net amount of the collections since the same period and from what causes such alterations have arisen    what was the plan and object of a committee of circuit instituted in bengal in       on what principles they proceeded  what was the nature and annual amount of the settlement formed by them for five years  what was the final amount of balances and remissions on that settlement    what sort of power and influence the members of the committee of circuit derived from their appointment and in what manner they have employed it    what have been the orders and instructions of the court of directors relative to letting of the lands since the year      and how far they have been observed by the governor general and council    whether persons in authority in the government or

granted in bengal since the institution of the governor general and council  commercial investment   in what manner the provision of the companys investment is made whether by contracts with middle

been or may be exercised    whether the weavers are compelled to work for the company at a fixed price or at liberty to work for whom they think proper    what checks are placed over the board of

individuals now in england what is the quantity of tonnage actually employed in the country or export trade of bengal    what may be the amount of the exports of bengal to the rest of india how the returns are made and whether the balance be in favor of bengal    to form a comparison between the present state of the foreign trade of bengal and that of any former period    to inquire under what restraints and difficulties the inland trade labors whether from heavy duties multiplied custom houses or a vexatious mode of collection  military augmentation   to state the establishment of numbers and expense of the army fortifications and other military services in bengal as they stood in the year      when the company in their instructions to the governor general and council declared that their military expenses in bengal had increased to a degree which was become insupportable to them    to inquire in what manner and on what principles contracts have been made for the construction or repair of barracks fortifications etc for military stores and provisions for boats for victualling fort william and most particularly for supplying the army with draught and carriage bullocks what orders have been given by the court of directors on these several subjects and how they have been obeyed or enforced  changes   to state the successive alterations in the form and augmentations in the

 of general field and staff officers unauthorised by the company or against their orders    what allowances have been granted by the governor general and council to the commanders in chief for the time being in addition to those fixed by parliament or limited by the companys instructions  present state   to state the present establishment and extraordinary expense of the army as they may appear from the latest accounts    to compare the same with that of former periods and with the present means of supporting it  finally to compare the whole of the present expenses of the government of fort william with the whole of their present resources and each of these respectively with that of former periods  when the secret committee shall have carried their investigation thus far one general question perhaps the most important of all will remain to be considered and may properly conclude their inquiries  whereas the legislature have vested the whole civil and military power of the presidency of fort william and in effect the government of bengal in the governor general and council who are directed and required to pay due obedience to all such orders as they shall receive from the court of directors with whom alone they are directed to correspond it follows that the authority of the court of directors is the only medium by which that of great britain over bengal is held and if their authority be slighted or defied it follows that the dependence of that distant dominion on this country is so far forth weakened and its connection with it loosened if not dissolved it seems then to be a point that deserves the most serious attention of parliament to inquire and ascertain in what degree the authority of the court of directors has been in fact binding on the governor general and council in what instances it has been resisted and in general what measures have been adopted and pursued by the court of directors to maintain it and to enforce obedience to their orders and it is to be presumed that parliament will expect an opinion from the secret committee of the effects that have already taken place the consequences that may ensue and whether the dominion of great britain over bengal is secure if the powers vested in the court of directors by parliament be found to have had no operation whether owing to their neglect or inattention to their duty or to any other causes prevailing on this side or to a spirit of independance contumacy and disobedience in their representatives abroad which the court of directors have strongly condemned but have not sufficient power to correct  in support of the propriety of continuing the territorial possessions under the government of the east india company it was strenuously urged in the house of commons that the natives had eminently prospered under that government that it would wound their feelings to be made subject to any other and perhaps might occasion a convulsion among them which might prove fatal to the british interests in india  extract of a letter from earl cornwallis to the court of directors of the east india company dated the  d of august      independent of all other considerations i can assure you that it will be of the utmost importance for promoting the solid interests of the company that the principal landholders and traders in the interior parts of the country should be restored to such circumstances as to enable them to support their families with decency and to give a liberal education to their children according to the customs of their respective casts and religions that a regular gradation of ranks may be supported which is no where more necessary than in this country for preserving order in civil society  i am sorry to be obliged to say that agriculture and internal commerce has for many years been gradually declining and that at present excepting the class of shroffs and banians who reside almost entirely in great towns the inhabitants of these provinces were advancing hastily to a general state of poverty and wretchedness in this description i must even include almost every zemindar in the companys territories which though it may have been partly occasioned by their own indolence and extravagance i am afraid must also be in a great measure attributed to the defects of our former system of management   the nature of the zemindary tenure cannot be more accurately described than it has been by mr hastings in his defense before the house of commons page    viz  had bulwantsing been are al and hereditary zemindar the succession would have gone to him of course there being in india no such custom as disinheritance this circumstance proves also that bulwantsing was not the zemindar for in that case it must have devolved to him by inheritance as zemindar his son must have succeeded it would have been a clear entailed hereditary estate  the end new publications printed for j debrett opposite burlington house piccadilly by permission of the
