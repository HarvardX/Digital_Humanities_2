explanatory remarks upon the life and opinions of tristram shandy wherein the morals and politics of this piece are clearly laid open by jeremiah kunastrokius m d  by way of motto anonymous  london printed for e cabe in avemarylane ludgate street mdcclx  explanatory remarks upon the life and opinions of tristram shandy chap i it is the misfortune of all great writers to put pen to paper so fast and let their imaginations carry them away in such a hurry that they seldom consider whether their readers comprehensions will be able to gallop after them posthaste without being out of breath to the end of the first chapter even though it should not contain above a dozen lines and it is as great an error in judgment  nay worse than that which byng was shot for to put too much wit in any production that is intended for universal reading  i say universal reading for besides the opinion of one of the greatest writers of this or the last age i cannot say which that a reader should have as much wit as the author he reads to understand him  which i flatter myself is seldom the case i speak as an author and therefore should be allowed a little vanity i say besides this generally received doctrine how can we tell what different kinds of wit prevail with all the readers in the universe  to go no further than the antipodes it is a thousand to one whether they would understand a pun or the best bonmot in all tristram shandy  and for aught i can tell in the moon and some other of the illiterate planets they may have exploded every kind of true wit mentioned by addison it is evidently for this reason that in most of the periodical works which are reckoned universal and particularly the magazines we are very seldom troubled with any thing but plain good sense the best method of making water gruel and fattening of capons which may be of use and understood all over the world  chap ii my good friend and arch companion mr tristram shandy gentlemen who makes such honorable mention of my learned father the celebrated doctor kunastrokius of physical memory vide page    vol i has fallen into this very mistake that i have just been mentioning and by a certain subtility of thinking and quaintness of expression the beauties and excellencies of his work may not only be passed over by many of the inhabitants of asiaminor monomotapa some of the mickmacs cherokees and catawbas but at least by seven hundred and fifty of the inhabitants of london and westminster the borough of southwark and parts adjacent  this computation which i did not make myself may appear at first somewhat too exact but the reader may be persuaded i have it from the best authority  my printer who assures me i cannot sell more or less than that number i own i was at first of another opinion and therefore ordered him to print twenty thousand but he soon convinced me of my mistake by the cartloads of wastepaper in his shop so that i now set down to write for the seven hundred and fifty incomprehensible readers of tristram shandy in and about the purlicus of this metropolis  and no other  chap iii to them be it known then that mr tristram shandy is one of the greatest moralists and most refined politicians this or any other age whatever has produced  chap iv before we enter upon the illustration of these round assertions it will be necessary to point out the qualifications of a moralist he should have a fundamental knowledge of ethics or that science which fixes the economy and conduct of human life that teaches the regulation of the passions and instructs men to be happy by practicing all the social virtues he should know how to adapt these rules to the various subjects he treats of and point out such evident and uncontrovertable conclusions in favor of morality as every unbiassed reader must be sensible of the effect  chap v a moralist has generally one two three four five six and sometimes more things in view those of the singular number write for writings sake those of the first plural number invert the rule of economy a penny saved is a penny got and think that in getting a penny they do more than save one they have not  so that they make writing and eating go hand in hand the triple number have generally some new moral doctrine to broach and with the two former concommittants add that of selfopiniated public service then come the controvertists to these and the recontrovertists with their answers replies and rejoinders ad infinitum    but before i launch out any further in the definition of a moral writer i must inform my seven hundred and fifty readers that mr tristram shandy is not among any of these classes  he stands by himself upon the top shelf of ethics  though but in twelves  unrivalled  inimitable  and to my seven hundred and fifty incomprehensible readers incomprehensible he must therefore be more fully explained than any of the foregoing moralists  and for that reason i allow him best part of the following sheets for his public defense to the moral world  chap vi the first evident mark of mr tristrams morals which indeed is no farther than the third page is what he puts into his mothers mouth upon his fathers regularity in winding up the house clock regularity every one knows is the cornerstone of virtue  and virtue is the foundation of morality  thus far then mr shandy goes on in a moral track to give us the history of his antibirth  but what does the winding up of the clock allude to  and how comes it this thought always entered his mothers head once a month this he very naturally accounts for by an assemblage of ideas according to lock and whatever it may want in decency he very notably makes up by sound philosophy and his little men homunculus singular homunculi plural in embrio  according to the economy of human life and consistant with moral duties  chap vii it would be difficult for me and tedious for my readers to trace mr tristram shandy through every part of his moral character i shall therefore confine myself to such traits as are the most striking though not selfevident and least understood  among these the following passage seems next to claim our attention the rituals direct the baptizing of the child in case of danger before it is born but upon this proviso that some part or other of the childs body be seen by the baptiser but the doctors of the sorbonne by deliberation held amongst them april  0      have enlarged the powers of the midwives by determining that though no part of the childs body should appear  that baptism shall nevertheless be administered to it by injection by means of a little squirt it is very strange that st thomas aquinas who had so good a mechanical head both for tying and untying the knots of school divinity should after so much pains bestowed upon this  give up the point at last as a thing impossible  here follows the question upon baptism with the consultation of the doctors of the sorbonne thereupon in french but as mr shandy has not favored us with a translation and as very likely some of my incomprehensible readers may not understand that language i have rendered it in english  those of my readers who notwithstanding their incomprehensibility have a smattering of the gallican tongue and fancy they comprehend the whole affair in the original have nothing to do but skip to chapter   and fancy there is no such thing as chapter   in this whole book  i mean volume  chap viii a memorial presented to the doctors of the sorbonne a surgeon and manmidwife represents to the gentlemen of the sorbonne that there are some cases though very uncommon wherein a mother cannot be delivered and when even the child is so enclosed in the mothers womb that no part of it is body appears in which case according to the rituals baptism should be conferred to it at least upon conditions the surgeon who makes this representation engages by means of a syringe to baptize immediately the child without any way hurting the mother the question he asks is whether this method he proposes is allowable and legal and if he may follow it in a case parallel to that which he represents  the answer to the foregoing memorial  the council is of opinion that the question proposed has many difficulties to be first removed the theologists have on one side established a principle that baptism which is a spiritual birth supposes a prior birth we must be born into the world to be reborn in jesus christ according to their doctrine st thomas part   quaest    article    follows this opinion as an established fact we cannot says that holy doctor baptize children which are enclosed in their mothers wombs by this st thomas means these children are not born and therefore cannot be reckoned amongst other men from whence he infers they cannot be the object of an external action to receive thereby the sacraments necessary to salvation pueri in maternis uteris existentes nondum prodicerunt in lucem ut cum aliis hominibus vitam ducant unde non possunt subjici actioni humanae ut per little ministerum sacramenta recipiant ad salutem the rituals enforce the practice of what theoligists have regulated upon those heads and they unanimously prohibit the baptising of children which are enclosed in their mothers wombs if no part of their bodies appears the concurrence of the theologists and the rituals which are the rules of the diocesses seems to establish an authority necessary to answer the present quesstion however the council of conscience considering on the one hand that the reasonings of the theologists is entirely founded upon their desire of conformity and that the prohibition of the rituals supposes that children so enclosed cannot be baptized in their mothers wombs which is against the present supposition and on the other hand considering that the same theologians teach that the sacraments which jesus christ has established as the easy but necessary means of sanctifying man may be hazarded and besides supposing that children enclosed in their mothers wombs are capable of salvation as they are liable to damnation upon these considerations and having an eye to the memorial wherein it is assured that a certain method is found out of baptizing children thus enclosed without occasioning the least prejudice to the mother the council imagines that the means proposed may be made use of in the belief that god has not left this kind of children without any resource and supposing according to the representation that the means there proposed are porper to procure them baptism nevertheless as by authorizing the proposed practice a rule universally established must be cancelled the council thinks that the memoralist should make application to his bishop whose province it is to judge of the utility and danger of the method proposed and as under the direction of the bishop the council thinks that recourse should be had to the pope in whom the right of explaining the laws of the church and of derogating therefrom where they cannot be executed is invested and however ingenious and useful the manner of baptism here proposed may be the council cannot give their approbation to it without the concurrence of these two authorities the memoralist is at least advised to apply to his bishop and to inform him of the present decision that in case the prelate should coincide with the reasons whereupon the undersigned have founded their opinions he may be authorized in cases of necessity when too much time may be lost to ask permission and have it granted for following the method proposed so advantageous to the childs salvation the council has nothing further to add than that notwithstanding they believe this method may be pursued are nevertheless of opinion that in case the children in question should come into the world contrary to the expectation of those who have used this method it would be necessary to baptize them upon condition and this is conformable to all the rituals which in authorizing the baptism of a child some part of whose body appears enjoins at the same time and orders it is baptism upon condition in case it comes happily into the world  deliberated in the sorbonne the  0th of april      a le moyne l de romigny de marcilly  chap ix i suppose by this time every one of my readers french readers or english readers understands clearly and perspicuously the representation or memorial of the french manmidwife and the answer of the doctors of the sorbonne thereto and in this opinion too before any english translation is given mr tristram shandy gives his compliments to those doctors in the following words  mr tristram shandys compliments to messrs le moyne de romigny and de marcilly hopes they all rested well the night after so tiresome a consultation  he begs to know whether after the ceremony of marriage and before that of consummation the baptizing all the homunculi at once slapdash by injection would not be a shorter and safer cut still on condition as above that if the homunculi do well and come safe into the world after this that each and every of them shall be baptized again on condition   and provided in the second place that the thing can be done which mr shandy apprehends it may by means of a syringe and without any prejudice to the father  this and the foregoing passages are what i propose laboring hard to rescue from the claws of moral though pseudo critics who would insinuate that they are not only directly inconsistent with all morality but evidently antichristian as to you my worthy  though incomprehensible readers i dare say no such thoughts ever entered your brain nor indeed how should they for what immorality can there be in giving the substance of a theological dispute especially when every thing that can possibly give offense is expressed in a foreign tongue  the latter part of this conclusion or query or whatever you please to call it i do not so much insist upon as in that case i should share the guilt if there were any with my friend tristram shandy for having exposed him in english therefore having said all i can say in defense of his morals and orthodoxy in this respect i beg you will conclude with me that in this part he no way deviates from his general moral character  this i think is reasoning ay and sound reasoning too enough for one chapter  and so we proceed to the next  chap x this chapter though entirely upon modesty cannot properly be called a modest chapter notwithstanding there is very little of the authors vanity in it therefore any of my seven hundred and fifty readers being females may pass it over if they choose it and my lazy readers in particular of either gender the epicene not excluded are carefully recommended to avoid it as perhaps after all they will have occasion to recur to a dictionary or be obliged to say their a b c numerically before they understand it    then it can be out of nothing in the world quoth my uncle toby in the simplicity of his heart  but modesty  my sister i dare say added he does not care to let a man come so near her  vide p    vol     one would be inclined to imagine that a man of my friend tristrams strict morals had concluded the sentence before the asterisms and that they were a mere error of the press though they had run through two editions if he had not immediately after added   my sister may hap quoth my uncle toby does not choose to let a man come so near her  make this dash  it is an aposiopesis  take the dash away and write backside  it is bawdy  scratch backside out and put covered way in  it is a metaphor  and i dare say as fortification ran so much in my uncle tobys head that if he had been left to have added one word to the sentence  that word was it vide p    vol     notwithstanding my strict reliance upon tristrams veracity and my great opinion of his uncle tobys purity of expression i cannot be induced to believe that his uncle toby either said backside bawdy or not bawdy or was metaphorically inclined to express himself in a covered way  naked truth i believe he thought the best  four asterisms are but four asterisms  and ever since asterisms have been in use we have always been taught that their number should be supplied by a like number of letters to make out the sense  curious indefatigable unblushing readers consider what letters will properly supply the place without infringing upon the sense  mind i have already exploded uncle tobys backside and covered way  what do you think of head there are but four letters in this word  ay but it will not do it is quite opposite to the authors meaning  arm and leg have but three letters and be hanged to them  thigh comes near it but then there is a letter too many  i have it  the third the twentieth the thirteenth and the nineteenth letters of the english alphabet certainly compose the word though it is not to be found in any lexicon extant  i hope  chap xi this chapter i intend to devote entirely to hobby horses  a hobbyhorse is a machine which boys ay and girls too frequently sit astride upon and which going up and down affords them much amusement  mr tristram shandys hobbyhorse i take to be  four asterisms as explained chap x and his favorite argument the argumentum ad rem as he applies it in page     volume the  st of his work  my hobbyhorse is a goose quill upon which i have rode through life to this period and by which i hope to get hobbyhorsically to my journeys end without much fatigue  n b my hobbyhorse never goes on so briskly as upon a journey of prescriptions and receipts  for instead of paying upon the first road i receive toll and the last excursion i seldom make but for the sale of some young hobby the offspring of my goose quill which never stumbles without i meet with a lady when i get out of the way of the two first syllables of my name and canter on simple strokius  though to be sure there is no more resemblance between a k and a c than there is between my hobbyhorse and a ladys pad  chap xii the foregoing chapters will give my readers a very competent idea of mr tristram shandys morality and religion for though there may be some few slips of the pen particularly where the four asterisms are left to supply the place of a word the drift of this work evidently appears to be moral and orthodox particularly the last which is manifestly evinced by his scheme of baptizing slap dash to use his own words all mankind even before they are born and thereby prevent any heretical or schismatical opinions except in matters of faith whatever  chap xiii i am now going to consider my friend tristram shandy as a politician  or rather as he is considered by the greatest politicians of europe asia africa and america  this it must be owned is an arduous task  but my title page is already printed and i cannot deviate from it but before i begin i make this solemn protestation that if any of the writers of our weekly political papers either composed of a sheet and a half to avoid the payment of duty  or in the form of a journal whereby a whole weeks news is besides a political essay sucked in at the easy charge of twopence halfpenny  or in the shape of a chronicle where piracies do manifestly abound  i say if any printers publishers editors compilers writers authors  whether garetteers first floorers house keepers chariotkeepers shopkeepers stallkeepers or cellarkeepers  hawkers and chapmen do in manifest opposition to this my will dare to borrow rob steal quote cite mention hint  except in my own genteel advertisement from of or that   there is such a book in esse as this present volume  i hereby declare solemnly  i believe i shall prosecute them  and that i certainly will never give them or either of them respectively a good introductory letter or essay or so much as a paragraph or hint concerning such things as no one else can be acquainted with but myself  those are my ideas nay i furthermore declare  i will never read peruse runover or look upon in any light whatever their papers etc etc etc respectively  but give my opinion  which goes a great way with myself right or wrong  and damn them all  n b every part of this and these foregoing chapters extends to all the magazines which i did intend to allot a chapter to enumerate as well as the reviews  without they make very favorable mention of me and this my elaborate work  chap xiv a politician is truly an amphibious animal  and in england he is more inclined to the herring than the monkey  it is quite otherwise in france where it is more requisite for a professed politicans to have learnt to dance than to have read machiavel for his arguments are better enforced by a caper  a pas grave or a balone than by the most syllogistic logic of all the schools un politic de paris that is a paris politician enters a coffee room with a pas de pass pie makes three entrechae at the front lookingglass goes up to the group tells them with a significant air nous f   ns bien le tour aux anglois cette campaigne  ces fires insulaires sauront bien tot fair respect au genie militaire de la france we shall play the devil with the english this campaign those haughty islanders will soon be taught to respect the military genius of france  he cuts two capers and retires whilst the multitude are admiring his profound knowledge of the interest of princes and every one agrees that monsieur a bien raison the orator was quite in the right  chap xv in england every coffeehouse has its president who harrangues the circle that catch his opinions and support them in their different districts   why sir i repeat it what have we to do with continental connections  are not our ships our floating bulwarks our only protection  could the king of  in return for all the assistance we have given him have made such a diversion as the brave captain elliot did in st georges channel i say sir would all the german princes put together have defeated thurot  is not our trade and our navigation the subject of this war  and what is our navigation to the inland parts of germany  trifling  i repeat it very trifling and yet neglect the herring fishery  that peruvian seamine and scarce pay any attention to those elaborate and well digested schemes of the great henriques   the learned deep sighted clear witted eloquent president of    coffeehouse after having made this popular and sagacious harrangue  laid hold of my worthy friend mr tristram shandy  here says he here is the man after my own heart  whose political notions are as clear and selfevident as my own  there is the touchstone of public measures  the whetstone of trade and navigation and the grindstone of malversation  chap xvi some of my incomprehensible readers may be greatly surprised at finding themselves got into such unexpected good company and being conveyed even without a passport whilst we are in the midst of a war with france from london to paris there dip into a political conversation with one of their greatest politicians got back safe to england without being put into the bastile for dissenting with him in his political opinions and holding french faith french generals french admirals as well as french minisers in the highest contempt then transported into one of our most oratorial coffeehouses and become auditors to a second cicero and a third demosthenes  all this shall be explained to you in a few words  it was necessary  how else could i have illustrated my assertion that a politician is an amphibious animal  how else could i have demonstrated that he has more of the monkey in him in france and more of the herring in him in england as to the parisian we dropped him a chapter or two ago but we have not yet done with cicero or demosthenes which ever you please to call him you shall have some more conversation with him presently and take my word for it he is abstracted from oratory a very shrewd sensible fellow and according to the common saying sees as far into a millstone as another man  chap xvii it may be necessary to inform some of my readers that we are not yet got out of    coffeehouse in    street  no  here we are yet as attentive as ever to mr profound that is the gentlemans name in the black full bottom wig and the green spectacles who has by this time thrown down a dish of coffee in enforcing his argument upon the touchstones whetstones and grindstones taken two pinches of snuff and opened tristram shandy exactly at page      was i an absolute prince he would say pulling up his breeches with both his hands as he rose from his arm chair i would appoint able judges at every avenue of my metropolis who should take cognizance of every fools business who came there  and if upon a fair and candid hearing it appeared not of weight sufficient to leave his own home and come up bag and baggage with his wife and children farmers sons etc etc at his back they should all be sent back from constable to constable like vagrants as they were to the place of their legal settlements by this means i shall take care that my metropolis tottered not through its own weight that the head be no longer too big for the body that the extremes now wasted and pined in be restored to their due share of nourishment and regain with it their natural strength and beauty  i would effectually provide that the meadows and corn fields of my dominions skould laugh and sing oh excellent metaphor cried mr profound in ecstasy worthy of the great pen from whence it flows   that good cheer and hospitality flourish once more  and that such weight and influence be put thereby into the hands of the squirality of my kingdom as should counterpoise what i perceive my nobility are now taking from them great  great tristram  and see how elegantly he illustrates this immediately after  why are there so few palaces and gentlemens seats he would ask with some emotion as he walked across the room throughout so many delicious provinces in france whence is it that the few remaining chateaus amongst them are so dismantled so unfurnished and in so ruinous and desolate a condition  because sir he would say in that kingdom no man has any country interest to support  the little interest of any kind which any man has any where in it is concentrated in the court and the looks of the grand monarch by the sunshine of whose countenance or the clouds which pass acros it every french man lives or dies  here mr profound made a pause after which  he addressed himself to us  well gentlemen what do you think of this great political writer  you may talk of your machiavels and your sommerss and your burnets  but what are they when compared to him how clearly he states the case when he has a mind for it and then again when he chooses to screen himself in a kind of parable how elegantly he does it another political reason says tristram prompted my father so strongly to guard against the least evil accident in my mothers lyingin in the country  was that any such instance would infallibly throw a balance of power too great already into the weaker vessels of the gentry in his own or higher stations  which with the many usurped rights which that part of the constitution was hourly establishing  would in the end prove fatal to the monarchical system of domestic government established in the first creation of things by god  what can he mean here resumed mr profound but pecuniary influence in elections particularly in boroughs and yet there is not one in a hundred takes it in that sense i tell you gentlemen tristram shandy is one complete system of modern politics and that to understand him there is as much occasion for a key as there is for a catalogue to the harleian library i own that i should not myself have penetrated so far as i have notwithstanding my great reading in works of this nature if i had not had the opportunity of supping the other evening with the author who let me into the whole affair i advised him to publish a key but he told me it was too dangerous   what is the siege of namur which he often mentions but the siege of fort st philips in minorca  or the wound his uncle toby received there but the distress the nation was thrown into thereupon his application to the study of fortification and the knowledge he therein gained means nothing else but the rectitude and clear sightedness of the administration which afterward took up the reins of government this is a master piece of allegory beyond all the poets of this or any period whatever there is but one fault to be found with mr tristram shandy as a politician  that is making yoricks horse so lean  but then he is armed at all points  i think too he should have told us the horse was white to have made the symbolical application  but he did not dare declare himself so openly upon this head  he told me so gentlemen continued he i will only read to you one passage more and leave you to make your remarks  in a word he would say error was error no matter where it fell whether in a fraction or a pound  twas alike fatal to truth and she was kept down at the bottom of her well as inevitably by a mistake in the dust of a butterflys wing  as in the disk of the sun the moon and all the stars of heaven put together  he would often lament that it was for want of considering this properly and of applying it skilfully to civil matters as well as to speculative truths that so many things in this world were  that the political arch was giving way do you observe gentlemen how forcibly he speaks here and that the very foundation of our excellent constitution in church and state were so sapped as estimators reported  chap xviii when mr profound had got thus far a fit of coughing took him which i was apprehensive would very near have carried him off  i waited with great patience near a quarter of an hour till he had recovered himself in expectation of having gained from him an explanation of this passage which he certainly would have given notwithstanding he told us in the beginning he would leave us to our own reflecti  ons but how unluckily mortifying was it both for you and me readers that after the fit left him there was not a sufficient number of auditors remaining to form a committee and mr profound went away as much out of temper with his cough as with his company i have regularly attended the house for above a fortnight past in expectation of meeting him when tears speak my grief i yesterday learned he died the night before  and all my hopes of an explanation of this passage are at an end  i propose erecting here a monument to the memory of profound in the same manner as tristram has to that of yorick  alas poor profound    i have just received the mortifying news that my printer has never a black copperplate to subjoin but i have desired him to borrow tristrams of his printer and if he will but lend it you may depend upon being as well amused and enlightened here as you were in reading the seventy third and seven fourth pages of the  st volume of tristram shandy  chap xix i told you incomprehensible readers you know your number by this time what a clever fellow profound was so that i hope you did not lose a word that he said but if you think that there was only a single syllable that you did not attend to i insist upon your returning back to the three preceding chapters as you will swear else i have not fulfilled the promise of my title page explaining the politics of tristram which can be done no other way than in the words of my deceased friend friend did i say yes i repeat it a great friend and what is more and difficult to believe a political friend who has enabled me to throw such light upon our author and clear the understandings of seven hundred and fifty incomprehensible readers  chap xx thus much for mr tristram shandys politics  chap xxi some of the most comprehensible of my readers must have observed that i have scattered very little greek and latin about this work and that i have even made shift with an english motto notwithstanding a classical one is so essential to the well understanding and recommending a book even though of this consequence  to be honest i must own that none of the family of the kunastrokiuss were any great grecians  and as to latin i always found it a very saleable commodity at the physicalmarket but if any of my readers should be desirous to divert themselves with a greek or latin quotation i would advise them to read me with homer herodotus virgil horace and a few more of the classics by their sides and if they understand them not else  they have nothing to do but now and then dip into one or other of them and please themselves and save me a great deal of unnecessary trouble  chap xxii this chapter is entirely upon propriety and must therefore of course with or without a pun be a very proper chapter  digressions are the soul of a work as mr tristram shandy has very judiciously discovered and he has as tenaciously adhered to this discovery  wherefore he may with the greatest propriety be styled the king of episodical writers  as to absurdities it is absurd to suppose there can be any in a work of humor  true humor i mean  i appeal to all and every one of my incomprehensible readers if there be any absurdity in the work now before them  i will answer for you all in one word  none in regard to my friend tristram what are generally reckoned absurdities in him are his greatest beauties  though he ridicules plates and cuts by a ridiculous stamp may he not with great propriety prefix a frontispiece to his second edition  every one must own that a frontispiece when executed by a masterly hand is an embellishment to a work  and who can be so out of the way as to find fault with an embellishment which evidently inhances the value of the production  again with respect to dedications  though that in the middle of his first volume certainly means if any thing a burlesque upon dedications of what nature so ever yet we find in his second edition he has dedicated this moralpolitical not bawdy ludicrous as some may imagine it piece to one of the most respectable characters in england  but who can take offense at it  what i have said in this chapter concerning mr tristram shandys propriety sets some of the mistaken errors of that work in the clearest points of light in which my readers incomprehensible as they are must certainly view them  chap xxiii like most other writers when i have nothing more to say i draw near a conclusion but as it is necessary for several reasons which i could explain if i chose but not having promised it in my title page i am not compelled to it to eke out another chapter i must say something if it be only to contradict what i have hitherto said  but this i shall not do and so continue as follows  if after all i have not sufficiently cleared my friend tristram shandy from any attacks of the false critics for want of morals or for any small heresy in politics  no part of this can be laid to his charge  as he was then unborn as he still remains in a literal sense  but to wave all considerations of this nature my readers as incomprehensible as they are must have perceived ever now that tristram shandy is the most excellent i was going to say  est by way of a superlative superlative suitable to the occasion piece that has appeared for many years besides according to hubras     the worth of every thing is just as much as it will bring  and this is the dearest production to the bookseller if not to the public that has appeared for near half a centry  advertisement to the nobility and gentry of all europe as i expect in consequence of the foregonig work to receive invitations on every hand for parties of pleasure regales dinners and suppers  in order to prevent confusion in my engagements and that i may not make appointments with persons i am entirely ignorant of i beg they would with all convenient dispatch send their titles names and places of abode with cards to my booksellers that i may pay compliments to them according to their different ranks or where upon a footing according to their alphabetical succession  n b such noblemen etc as choose to give me testimony of their approbation of this book by particular marks of their beneficence will please to take notice that no living however lucrative can be accepted as i am not in orders  i am particularly obliged to the managers of both the houses whose kind intentions i already anticipate in favoring me with the freedom of their respective theaters and they may depend upon my paying my compliments to them in due time  but i am afraid i cannot accept of mr    s kind invitation to his house at hampton this summer  finis
