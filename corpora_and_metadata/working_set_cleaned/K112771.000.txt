the peerage of scotland containing an historical and genealogical account of the nobility of that kingdom  collected from the public records of the nation the charters and other writings of the nobility and from the most approved histories  by george crawfurd esquire  edinburgh printed for the author sold by george stewart at the book and angel in the parliamentclose       the preface the nature of this work seeming to render something of a preface necessary i shall for that reason entirely dedicate it to the service of the reader in as few words as possibly i can  having formerly written a short essay upon the royal family of stewart to which was prefixed an historical account and description of the shire of renfrew i had no sooner published that little book than several persons of eminent distinction for their learning and knowledge in the antiquities of the nation for whose judgment i had the most profound regard set upon me to write a peerage of scotland a book very much wanted which at length by their importunity and promised assistance i was prevailed with to undertake  when i first set about this work as i did entirely devote and dedicate my time to the study of antiquities particularly those of our own country so i made it my business to collect all those historical and genealogical tracts that had been done on the nobility that i could come to the knowledge of the oldest of that kind i have met with was a few loose sheets on the genealogies of our nobility said to be done by james lord ochiltree in the hands of my very worthy friend and one of our best antiquaries mr baillie of castlecary but the accounts even of the few families that lord treats of are very lame and i observe where he goes much higher than his own time they are purely traditional and therefore i could not depend on them  i perused also the large genealogical collections concerning the nobility by sir james balfour who was lord lion king at arms in the reign of king charles i but they are written so very loosely and i have seen them contradicted so frequently by writs and charters that i give them but little credit i suppose sir james never intended these papers should have gone further than his own closet for he was a learned and curious gentleman as appears from his annals in which he is much more exact especially as to what occurred in his own time  i procured likewise a copy of the historical essay on the principal families of the kingdom alphabetically digested by the learned lord advocate sir george mackenzie of rosehaugh but i apprehend these papers have been only some first draught of a greater work sir george intended which he lived not to finish of this there are many copies in several hands the most exact by very far of any of them i have seen was that which i had the use of from thomas crawfurd of cartsburn my brother who by his own reading and knowledge in the antiquities of the nation has rectified a great many of sir georges mistakes at least of his amanuensis and has with great accuracy embellished his own copy with a vast deal of fine historical remarks that it well deserves the character of a curious manuscript  i had moreover a sight of the genealogies of the nobility collected by mr dunlop the late principal of the college of glasgow who was historiographer for scotland a gentleman of great integrity and learning and an excellent antiquary i understand he intended to have written a peerage of scotland and for that end made very full collections on that subject but i observe that most of mr dunlops accounts are composed of those genealogical descents that the nobility have in their own families and are handed about by their friends and that ingenious gentleman did with great accuracy and judgment add historical memoirs to the genealogies which give them a great ornament and he is very exact as to his authorities the ms was communicated to me by my very worthy friend mr dunlop the present professor of greek in the university of glasgow the principals son  but after i had made all those collections i have mentioned and a great deal more of that kind i cannot stay to particularize i found i had not any tolerable foundation for the carrying on the work i had undertaken for the honor of the country the design it was principally for or my own reputation and therefore by the advice and direction of my ingenious friends who had engaged me in the design i did with as much humility and modesty as i was master of address every peer by myself or some friend for the assistance of their own charters and writings to enable me to do their families justice in this undertaking  such helps as i sought were very generously afforded me by the greater part of the nobility who allowed me the perusal of their charterchests and original writings from which i composed the accounts of their families as they stand in my book severals indeed i did not see some were unwilling to show their family writs for diverse reasons some were minors others were abroad and out of the country and even to such i have done all the justice was possibly in my power but if the accounts of such families whose charters i have not had access to be shorter and less connected than others that was what cannot be supposed i could help i took care timeously to advertise every body concerned and if they did not incline to show me their writs the blame cannot be laid on me  but that i might be the better able to carry on the work i had undertaken with advantage and to form accounts of those noble families whose writs i had not seen and to supply if a hiatus did happen as it frequently did in such families whose writings i had perused i searched all the public offices and libraries about edinburgh by the public offices i mean the registers of the great seal which i perused from the charters of king robert i down to our own times in the laigh parliament house and in the chancery i looked over also the records of the justiciary and all the chartularies in the lawyers library  and noted every thing as exactly as i could and the keepers of these offices were so obliging as to allow me access at all hours ordinary and extraordinary whenever i called and to whom therefore i do with all due gratitude return my most humble and hearty acknowledgments  but after all my labor i am so far from being so vain as to imagine this essay is not capable of any further improvement that on the contrary i am sensible i have through inadvertency and the errors of the press especially in dates and proper names of the present age fallen into many mistakes but i beg the ingenious reader will pardon these omissions which are inevitable in such books and where he discovers an error he will correct it with his pen  perhaps some may think that i have been fuller upon some families even some that are extinct than on others who are much more ancient than those i enlarge more upon the reason is plain the representatives relations or descendents of those noble families showed me their writs and encouraged my design if others had done so i doubt not but i should have been able to have done them as full and vouched them as well for i can say and do here declare on the word of a gentleman that i had no regard in the doing of justice in my province as an author to the encouragement i received from any man otherwise than to reckon myself very much obliged to such and i own i did not spare either time or pains to discover any particular i thought could give an ornament to the antiquity or a luster to the honor of their families  but where i have been assisted from the public records or authentic history i have been as full on those families who never encouraged the design as i have been upon those who gave me the greatest assistance every way and for the truth of this i can and do appeal to severals of the nobility themselves who will find very long deduced and well vouched descents of their families in this peerage who never encouraged my undertaking in any degree but as i said before that i had had no respect to for my chief and only regard was and shall be truth and the honor of our country as far as i am capable to discover the one or defend the other  as to the work it self i shall say nothing but after so great labor and expense of time the essay being new and never before attempted how defective soever it may be i cannot but hope will meet with a favorable reception from the ingenious and more particularly have the approbation and countenance of persons of distinction who frequently read such books and know how useful and acceptable undertakings of this kind have ever been accounted in all the polite nations of europe  the peerage of scotland hamilton earl of

his own family much less the kingdom but that which should atone for all his oversights and preserve his memory from all unkind reflections was the glorious part he acted in conducing so much toward the restoration of king james i in which he was the great instrument not long thereafter the king growing jealous of the dukes power which no doubt was very great and discovering some treasonable intrigue in which he was concerned he was first put under arrest and sent prisoner to the castle of carlaverock and being shortly after brought to his trial he was found guilty of high treason by his

family was undoubtedly very ancient and said to be of a hungarion extraction so it was no less illustrious for it is allyances as the whole course of this work does testify but in regard i had no access to see any of their writes i cannot make a deduction of them i shall only remark that the last lord whose very name i could never so much as learn died without issue since the restoration of king charles ii and with him the honor of the family failed  murray lord of bothwel all our scots historians make mention of the moravii as a bold and warlike tribe who about the middle of the first century were very assistant to king corbred i in his wars against the romans whose captain roderick and a great many of his followers were slain in that famous expedition of queen baudicea related also by cornelius tacitus but that i may proceed to my design in giving a historical and genealogical deduction of the ancient and noble family of the murrays properly so called i shall begin with their ancestor one friskinus who was a great man in the northern parts in the reign of king david i anno      for it is certain he was not only possessed of the country of moravia now called moray but likewise that of sutherland which he divided betwixt two of his sons and from whence they took their respective sirnames writes of the episcopal see of murray in the registers of that church in the lawyers library ms and his descendents even to this time carry the same coat of arms viz three molets differing only in the tincture  william de moravia filius friskini seems to be a very great man about the court of king william as appears from the frequency of his witnessing the deeds of that pious prince to the cathedral church of moray and to the bishops of that see ibidem confirm by king william ric epis moraviae ecclesiae de forress to which this great man was likewise himself a benefactor he left issue  william de moravia who is entitled willielmus de moravia filius willielmi filii friskini in a donation which he made in pure and perpetual alms ecclesiae sancti trinitatis de spiny and collegio canonicorum ibidem deo servientium ecclesiam de artindoll cum pertinen coram hugone fratre suo and archibaldo de douglas cartulary of the cathedral church of elgine in bib jurid he left issue several sons of whom diverse ancient families of the murrays branched ibidem beside  walter de moravia miles who is designed filius domini willielmi demoravia ibidem in an indenture between him and the bishop of moray relative to the church of artindole ad annum      and was likewise a donator to st nicolass hospital near the bridge of spey by his gift of the lands of achinway ad sustentationem pauperum ibidem recipiendorum of which the bishops of moray were patrons he gave to the church of elgin and the chapter of the episcopal see of moray ecclesiam de inerallel cum pertinen pro salute animae suae and is the same walterus as i take it who is one of the great men magnates scotiae mentioned as a guarantee in a treaty of peace betwixt our king alexander ii and henry iii of england anno      rymers foedera angliae ad annum      he left a son  willielmus de moravia filius walteri de moravia who is so designed in the act declaratory of the succession of the scots crown to king alexander iii and his heirs anno      ibidem ad annum      and is the same noble person designed panetarius scotiae and dominus de bothwel and drumsargard rymers foedera angliae ad annum    0 and      under which title there are many donations made by the heirs of this noble house to the chapter of the episcopal see of moray after they came to have possessions in the south and spread there into many noble branches  this willielmus de moravia dominus de bothwel and drumshargard panetarius scotiae was one of the great barons summoned to bervick as an auditor of the claims of the bruce and the baliol anent the succession to the crown ibidem his title of drumshargard distinguishes him from another sir william de moravia de tilybardin mentioned in the same write of summons when that great affair was in agitation and which afterward was by king edward i of england

history is the best vouched and instructed of any of that kind i have ever perused and it carries a great air of antiquity with it and is very nobly oramented with accurate historical remarks and well deserves the character of a curious book the author beside other instructions for the original descent of the murrays of drumshargard and abercarnie from the moravii of bothwel does very judiciously observe that both the baronies of bothwell and drumshargard now called camslang were in the person of sir william de moravia panetarius scotiae designed dominus de bothwel and drumshargard and indeed can i observe be well made out from comparing the english foedera prynne and the chartulary of glasgow together and that immediately upon his death they came to be two distinct lordships andrew being lord of bothwel sir williams eldest son whom we know was so by his hereditary office of panetarius scotiae and sir john whom my author calls his younger son was lord dominus de drumshargard and which he makes well appear and concludes it is plain he was sir williams second son for his patrimonial estate of drumshargard lay contiguous with and was a part of his lordship of bothwel and given him off by his father for in matters of so remote antiquity we conclude for certain what is instructed so rationally by such manuscripts as are neither contradicted by writes nor any authentic history but confirmed by constant uninterrupted and universal tradition in perthshire  andrew de moravia panetarius scotiae and dominus de bothwel was just such a patriot as his father whom he did not long survive for he lost his life in the attempt at stirling to redeem his country from the subjection and slavery it was under to the english on the memorable    th september      buchanan and abercromby leaving sir andrew his son and heir who tracing the steps of his noble and loyal father in a firm and resolute adherence to the interest of his country of which he had given such pregnant instances and of his eminent courage and conduct in diverse encounters with the opposite party that he was thought worthy to be joined with sir william wallace in the command of the army which anno      entered england and performed such actions of wonderful courage that they became very terrible to the enemy and thereafter when robert the bruce took upon him the title of king of scotland and declared his purpose of doing all was in his power toward the redemption of his country and the retriving of the independency of the nation no body appeared more hearty in his interest than sir andrew murray or stood more firm to that glorious monarch in all the vicissitudes of fortune that befell him and it was no doubt in reward of his great merit that the king bestowed upon him his sister the lady

was upon the death of the earl of mar the governor unanimously elected regent in his room and he held that great office except a little time he was a prisoner in england with the universal approbation of the whole nation and the applause of all men even till his death anno      buchanan says that having reduced lothian to the obedience of his lawful sovereign king david to give himself a little relaxation he made a progress into the north to visit his own lands and possessions transmontana praedia intervisit which no doubt was his own old northern estate in elginshire and out of which his sons made mortifications to the cathedral church of elgine where their father was interred whose character drawn by the great buchannan i cannot pass over speaking of his death he says summum apud

viderentur he was solemnly interred with his ancestors in the cathedral church of elgin under a canopy of free stone in armor as big as the life with his coat of arms over him dr johnstoun celebrates

robert the iii to break the marriage articles he had entered into with the earl of march whereby the prince the kings son was to have married the earl of marchs daughter and in place of that lady to substitute elisabeth douglas his own daughter and who says he is so much a stranger to our history as not to know that from the time of this earl till the extinction of the stem of that illustrious

were alone sufficient to preserve his memory yet cannot i omit adding this epitaph which mr hume gives him quicquid sors potuit mortali in pectore far vel facere hoc didici perficere atque pati prima

his own body in      he resigned the lordship of douglass in favors of sir william his nephew son of archibald lord of galloway who was slain at the battle of halydonhill so fatal to the scots anno      whereupon he obtained from king david bruce a charter de omnibus terris reditus and possessiones per totum regnum scotiae de quibus quondam jacobus dominus de douglass avunculus suus and archibaldus pater suus obierunt vestiti cum regalitate and libera warena integre and honorifice una cum ducatu hominum vicecomitatum de roxburgh and selkrig in the      he was warden of the east marches toward england and accompanying king david to the battle of durham he was taken prisoner with his sovereign hume  but was soon afterward released in      he was one of the commissioners on the part of scotland authorized to treat with the english about the redemption of the king rymers foedera angliae  and among other nobles bound to edward iii for a hundred thousand pound sterling ransom in which deed he is designed willielmus dominus de douglass miles much about the same time he was dignified with the honor of earl of douglass for i find him entitled willielmus comes de douglass when he is joined in commission with diverse lords to treat with english commissioners about king davids enlargement rymer  this earl was deeply engaged on the french side in the memorable battle of pictiers where john king of france was taken prisoner by the black prince and very narrowly escaped being then ambassador from king robert ii to the french court where the ancient alliance betwixt the two crowns was renewed and confirmed as for his works of piety i have only discovered that he gave in pure alms to the abbey of melross and the monks serving and perpetually to serve god there the patronage of the church of cavers with its tithes for celebrating divine service there according to the tenor of a special ordination by him made viz for certain priests who were to perform that service for the good estate of his sovereign lord king david and of himself during his life and for the health of his soul and his ancestors and successors after his departure hence and which donation the said king ratified in the  0th of his reign  he married first margaret daughter of donald sister and at length sole heir of thomas earl of mar here i take the liberty to differ from mr hume who says this earls first marriage was with the earl of marchs daughter and that he had by her james earl of douglass killed at otterburn which is a mistake for i have seen a mortification by margaret countess of douglass and mar to the church of st mary of garrioch for the soul of william earl of douglass her husband and james earl of douglass her son and heir also there is a confirmation by the same earl james to the monks of melross of the church of cavers wherein he is designed comes de douglass and mar moreover it is to be considered that upon the decease of earl james isabel his sister of the whole blood succeeded him in the honor of mar when the earldom of douglass devolved upon archibald their brother of the half blood  by whom he had james his son and heir and isabel a daughter after the death of her brother countess of mar who became first the wife of sir malcolm drummond of cargill who in right of her was entitled lord mar charta penes ducem de douglass  and thereafter of sir alexander steuart knight in whose favor she resigned the said earldom anno   0  causa says she matrimonii contracti inter dominum alexandrum senescal and nos dictam isabellam charta in rotulis roberti iii  which honor he enjoyed till his death  this earl williams second marriage having divorced his former wife was with margaret daughter of patrick earl of march this is with greater probability than that he was brother by the same mother to james earl of douglass killed at otterburn for when he succeeded to the honor and estate of douglass he made no claim to mar which descended to isabel earl jamess sister as is above narrated  by whom he had archibald lord galloway afterward earl of douglass and his third and last was margaret daughter and heir of thomas steuart earl of angus by whom he had george douglass first earl of angus of that name he departed this life in      and was interred in the abbey church of melross according to mr winton whose words are these to douglasdale as i heard say an sickness took him by the way and there he dyed in short space  to melrose then they took his body and there it bury it right honorably   this earl was succeeded by james his son between whom and sir henry percy there were glorious feats of arms performed in honor of their country he was killed at the battle of otterburn    of july      fought betwixt him and sir henry hotspur son to the earl of northumberland an encounter says one managed with that unparallelled courage on both sides that it was hardly to be matched in history and was the occasion of an old rhyme of which this is a part it fell about the lammas tide when yeoman win the hay the doughtie douglass began to ride in england to take a prey   mr john johnston our famous poet has endeavored on his part to perpetuate his memory by the following elegy quaeritis o quid agam en animam jam ago fata meorum hac sequor innumero huc vulnere facta via est nesciat hoc hostis sequitor quam quisque secat

ancient times is thought by the learned spelman and seldom to have been the kings principal minister in a province no doubt invested with a power of administration of justice to which certain honourary privileges were annexed it is thought it was not at the first institution properly a title of dignity but of service they were of two kinds either such as served the king in greater places of eminency who were called thani majores or thani regis as the thanes of fife caithness argyle and murray were these that served under them were termed thani minores but when the title of comes and dux became hereditary so the learned are of opinion the title and privileges of thani majores did descend with the lands from fathers to their children tho the lesser did not yet they still retained the old name of thanes and thanedoms as the baronies of boyn in baff shire and calder in murray etc are called to this time and perhaps the difference betwixt the two consisted in this that the greater thanes derived their power and authority immediately from the king and held them of the crown in capite for knights service which by a certain constitution made them hereditary and were of the same kind with them that afterward came to be parliamentary barons the lesser thanes had only commissions from them and were held in the ordinary way for services done and to be done all our histories do agree that mackduff formerly thane was created earl of fyfe by king malcolme canmore anno  0   balfour and other scots historians  and that in consideration of his extraordinary services to that prince in assisting him to revenge his fathers death upon mackbeth and to recover his crown for which he gave him and his heirs these great and noble privileges  i that his posterity should have the honor to place the succeeding kings in the chair of state at their coronations  ii that they should lead the van of the royal armies  iii that if any within the  th degree in relation to his family should be guilty of the unpremeditated slaughter or casual homicide of a gentleman he should pay twenty four merks of silver and but twelve if a plebeian for expiation of the crime flying to a sanctuary near newburgh in fyfe on the confines of strathern which was much the same privilege granted to mackduffs kindred as the cities of refuge were to the isralites joshua  0 at the place of

sirnames became first fashionable so it is not to be doubted but the surname of gray has the same derivation some are of opinion that it took its rise from a city in the franche compte which is still so named others and among those francis de bellowforest derives the surname of gray from the castle of gray in picardy and adds that one rollo chamberlain to robert duke of normandy who possessed the aforesaid castle was the first who assumed that surname however it is certain one anchitil de gray came over to england with william the conqueror and that when the general survey was made in the  0th of that kings reign he held many lands in oxfordshire and elsewhere from him many great and illustrious families in england are descended as the dukes of kent and suffolk the earl of stamford the barons gray of chilingham and werk with their numerous cadets whose names and heroic actions are frequently to be met with in the english history  that the lord gray in scotland has his descent from some of these cannot be doubted mr camden the great english antiquary and others of our own country also are mistaken as to the time of their ancestors coming to scotland as will appear afterward but they assert and with great probability that the first of this most noble family was a son of the house of chilingham indeed the armorial bearing of both families are still the same and it is observable that the lands of browfield the first inheritance of the grays in scotland ly in the county of roxburgh or teviotdale at no great distance from chilingham in northumberland which lands were given off in the reign of king robert i to sir andrew gray his son who and his posterity enjoyed the same for several generations till andrew lord gray who was justicegeneral in the time of king james iii exchanged them with the earl of angus for brughtiecastle bagilo and the fishings thereof now every body knows that some northern counties of england and northumberland in particular were some times possessed by the kings of scotland and it is well known that some of those who held lands of the crown of scotland in the northern counties of england had also possessions within scotland the bruces and baliols and many others did so and when war broke out betwixt the two nations the families so stated divided among themselves and adhered to either of the kings in whose dominions they had largest possessions thus it is probable that sir andrew gray the first whom we find on record with us adhered to king robert the bruce whose subject he was upon the account of his scots estate this sir andrew was undoubtedly a brave man and a great favorite of that glorious monarch robert i from whom he had a grant the   th of february the  th year of his reign anno      of the barony of long forgan in the shire of perth and of many other lands in forfarshire for his good and faithful services as the charter bears charta penes dominum gray  he also acquired the lands of broxmouth in the county of roxburgh from sir alexander fraser knight and these two records which i my self have seen and perused though there were no other extant do sufficiently confute a very gross mistake of boethius buchanan and camden who say that the first of this noble family came only to scotland with king james i when he was relieved from his captivity out of england anno      whereas the chief of this family another sir andrew gray was by the estates of scotland sent to england one of the hostages for that kings ransom but of this afterward with whom this gallant sir andrew was married it does not appear but from the archives of the family of gray it is evident he left a son sir john gray who succeeded him in his estate who in several records is styled lord of broxmouth as are several of his descendents after him  this john gray de gray dominus de broxmouth had a grant of the lands of craigie in the county of forfar from william de troup for a very valuable consideration mentioned therein and that grant was confirmed to him by king david ii the  th of september the twenty seventh year of his reign anno      with whom it would appear he was no less in favor than his father had been with the great king robert i find this noble person had very great superiorities beside his own proper estate as a proof of which there is a charter granted to him by hugode giffard whereby he acknowledges sir john gray to be superior lord to henry de fotheringham of the lands of lourenston and huhcuman now called littleton of the date at langforgan ultime februarii      ibidem  i find also that john gray was custos rotulorum and registri in the reign of king david bruce and likewise of his successor king robert ii who had for pension during life ducentos solidos sterlingorum out of the profits of the court of the chamberlain and justiciary charta in archivis david ii ad annu      etiam charta in rotulis roberti ii  a sallary that has been observed by a learned and judicious person to amount to as much as the constable or marischal enjoyed as the fees of their offices in those days to whom sir john gray the lord of broxmouth was married it does not appear from any record of the family but it is clear that he left two sons john the eldest who was one of the hostages for the ransom of his royal sovereign king david anno      rymers loedera angli  with whom he had been made a prisoner at the battle of durham in the year      and sir patrick who succeeded him in his great estate and in the royal favor for king robert ii in a charter to this sir patrick gray designed lord of broxmouth and to margaret his wife of sundry lands in the barony of longforgan the king gives him the distinguishing appellation of cosanguineus noster charta penes dominum gray  likeas he had by the said king pro retinentia sua a yearly pension of    l    s   d sterling and that during life ibidem  which is all i have found memorable of him by margaret his wife aforesaid but of what name or family the record does not mention he left issue four sons andrew alexander patrick and george also two daughters married to lindsay of crawfurd and elizabeth to andrew moncur of thatilk  sir andrew gray the next of this noble family added to the old paternal estate of his family the barony and lordship of fowlis in perthshire by his marriage with janet daughter and sole heir of sir roger mortimer knight lord of fowlis ibidem  it was this sir angrew gray who in his old age had the honor to be one of the hostages for the redemption of king james i when he was relieved out of england in

a full assembly of the three estates of parliament to which all of them set their seals  i must acknowledge i have not had the honor to peruse the more ancient writes of the family of hamiltoun wherefore i am obliged to rely upon the account given me from mr hamilton of wishaw an antiquary of no little fame who says that sir gilbert hamilton the first of this illustrious race who transplanted himself from the kingdom of england was extracted from the ancient earls of licester of whose grant his progenitor had lands in that county called hamilton from whence they assumed a surname and that the occasion of his coming to scotland is delivered by historians after this manner sir gilbert say they at the court of edward ii chanced to talk with honor and respect of the great merit of king robert the bruce whereupon one john del spencer gave him a blow which arrogant treatment he resented so highly that encountering him the next day he killed him and to avoid punishment fled to scotland where he was well received by king robert who to make amends for what he had forfaulted on his account at home generously rewarded him with the barony of cadzow in the county of lanerk then an appendage of the crown he was a very brave man and to him are ascribed a vast many great exploits particularly that he distinguished his valor and conduct in the decisive battle of bannockburn which happened on the the   th of july      so eminently that he was knighted in the field and got a gift of diverse lands my former author further informs me that he was matched with a lady of the family of the randolphs raised in that reign to the honor of earl of murray by whom he had two sons sir walter his successor and sir john hamilton of rossaven knight of whom sprung the family of prestoun in vicde edinburgh and its branches to sir gilberts memory this epitaph was composed by a famous author iure ego deserui patriam veteresque penates nempe fidem jus fas deserit illa prius jam nova jura libens inii sub rege benigno qui profugo patriam qui potiora dedit hinc res at que decus fortunaque laeta secuta est hinc regum thalamis nobilitata domus esto solum verti at patriam inveni haec dedit auxit quae modo perdideram quae potui illa dedi   sir walter his son was a man of great fame and character he had several military commands in the service of robert i which he performed with great diligence and success in consideration whereof he had by that princes grant a charter of the barony of cadzow to be held in as ample manner as sir gilbert his father held the same also in the  th of the same reign to reward his great merit and acceptable services he had a grant of the barony of machanshire in the county of lanark which formerly belonged to john cumin knight further in the      the king bestowed on him the lands of kinneil larber brimage and auldcathie in the shire of linlithgow and the very same year the lands of kirkinder and kirkowen in the county of wigtoun for good services done and to be done by him as the charter bears thus by his princes bounty and favor arriving to great wealth and honor he strengthened his family by a very noble alliance taking to wife isobel daughter of william earl of ross wishaws account of the family of hamilton  and neice to the king by her mother by whom he had two sons who survived him sir david and sir john hamilton from whom the families of innerweek ballincrieff and the present earl of haddingtoun are descended  to sir walter hamilton succeeded sir david his son who served king david ii in his wars against the english he was with the king at the unfortunate battle of durham anno      where he was taken prisoner with his master mr rymers foedera angli  but paying a ransom he was released that he had great esteem from that king is plain enough for in the  0th of his reign he had a special grant of all the lands which belonged either to sir gilbert his grandfather or sir walter his father in any part of the realm the charter is dated    september      and at the same time the king was pleased to discharge for ever to him and his heirs a feuduty that had been formerly payable to the exchequer out of the barony of cadzow a sign of the prevalency of his interest at that princes court where men of merit were only employed in the  th of king robert ii anno      he had summons to parliament and appends his seal to the act recognizing his majestys title to the crown and in settling the succession upon all the kings children lawfully begotten either by elisabeth mure his first wife or euphame ross then his queen acts of parliament still extan in the records where he is mentioned in both  what is further remarkable of this sir david is that according to the devotion of that age when donatives to the church could sanctify and merit for any person he gave in pure and perpetual alms to the cathedral church of glasgow an annuity of ten merks sterling out of the barony of kinneil for the support of a qualified person to celebrate divine service at the altar of the blessed virgin mary in the said church pro salute animae roberti quondam regis scotiae nec no pr

countess dowager of douglass by whom he had a son and two daughters  sir john hamilton of shawfield in vic de lanark  mary married to william earl marishal  elisabeth to david earl of crawfurd afterward duke of montrose  nota here it will i apprehend be neither improper nor ungrateful to my reader to offer some considerations to obviate that assrtion of george buchanan and other historians who have copied and translated from him who insinuate that the lady mary the kings sister was forced by her brother to marry james lord hamilton when thomas boyd earl of arran her husband was alive and this is generally believed by every body who reads george buchanans history and enquire no more about it but depend on our affairs as wrote by him who indeed to do him justice was a very learned and polite person and has wrote the history of scotland not much inferior in style to the best roman authors i shall here offer what i have observed in relation to this affair all histories commend the lady marys affection to her husband and tell us that she could not be prevailed with to forsake or desert him when he fell into disgrace but transported her self with him into foreign parts to share with him in his misfortunes and sojourned with him in denmark and flanders for some time till she understood from scotland that her presence and solicitation with her brother might prevail with him to suffer my lord arran to return home to his native country and accordingly she came to scotland but the king continuing inexorable and the lady detained from going abroad the poor unfortunate earl of arran soon after died of grief at antwerp she continuing a widow till the      is then i find married to james lord hamilton moreover i am told by mr hamilton of wishaw that the contract of marriage is still preserved among the archives of the family but i have not seen it but there is a charter in my hands dated the   th of july      to james lord hamilton and the lady mary stewart the kings sister of the lands of kinneil etc moreover i think the testimony of mr john ballenden arch dean of murray who was co temporary with the lady whom we find alive in the      and for ought i know lived much longer ought to be regarded he at the command of king james v translated hector boethius history of scotland into english printed in the year      under this title the history and cronicles of scotland completed and newly corrected and amended by the reverend and noble clerk mr hector boeis canon of aberdeen translated by mr john ballenden archdean of murray and canon of ross and there he says book    cap   the first daughter of king james ii was married to the lord boyd of whom was begotten a son whilk was slain by the lord montgomery and a daughter married to the earl of cassils and after the death of the lord boyd this daughter of king james ii was married on the lord hamilton and that way the house of hamilton is decorit in the kings blood i say i think the authority of this learned and ingenuous author should determine any man of judgment more than a posterior partywriter such as every one knows george buchanan was with all deference to his character otherways for every body may perceive who reads his book that he takes all opportunities to blacken and misrepresent this nobe family sometimes with very great inconsistency with himself as a judicious historian and if this be not sufficient to disprove this part of buchanans history take also the testimony of a very ingenious foreign historian ralph holinshed who wrote a history of scotland wherein he says that after the death of the lord boyd the daughter of king james ii was married to the lord hamilton but how far will not an author depart from truth who is the devoted servant of any party as buchanan was who wrote the latter part of his history to serve a particular turn well enough known james lord hamilton was succeeded by james his son who was constituted one of the lords of the privy council anno    0 in which station he continued till from some mistake he entered into that memorable league with the earls of douglass ross crawfurd murray and ormond wherein they solemnly swore never to desert one another during their lives that injuries done to any one of them should be considered as done to them all that they should concur against whatsoever persons within or without the realm and spend their lives goods and fortunes in defense of each other but when sir james hamilton discerned their violent purposes against the king he severed himself from them and returned to his duty whereupon ensued the ruin of the earl of douglass who persisted in his rebellion in the reign of king james iii he was no less considered and valued than he had been by the former king for in the      when a treaty of peace was set on foot with the english he was one of those noble persons who met the lord howard and other commissioners on the part of the king of england and treated of a league and amity betwixt the two nations thereafter on the  th of march      he was with william bishop of aberdeen david earl of crawfurd john lord darnly and archibald whitelaw secretary of state by a commission under the great seal appointed to treat with the ambassadors of england upon a lasting peace betwixt the two realms his excellent qualities and heroic virtues gained so much upon his sovereign king james iii that he was pleased to bestow upon him his sister the lady mary countess of arran in marriage the greatest honor any subject was capable of with this most virtuous lady he lived in all conjugal affection till the  th of november      he departed this life obituary of glasgow in the chartulary of that metropolitan see in the hands of alexander baillie of castlecarrie a gentleman well known in the antiquities of his country and who has been at great pains to make considerable collections very useful for illustrating the history of the kingdom  leaving issue james his successor and a daughter elisabeth married to matthew earl of lennox grandmother by him of henry lord darnly duke of albany father of king james vi first monarch of great britain  which james being a nobleman endowed with all the great qualities suitable to his high birth began early to distinguish himself in the public service in the reign of king james iv for when he was very young his majesty called him to his privy council and in the   0  sent him to england to conclude his marriage with margaret eldest daughter to henry vii soon after which the said king being sensible of his great merit and eminent services was pleased to give him the earldom and create him earl of arran on the  0th of august   0  where the remarkable expressions used by his majesty as the just motives of bestowing the honor are sufficient to illustrate those of his posterity and are thus set forth in the preamble of his patent  sciatis nos propter propinquitatem sanguinis inter nos and dilectum consanguineum nostrum jacobum dominum hamilton and pro suo gratuito servitio nobis impenso and impendendo ac pro suis magnis laboribus and expensis factis and sustentatis pro nostro and regni nostri honor tempore

tempore praedicto mature avisatos and ex nostra expressa scientia ac proprio motu dedisse concssisse and hac presenti charta nostra confirmasse eidem jacobo domino hamilton totum and integrum comitatum de arran jacen in vicecomitatu e bute etc charter of erection of the earldom of arran in favors of james lord hamilton in the public register of charters this may likeways serve to correct the mistake of those historians who say that when james lord hamilton married the sister of king james iii that he got with her the earldom of arran which marriage i have made evident was in the      and yet this grant of the earldom of arran was not to him nor his son for twenty nine years after the marriage of his father and mother from this we may remark how george buchanan and other historians who copy from him are to be relied on who take materials and vouchers of their histories from other authors who have wrote before them and never looked into the national records where proper materials for a historian are to be found for i cannot imagine that mr buchanan ever gave himself the trouble to turn over one roll in the public archives of the kingdom otherwise he could not but have discovered the error of robert iiis illegitmacy and many other things relating both to the royal family as well as to this noble family i now write of for since the time of king robert the bruce the records are pretty full so that if diligently perused would have rectified many very gross errors all our old historians have fallen into whom buchanan as to the history has followed exactly for he only turned their books into that ornate latin style we now read his history of scotland in for i cannot imagine buchanan saw the records otherwise he could not have been so wicked or so perverse an historian as to have concealed matters of fact so evident there and of such importance to the royal family except ye suppose as indeed many do that he was well pleased to find that any before him had wrote of the illegitimacy of king robert iii and thereby to make it a precedent for the succession of another bastard to the crown who was his patron in prejudice of the lawful heirs and james duke of chatlerault being then the presumptive heir of the crown failling of queen mary and her young son king james vi i believe mr buchanan had a particular view to that in his malicious and false aspersions against that most noble and worthy lord and his family both in his history and in another scurrilous pasquil he wrote entitled an admonition to the true lords and which is the most false and most scandalous writing that ever flowed from the pen of any man of the least worth which shall be answered elsewhere to the conviction of any who will allow themselves to believe truth all clearly made out from original writings accidentally come into my hands   his lordship being now higher in dignity the year following had the command of the forces sent from scotland to the assistance of christian ii of denmark which service he happily performed with conduct diligence and fidelity having gone thus successfully through this affair his royal master again entrusted him with the command of the four thousand men sent into france to the assistance of lewis xii where he acquired immortal honor and when that service was over he returned home richly rewarded by that prince besides a pension during life while he stayed in france the death of king james iv happned in the unfortunate battle of flowdon then he returned home to settle the disturbed state of his native country which ordinarily falls out in all minorities and stood fair to have been elected regent to the young king many says my author gave their voices for him as being nearest in blood to the king and a man affecting peace more than others and every way sufficient for such a charge but he generously and justly yielded his pretensions to his cousingerman john duke of albany who was as near to the king in the male as his lordship was in the female line upon the dukes promotion to the supreme government his lordship was named captain of the castle of edinburgh drummonds history  provost of that city and not long after warden of the marches toward england also in the      this earl was appointed one of the six guardians of the realm who were to rule by turns when john duke of albany went to france to renew the ancient league which had been kept inviolable for many centuries past betwixt the two realms there being nothing more to be found in history concerning this great earl we shall draw toward the close of his life and observe his marriages and issue  his first wife was beatrix daughter of john lord drummond charta in rotulis jacobi iv  by whom he had only one daughter margaret married to andrew stewart lord evandale and ochiltree my lord strathallans historical account of the family of perth penes jo drummond md  and after her death elisabeth sister to alexander lord hume lord high chamberlane of scotland but being divorced from her this is fully made evident from the process of divorce at the instance of the said james earl of arran as it was led and deduced before mr patrick coventree and other judges delegate for that effect in the      and is still preserved in the charter chest of the family whereby it appears she had been formerly married to sir thomas hay who then was alive and so could not be married to any other man this by the by is sufficient to correct the mistake of the author of a history of the church of scotland called knoxs history who makes james duke of chatlerault born in unlawful wedlock in regard elisabeth hume his fathers first wife was alive but that author had not access to see or know of this divorce otherwise i have more charity for him than to think he would have transmitted a falsehood to posterity  he was again enabled to marry so he next took to wife janet daughter of sir david beaton of crich in vic de fife comptroller in the reign of king james iv widow of sir robert livingston of easterweems by whom he had  james earl of arran  helen married to archibald earl of argyle  jane to alexander earl of glencairn  this earl giving way to fate in the    0 was succeeded by  james his son a person of singular prudence and integrity as will appear in the whole conduct of his life in the      when he was but a very young man he was one of the lords who attended king james v by his special appointment in his voyage to france when he espoused magdalen daughter to francis i drummonds history of king james v  afterward in      when the foresaid king had a prince born to him by mary of lorrain his next queen he had the honor to stand godfather to him ibidem  his lordship was very forward in offering the king his service toward the suppressing the incursions of the english under the command of sir thomas wharton and had the command of that body which was sent to desend the eastborder where he soon heard the mortifying news of the loss of the army at solway which was not long after attended with the death of that monarch who yielded his last breath on the    of december      then my lord arran was by the unanimous consent of parliament chosen protector to the young queen mary and governor of scotland which was ratified by an act of the three estates in which the lords spiritual and temporal and commissioners of burghs declare james earl of arran lord hamilton second person of the realm and nearest to succeed to the crown of the same failling of our sovereign lady and the bairns lawfully to be begotten of her and none others and by reason thereof tutor lawful to the queens grace and governor of the realm and he to use the said office in all things until the perfect age of our said sovereign lady and all the leiges of this realm to answer and obey the said earl as tutor lawful to her grace and governor foresaid in all things concerning the said office conform to the act made hereupon the original of this act is in the custody of the family of hamilton bearing date   th of march      to which all the seals of the noblemen prelates and buroughs are appended which i have seen and from which i took this note   as soon as the earl was in possession of the government he sent the earl of glencairn sir george douglass william hamilton of sanquhar james learmont of balcomy and mr henry balnaves of hallhill secretary of state unto england in order to treat both about a peace which was become necessary by reason of the kings death and other concurring circumstances and a match betwixt the infant queen and edward prince of england accordingly a peace or at least an abstinence as it was then termed and a marriage betwixt the queen and prince edward were agreed to and ratified by a great majority in the parliament which met at edinburgh in august       i need not mention in this place how this advantageous union was spoiled by the then clergy and the french faction it being so fully treated on by bishop lesly and mr buchanan only i shall add what neither of them have taken much notice of that the earls of huntly argyle montrose bothwel monteith lord fleeming and a great many more of all ranks entered into a most solemn bond and notwithstanding of the act of parliament bound and obliged themselves to oppose the intended match with england and consequential union with all their power though with the hazard of their fortunes and lives at the same time they endeavored all they could to bring the governor into a compliance with the breach of the treaty and the more effectually to win him over to them they proposed to secure the crown to his posterity by bestowing the infant queen upon the lord hamilton his eldest son but so invincibly was he attached to what he thought the interest of his country and his own reputation and honor in the observation of a treaty he himself had caused to be ratified in parliament that he kept it inviolated on his part till king henry viii not only refused to ratify it on the other part but also caused his officers to seize upon a great many scots ships that had sailed to england laden with french and scots commodities upon the faith of the treaty of peace before concluded this undeniable breach of the articles condescended on the governor resented to that degree that he called a parliament in december      and in it declared the treaty to be void and null in regard the english had broke it first then he applied himself with the utmost diligence to carry on a war and immediately raised what forces he could to oppose the english army that had invaded scotland under the command of the lord evers whom he encountered at ancrum in teviotdale and though they were  000 to not above  00 put them to the rout with considerable loss on their side and scarce a man on his lordships not long after this he was joined by monsieur de lerges count of montgomery with   00 french auxiliaries and marched toward england in search of the earl of hartford who to retrieve the former loss had entered scotland and had already laid waste a great part of the merse and teviotdale but retired upon the approach of the scots army the governor in his turn invaded england beat the enemy where ever he found them ravaged the country and returned with the glory of having defeated one army and given the chase to another in one campaign neither am i to forget that at this time king francis i sent him the ensigns of the most noble order of st michael to proceed in the      when the duke of somerset was made protector of england and tutor to edward vi upon the demise of henry viii in prosecution of the war he invaded scotland upon the head of a mighty army seconded by a fleet by sea his grace hastening to raise all the force he could to oppose him so advancing toward pinkiecleugh where the enemy were encamped the english obtained the victory on the  0th of september      and left eight thousand scots killed on the field after which they ravaged the country five miles round sacked leith and made an attempt upon edinburgh but by the activity of the governor they were repulsed with loss after which his lordship repaired to stirling where he had appointed the nobility to meet him in this assembly he appeared not at all dejected or dispirited but addressed himself in this speech that monsieur de larrey has thought fit to insert in his french history of england translated by an ingenious author from whom i have presumed to borrow it  i doubt not but that many of you my lords and more of the vulgar whose forward preposterous understandings seldom judge of things but by the various events they are liable to may be apt to disapprove a war that has been attended with consequences so fatal to most of us i own that i advised you to undertake it and as then so i am still of opinion that it is one of these evils the glory and liberty of the nation do not allow us to avoid i know not but you may have other sentiments at this time and have therefore called you together to congratulate your magnanimity if you remain unshaken as i am in your resolution to repulse the encroachments made upon us and if you are otherwise disposed as i hope you are not to upbraid your fear the inglorious enemy of reason and courage when i took the command of our armies upon me you unanimously preferred an honorable war to a peace you thought equally unsafe and disgraceful and shall we be so mean as to yield to the first signal injustice of fortune no i am persuaded that as grating as our misfortune at pinky must needs be to you all you will nevertheless choose to pursue a noble revenge rather than sit down with the affront or submit to the threatened slavery come on it what will i am fixed in my first opinion and i had rather preserve the monarchy at any rate i mean though at the expense of such of the subjects fortunes and blood as have been or may yet chance to be wasted than to spare the estates and lives of private men though ever so great or deserving with the loss of our common country let us labor by all means to save the ship that saves all and to effect this let us not grudge to cut down the mast nor to see our own shares of the loading thrown over board if the foundation of an edifice stands firm it is no great matter what comes of the ceiling or furniture our private losses are so many sacrifices that are due to the public they weaken the state i own it but the ruin of the state it self must needs involve us all in universal irretrivable miseries consider my lords with what an enemy we have to do and on what terms we may purchase a peace our enemy is he not the same old inveterate one whose avarice has by unjust wars so often attempted to devour our existence and is not this present war alone sufficient to make us tremble at the very thought of falling under the power of tyrants so unconscionably implacable we cannot descend to the terms they propose without stooping under the imperious yoke of a people that thirst for our blood and whose insolence is whetted with fury cast your eyes on the other hand on your ancient unalterable allies the french they never yet failed us in our greatest exigencies and will not in the present juncture of our affairs neither do we want friends in italy nay there are few potentates in europe that will unconcernedly look on and behold our destruction resolve in fine whether we had best defend our liberties or give them up whether it is most expedient to die if it must be so free and independent or to live eternal slaves to our greatest foes it is true they offer us fair things our laws and rights are by the treaty to remain untouched but pray who is guarrantee for this and if the english shall in an aftergame either break or encroach upon the articles agreed to who will redress our grievances to what tribunal shall we appeal it is a jest to offer to set up either for liberty or property when in effect we shall have given them away we must begin by surrendering our mistress to a husband that is to a master which done i dont see why he may not as such subject her crown to his own or rather unite and confound them in one and thus scotland must inevitably become a county or province of england it is impossible to reflect on the ambitious project without horror and detestation and how can we choose but to have the meanest sentiments of and greatest contempt imaginable for such of our countrymen as shall show themselves villains enough to comply the uncertain events and length of the war may perhaps intimidate some of us but is it the first time that scotland has seen herself exposed to dangers of this kind when reduced to the like extremities did ever our ancestors hesitate to prefer their honor to life and are we so far degenerated as to render our selves their offspring unworthy of the inesteemable treasure they purchased with so much valor and transmitted to us with so much glory had the malign influence of our birth involved us in slavery how far we had been obliged to endeavor the recovery of that freedom we had never enjoyed i shall not determine but since we were born free it is plain that our posterity can never pardon our cowardice if we become willing to resign the independency our own birth and forefathers courage have entitled us to i but a part of our estates and honors were invaded we might plead some pretense or excuse for dispensing with it but the body of the nation is attacked our country nothing less than our country is at stake its ancient laws and fundamental constitution are on the point of being subverted i cannot disown but that it is hard to tell what success it shall please the almighty to give to our arms it is certain however that as we must bear with patience those maladies the infirmity of nature has made us liable to so we are obliged to suffer with constancy such further losses as the enemys good fortune may procure us it is not only in these our days that the scots nation equal to the romans in this point have stood firm in the midst of dangers or that they have conquered their hard fate by the steddiness of their courage let us for no reason affront the memory of those heroes that gave us a being and far from following the example of those in the march and teviotdale let us rather detest the infamy of their defection the more vigor we shall express by our unanimity in this meeting so much the more may we expect the assistance of our friends beyond seas nay fortune her self seems to take pleasure in raising that virtue she has in vain attempted to depress one thing at least we are sure of the boldness of our resolutions cannot fail of conveying the praises we shall deserve down to the old age of time whereas our cowardice if expressed on this occasion would render us infamous and unhappy at once  this speech so lively and so admirably well adapted to the humor of the nation at that time had its desired effect the nobility applauded his design they talked of nothing but of means to prosecute the war and whatever the event might be they resolved to hazard all rather than submit to the english so it was agreed to have recourse to the king of france who they thought alone able to retrieve their losses and to transact with him about marrying the queen when fit for a husband to francis the first his son the daulphine then the said king was pleased to create his lordship duke of chattlerault in that kingdom and to assign him for the better support of the honor a revenue of  0000 livres a year to him his heirs and assigneys for ever after which his grace continued governor of scotland for six years till the      he resigned that great post in full parliament to the queens mother he was again declared to be the presumptive heir of the crown failing queen mary and the issue of her body and this at a time when he had divested himself of all authority delivered up the regalia and consequently was not in a condition to influence the members nor bias the judgment of the nation after which his grace lived much at home in a state suitable to his quality employing himself in the service of his country upon all occasions with untainted honor  when queen mary returned home from france anno      her majesty was pleased prudently to make choice of a new privy council all or most of whom were protestants the better to conform her self to the present posture of affairs and confiding much in the duke of chattlerault he was chose one of that number wherein he worthily served her majesty in settling the kingdom then in no small ferment always showing a great steddyness to the interest of his country and the protestant religion the queen having found the benefit of his faithful services at home was pleased in      letter under the privy seal to send him over to france to take care of her interest there where he did all the service he could that was consistent with his honor and the protestant cause here he continued till the queen was forced to make the resignation of the government in favors of her son the prince then the duke of chattlerault was called home to be the head of the loyalists history of scotland ad annum       so soon as he came to scotland his grace used his utmost endeavors to have had the earl of murray then regent degraded from his usurped authority the queen reponed to the exercise of her royal power and the peace of the country restored and for that end by virtue of a commission from her majesty he gathered together what forces he could raise in so short a time but seeing no manner of hopes of assistance from england and knowing that a civil war was just breaking out in france he resolved to make no other use of his arms than to obtain to himself and his friends honorable conditions of peace and the benefit of living quietly at home till indulgent providence should afford him an opportunity of serving his queen and his country for which end the bishop of st andrews his brother was sent to the regent to procure a safe meeting in order to bring their differences to an accommodation and the time and place being agreed to after many disputes on both sides the following articles were drawn up and mutually signed which i shall set down in the primitive style  it is desired for the part of my lord regent that my lord duke and his adherents shall recognosce the king and his authority and acknowledge themselves to be his subjects and promise unto him service obedience and fidelity in all time coming as their sovereign  it is required on the part of the dukes grace and his adherents that every nobleman be admitted to have his place in council as their predecessors have been in all time of other princes of this realm and my lord regent bearing the kings authority shall be sworn solemnly from that time forward to behave himself uprightly and indifferently to them as the remanent noblemen of this realm in all their honest and just causes without particularity or remembrance of any offense conceived amongst them during the time of their contraversies   item that all these who shall be content in time coming to behave themselves as faithful subjects to the king and acknowledge their obedience to him shall be restored to their lands bounds heritages and possessions notwithstanding the doom of forefaulture led against them providing always that this benefit shall not extend to them that has been forfaulted for art and part of the slaughter of umquhile the kings father   item that my lord regent and remanent noblemen joined with himself shall condescend to sick heads and articles as may redound o the queens honor advancement and commodit and may best serve her turn providing that the same be not prejudicial to the king nor his sovereignty whereupon depends the security of all noblemen and others professing themselves to be his subjects  and because my lord regent and others on his part are as well content to yield to their reasonable desirs foresaid as to crave the performance of his desire toward the kings obedience at their hands and wlleth that all come together at a time because now public leisure cannot serve to complete these things that are necessary to be done to the queen it is thought convenient that on tenth day of april next to come shall be assembled and conveened together at edinburgh in quiet and peaceable manner their persons following they are to say my lord regent my lord duke the earls of huntly argyle athol mortone mar glencairn and my lord herries  and in case of absence of any of their nine persons be sickness or other lawful impediment ane other nobleman of that party shall be chosen to supply his place and there in friendly manner to treat conclude and agree upon sick heads as shall be performed to the queen and what the said persons shall find redound to her honor without prejudice to the king the hail noblemen on both sides shall condescend thereto and for the security of the coming of the nobility foresaid my lord regent promises on his honor that they shall be skaithless and without danger in their coming remaining and returning   item it is agreed that my lord duke chattlerault nor his adherents shall not challenge use nor execute no authority of lieutenandry be any commission of the queen or that any impediment be made be them against the kings authority in the mean time and ordains forces of fensible men on all sides to be dissolved that no injury be done to any subject be way of deed  the regent promises to perform upon his honor so far as concerns his part and therefore wills the dukes grace the earl of cassilis and my lord herries to enter sufficient pledges presently for performance of their parts to wit for the duke one of my lord dukes sons for the earl of cassilis the said earls brother and for my lord herries the said lords eldest son    according to articles most of the persons concerned met at edinburgh on the  0th of april      to treat at large of a through agreement and especially of such points as related to the banished queen being all in one room the regent first rose and drawing out a paper asked the duke if he would instantly subscribe an acknowledgment of the young kings authority or not to which he modestly replied that he and his friends had laid down their arms conditionally nor could he think himself or them obliged to subscribe their allegiance to the king unless according to these conditions the regent at the same time should grant what might be reasonably demanded in behalf of the distressed queen and therefore hoped he would not proceed to acts of force and fraud too since not only he and his friends but their hostages likewise were in his hands desiring him to remember that they had religiously observed every article of the late treaty and had come secure and unarmed as to a friend faithfully relying on his honor and those assurances of safety he had given them in the most solemn manner under his own hand to this easy remonstrance of the duks murray made no manner of return says my author drumsoys memoirs but against all the laws of honor sent him to the castle of edinburgh melvils memoirs  where he was kept close prisoner till the regent was murdered by james hamilton of bothwellhaugh on the    of january    0 then he had his liberation after having purged himself by oath from all manner of suspicion in that affair  what a loyal and honest part my lord duke of chattlerault acted for the interest of his sovereign queen mary in the time of her greatest distress is so well known and was so frequently owned and acknowledged by her majesty that i dont think it necessary to be further insisted on here queen mary always called the duke of chattlerault father  and that his loyalty was not easy to him is evident from the manifold sufferings and hardships he underwent during the continuance of the civil war for as soon as the earl of lennox was elected regent he burnt down the castle and town of hamiltoun and that these honest patriots might be heartily humbled not so much as the cornfieldsd and trees belonging to a hamiltoun were spared the duke himself with his two sons and most of the gentlemen of the name of hamilton were all forfaulted for their rebellion against the young king notwithstanding he resolutely persisted in the queens service and had a large share in the misfortunes of that unfortunate queen but being aged for the better security of his person from the violence of his enemies he retired into france where he stayed some time during the rage of the war which had reduced his country to the last extremity and returning home he gave way to fate on the    of january      as for his character notwithstanding the envy of some and the malice of others it shone very bright in that great and difficult trust of governor of scotland which he held in the most difficult times so he discharged it for twelve years with no less prudence and dexterity than honor and reputation a praise which few of his enemies ever denied him in any time for in his court says a reverend historian archbishop spottiswoods history of the church of scotland  there was nothing to be seen the severest eye could censure in the public administration such a moderation was kept as no man was heard to complain and continues my author he was a nobleman well inclined plain and without all dissimulation and fraud that by the goodness of god who always favors the upright he was carried through many difficulties and died in peace and honor well advanced in age  this noble duke married margaret eldest daughter of james douglas earl of morton by whom he had issue  james earl of arran his eldest son a gentleman of the highest expectations who gave early proofs of inheriting all the virtues of his ancestors to an eminent degree but he became defective in his understanding and thereupon retired from the world dying without succession anno   0   lord john thereafter marquess of hamilton  lord claud progenitor to the earl of abercorn  lord david who dyed a young man  lady margaret married to alexander lord gordon son and heir of george earl of huntly sans issue and after his death to james lord fleming ancestor to the earl of wigton  lady anne to george earl of huntly lord high chancellor of scotland progenitor to the present duke of gordon  lady jean married to hugh   d earl of eglingtoun but had no succession  his successor in the honor was james earl of arran his eldest son but he being non compos mentis john his next brother represented the family this noble lord was born in the      and had by the bounty of king james v the commendatory of arbroath abbey one of the richest benefices in scotland bestowed on him anno      charta in bibliotheca juridica ms a gulielmo wilson clerico sessionis deputato facultati juridicae donata codemque in regni hujus antiquitatibus haud parum versato  by which title he was designed for some time after we hear not much of his conduct till the breaking out of the civil war in queen marys time anno      that he most faithfully adhered to her majestys interest and upon her imprisonment in the castle of lochlevin his lordship with several others entered into an association wherein they promise to use their utmost endeavors by all reasonable means to procure her majestys freedom and liberty upon such honest conditions as may stand with her majestys honor the commonweal of the whole realm and security of the whole nobility who at present have her majesty in keeping whereby this our native ream may be governed ruled and guided by her majesty and her nobility for the common quietness the administration o justice and weal o the country and in case the noblemen who have at present her majesty in their hands refuse to set her at liberty upon such reasonable conditions as said is in that case we shall employ our selves our kindred friends servants and partakers our bodies and lives to set her highness at liberty as said is and also to concur to the punishment of the murder of the king her majestys husband and for sure preservation of the person of the prince as we shall answer to god and on our own honors and credit and to that effect shall concur every one with other at our utmost power and if any shall set upon us or any of us for the doing as aforesaid in that case we promise faithfully to espouse one anothers interest under pain of perjury and infamy as we shall answer to god  my lord hamiltons most loyal and firm adherence to the crown was very dear to him for the contrary faction who were masters of the young king prosecuted him and his family with the utmost severity for no other reason but because they owned queen marys authority and therefore in one of their parliaments held in october      both he and his brother lord claud were forfaulted my lord john to avoid the storm that threatened him fled on foot in a seamans habit into england and from thence made his escape into france where he was kindly entertained by james beaton bishop of glasgow then ambassador at the french court for queen mary here he had great offers made him by the house of guise if he would change his religion and embrace popery but such was the goodness of god toward him that he perseverd in his religion which though it lost him the favor of the french court it preserved him the peace of his conscience which he ever afterward reckoned one of the most signal favors of heaven toward him notwithstanding the hard usage his lordship met with he continued true and faithful to the queen to the last of which her majesty was so sensible that when that severe and unparalleled sentence of death was passed on her in england she took a ring off her finger and gave it to one of her servants and ordered him to carry it to her cousin lord john hamilton and tell him that that was all she had to witness her great sense of his families constant fidelity to her and their sufferings for her interest and desired it might be still kept in the family as a lasting evidence of her kindness to it this ring is still preserved with a due regard in the family to this day and i have seen it in my lady duchess of hamiltons custody   this noble lord in the course of his exile sojourned in diverse foreign parts till some time after king james iv came to manage by his own councils that he returned to scotland and on the first of november      together with several other lords and barons petitioned the king to redress certain grievances of the nation sir james melvils memoirs  representing to him in a humble manner that the hard handling by partial persons about his majesty had compelled them upon plain necessity and for their last refuge to take the boldness to come into his presence in arms for the surety of their lives and lands adding that they were ever humbly minded to serve his majesty and obey him hereafter as became dutiful and loyal subjects to which the king replied that though their enterprise was treasonable yet in respect of their necessity and in hope of their good behavior in time coming he would remit the crime and further directing himself to my lord hamilton he said my lord i did never see you before and must confess that of all this company you have been the most wronged you were a faithful servant to the queen my mother in my minority and when i understood not as i do now the state of things hardly used hereupon a parliament was called wherein the act of forfaulture of the hamiltons was repealed and the family again restored to all the titles of honor estate and precedence lost either by the attainder of himself or of james earl of arran his brother and the same year his lordship was sworn of the privy council and constituted captain of his majestys castle of dumbartoun the king placing great confidence in the fidelity of this lord was pleased in the      writes of the privy seal in the public records to give him a commission under his privy seal to be ambassador extraordinary to accomplish the marriage betwixt his majesty and the princess anne of denmark and this with full consent of his privy council but his lordship declining that honor by reason of his age and the king himself going in person to denmark his majesty named my lord hamilton lieutenant of the south of scotland which great trust he discharged fully to his majestys satisfaction and the expectations he had conceived of him the royal favor toward his lordship did not stop here but the king in memory of his long and faithful services was pleased to raise him to the degree and dignity of marquess of hamilton with great ceremony on the    of april      sir george mackenzies herauldry  continuing ever afterward without any the least interruption in great esteem with that prince who gave him frequent visits at his palace of hamilton and treated him with the same respect the queen his mother had done the duke of chattlerault and called him always father to conclude this noble person died in the highest favor with prince and people the   th of april   0  chart in cancellaria s d n r  and was interred among his ancestors in the collegiate church of hamilton leaving a son and a daughter behind him by margaret his wife daughter of john lord glamis ancestor to the earl of strath more james his successor and margaret married to john lord max well ancestor to the present earl of nithsdale  john marquess of hamilton was succeeded by james his son who was born in the      after his accession to the honor he was appointed one of the lords of his majestys privy council and afterward preferred to be one of the gentlemen of the bed chamber and that he might the better support his character his majesty was pleased to dissolve from the crown the abbey lands with the patronages and tithes of the monastery of arbroath in forfarshire and to eect them into a temporal lord ship in favor of my lord marquess and that especially in consideration of his fathers faithfulness and sufferings for queen mary by his royal charter bearing date the  th of may   0  charta in rotulis jacobi vi ad annum   0    besides this vast augmentation of his fortune in lands he likewise bore several great offices in that princes reign as lord high steward of his majestys household and lord high commissioner to the parliament which began on the    of july      mr calderwoods history of the church of scotland  wherein the five articles of perth assembly were ratified and after having surmounted all the difficulties that occurred in that ticklish juncture he put a period to that session on the   th day of august ensuing his lordship highly meriting for his services to the crown his majesty was pleased in recompense thereof on the    of june      to creat him a peer of england by the honor of earl of cambridge a title that had only been born by very illustrious persons all of the royal family of england and as a further instance of his royal favor to admit his lordship into the most noble order of the garter and accordingly he was installed at windsor  th of july      from henceforth living in the highest favor with his prince whose affection and esteem he had a greater power over than any man of that time says one the duke of buckinghame only excepted he departed this life at london in the prime of his age   d of march      aged    years to the great grief of the king who prophetically apprehended that as the branches were now cut down the root would quickly follow for the duke of lennox died the    of february preceding and his majestys death happened on the   th of march ensuing  he married anne daughter of james earl of glencairn by whom he had issue three sons and three daughters  james duke of hamilton  william duke of hamiltoun  lord john hamilton died young  lady anne married to hugh earl of eglingtoun and had issue  lady margaret to john earl of crawfurd and had issue  lady mary to james earl of queensberry but had no issue  james marquess of hamilton his son was born on the   th of june   0  he had his education in scotland till the   th year of his age he was sent for to court and married to the lady mary feilding daughter of william earl of denbigh by susanna sister to george duke of buckinghame after which he went to the university of oxford where he continued during the time it was judged necessary his lordship should follow his studies there  the next qualification for a young nobleman was to accomplish himself with traveling into foreign countries which he did into france spain and several other parts beyond sea dr james baillie of carnbrew accompanying him as his governor who faithfully discharged the trust reposed in him  upon king charless coming to the crown he was sworn of his majestys most honorable privy council in both kingdoms and that he might have a nearer relation to the court was constituted gentleman of the bedchamber and on the   th of june      preferred to be master of the horse then void by the death of the duke of buckingham dr burnets memoirs of the dukes of hamilton  neither are we to forget that his majesty was pleased to honor his lordship with the dignity of the most noble order of the garter anno    0 at the baptism of k charles ii where my lord marquess had the honor to represent the king of bohemia as one of the godfathers at the font  in the      his majesty taking into his consideration the state of the king of bohemia his brotherinlaw was pleased from the entire confidence he had in the marquess to allow him to treat with gustavus adolphus king of sweden for raising an army of six thousand men to join that monarch in his expedition into germany to be employed against the imperialists for the recovery of the palatinate dr burnet makes out this fully  and it is more remarkable that this lord should be entrusted with so great a command because he was but then twenty three years of age but that enterprise ending without so much advantage as was expected from such an army to the protestant cause neither his absence nor want of thorough success in his negotiation diminished in the least his masters esteem of him for upon his return to court he was received with all the respect that could be given a subject  upon the first insurrection in scotland anno      occasioned by the pressing of the liturgy he was sent down as his majestys high commissioner to the general assembly of the church with instructions to compose and appease the disorders of the nation then in a great ferment but in that judicature my lord marquess not being able to carry what the king designed he according to order dissolved the meeting and inhibited them to sit any longer under pain of rebellion which was all his lordship could do next year he was entrusted with the command of the fleet sent down to reduce the covenanters to their duty to the king his majesty himself being on the head of six thousand landforces advanced as far as berwick but by the marquesss mediation and good offices with the king a treaty was set on foot and a pacification ensued  on the breaking out of the civil war in england anno      he was one of the peers who signed a solemn declaration that his majesty abhorred all designs of making war upon his parliament and that all his endeavors tended to the firm and constant settlement of the true protestant religion the privileges of parliament and the laws the peace and prosperity of the subject the earl of clarendons history of the rebellion  and at the same time he offered to the king to go into scotland undertaking that he would at least keep that people from doing any thing that might seem to countenance the carriage of the english parliament but to be only spectators of what was done in england without engaging themselves in the quarrel and would endeavor if possible to oppose the calling of a parliament in scotland which the king had absolutely refused to do till the time came agreed on at his majestys last being there the earl of clarendons history of the rebellion and civil war  but as soon as he came down to scotland he quickly discerning the strength of the covenanters gave way to it that there should be a meeting of the estates reasonably enough concluding that the absolutely refusing to suffer a parliament to be called would not quiet the debates nor secure the king but more inflame those who desired it and who would take some other time when many of them who opposed it should be absent to propose it and so would carry it and that therefore they were better be absent at first whereby the other party might without opposition send out their summons for a parliament to assemble at the day they should think fit and that as they who would serve the king would not be there so they should prevail with as many others as they could not to be there like wise where by the number which appeared would be so inconsiderable that they would not dare to sit and perfectly disperse and this disappointment would for ever quash that design and render those who advised it odious to the people as men who desired illegally to engage the nation in unjustifiable ways to disturb the public peace but his lordship changing his former opinion concerning their being absent at the time of the meeting or parliament since their mere absence would not be discountenance enough and that they who sat as indeed many would have done would carry the reputation of a parliament and the people would be guided by them and therefore he proposed to the kings friends that they would all resolve to be present and take their places that when the house should be set and any man should stand up to propose the taking any business into consideration he would first make his protestation against proceeding in so unlawful a convention and that they should all make the same protestation and he did hope that the number of the protesters would be great enough to dissolve the meeting and thus they should put the best end to the matter that could be desired but if it should succeed otherways then would be the time to withdraw and put themselves in arms toward which he would make the best preparation he could and desired them to do the like and this last overture the king himself liked best and approved of that they should meet in the convention which they did accordingly at the day appointed then his lordship according to his promise and concert took an opportunity to make a protestation against the legality of the meeting upon which many of the members who had been always most engaged against the king were very warm and demanded that he should declare himself clearly whether he did protest against the parliament but his lordship fearing as he declared the fatal issue of adhereing to his protestation to the kings service he excused himself after the best manner he could though no man had a greater dislike of the high proceedings of that meeting in exceeding the limits of their duty to the king or had a greater affection for his majestys service than my lord marquess had for he opposed all their determinations with all the vigor he thought seasonable concurring only so far with them as was necessary to keep up his credit whereby he might with the more authority advance the kings cause and a peace which he and all good men so passionately desired his majesty that he might testify the esteem he had of my lord marquesss services and of his fidelity to his interest was graciously pleased to promote him to be duke of hamilton on the   th of april      diploma jacobi ducis de hamilton in rotulis car i  how this convention in scotland was consend and overreached by sir henry vane every one knows for he persuaded them that there was nothing intended against the king by the english nation but only that they should interpose for a good peace to them which would be an honor to them and a great obligation to his majesty earl of clarendons history of the rebellion  as for the history of this convention and its subsequent acts and the fatal effects as well as infamy of the scots joining with the english parliament against the king as the consequent of the solemn league and covenant are all particulars so well known and have been so much enlarged on in several treatises particularly wrote to that purpose that the further mentioning of them in this place will be but needless seeing the noble person whose memoirs i write was free from any accession or guilt therein  as soon as the convention was over the duke and his brother the earl of lanerk left scotland to give the king then at oxford an account of all their proceedings but notwithstanding of his graces good intention toward the king his enemies for not a few he had used all the artifies they could to render him suspected to his majesty as if he secretly countenanced at least did not sufficiently abhor the unnatural rebellion of his countrymen and this imputation was with so great art insinuated that it got so much credit with those about the court that the king upon my lord duke and his brothers arrival commanded them to keep their chambers and ordered a guard to attend them ibidem  so after some time his grace was sent in custody to the castle of bristol and from thence to exeter and so to the castle of pendinnis whence he was removed to st michaels mount in cornwall upon the surrender of which to the parliaments forces anno      he obtained his liberty which he employed with much zeal in the kings service to the loss of his life by which he was not only vindicated in the opinion of all men from all those jealousies and aspersions he had lain long under but the proceedings that had been against him at oxford were looked upon by many as void of that justice and policy which had been requisite and they concluded by what he did after a long imprisonment how much he might have done more successfully if he had never been restrained ibidem   as soon as my lord duke was at liberty it was believed that the animosity was so great between him and some others of great name that he would rather meditate a revenge than concur in any action which might advance the kings interest but his grace well considered both his duty to his majesty and his own danger at such a juncture to think of private contention and matters of revenge when the public was so much at stake so that his former treatment made no other impression upon him then to make him show his steadiness more and more to his majestys service who then so much stood in need of the assistance of his faithful subjects  when the king put himself into the scots army before newark in the      my lord duke having obtained his liberty came to wait on his majesty bishop burnets memoirs of james due of hamilton  and was well received by him after they had conversed some time together his majesty was pleased to express the sense he had of his long sufferings and told him in these words that he had ever judged him innocent as to the bulk of things tho he confessed there were some particulars he was not so well satisfied with but that his restraint was extorted from him against his heart for he had stood out against all the importunities of his enemies till the very morning he came to oxford  his lordships next care was to bring his majesty and the committee of estates to a happy peace and accommodation dr burnets memoirs  and as he earnestly endeavored to have them satisfied with the kings concessions so he dealt fervently with his majesty to yield to the abolishing of episcopacy in england as he had in scotland as the only way to induce the presbyterian party to declare for him but the good king could not be be prevailed on to consent to buy his peace as he said at so dear a rate as the peace of his conscience so the treaty at that time had not its desired effect  when it came to be considered in parliament what way his majestys person should be disposed of still in the scots army my lord duke finding that the house by a majority were inclined to deliver him up to the english parliament his grace took an opportunity that he might declare to the world his abhorrence of an action attended with so much infamy and spoke against it to this purpose  would scotland now quit a possession of   00 years date which was their interest in their sovereign and do it to those whose enmity both against him and them did visibly appear was this the effect of all their protestations of duty and affection to his majesty was this their keeping of their covenant wherein they had sworn to defend the kings majestys person and authority was this a suitable return to the kings goodness both in his consenting to all the desires of that kingdom an      and in his late trusting his person to them what censures will be past upon this through the whole world what a stain would it be to the whole reformed religion and in fine what danger might be apprehended both to the kings person and to scotland from the party that was now prevalent in england  but notwithstanding all the opposition the duke and his friends could make against it yet the same was carried upon the   th of january      that the king should be delivered up into such hands as the english parliament had appointed to receive him ibidem  to the great grief of the duke and all true hearted scotsmen and that his grace might again in any degree retrive the dishonor the nation suffered in the giving up that excellent prince he endeavored all he could to infuse a sense of shame and horror in all people for the late action which might prepare them to a reparation of it by a generous engaging in the kings quarrel and in doing so most of the year      was spent even till the meeting of the next parliament which sat down the   d of march      bishop guthries memoirs  at the opening of which my lord duke did all he could to inflame the people with zeal for his majestys relief and against the army of england who he said had forced the parliament there to break the treaty between the two kingdoms in their ill usage of the king who was imprisoned by the army nor was it in the power of the parliament to set him at liberty that they had now upon the matter absolutely deposed him by not suffering him to perform the office of a king not permitting any of his subjects to repair to him in which the kingdom of scotland was concerned in that being independent upon england and the paliament of england they were by them deprived of their king and could not be admitted to speak with him nor his majesty to send to them which was such a presumption and violation of the law of nations and such a perfidious breach and contempt of the solemn league and covenant and of the treaty between the two kingdoms that they were bound by all the obligations human and divine to be sensible of it and to redeem their kings liberty and their own honor with the hazard of their lives and fortunes and all that was dear to them and therefore he desired that they might enter upon those counsels which might soonest get an army together which should no sooner enter england but it would find a conjunction from that whole kingdom except only the army and that it would then quickly appear that the parliament of both kingdoms desired the same thing and to live happily under the government of the same king  this discourse urged by the duke and seconded by many of the principal members was entertained with so general a reception that it was agreed to that an army should be raised for the relief of his majesty whereof his grace was appointed general which being levied with all the diligence imaginable entered england about the  th of july      consisting of twelve thousand foot and five thousand horse and next day had the town of carlyle delivered to them from sir philip musgrave the life of james duke of hamilton  and after some days stay there he marched to kendal and thence to prestoun in lancashire where he was so closly pursued by cromwells horse under lambert that on the  0th of august      his whole army was routed and his grace put to the necessity of rendering himself prioner upon articles of capitulation at exeter in staffordshire to the lord gray of groby the capitulation is set down a length in dr burnets memoirs of the dukes of hamilton and peerage of england  from whence he was carried to ashby where he continued till the beginning of december he was sent prisoner to windsor where he had the society of the earls of norwich and holland and the lord capell common sufferers in the same cause with himself where they were all kept in close restraint till the murder of the king the duke then perceiving his own danger attempted to make an escapec in which he had so well succeeded that he was out of his enemies hands full three days but being impatient to be at a greater distance from them he was apprehended as he was taking horse in southwark and carried prisoner to the tower from whence he was on the  th of february      brought before that monstrous high court of justice whose hands were still reeking in the blood of their sovereign mr steel and mr cook council for the parliament life of james duke of hamilton  exhibited a charge of high treason against him that he the earl of cambridge had traitorously invaded the nation in a hostile manner and levied war to assist the king against the kingdom and people of england etc in his defense he used all the lawful means in the world and insisted upon the right and privilege of the kingdom of scotland that it had not the least dependence upon the kingdom of england but was entirely governed by its own laws that he being a subject of that kingdom was bound to obey the commands thereof and the parliament of that kingdom having thought it necessary to raise an army for the relief of their king and constituted him general of that army it was not lawful for him to refuse the command thereof and whatever misfortune he had undergone with it he could not be understood to be liable to any punishment but what a prisoner of war was bound to undergo he was told that the rights and laws of the kingdom of scotland were not called in question nor could be violated by their proceedings against him who was a subject of england against which he was charged with rebellion and treason that they did not proceed against him as duke hamilton of scotland but as earl of cambridge of england and they would judge him as such  his council mr hales mr chute and mr parsons defended him with great learning and judgment as may be seen in bishop burnets memoirs of his life at large but all arguments in his favor signified nothing he was born down with the torrent of the times and together with the earls of holland and norwich the lord capel and sir john oven had sentence of death pronounced against them to los their heads to conclude the fate of this great person he was on the  th day of march      brought to westminster the place appointed for his execution and ascending the scaffold with a composed and undaunted courage he spoke of his devotion to the church of scotland and the protestant religion established by law and professed in that church of his loyalty to the king whose restoration and prosperity he heartily prayed for and affection to the welfare and happiness of the kingdom as matters unquestionable after which with a mavelous tranquillity of mind he delivered his head to the block which severed it from his body at one blow which together with the body was convoyed by sea into scotland and buried in the church of hamilton according to his own order  his grace by mary his wife aforesaid daughter of william earl of denbigh besides three sons and a daughter who died in their childhood he had two daughters who survived him lady anne duchess of hamilton and lady susanna married to john earl of cassils  james duke of hamilton being thus impiously cut off leaving no sons behind him his estate and honor did descend to william earl of lanerk his brother he was born   th december      life of william duke of hamilton  being deprived of his father in the  th year of his age his mother a lady among the most eminent in all virtues redoubled her care of his education in the schools and university at home and then his brother the duke sent him abroad bishop burnets memoirs of the dukes of hamilton to qualify him by travel and otherways for the service of his country continuing beyond sea till his twenty first year ibidem anno      his majesty king charles i conceiving an extraordinary good opinion of him was graciously pleased as a distinguishing mark of his favor by letters patent bearing date the    of march      to honor him with the titles of earl of laerk lord machanshire and polmont diploma gulielmi comitis de lanerk in rotulis car i ad annum       and william earl of stirling secretary for scotland giving way to ate in the beginning of the year    0 lives of the officers of state ms penes me  the king discerning my lord lanerk adorned with all the qualifications he judged necessary for the discharge of that employment was pleased to promote him thereto an office his lordship discharged with eminent sufficiency and the general applause of all men for some years after though it is remarkable he was but aged twenty four years at his promotion  the cruel and bloody civil war hastening on my lord lanerk used his utmost endeavors to allay the unhappy differences which had arisen between his majesty and his subjects of both kingdoms and bent all his thoughts to mediate a peace to the honor and safety of the king and the welare and happiness of the kingdom in the convention of estates which met on the    of june      the bishop of duakeids memoir of the civil war  his lordship acted with his usual zeal for the public good but discerning that the royal party in that assembly had not authority or power enough to cross any thing that was done to the prejudice of the king earl of clarendons history and bishop burnets memoirs compared  and that a direct protestation against the convention in that conjuncture of time was to destroy themselves to no purpose his lordship and other loyal peers did give in a declaration and took instruments both in the kings name and their own burnets memoirs  which was all that could be pradently done in that season soon after which my lord lanerk for reasons and from motives that history is altogether silent in and which is not clear enough to this time he put the kings signet with which he was entrusted as secretary to the proclamation for the general rendevouz of all men in the kingdom from such an age to such an age whereby the army was presently formed which afterward joined with the parliament of england against the king the fatal consequences of which are so well known that they need not be told clarendons history  this action was not thought capable of any excuse and was afterward very much represented to his disadvantage and was the first cause of the kings jealousy both of the duke his brother and his lordship and thereby their sincerity and affection to his majestys service came to be very much called in question but the earl of lanerk presuming he had enough to excuse himself of any disloyalty as soon as the convention was over went with his brother the duke to wait on the king at oxford guthries memoirs  being confident that when he should be admitted to speak with his majesty he would give him satisfaction in that affair clarendons history  upon their arrival there both the brothers were put under a confinement but the earl perceiving burnets memoirs that they were not like to obtain a trial for clearing their innocence and discovering the forgeries of their accusers and his lordship fearing a long and cruel imprisonment he made his escape by means of sir james cuningham and presently repaired to london after some stay there returning to scotland he easily found means to make his peace with the estates by taking of the covenant guthries memoirs  whereby he came to have a great influence on their counsels and did not a little contribute to moderate the fury of the leading men of that side to hearken to propositions for peace and accommodation with the king  after this we hear not much of the conduct of the earl till the      when the king came to the scots army at newark he was with other two lords sent commissioner from the committee of estates with an humble offer of their duty to his majesty and of their sincere intentions to serve him and withal to give him assurance that the preservation of his sacred person and his just power and greatness was and should ever be dear to them here my lord lanerk used all the persuasions and all the importunities he could with his majesty to give satisfaction to the desires of his subjects and as a preparation to this that he would send his positive orders to the marquess of montrose to lay down his arms extirpate prelacy out of england as he had done in scotland and to agree to such propositions as should be brought from the two houses in england the first proposal he graciously condescended to to the next he returned this answer that when he was satisfied in his conscience of the lawfulness of what they desired then and never till then would he grant their demands as for the message from the english parliament it was so high that his majesty could not grant  or my lord clarendon says it contained such an eradication of the government of the church and state that the king told them he knew not what answer to make to them till he should be informed what power or authority they had left him and his heirs when he had given all to them which they desired  on that ominous day   th of january      when the great transaction came to be debated in parliament about the disposing of his majestys person who was in the hands of the army whether they should leave him in england to the two houses yea or not thus was the question stated against giving up of the king my lord lanerk argued strenously and spoke against it as the most barefaced violation of their faith and allegiance to deliver up their native prince who had put himself into their hands against his will and consent into the custody of such as would put his sacred person in eminent hazard but to the eternal infamy of the majority of that convention it was carried to deliver up the king whereat his lordship was so perfectly overwhelmed with the horror of so sinful and shameful a deed that he expressed his dissent from it in so passionate a manner that it would be to do him wrong to omit to give it in his own words as god shall have mercy on my soul said he at the great day i would rather choose to have my head struck off at the cross of edinburgh than give my consent to this vote and then adds that this was the blackest day that ever scotland saw bishop burnets memoirs i wish latest posterity may not for ever have cause to remark with equal sorrow and regret the same ominous day threescore years viz sixteenth of january one thousand seven hundred and seven on which the late treaty of union betwixt the two nations was ratified and approven b act of parliament whereby alas scotland is now no more well may scotsmen who think on the transactions of that day say with the poet quis talia fand temperes a lachrimis   as the earl of lanerk had from the very beginning of the war been always disposed to peace so shortly after this by his dexterity and influence a treaty was set on foot betwixt the king and the parliament of scotland his lordship with the earls of lauderdale and loudon being appointed commissioners for that end in pursuance of which laudable design they repaired to his majesty as soon as he was at the isle of wight and undertook to invade england with an army to restore him to his just rights and in order to this they proposed to him many conditions which would be necessary for his majesty to perform toward the nation without whichit ould not be easy to induce them to be so unanimous in an engagement for him as was necessary for such an enterprise they required that the prince of wales should be present with them and march in the head of their army that such a number of scotsmen should be always in the court of the bedchamber and all other places about the persons of the king prince and duke of york that berwick and carlyle should be put into their hands they demanded moreover that as soon as his majesty could with freedom honor and safety be present in a free parliament to confirm the solemn league and covenant by act of parliament clarendons history  providing that none who was unwilling should be constrained to take it they likewise obliged his majesty to confirm presbyterian government in england for three years and after the expiration of that time such a government shall be determined by his majesty and the two houses of parliament as was most agreeable to the word of god that an effectual course shall be taken for the suppressing of all heresies and all principles and practices contrary to the principles of christianity this agreement his majesty was pleased to sign the    of december      the earl of clarendon in his history has the substance of the treaty  and to oblige himself in the word of a king to perform his part of the treaty as the commissioners also engaged themselves upon their honor faith and conscience and all that is dear to honest men to endeavor to the utmost of their power that the kingdom of scotland should engage to perform what was on its part to be performed  any body who reads this treaty in which his majestys concessions are so full could scarcely have thought that any party would not have been perfectly pleased with it and so all would indifferently concur in that dutiful loyal and generous design of relieving the king then made a close prisoner by oliver cromwell and the officers of the army but the rigid clergy and the lords of that side not only declared against the engagement as unlawful and sinful bishop guthries memoirs  and all the persons who advanced and promoted it as deserters of the covenant but also raised what force they could in the western counties to oppose it which at last came to be formed into a kind of an army under the command of the earls of eglintoun lowdoun and some of the leading clergy ibidem  whom for respect to their character as church men i will not name against this illegal insurrection the committee of estates ordered some troops to be levied which the earl of lanerk was chosen to command but his lordship was o sincerely and thoroughly devouted to preserve the peace of his country and to accommodate matters calmly and without blood that he brought the matter to an agreement very much against his mind and to his prejudice yet so violent and perfidious beyond what can be imagined were these times that though my lord lanerk complied with them in their own terms in whatever they demanded yet knowing his lordship to be a throughpaced loyalist and that his principles were quite opposite to their designs they resolved to be rid of him at any rate and therefore without the least pretense of any breach of any article of their treaty they put him under a restraint resolving to send him to their brethren in england who had by this time barbarously murdered the king to be punished as an incendiary that is to have his head cut off wherefore he thought it his most advisable course to get out of the sight of the calamity of his country and to retire beyond sea which he did into holland with an offer of his service to king charles ii and brought with him says the lord clarendon a heart and affection clearer and less clogged with scruples and reservations for the kings service than any other of the nation had when his lordship arrived at the hague he first came to know that he was duke of hamilton by the slaughter of his brother this sad news afflicted him so much that he kept his chamber for some days without so much as waiting on the king who sent a gracious message to him to condole for the loss of his brother and all the lords and other persons of qualility about the king made their visits of condolence to him with all civility his grace stayed in the netherlands till the king and the commissioners from scotland had agreed to the terms on which they would make him their king my lord duke being very instrumental to prevailupon his majesty to submit to the most rigid terms the kirk required of him at the same time in the end of the      his majesty was pleased to acknowledge and recompense the dukes loyalty and merit by bestowing the garter on him as a distinguishing mark of his royal favor he accompanied his majesty to scotland anno    0 but his enemies would not permit him to come to court so having given his majesty the best advice he could with his leave he retired to the isle of arran where he stayed till the parliament met at stirling in      then his grace was suffered to come to court being welcomed by the king and nearest in his confidence so soon as the army was raised for restoring the king my lord duke raised a troop of horse for his majestys service on his own charge with which he marched to the fatal battle of worcester  d of september      charging the enemy very vigorously he received a shot in his leg whereby he fell into the enemies hands and on the    of september died of his wounds and thereby prevented the being made a spectacle as his brother had been which the pride and animosity of his enemies would no doubt have caused to be having the same pretense for it by his being a peer of england as the other was the earl of clarendon having furnished me a character of this noble duke in his history of the civil war i shall presume to insert it in his words he was says that noble lord a man not inferior in wisdom and parts of understanding to the wisest men of the nation of great honor courage and sincerity in his nature and which was a rare virtue in the men of that time was still the same men he pretended to be and in truth was in all respects a very accomplished person of an excellent judgment and clear and ready expression and though he had been driven into several unwarrantable actions he made it very evident he had not been led by any inclination of his own and passionately and heartily run to all opportunities of redeeming it and in the very article of his death he expressed a mavelous cheerfulness that he had the honor to lose his life in the kings service and thereby to wipe out the memory of his former transgressions which he always professed were odius to himself  he married in the      elisabeth daughter and coheir of james maxwell earl of dirletoun by whom he had a son james who died an infant also four daughters  lady anne married to robert third earl of southesk and had issue  lady elisabeth to james lord kilmaurs son to the earl of glencairn and again to sir david cuningham of robertland sans issue  lady mary to alexander earl of callendar after his death to sir james livingstoun of west quarter and last of all to james earl of finlater  lady margaret to william blair of that ilk in vicecomit de air and had issue  upon the decease of william duke of hamilton without issue male of his own body the estate and honor of the family did devolve on his niece the lady anne eldest daughter of james duke of hamilton a lady who for constancy of mind evenness of temper solidity of judgment and an unaffected piety will leave a shining character as well as example to posterity for her conduct as a wife a mother a mistress and in all other conditions of life her grace married william douglass earl of selkirk eldest son of william the first marquess of douglass by mary his second wife daughter of george marquess of huntly who by the marriage articles yielded to change both his surname and the surname of all his children to hamilton whereupon he was by king charles ii raised to the dignity of duke of hamilton for his own lifetime charta in rotulis car ii ad annum    0 by letters patent on the  0th of september    0 but such was the humor of the times and the prevalency of parties that save that his grace was in the council he had no employment in the state during all king charless reign though he had a large share of his majestys esteem which he testified when he chose him into the society of the most noble order of the garter miscellany collections anno       when king james vii came to the throne in the beginning of the      he found more favor with the court than he had done in the former reign for he was not only a lord of council but also of the treasaury and session an extraordinary lord also on the   th of october      he was sworn a privy counselor for england history of england vol iii  in all which offices he continued till his majesty retired into france in the end of the      on the grand revolution of the

disposal of the public revenue and fortresses of the kingdom that he would do every thing that was necessary for the preservation of the peace of the kingdom until a meeting of the estates of the nation which they desired his highness to call to be holden at edinburgh the   th of march       the convention upon the prince of oranges letters meeting at the day appointed began with the choice of a president which fell on his grace the duke of hamilton by a majority of ten voices more than the marquess of athole memoirs f the convention of estates ms  after which they passed an act asserting and maintaining the lawfulness of the meeting and declaring that they would not dissolve but continue sitting until the government religion and property were settled and established acts of the convention of estates  their next care was to publish a proclamation requiring all persons from the age of sixty to sixteen to be ready to take arms upon advertisement from the meeting of estates for securing the protestant religion the laws and liberties of the kingdom acts and orders of the convention of estates  at length on the   th of april they proceeded and came to the following resolution viz that king james vii being a professed papist did assume the regal power and acted as king without ever taking the oath required by law and has by the advice of evil and wicked counselors invaded the fundamental constitution of the kingdom and altered it from a legal limited monarchy to an arbitrary despotick power and has exercised the same to the subversion of the protestant religion and the violation of the laws and liberties of the kingdom inverting all the ends of government whereby he has forfaulted the right to the crown and the throne is become vacant upon which the estates ordered a committee to bring in an act for settling the crown upon william and mary king and queen of england and likewise to prepare an instrument of government to be offered with the crown for redressing the grievances and securing the liberties of the people in pursuance whereof the committee drew up an act ibidem reciting in fourteen articles the method by which king james had invaded the constitution of the kingdom and in other twenty four articles their claim and declaration of their ancient rights and liberties which act being read and agreed to it was enacted that king william and queen mary should be declared king and queen of scotland to hold the crown and royal dignity of the said kingdom to them the said king and queen during their lives and the longest liver of them and that the sole and full exercise of the regal power be only in and exercised by him the said king in the names of the said king and queen during their joint lives and after their decease to the heirs

with king william and queen mary his grace became the prime minister was lord president of the privy council one of the extraordinary lords of session and lord high admiral of scotland but it seems that king thought not all this enough to reward his signal merit and services so he was pleased again to make him lord high commissioner in that session of parliament which began on the   th of april      acts of parliament  wherein several acts for the benefit of trade and commerce passed his grace having ordered the lord chancellor to prorogue the parliament to the   th of september he set out for london some time after from whence returning in the month of march he was taken ill in his health after an indisposition that would not yield to the art of the physician that handsome body of his sunk extremely yet without any alteration in his mind and senses and with a full prospect of death and a christian preparation for it he departed this transitory life at the abbey of holyrood house on the    april      in the  0 year of his age and was interred in the collegiate church of hamilton in the vault of the family where there is a monument erected for him of various colored marble

for france   d december      in the beginning of january      when the prince of orange desired the advice of the scots nobility and gentry then at london what was fit for him to do in reference to the affairs of scotland this occasioned a free conference among them and my lord arran offered his opinion in these words miscellany collections of the year       i have all the honor and deference for the prince of orange imaginable i think him a brave prince and that we owe him great obligations in contributing so much for our delivery from popery but while i pay those praises i cannot violate my duty to my master i must distinguish betwixt his popery and his person i dislike the one but have sworn and do owe allegiance to the other which makes it impossible for me to sign away that which i cannot forbear believing is the king my masters right for his present absence from us in france can no more affect my duty than his longer absence from us has done all this while and the prince desiring our advice mine is that we should move his majesty to return and call a free parliament for the securing our religion and property which in my humble opinion will at last be found the best way to heal all our breaches  his lordships constancy to the interest of king james even after the prince of orange was declared king of england occasioned such a suspicion of his conduct that he was sent prisoner to the tower history of england vol iii  but being discharged some time after he retird for a time into scotland his fathers death happening in the      brought no accession either o

his grace for many years after was not engaged in any public affairs except parliamentary ones as they occurred where he ever on all occasions showed a tender concern for the honor and prosperity of scotland more particularly in the great opposition he made in the union of the two kingdoms which as it did demonstrate his entire affection to his country so on that account it callenges a just esteem and honorable remembrance of his memory as a noble patriot by all the lovers of their country to perpetuity  the matter of the union being concluded in parliament his grace retired to his

of the english lords apprehending it might be dangerous to their constitution to admit into their house a greater number of the scots peers than were agreed to by the act of union and therefore resolved to oppose the said claim hereupon monday the  0th a motion was made for taking that matter into consideration which was done accordingly but after a few speeches the debate was adjourned to the   th and after some time spent therein the further consideration of that business was put off till the  0th upon which day the lords resumed the debate the queen being present incognito after learned council in the law for her majesty the house of lords and the duke of hamilton several speeches were made on both sides so that the debate lasted till near eighth in the evening when the question was put whether the twelve judges should be consulted with which being carried in the negative by fourteen voices proxies included another question was put whether scots peers created peers of great britain since the union have a right to sit in that house which was also carried in the negative by five voices although by this decision the royal prerogative the duke of hamilton and the whole peerage of scotland received a great mortification yet her majesty was pleased to continue her royal favor to his grace by making him master general of the ordnance and knight of the most noble order of the garter at a chapter held at windsor   th of october      and shortly after appointed him to go ambassador extraordinary to france upon the conclusion of the peace but while he was preparing his equippage suitable to the grandeur of his character he had the misortune upon the   th of november      to fight a duel in hydepark with the lord mohun where he killed that lord upon the spot and his grace died of his wounds by the time he got into his lodgings nota his grace the duke of hamilton and the lord mohun had married two ladies who were near relations both nieces to charles late earl of maclesfield and having been at law for some time about an estate they met twice and the last time on the   th of december at mr orlebars in chancery at his chamber in the rolls where upon the examination of mr whiteworth who had been steward to the lady gerard and the maclesfield family the duke happening to say he had neither truth nor justice in him mohun in answer replied he had as much truth as his grace this was the unhapp beginning of the quarrel upon which a challenge was carried by lieutenant general mackrtney the lord mohuns second who according to the positive oath of

saraces or gypsies from ireland infested the country of galloway whereupon the king emitted a proclamation bearing that whoever should disperse them and bring in their captain dead or alive should have the barony of bombie for his reward so it chanced that a brave young gentleman the lord of bombies son fortuned to kill the person for which the reward was promised and he brought his head on the

served the crown of france in the wars of italy where his gallant behavior procured him a very great name and reputation he was always in very high esteem with his own prince king james v for his fathers sake after whose death he was sent over from france to prevent any detriment to that crown by the minority of the young queen but being a frank and openhearted person he fell into the snare laid by cardinal beaton bishop of st andrews for him and in a little time lost the french kings favor and when it was come to that pass that he could neither stay at home nor return to france with safety he went into england anno      and put himself under the protection of henry viii who generously received him into his favor and gave him his neice lady margaret douglas in marriage and an estate in england to the value of seventeen hundred merks sterling per annum as an equivalent for his own fortune which was forfeited in scotland and this agreement the earl made with that prince that he should deliver into his hands the castle of dumbartoun with the isle of bute and the castle of rothesay rymers foedera angliae  which though the earl resolutely undertook yet the success did not answer he lived at the court of england till the      he was called home by queen mary and his forfeiture repealed by act of parliament after he had been banished from his country for  0 years his son henry lord darnly soon following him who being a young nobleman of illustrious birth extremely handsome and of a temper as well mixed as his outward proportions queen mary at first sight became so enamored of him that neither the menaces of queen elizabeth nor any other considerations could deter her from marrying him when to render him the fitter match for her she raised him to the dignity of duke of albany after this when he had not been above five months in scotland and did not exceed his nineteenth year she married him and with the consent of most of the peers declared him king of which happy marriage upon the   th june      to the perpetual advantage of all britain her majesty was delivered of a son king james vi first monarch of great britain  but though the queens love to the lord darnly at first had been very warm yet it began soon afterward as much to cool toward him the unkindness between them being chiefly fomented by one david rizio an italian her secretary for the french tongue which indignity the king revenged by entering into the cabal with those who contrived and and murdered the poor old man with circumstances that were not at all allowable and it is probable that it was in resentment of rizios death that the earl of bothwel and others officiously as thinking it might gratify the queen most inhumanly murdered this lovely prince in his own lodgings as he lay a bed on the  th of feburuary      though bothwel who was the murderer did maintain the queens innocence to his last moments and i think there was no other ground for believing the queen to be concerned in that oul action but her imprudent marrying that profligate person so soon thereafter who by common fame was reputed to be the murderer of her husband  upon the death of king henry the earl of lennox his father prosecuted the earl of bothwel as the regicide but that earls interest at court so over ruled the jury that he was formally acquitted of all suscion as well as action in the murder which lennox was forced to acquiesce in and from that time forth he lived in retirement till the death of the earl of murray the regent that he was unanimousy chosen regnt to the young king james vi his grandson which great tru he executed for    months till he was murdered by a party of the queens friends on the  th of september      buchanans history  he was interred in the chapel within the

king james embraced his lordship with singular kindness admitted him into his inwardest councils and made him duke of lennox and lord high chamberlin of scotland anno    0 this extraordinary favor of his with the king procured him envy from many who secrely mattered that he being a man most devoted to the romish religion was sent from france to subvert the true religion and that which increased the suspicion the more was that he applied himself and gave countenance to those who were most in the interest of the kings mother so that william earl of gowrie and others employed all their wi o

arundel  lady anne to archibald lord angus son and heir to william first marquis of douglas  lady frances to jerome westoun earl of portland  james duke of lennox as he was of the noblest extraction so his majesty king charles i took great care of his education and sent him to france italy and spain where he was created a grandee of that kingdom clarendons history  and as soon as he returned though he was scarce one and twenty years of age made him a privy councellor and as he had many great offices by inheritance so his majesty out of his abundant kindness to him made him master of the household lord warden of the cinque ports and knight of the most noble order of the garter  when the war began in      he adhered to the kings interest with signal fidelity and affection and made so entire a resignation of himself to his majesty that he abhorred all artifices to shelter himself from the pejudice of those who how powerful soever failed in their duty to the king and therefore he was pursued with all imaginable malice by them as one that would have no quarter and as he had received great bounties from the king so he sacrificed all he had to his service as soon as his occasions stood in need of it and he lived with unspotted fidelity some years after the murder of his master and was suffered by those that then governed to pay that last duty to him of putting him into his grave and died without the comfort of seeing the restoration of the crown on the  0 of march      dugdals baronage of england  by mary daughter of george duke of buckingham his wife he had esme who

his wife daughter of walter stewart esquire son of walter lord blantyre so that the honor of this princely family became extinct and his great fortune and hereditary offices came to king charles ii as his nearest heir male the kings great grandfathers father and the dukes being two brothers  but his majesty considering with what luster and glory the house of lennox had shone in former times and that while the dignity was in his majestys own royal person it was suppressed in the crown wherefore that the honor might be again revived and his majesty having bestowed the estate of lennox upon the lord charles lennox one of his natural sons whom he so surnamed by lovisa de querovale duchess of portsmouth was pleased to create him duke of lennox earl of darnly lord torboltoun   th of september

lady anne lennox  lesly earl of leven sir alexander lesly first earl of leven was the son of captain george lesly extracted from the house of balquhain in the county of aberdeen one of the most illustrious families of the leslies laurus leslana  being a younger brother he entered early into the life and condition of a soldier upon that stage where some of all europe then acted between the spainard and the dutch in the lord veres regiment in holland where he attained the reputation of a very good officer in the quality of a captain to which he attained after few years service  after which he went to sweden and entered into the service of the greatest general of that age gustavus adolphus king of sweden against the imperialists where he performed such great actions as procured him a general estimation and thereby gained so much honor that the king promoted him to be lieutenant general and then velt marshal of his armies with general approbation as a person who well deserved the preferment yea that king had so great an opinion of sir alexander lesly that in the      when the emperor had reduced all germany except stralsnd which was then invested by count walstein the citizens having a jealousy of their governor at the desire of some of the german princes made application to the king of sweden to send them an officer to command in that place which he willingly granted and pitched upon sir alexander lesly as a person fit for that station and he acquitted himself with so much conduct and gallantry that though the plague was in the city the outworks in a very ill condition and count walstein the imperial general before it with a formidable and victorious army he obliged him to raise the siege with considerable loss though it is reported the count was so confident of success that he swore though stralsund were hung in chains betwixt heaven and earth he would have it and general leslys behavior was so agreeable to the burghers that they made him a rich present in gold and struck several glorious medals upon that occasion some of which they presented him with one of which i have had he honor to see still preserved in his family   in the    0 general lesly was sent by the king of sweden to make an attack upon the isle of rugen in order to drive the imperialists out of it which he effected and his conduct and bravery on this occasion was so very remarkable that it drew upon him the greatest encomiums both from friends and enemies that could be devised by which means he opened a way for the king of swedens marching into germany  general lesly continued in the swedish service after the death of king gustavus under his daughter queen christiana till the year      that the troubles began in scotland he returned to his native country upon an invitation from the disaffected nobility and as soon as the covenanters began to list men toward the raising an army under the obligation of the covenant he was chosen to be their general to which he was by all men held very equal having had good experience of the most active armies of that time and a courage very notorious but that enterprise ending without any action by reason of a pacification which was then agreed to the general had no opportunity to signalize himself at that time but the peace being of a short duration and a new war breaking out the next year sir alexander lesly was again constituted general of the scots army which entered england in august    0 who having routed a party under the lord conway at newburn took possession of newcastle where they kept their head quarter soon after which a cessation was agreed to and a treaty appointed at rippon and afterward carried to london where a peace was happily concluded the particular articles whereof were ratified by his majesty in the parliament      at the conclusion of which general lesly was created earl of leven  the irish rebellion breaking out at this time his lordship was appointed general of the scots forces that were raised and transported into that kingdom upon the charge of england for suppressing the rebellion there in which service he continued till the      he was called over by the parliament to form and command the scots army that was sent into england to assist the parliament against the king by whose help the paliaments forces obtained their great victory at marstonmoor    july      where a noble and judicious memoirist of the english nation i mean the lord hollis does general lesly the honor as well as the justice to ackowledge that his lordship who commanded the scots horse and his countryman major general crawford who was major general to the earl of manchesters brigade were the persons who did the principal service that day quite contrary to what another celebrated historian of the same nation says of the generals conduct in the battle only it is to be observed that that authors account of this affair is wrote with so much rancor and prejudice and with such circumstances of inconsistency that the manner of the narrative takes off much of the credit of what he wrote in that matter  in the year      when the estates of scotland raised an army for the relief of king charles when he was made a prisoner in the isle of wight general lesly so well preserved his reputation with those of his own country who wedded the kings interest most that he had the command of the army offered him but he thought fit to decline it upon account of his age and infirmities which was happy for him considering the unfortunate issue of it  after the murder of the king his lordship appeared mighty earnest and forwad for restoring of king charles ii and the reestablishment of our old constitution and frankly entered into those designs and measures that were set on foot for the raising an army for his majestys service and was at the battle of dumbr in person in the quality of a volunteer after the defeat of the scots army there and when another design was set on foot for raising an army to march with the king into england no body appeared more forward in that service than his lordship but while general monk lay before dundee the old general with several other noblemen having appointed a meeting at eliot in angus to consult of means to relieve the town and other matters concerning the war of which monk having got advertisement sent a strong party of horse and dragoons commanded by colonel morgan to surprise them which he did in the night and the old general and the principals of them being taken were sent to london and committed prisoners to the tower and notwithstanding all the services he had done the english parliament his lordship did not receive the least favor from them nor from cromwell but underwent sequestration and all other severities the most loyal of his countrymen suffered but the crown of sweden having entered into an alliance with the parliament of england her swedish majesty calling to remembrance the great services performed by general lesly to the crown of sweden was pleased to interpose by her resident then at london for his liberation which being obtained his lordship was so sensible of the honor that princess had done him that to show his gratitude for so singular a favor he went over in person to sweden to return her majesty his humble and hearty thanks at which court his lordship was treated with all the civility and respect due to his quality and merit and returning thence to his native country lived mostly at his seat of balgony in a voluntary retirement till death put a period to his life some time of the

captain of horse and then was made colonel of a regiment of foot by his electoral highness which he brought over with the prince of orange in his expedition into great britain anno      upon that

appear to be very honorable as well considered in it self as in its illustrious alliances and branches  the family of lovat which this title leads me more particularly to treat of as it is one of the best extracted so it is one of the most noble and most numerous of all the frasers they are derived from sir simon fraser son of sir alexander fraser and nephew to king robert i who obtained the barony of lovat and other fair possessions in the northern parts by marriage of the heir female of the bissets in the latter end of king david ii whose arms he thereupon took into his own and which is

comes from stirling to edinburgh pretending a friendly visit to her son which the chancellor very willingly allowed her in the castle several days during which time she cajolled the prince into an obedience to her will and the chancellor into a belief that she designed nothing but what she owned at length she told the chancellor that she would but stay one night longer in the castle being the next day to set out for whitekirk in buchan to perform a vow which she had made for the health of the king whose person she earnestly recommended to his care till she should return he assured her of his fidelity both in that and all other respects and so left her thus all eyes but those of a trusty few being asleep the young king was carefully put up in a chest among his mothers furniture and

the king was hunting in the park of sirling his small retinue were on a sudden surrounded with a body of about  000 horse commanded by the lord chancellor in person so that the king was carried off without any opposition to edinburgh where he was welcomed by the acclamations of the people  sir alexander livingston upon advice of what had happened came to edinburgh and wisely considering that the chancellor could not more probably stand his ground amidst so many difficulties without him than he had done without his assistance he thought the best way was to endeavor to bring him to terms of accommodation which by the mediation of the bishops of aberdeen and murray was at length effected the chancellor continuing in his office as formerly and the custody of the kings person was again committed to sir alexander which high trust he executed with great fidelity till the      that the king now arrived to the age of    years began to govern in some measure by himself soon after which the earl of douglas became the principal favorite at court who bearing no good will to sir alexander livingston or any of the former ministry prevailed so far with the king as o call a parliament which accordingly met at perth black acts of parliament  thither he and others of his party were summoned to answer to such accusations as should be exited against them sir alexander was accused of having alienated the crown lands wasted the royal revenues and seized upon the kings jewels the furniture of his houses and what else he could divert to his own private use in consequence of which he was declared rebel his estate confiscated and sent prisoner to dunbartoun there to remain during pleasure this treatment of sir alexanders was thought very hard but the fate of william livingston his second son sir robert livingston of drumray late lord treasaurer was much harder for they were both beheaded in the castle of edinburgh where authors say that mr livingston being a young man of admirable parts and great eloquence made such a moving discourse upon the vanity of the world and the vicissitude of humane affairs as drew tears from the eyes of all that were present but after some time of imprisonment the king was pleased to restore sir alexander livingson to his estate called him to his council and constituted him justice general of scotland anno      rymers foedera  the same

   th of may      and that for the greater splendour of his majestys coronation  when the troubles broke out in the year      the earl of lowdon was one of the most leading of the peers who testified a dislike of the ways and methods had been taken in reference to the liturgy and the other innovations then brought into the church and as soon as the party who pressed for reformation did resolve themselves into societies his lordship was one of the nobility who were chosen to conduct their affairs and to represent their grievances which he did in a speech before the council on the    st of december to this purpose that by the methods lately taken it appeared there was an entire new model of government in church and state intended that the late service book and the book of canons which were then set out and imposed on the nation had passed no approbation of the assembly nor any convocation of of the clergy nor had been so much as communicated to the privy council but appeared to be so many new laws imposed on the kingdom by the kings sole authority contarary to the established laws of the land merely contrived by the bishops on whom he craved justice in a legal way  when his majesty had raised an army against the covenanters in      and was advanced as far as the borders my lord lowdon was one of the peers who signed an address to the king lamenting their ill fortune that their enemies had so great credit with his majesty as to persuade him to believe that they were or could be disobedient to him a thing that could never enter into their loyal hearts that they desired nothing but to be admitted into the presence of their gracious sovereign to lay their grievances at his royal feet and leave the determination of them entirely to his own wisdom and pleasure  the humility of the style wrought so upon the kings nature who thought it great pity that any blood should be spilt in a contention which he himself might put an end to by his own royal word as soon as he should hear their complaints that he easily consented to bring the business to a fair treaty to which the earl was named one of the commissioners upon the part of the covenanters and who accordingly met with such english commissioners as his majesty was pleased to appoint at the berks where they entered upon and concluded a pacification whereby the armies were to be disbanded an act of oblivion passed the kings forts and castles to be restored and a parliament and a general assembly to be called for a full settlement and that thereby all factions and animosities might be reconciled and composed but this peace was of a very short duration for the pacification being ill kept on both sides the king disowning what had been said to have been transacted upon his part and the covenanters remitting nothing of their zeal against the bishops and the liturgy having likewise entered a protestation that they did not intend by any thing contained in the treaty to vacate any of the proceedings which had been in the late general assembly of glasgow by these proceedings the breach became greater and wider and preparations for war began to be renewed on both sides with more vigor than ever but before things should come to the last extremity and that if possible matters might be composed without blood his majesty thought fit to require the covenanters to send some persons entrusted by their body to attend him to give an account of their proceedings and which was the thing they always most desired accordingly certain commissioners were named of which number the earl of lowdon was one at this time when the commissioners repaired to london there happened to be a letter intercepted and transmitted to his majesty that had been signed by the earl of lowdon and the chief of the covenanters written to the french king and directed an roy a style only used by subjects to their natural king in which they complained of the hardness and injustice of the government that was exercised over them put him in mind of the dependence scotland formerly had upon that crown and desired him now to take them into his protection and give them assistance clarendons history of the civil war  this letter being seen and perused by the lords of the council of england and the lord lowdon being examined and refusing to give any other answer than that it was writ before the agreement and thereupon reserved and never sent that if he had committed any offense he ought to be questioned for it in scotland and not in england and insisting upon his safe conduct demanded liberty to return but notwithstanding all the defenses the earl was able to make he was committed prisoner to the tower and tho his commitment was highly resented by the parliament as a breach of the public faith yet he continued in prison some months thereafter till by the interposition and intercession of the marquis of hamilton he was enlarged on the    th of june    0 burnets history of the two dukes of hamilton  when his lordship renewed all professions of duty to the king and a readiness to engage in his service as oon as he should return to his native country where his power and interest was as great as any mans which he did by disposing all those upon whom he had influence to hearken to all over tures for a peace with his majesty but notwithstanding all the endeavors of the lord lowdon and others who heartily desired an accommodation matters came to a second rupture and upon a party of the covenanters having routed the lord conway at newburn who appeared for the king and having taken newcastle they thought fit after that to present a humble petition and address to the king for a new treaty which his majesty condescending to and rippon being named the place of meeting the earl of lowdon was appointed one of the commissioners for the treaty but all they they did there was only to agree to a cessation of arms a safe conduct being granted to his lordship and the rest of his colleagues for going to london to carry on and conclude the treaty there which they did with all possible diligence and which his majesty confirmed and the lords of the privy council were made the conservators of the peace during the interval of parliaments  the peace betwixt the two nations being thus happily concluded it was judged necessary that the treaty should be ratified by the parliament of scotland which in the      his majesty was pleased to hold himself in his own royal person for the full satisfaction of his people and wherein all particulars that had been in dispute were adjusted to the seeming joy and satisfaction of every man and the security of all that was then established was sufficiently provided for in the end of the session his majesty was pleased to bestow honors and offices on some principal persons who had merited well at his hands and who were best able to serve him so the chancellours place was bestowed upon the lord lowdon during life and that with the full consent and approbation of the parliament rescinded acts of parliament  who looked on him as he was throughout the whole kingdom as a very wise man excellently fitted and qualified for the discharge of that great trust as the exigence of affairs then stood  when the civil war broke out in england the chancellor repaired to the king at york clarendons history  when his majesty did so fully satisfy his lordship with the justice and honor of his carriage toward his english parliament that he wrote to the scots commissioners at london in the name and by the direction of the lords of the secret council that they should present to the two houses the deep sense they had of the injuries and indignities which were offered to the king whose just rights they were bound to desend and that they should conjure them to bind up those wounds which were made and not to widen them by sharpness of language and to give his majesty such real security for his safety among them by an effectual declaring against tumults and such other actions as were justly offensive to his majesty that he might be induced to reside nearer to them and comply with them in such propositions as should be reasonably made ibid  soon after which taking leave of the king his lordship renewed all imaginable professions of duty to his majesty and a readiness to engage in his service which the king was very well assured he could do  in the      the chancellor was sent commissioner from the privy council of scotland who called themselves the conservators of the peace between the two kingdoms to his majesty while he was at oxford desiring to pass as a mediator betwixt the king and the two houses in england when his lordship used all importunity and arguments to persuade the king in private to consent to the alteration of the government of the church of england assuring him that it would be a mean not only to hinder the subjects of scotland from adhering to the english parliament but that it would oblige them to assist his majesty to the outmost in the vindication of all his rights but he found the king too strongly fixed to be swayed in what he thought a case of conscience by a consideration of convenience  he then betook himself to his own proper errand which consisted of two parts the one to offer the mediation of the conservators of the peace of the kingdom for the composure of the differences between his majesty and the two houses the other to desire his majesty that he would summon a parliament in scotland in answer to the first demand of mediation his majesty told him that he could not find any color or pretense of authority granted by the act of pacification by which the commissioners for scotland could conceive themselves interested in a faculty of mediation that the clause mentioned by them related only to the differences that might grow between the two nations which his majesty said had been and should be inviolably observed by him and therefore he could not admit of any such mediation as they proposed for the other demand of a parliament in scotland the king told him and the rest of the commissioners that against the time by which they could legally demand a parliament naming the day which was to be on the first tuesday of june      he would issue out his writs and there being no emergent cause to do it sooner he would forbear to put his subjects there to that trouble which those meetings how necessary soever would naturally carry with them so his lordship perceiving that he should not receive satisfaction in either of these proposals at last returned home re infecta  in the      when his majesty did renew his offer of peace to the two houses of parliament which they likewise agreeing to and uxbridge being assigned for the place of meeting the chancellor the earl of lawderdale sir charles erskine and mr robert barclay member of parliament for the burgh of irvine and mr alexander henderson in matters only which related to the church were sent commissioners from scotland but that treaty unhappily coming to nothing a bloody civil war thereupon ensued  when the king put himself into the scots army before newwark and the english positively demanded the delivery up of the kings person the earl of lowdon was appointed to treat with the parliament of england about that important affair where in a free conference with the two houses he publicly declared that an eternal infamy would ly upon the whole nation if they should deliver up the person of the king the securing of which was equally their duty as it was the parliaments and the disposal of his person in order to that security did equally belong to them as to the parliament however he said he would use all the persuasion and all the importunity he could with the king that his majesty might yield and consent to the propositions the parliament had sent to him  in the      the lord chancellor was one of the commissioners appointed to attend the king from the parliament of scotland while he was at the isle of wight to treat with his majesty anent a full accommodation with that kingdom and which they at last concluded on terms of great advantage to the nation in recompense of which the chancellor and his colleagues undertook to raise an army to rescue and relieve his majesty from the captivity he was then under and to restore him to his just rights and that no time might be lost as soon as the treaty was signed the chancellor departed for scotland where at first he used his outmost endeavors to procure such persons to be elected members to the parliament as he knew to be most inclined to the service in hand in which the honor of the country was so much concerned  when the parliament met on the  d of march      rescinded acts  the lord chancellor was chosen president of the convention wherein he employed all his power and interest to bring the parliament to comply with the engagement and declare for the king and tho the affair met with great opposition yet the resolution was carried in putting the country in a posture defense and raising an army to relieve the king i need not here recount the fate of that army which marched into england under the conduct of the duke of hamilton nor how unsuccesfull it proved for the design it was intended  b cromwells indemnity to the people of scotland all i shall further observe is that as there had been a party in the parliament whom the kings concessions did not satisfy so they declared against the engagement as unlawful and ungodly and the violent party of the clergy joining with them they passed an act against the engagers that was all those who had been the promoters of it ranking them into several classes whereby they were excluded from all offices of public trust and vote in parliament till they had satisfied the church by a public profession of their repentance for their accession to the unlawful engagement as it was called  when the parliament met after the murder of king charles i the lord chancellor was chosen president of that session who by their    act proclaimed king charles ii it is beyond all doubt the chancellor gave all imaginable assistance he could to bring over the king from holland and to raise the army that marched with his majesty into england but that army being unhappily defeated at worcester and the usurpers absolutely prevailing over all the three kingdoms the chancellor was not only outed of his office but was for ced for the security of his person to fly to the highlands where he lay concealed till the earl of glencairn by virtue of his majestys commission drew together a small body of horse and foot for his majestys service that the earl of lowdon repaired to him for which he was foreited by the powers that then prevailed and thereafter when cromwell granted an indemnity to the people of scotland both the earl of lowdon and the lord machline his son were particularly excepted after which his lordship the chancellor continued in the hills till all hope of serving the king was given over that he capitulated to lay down his arms and live quietly at his own house which he did in a country

crest a phoenix displayed proper motto i bide my time  lyle lord lyle some who have enquired into the antiquity of sirnames with much curiosity think that the first ancestor of this family was one of those scotsmen who fled from the usurpation of mackbeath into england and returned with edgar atheling and his sister the princess margaret afterward wife to king malcolm canmore upon the invasion by william the conqueror and got possessions in the isle of bute in the western parts of this realm from whence they took the demonation of le isle which they kept after they came to be settled upon the continent at duchalcastle in renfrewshire tho i have not seen directly any mention of them till king williams time that william de isle is one of the witnesses to that deed which walterus dapifer

william at the battle of alnwick rymers foedera on the   th july       the next in order of succession if not his son to be taken notice of is radulphus de isle who is a witness to the donation which

vendition of the lands of aldingstoun to the abbot of paisley and his title being added to the surname is an undoubted evidence that he was then a very remarkable person for i cannot but observe that this is the very first time i have found any in the western parts adding a local title to the surname  in the grand competition betwixt bruce and baliol for the crown sir walter lyle was upon the bruces side as his friend and namesake sir allan lyle was upon the baliols afterward and adhered to the interest of edward baliol in all the turns of the times in consideration whereof upon his coming to the crown he made him sheriff and governor of bute and lord high chamberlain of scotland sir james balfours list of chamberlains  but whether this sir alan lyle was the head and representative or only a branch of the family i do not know however it is certain that john lyle of duchal was in favor with king david bruce in the   th of whose reign he had a grant to himself and margaret de vauss his wife of the kings lands of buchhan in the county of stirling and to their heirs charta in rotulis dav     after which he obtained the honor of knighthood for i have found him designed joannes de

of mar though i know not precisely who she was but in her right the lord lyle in the time of king james ii laid claim to a part of that estate and from thenceforth added the coat of mar to his paternal arms this john was succeeded by his son  robert lyle styled chevalier de duchal in the letters of safe conduct that were granted by the king of england to a number of great men of scotland to come into his dominions in the      to wait on king james home when he was relieved from his captivity out of england i find he was also one of the hostages for the kings ransom rymers foedera  when the king possessed himself of the earldom of mar upon the death of alexander stewart earl of mar who was not born in lawful marriage he put in his claim as one of the heirs of that earldom to which he and the lord erskine should have succeeded by right and proximity of blood as fordons continuator says anno      obiit alexander stewart comes de mar and quia bastardus erat rex illi successit quamvis jure haereditario domini erskine and lyle successisse debuissent it is probable the king componed with sir robert lyle about his right for in all the disputes betwixt the king and the lord erskine

dominus de douchal and in a confirmation of the same charter under the great seal in the year      he is designed dilectus consanguineus noster robertus dominus lyle which does plainly show the time he was raised to the honor after which he had sundry grants from the crown particularly of the royal castle of refrew with the orchards and meadows for the payment of a tackduty of five pounds yearly

profuse man and of no expectation the father caused first interdict him but that method proving ineffectual he resolved to dispose of his estate to his daughter and her heirs and that he might more

royal army at the battle of harlaw against donald earl of ross and having made a great slaughter upon the highlanders effectually secured the government against the like attempts for many years thereafter but tho he had great wealth at home yet he showed himself so averse to idleness and pleasure that with a gallant company of his countrymen volunteers he went over to the low countries after the battle of harlaw and entered into the service of the duke of burgundy abercromby  where he made so fine a figure in that country that after the death of his first lady he gained the countess of holland in marriage and in her right laid claim to that sovereignty but the hollanders would not submit to the government of a foreigner which obliged him to return to scotland in the reign of king jomes i in whose hands he resigned the earldom of mar in favors of sir thomas stewart his natural son charta in rotulis jac i  reserving his own liferent but he dying without issue as well as his father whom death overtook in the year      there arose a competition betwixt the king and robert lord erskine about the earldom of mar the main plea for the king was a right from the last earl it was pleaded in behalf of the lord erskine that his right was derived from his ancestors by proximity of blood as nearest heir of lady isabel douglas the last countess of mar in the end judgment was given against his lordship in favors of the king who thereupon possessed himself of the earldom of mar and annexed it to the crown where it continued till king james ii gave it to his brother john then created earl of mar charta in publ archivis  but he dying without issue it fell back again to the crown where it remained till the      queen mary erected it into an earldom in favors of james prior

mar although it is not above three hundred years since the erskines had any title to the earldom of mar yet this illustrious family considered in it self is very great and eminent if we respect either its antiquity or the many great employments and perferments they have been honored with these four hundred years past and tho i cannot show the precise time when or by whom the name was first assumed yet it is certain it was derived from the barony of erskine in the shire of renfrew and so being a local surname is of consequence very ancient tho the first mention i have found of them is no higher than the time of king alexander ii in the    th of whose reign henry de erskine is witness in the gift which amelick brother of maldwin earl of lennox made to the chanons of paisly of the patronage of

the next of this noble family was a forward asserter of the right of king robert bruce to whose interest faithfully adhering he was one of those patriots who in the      joined the earl of murray and sir james douglas when they made an expedition into england where his gallant behavior procured him the honor of knighthood barber and abercromby and other marks of the royal favor he let behind him

and so to sir andrew ogilvy ancestor to the earl of finlater in the reign of king james ii  which sir robert erskine of erskine being a person well versed both in peace and war was no less conspicuous for his firm and steadfast loyalty to king david than his father had been to king robert even when his interest was at the very lowest and the usurper baliol upon the throne for as soon as the loyalists took the fields and declared for their lawful sovereign sir robert erskine joined the lord high steward and other patriots who fought with and defeated the rebels and thereby recovered a great part of the country to the kings obedience for which he was afterward rewarded as his singular merit deserved  when a treaty was set on foot for redeeming king david from captivity when he was taken prisoner at the battle of durham anno      sir robert erskine lord of erskine as he is called in the record was one of the commissioners employed in that honorable negotiation rymers foedera  but that treaty not taking effect he was always one of the plenipotentiaries that were appointed for the same purpose and renewed every year tho all of them were unsuccessful till the      that robert

agreed that king david should be released set free and ransomed for  00000 merks sterling money to be paid yearly by  0000 merks till the whole sum was paid to which no man seems to have contributed more frankly than sir robert and gave his eldest son one of the hostages for performance of the treaty rymer  this signal loyalty to his distressed sovereign could not fail to be nobly rewarded and therefore his majesty no sooner returned home than he constituted him justiciary for the northern district of scotland anno      charta in publ archivis  and the same year he was appointed to go upon a solemn embassy to france to renew the ancient league betwixt the two crowns sir john grant and norman lesly esquire being his colleagues rymers foedera  also in the      he was appointed one of the

all the service he could for king robert ii toward his advancement to the throne his majesty did not then forget to dispense his royal favors to him and more particularly he made him a grant of an annuity of forty meks sterling for merly payable to the crown out of the barony of cadzow which he exchanged with sir david hamilton for his lands of alands barns and barn hill within the barony of

as rendered him very capable of acting the part of a most consummate statesman which he did afterward in the highest and most eminent stations a subject could attain to being at first a younger brother his father judged the best way was to provide for him in the church and therefore having given him education accordingly he was in due time made commendator of inchmachmo in the end of king james vs reign no doubt for his better support in the prosecution of his studies to qualife him for a higher office in the church but both his brothers dying without heirs of their bodies he was obliged to quit the character of a churchman and marry in order to raise up heirs to the family which he did and matched with annabella daughter of william murray of tillibardin paternal ancestor to the present duke of athole by whom he had john his successor and a daughter margaret married to archibald earl of angus  upon his accession to the honor through the demise of his father tho he was but then a very young man he had so fair a reputation and was so generally well esteemed that the queen regent thought fit in the      dr andersons history of scotland ms in biblioth jurid edin to give his lordship the command of the castle of edinburgh in which station he behaved so well that he preserved himself in the good opinion of the queens majesty and the whole nation  when queen mary returned from france anno      her majesty having made choice of a new privy council my lord erskine was named one of that number in which station he soon rendered himself very gracious to the queen insomuch that she made him a grant of the abbey of inchmachomoe and diverse other church lands then newly dissolved his interest at court now being very great he thought it a favorable opportunity and a proper season for him to renew his claim to the earldom of mar and having made good a title through a long deduced pedigree from gratney earl of mar his pretensions being supported by the queens countenance his claim was allowed and ratified by act of parliament and though my lord mar was a very zealous protestant it is worthy our remark queen mary trusted him as much as she could have done any of her own profession which she did eminently manifest by the confidence she reposed in him for as soon as she was happily delivered of the prince james vi her majesty committed him to the tuition and custody of the earl in the castle of edinburgh then under his command and he discharged that great trust so well and was so much superior to all tentations of infidelity that when the earl of bothwell had married the queen he could not prevail with my lord mar either by promises or menaces to deliver up the prince to him which was the thing in the world that wicked earl had set his heart most upon when it is known his lordship could have made his own terms in the end when bothwell found all his offers rejected he was glad to allow the earl to carry the prince to stirlingcastle of which he himself was heritable governor and then delivered up edinburgh castle to bothwell on the   st of may      who immediately placed a creature of his own sir james balfour in it by which means the earl of mar became under god the happy instrument of the princes miraculous preservation during his long minority however he still retained great duty and affection to the queen even after things came to an extremity so it would appear that nothing but a pure principle of conscience for the preservation of the heir of the kingdom first engaged his lordship in the company of those who set the crown upon the head of the prince when he was an infant little more than one year old when the civil war began i dont find this generous and prudent lord much engaged on either side for his particular province being to take care of his royal pupil he stayed himself much with him and as he grew up in years gave him a princely education appointing the famous mr buchannan mr peter young mr david eriskine commendator of cambuskenneth and mr adam erskine commendator of dryburgh to be his instructors gentlemen who wanted none of those qualities which were to be wished to be in the persons to whom the education of a great and hopeful prince was committed and for framing his mind and manners in his young and tender years  my lord mar bore no public office in the state till the      that upon the death of matthew earl of lennox the regent the earl of mar was a nobleman so generally well esteemed that he was by the unanimous consent of the kings party chosen regent of scotland in his room sept        in which great office he had says one less satisfaction than he expected for when he had strugled no less under the turbulent councils of his own party than the insolences of his adversaries died for very grief after he had governed only thirteen months upon the    th of october      and left behind him so unblemished a reputation as cannot be very easily paralleled in the like circumstances he was interred in the vault of his family among his ancestors in the paroch church of alloa under a plain monument without any other inscription than signifying him to be the person there interred  to john earl of mar succeeded john his son then under age of whom i have found little memorable till the      his lordship being then very young he was induced to join with others of the discontented nobility who seized on the king at ruthvencastle and petitioned his majesty that he would remove sir james stewart who then styled himself earl of arran from his councils being a person of evil fame and disaffection to the public peace of the kingdom and an instrument of discontent between the king and his nobility but the way and manner of that enterprise being afterward adjudged treasonable the earl was obliged to give up the command of stirlingcastle and to leave his majestys dominions which he did and transporting himself into ireland from whence he came over to england and joined the the lord hamiltoun and others who had been outlawed during the regency of the earl of mortoun with whom he returned to scotland anno      when he obtained his majestys pardon was restored to his command of stirlingcastle and to a more than ordinary share of his majestys favor which his lordship never afterward forfaulted by any undutiful behavior  in the      when it pleased god to bless his majesty with a son prince henry the king reposing full confidence in his lordships fidelity committed the tuition of his royal highness to him and his majesty was at the same time pleased to write with his own hand the following letter to his lordship my lord of mar because in the security of my son consists my security i have concredited to you the charge of his keeping upon the trust i have in your honesty this i command you out of my own mouth being in the company of those i like otherwise from any charge that can come from me you shall not deliver him and in case god call me at any time see that neither for the queen nor estates their pleasure you deliver him till he be eighteen years of age and then he command you himself     how the earl discharged this great trust will best appear from the exoneration which his majesty gave him under the great seal when his lordship carried the prince to london upon his fathers accession to the english crown a copy of which i shall here insert james by the grace of god king of great britain france and ireland etc whereas it is not unknown that upon just and necessary considerations we did commit in the year of our lord      the custody of the prince our son to our right trusty and wellbeloved cousin and councellor the earl of mar as well in regard of our security which consists in his security as in respect there was none more fit to take that charge than the earl of whose sincerity in religion affection and fidelity to our person to our state together with his discretion and judgment we have had so good experience having now otherwise resolved to dispose of him and considering how just and necessary it is for us to give as ample a discharge to our cusin the earl of mar as may be we do therefore first declare to all persons whatsoever by these presents that we have very great cause most graciously to allow of that great care which he has showed in providing for his virtuous education next that he has observed our directions for his delivery and lastly that he has been received in so good state of health and constitution of body and mind that we have occasion not only to take comfort in gods favor thereby so confirmed to us but do now testify and declare by virtue of these present letters that we do discharge acquit and exonerate against us our heirs and successors our said cousin the earl of mar concerning the education and delivery of our son as foresaid and do hereby notify to the world that we have received full and entire satisfaction answerable to the trust reposed in him and are resolved to lay it up in memory as a record of his constant love and duty toward us and taking ourselves bound on the honor and gratitude of a prince not only to give him acquittance but to reward him in time coming for so great and memorable a service    june   0   neither are we to forget that in the   0  his majesty sent him ambassador to queen elizabeth to congratulate that princess upon her suppressing the audacious attempt of the earl of essex in which negotiation his lordship deported himself with such prudence and conduct that he brought the principals of the english ministry to favor his majestys succession to that crown which took effect in less than two years there after which upon another occasion his majesty did very gratefully acknowledge and own that next to the goodness of god he ascribd to the earl of mar s last negotiation in that kingdom his peaceabe accession to the crown of england  his majesty upon his accession to the crown of england did not forget to dispense his royal favors to his lordship more particularly he began with conferring the garter upon him the ensigns of which he was invested with on st georges day april   d   0  and shortly thereafter caused him to be sworn of his majestys most honorable privy council of england and made him a grant of sundry abbacies and other church lands then dissolved from the crown but his majesty being still more and more desirous to confer greater honors on his lordship was graciously pleased to constitute him lord high treasurer of scotland upon the removal of sir robert ker earl of somerset and had the whitestaff delivered to him on the  d of december      in which office he demeaned himself so well that he did his master much service and preserved himself in the good opinion and acceptance of the whole nation and he had the treasury so full at the kings coming down to scotland in      that the court were entertained with the greatest magnificence imaginable out of the profits of the crown and it was observed by the english nobility who attended the king in that progress that his majesty appeared with no less lusture at holyroodhouse than at whitehall  he continued in the treasurers place till the    0 his lordship being grown aged and infirm he resigned the office which was immediately put into the hands of the earl of mortoun and declining to be put into any other public employment he retired to his seat in the country where death put a period to his days on the   th of december      aged     he married first anne daughter of

justice which station he prudently and faithfully discharged till the      his lordship was removed upon a general statute that no peer could be an ordinary lord of the session whether it was this or any other act of unkindness he met with from the court i cannot say but it is certain upon the first appearance of the troubles in      his lordship being then governor of edinburghcastle his majesty did not seem to be absolutely satisfied of the affection of the earl to his service and therefore removed him from that command and put the castle into the hands of major general ruthven as a person on whom he could firmly rely and yet his majesty was willing that his lordships remove might not be attended with any act of disobligation and therefore gave him  000 lib which the marquis of

expected from the most eminent instructers  in the      he was chosen knight of the shire for the county of berwick to the parliament wherein he served with distinguishing zeal for the liberties of his country and upon every occasion opposed and contradicted all taxes and impositions on the subject that were not exactly according to law  in      the privy council having arbitrarily imposed a tax upon the shire of berwick that was not altogether legal sir patrick hume was chosen to remonstrate against it and to apply to the lords of session for redress in the ordinary course of justice which was so highly resented by the council as an act of insolence and a contempt of their authority that he was ordered to crave pardon in the most submissive manner and to submit to their sentence but s patrick insisting on the legali of what he had done and absolely refusing to make any such compliance for what he thought so solemn an act of his duty his attendance was continued from day to day to

of the chief ministers of state was so great against him that as soon as the court had notice of his being at london it was resolved he should be apprehended and imprisoned as a man worthy of their fear though they could not charge him with any practices that were not precisely agreeable to the duty of a good and faithful subject but only a suspicion of his disaffection to the government from the company he haunted the principals of whom were the earl of shaftsbury and the lord russel his near relation but sir patrick having got timeous warning of the design of the court thought it his most advisable course to step out of the way and traveling beyond sea he retired to geneva from whence he came down to holland where he was received with great kindness and generosity by e prince of

popery he joined with the earl of argyle and came over with him in the invasion      but that attempt being by the providence of god overthrown and the party dispersed sir patrick found means to conceal himself in airshire for three weeks a report being industriously spread abroad by his friends that he was dead that the search for him might be discontinued till a vessel was provided for him on the westcoast which in a few days safely landed him at dublin but not thinking it safe for him long to continue in ireland for by this time he was forfaulted and declared a rebel he went over to holland where he met with the same kind and generous reception from the prince of orange as formerly though perhaps not so avowedly and there he continued to reside till the      he came over with the prince of orange in his expedition to britain the prince had so great an esteem of his sincerity to the protestant religion and of his fidelity and affection to his highnesss design that he thought fit particularly to consult with sir patrick in that difficult juncture and when the government was dissolved upon king jamess withdrawing into france sir patrick hume was one of the most leading and forward in the address from scotland to the prince of orange to take upon him the administration of affairs both civil and military till a meeting of the estates should be called to settle the nation which his highness having called sir patrick was chosen a member thereof for the shire of berwick wherein he became very instrumental in bringing about the revolution and in procuring the settling of the crown on king william and queen mary as soon as their majestys came to constitute a privy council sir patrick was named a privy councellor and appointed one of the commissioners to treat of an

of his majestys royal favor to the family of polwarth and in commemoration of his lordships great affection to his said majesty a warrant being directed to the lord lion for that effect and that his lordship might have the more interest in his own county and appear the more considerable there their majestys king william and queen mary were pleased to constitute him sheriff principal of

was pleased to give him a very ample approbation of his services under the great seal april   th   00 wherein his majesty declared quod praefatus comes in omnibus muneribus a nobis concreditis andore

person in the assembly of the church but during the sitting of the assembly king william died which did very sensibly affect his lordship and all the hearty lovers of the revolution his commission

the assembly in the end of   0  her majesty having made some alterations in the ministry the earl of marchont was removed from being chancellor to which office the earl of seafield was preferred but his remove did not in the least diminish his lordships zeal for what he thought the interest of his country but rather eightned his public spirit for having always most at heart the security of the protestant religion and a successor to the crown of that religion in the first parliament after the queens coming to the crown the earl was the first who proposed an overture for settling the succession to the crown on the princess sophia duchess dowager of hanover and the heirs of her body being protestants in default of issue of her majesty queen anne and at the same time presented another act for securing and settling the presbyterian government in doctrine and worship as being most agreeable to the word of god but though the first overture did not at that time take the parliament having a view of an union with england yet the last carried and was approved by a great majority and when the treaty of union came before the parliament his lordship there as well as in the commission of the general assembly of the church used his utmost endeavors to have it brought about as the only means he thought could secure religion and establish a firm and lasting peace betwixt the two nations a protestant successor to the crown being thereby secured which was the thing his lordship longed most passionately to see before he should leave this world and when that settlement

ancient in scotland as the reign of king malcolm iii that a gentleman from hungary accompanied queen margaret the wife of that prince into this realm where he got lands in lothian which he called melvil after his own name and there fixed his residence but be this as it will it appears from writs i have seen the melvils were very considerable in the time of king william both for the many lands they enjoyed and the great offices they held under the crown galfred de malevile in that reign gave the church of malevile to the monks of dunfermling cum tota illa terra quam eidem feclesiae assig

after the year      and died      and further it is worth taking notice of that some families abroad in foreign parts particularly in hungary still carry the surname of malevile and give a coat of arms much the same with the earl of melvil viz gules three crescents argent within a border charged with eight roses of the first  this family divided itself into three collateral branches from as

dunbar melvils memoirs  and a knight and to the very hour of his death prosecuted him with all manner of kindness and respect this worthy man was among the first of note in those parts who embraced and favored the reformed religion which made him the object of the hatred and malice of the romish clergy bishop beaton of st andrews and mr durie the abbot of dunfermling his neighbors did particularly own it the bishop accused him before the king of heresy at least a favourer of luthers doctrine which as the times went could not fail of being penal to him if the king who had a particular favor to sir john melvil had not interposed and saved him from their further prosecution but the wicked bishop did not rest here for what he could not effect in course of law he intended to execute by a barbarous assassination having for that end hired some villains to intercept and murder sir john in the way as he rode home to his own house but by the good providence of almighty god and the courage and fidelity of his own servants and retainers who were very umerous the design was prevented but what bishop beaton could not bring to pass his successor bishop hamilton effected on pretense of a treasonable correspondence with the nations enemies abroad and the matter was thus in the minority of queen mary a war breaking out betwixt scotland and england upon the breach of the marriagearticles that had been agreed on betwixt edward prince of wales and queen mary whereupon all correspondence betwixt the two nations was forbid upon the highest penalties and it happening that sir john melvil having before that sent his eldest son to england for the improvement of his education after the war broke out he wrote to him wherein the good old man admonished his son to live and demean himself as became a christian and a gentleman without any thing relating to a treasonable correspondence or intelligence as was pretended but the letter being intercepted was brought to the bishop of st andrews and his interest being thn superior to any mans with his brother the earl of aran the governor sir john was suddenly seized and sent prisoner under a strong guard to strling and it being resolved he should be cut off in a seeming way of justice an indictment of high treason was prepared against him and care being taken before by his accuser the bishop to provide witnesses to prove the charge he was found guilty and condemned to lose his head which was accordingly executed on him in the end of the year      nor did bishop hamiltons malice abate toward him after his death for they seized on his estate dispossessed his lady and children with all the circumstances of barbarity malice could invent and never left persecuting his family till they had reduced it to the lowest penury and want by disposing and giving away all the fortune that should have supported them but they were under the care of a higher hand for the almighty ordered matters so that all the younger children were better provided for than they could have been by their father if he had been alive as sir john himself had oretold his lady to comfort her under the disconsolate circumstances of his death by helen his wife daughter of alexander napter of merchistoun ancestor to the lord napier he had   john his eldest son thereafter lord of raith   robert lord melvil   sir james melvil of

was much taken notice of for his prudent and generous behavior insomuch as henry ii soon placed him in his service in a very honorable station in which he continued many years to his masters great satisfaction  upon his return to scotland his known great parts and the very good general reputation he had acquired inclined queen mary to call him to her privy council and to send him ambassador to england anno      and he discharged his trust with prudence and dexterity insomuch as when king james vi came to act by himself his majesty sent sir robert ambassador to england in conjunction with the master of gray to intepose with queen elisbeth in behalf of queen mary that the sentence of death which was passed on her might not be put in execution where says my author sir james melvils memoirs  he spoke such brave and stt language before the council of england that the queen threatened his life and would have retained him captive had not the master of gray s interest prevented it who was his colleague but as this faithful discharge of his trust did and alwise will reflect honor on his memory so it endeared him very much to king james who reposing great confidence in sir robrt

were born him by queen margaret who was daughter of henry vii of england and have of late improved it so far as to allege that this was one of the motives of the death of john earl of gowrie at perth  th of august   00 because he stood in an equal degree of relation in blood with king james vi to the crown of england but this being now known and owned as a mistake i need not enlarge much upon disproving what has been said upon that subject but to put the matter beyond dispute i have seen marriagearticles betwixt sir colin campbel son to archbald earl of argyle and who was thereafter earl

methvens daughter were performed in the most solemn manner upon the eschutcheons of his maternal line the arms of the earl of athole were placed as the father of the lady methven which appears from the printed account of the marquiss funerals and it is not to be imagined if this illustrious person had been descended of the royal family of england that such a great mistake would have been committed as to have placed the arms of the house of athole instead of the royal arms of england at his obscquies where the outmost care and charge was bestowed to perform them with all imaginable

majesty to have that title conferred upon him and the king without considering any inconveniency that might attend that creation gave him a patent ratifying and approving him in that dignity but it is reported being very much exalted with that title his vanity was not a little supported with the general error of our historians of david earl of stratherns being the eldest son of king robert iis first marriage with eupham ross his queen and some high expressions in reference to his right to the crown having inadvertently dropped from the earl the matter came to be talked at court and his majesty was pleased so far to take notice of it that he deprived his lordship of all the offices he held under the crown and gave order to sir thomas hope lord advocate to raise a decree of reduction

halkerton after which his successors i think went by the title and designation of cadham in the county foresaid  lieutenant general john middleton was the son of john middleton of cadham by helen his wife daughter of john strachan of the family of thornton who being bred a scholar intended to have made his fortune that way but the civil war breaking out he laid aside that resolution and betaking himself to the profession of arms engaged in the service of the english parliament where the eminency of his courage made him so much taken notice of when he was not above the degree of a captain of a troop of horse that by the time sir william waller was sent with an army into the west of england distinct from the other commanded by the earl of essex captain middleton was made his lieutenant general clarendons history of the rebellion  and he continued in that service with singular reputation till the parliament cashiered the earl of essex and made their new model he quit all command there and betook himself to the service of the estates of scotland where he gave frequent testimonies of signal courage and valor in several actions insomuch as when the parliament anno      raised an army for the rescue of the king upon his being made prisoner in the isle of wight he was appointed lieutenant general of the horse and at the battle of preston he maintained a dispute with the enemy with great courage and with very great loss to them for several hours memoirs of john first earl of middleton ms till losing his horse he had the ill fortune to be taken prisoner and sent to newcastle ludlows memoirs  where he continued till after the murder of the king he found means to corrupt the marshal who had the keeping of him and made his escape into scotland by the time k charles ii arrived in this kingdom where he was received by his friends with great joy to whom such a brave officer and of such entire affections to his majesty could not at such a season but be very acceptable and when the parliament had raised another army to march into england with the king clarendon  whereof his majesty himself was general lieutenant general middleton had the command of the horse and at the fight of worcester  d of september      at that part where middleton commanded there was a very brave resistance made and he charged the enemy so vigorously that he beat that body that charged them back in great disorder and with great loss ibidem  but in the action he received several wounds whereby he fell into the enemys hands and as soon as he was fit to be removed was sent prisoner to the tower of london ibidem  and destined to be sacrificed by cromwell against whom he thought he might more warrantably proceed than against any other of the scots prisoners because he had heretofore in the beginning of the war served the parliament and to that purpose he erected a high court of justice for the trial of some persons that had been troublesome to him especially major general middleton and the time approaching that he was to be tried his friends in london gave him so good and so particular advertisement that he ma his escape and after he had cocaled himself there a fortnight or three weeks that the diligence of the first examination and enquiry was over he had the good fortune to get himself safely transported over to france and came to the king to parts to the grief and vexation of the very soul of cromwell who earnestly thirsted after the blood of this noble person  lieutenant general middleton continued to attend on the king till the      his majesty being importuned by many expesses as well from the scots lords who were prisoners in england as from those who were at liberty that lieutenant general middleton might be sent over to the highlands with his majestys commission and with some supply of arms and that by the next spring they would have an army ready strong enough to meet with general monk and though the king did not says the lord clarendon expect that any notable service would be performed by his friends in scotland for his advantage or their own redemption yet did not think fit to seem to undervalue the professions and overtues of those who had during his being among them made all professions of duty to him and therefore gave such a commission and instructions to the lieutenant general as were necessary and dispatched him to scotland where he arrived with some few officers and such a supply of arms and ammunition as could be got upon his own credit and activity in the winter of the year      when the earl of glencairn delivered up the command of the troops to him and he continued at the head of them for a whole year thereafter but never getting any supplies from abroad he was at length totally routed and suppressed by general monk after which he found shelter in some honest mens houses where he was concealed till opportunity served to transport him beyond sea that he came to the king at cologn      and attended his majestys fortune throughout the rest of the exile  upon the restoration his majesty in commemoration of the long and faithful services of general middleton was pleased to raise him to the degree of an earl by the title of earl of middleton by letters patent bearing date  st of october    0 charta in rotulis caroli ii  made him commander in chief of his majestys forces in scotland governor of edinburgh castle one of the lords of his majestys most honorable privy council and appointed him lord high commissioner to the  st and  d sessions of the parliament      and      but being impatient to be the sole favorite in his last session of parliament he procured an act to pass by which certain persons were to be incapacitated from all offices of honor or trust and that by a very new and unheard of way of billoting by which act the secretary of state the earl of lauderdale the treasurer the earl of crawfurd the justiceclerk sir robert murray and others who had given very signal testimony of their affection and fidelity to the king were particularly levelled at but his majesty finding the earl had very far exceeded the limits of his commission in the framing and passing of that act and that it was highly derogatory to his majestys justice and innate goodness he had such a deep resentment of the indignity that he gave orders to reseind the act of billoting and it fell heavy on the earl himself for he was immediately removed from all the offices he held under the crown the castle of edinburgh was given to the earl of lauderdale and the command of the forces to the earl of rothes who had contributed very much to his overthrow but his majesty calling to mind the great merit and services of the earl of middleton during the exile thought it improper he should be dismissed with any further marks of the royal displeasure and therefore that he might be out of the way and never more in a condition to compete with or control the earl of lauderdale who had the ascendant of the other in the kings affections he was made governor of the new english fort of tangier in africa which was little other than a more decent exile there he lived till the      death overtook him in that remote corner of the world where his body was committed to its rest he married first grisel daughter of durham of pikar sister to sir alexander durham of large and again

his friends in order to raise up heirs to his illustrious house prevailed with him when he was but a youth to marry which he did into a very noble family this marriage broke off the course and gave a great interruption to his studies but quickly finding the loss he should sustain if he did not go through with his education he got good masters at home and entered into a close course of study wherein he made so great a proficiency and progress that in a very little time he became not only a great master but a critic in the greek and latin after which for his greater improvement and giving an ornament to his hopeful person he traveled into foreign parts where he spent some years in attaining the language and in learning the exercises then in vogue in which he excelled most men and came over to england by the time he was twenty two years of age  he then betook himself to the court intending to live there in a view of serving the crown and of raising himself to those honors and employments both his birth and personal qualifications did entitle him to but in his attendance there meeting with some discountenance of the king which was very artfully brought about he left the court and returning to scotland just before the breaking out of the troubles he joined with the discontented party who appeared most forward for the redress of grievances of the church which was all that was at that time pretended insomuch as he soon became one of the principal and most active lords for the covenant and reformation but after the first expedition of the covenanters into england the earl upon his observation of the unwarrantable prosecution of the ends of the covenant he gave over that party and his command in the army and made a full tender of his service to his majesty which brought him so much into the jealousy of the party he had formerly been of that there was no room left to doubt of his sincerity to the king the earl of clarendon does very unjustly insinuate in his history of the civil war that while the king was in scotland the earl of montrose offered to make away two great men he thinks were not so cordial in the kings interest as could have been wished but as this calumny is most false as i am fully able from original writs and papers to justify him from that aspersion so i shall offer no more here for his vindication but to declare to the world and which i am able to demonstrate that the marquis of montrose was a prisoner in the castle of edinburgh for corresponding with the king from the month of june      till january thereafter and the king came down in august and returned in november so it is clear he was a prisoner all the while his majesty was in scotland original instructions of all this i have had the honor to peruse in the duke of montroses custody  after his releasment he lived most part privately at his seat in the country till the meeting of the convention      he privately withdrew out of scotland and came to the king a few days before the siege was raised from gloucester and gave his majesty the first clear information of the proceedings of the convention of the resolutions would be there taken and of the posture the kingdom would speedily be in and made some propositions to the king for the remedy which there was not says the earl of clarendon then time to consult of but as soon as his majesty returned to oxford after the battle of newburry he was very willing to hearken to any overture the earl should make in reference to what could be done to prevent the mischief was like to ensue to his majestys affairs by a combination betwixt the scots covenanters and the english parliament wherefore that his majesty might have this important affair brought to a full resolution he was pleased to hold several conferences with the earl but all the advances which were made toward the execution of any attempt for the kings service were checked by his majestys not being able to give any troops to the earl by the protection whereof the loyal party of the kingdom might come to his assistance and discover their affections to his majesty notwithstanding of which the vigorous spirit of the earl of montrose stirred him up to make some attempt which he thought might be of service to the king and therefore proposed that his majesty should give a command to the earl of antrim to raise and send over a body of two thousand men into the highlands of scotland to be a foundation for raising forces there and that if his majesty would grant him a commission to command that army he would himself be in the highlands to receive them and run his fortune with them and that if no time were lost in prosecuting that design he did hope that by the time the scots army should be ready to take the field they should receive such an alarm from their own country as should hinder their advance into england clarendons history of the rebellion  upon this overture the king conserd with the two lords and finding the earl of antrim forward to undertake the raising as many men as should be desired his majesty resolved to encourage it all he could and therefore that the earl of montrose might depart with the better character and testimony of his majestys favor and good opinion and be thereby the better qualified to per form the great trust reposed in him his majesty was pleased to give order for a warrant to make the earl marquis of montrose charta penes ducem de montrose data   may       and gave him a commission constituting his lordship captain general and commander in chief of all the forces to be raised in scotland for his majestys service and so taking his leave of the king accompanied with several gentlemen he began his journey as if he meant to make his way in company with them into scotland but after he had continued his journey two or three days in that equipage which he knew could be no secret and that it would draw the enemies troops together for the guard of all passes to meet with him the marquis was found missing one morning by his company who after some stay and enquiry returned back to oxford whilst this noble person with incredible address and fatigue had not only quitted his company and his servants but his horse also and found a safe passage most part on foot through all the enemies quarters till he came to the very borders clarendon  from whence by the assistance of friends whom he trusted he found himself secure in the border of the highlands with his most faithful friend the lord of inchbrackie guthrys memoirs  where he lay quiet without undertaking any action until the earl of antrim did make good so much of his undertaking that he sent over colonel alexander mdonald with a regiment of fifteen hundred soldiers who landed in the highlands at or near the place that had been agreed on bishop wisharts memoirs of the marquis of montrose  where the marquis was ready to receive him which he did with great joy and quickly published his commission of being general for the king over all the kingdom  with this handful of men thus brought together with those circumstances he brought in so many of his countrymen to join with him as were soon strong enough to arm themselves at the charge of their enemies whom they first defeated and every day increased in power till he fought and prevailed in the several battles of tippermuir alfuird aldearn aberdeen inverlochy and kilsyth that he made himself in little more than one year upon the matter master of the kingdom and did all those stupenduous acts which are deservedly the subject of a history excellently written in latin by dr george wishart thereafter bishop of edinburgh though very ill translated since by an unknown hand  after the battle of kilsyth his excellency the marquis marehd eastward took the city of edinbutgh the bishop of dunkelds memoirs  and advancing his course toward england he was unexpectedly attacked by major general david lesly with the whole strength of the scots horse at philiphaugh on the   th of september      bishop guthrys memoirs  where he was totally defeated so that his future triumph was not only prevented but he was compelled with great loss to retire again to the highlands for recruiting of his army in which he had wonderfully succeeded when he received his majestys positive orders while he was in the hands of the scots army before newark to lay down his arms by a certain day prefixed and to leave the kingdom lord crendons history  till when they pretended they could no declare for his majesty and this was done with so much earnestness and by a particular messenger known and trusted that the marquis obeyed and transported himself into france toward the end of the year      bishop wisharts memoirs of the marquis of montrose clarendon  where he did for some time reside and took the opportunity while he attended at that court to make some overtures to cardinal mazerine to raise any army for the service of the king which the crafty cardinal did not receive says the lord clarendon with that regard the marquiss great name deserved thereupon his excellency left france and made a journey into germany to the emperors court and thence to brussels where he lay privately and as incognito for some time till he heard of the murder of the king that he came to the hague and presented himself to king charles ii with the tender of his service c  and his majesty received him with a very good countenance and as a most gracious testimony of his great fidelity and merit presented him with the ensigns of the most noble order of the garter  while the king remained at the hague there were at this time beside the marquis of montrose and those of the nobility who adhered to him the commissioners who came from the council and the kirk to invite his majesty into scotland and the duke of hamilton and others of the nobility who joined with him and though there was nothing the king wished more than that some expedient might be found out to unite all those parties especially that there might be an union and reconciliation betwixt mentrose and the hailtonion faction who had an equal desire to serve the king and were as much persecuted by the party who then governed as the marquis was yet the animosity of each of them was such against him that they were equally his implacable enemies insomuch as they did not only refuse to meet with him but as soon as he came into the room where they were though his majesty himself was present they immediately withdrew and left the room ibidem  and desired that the marquis whom they called james graham might be forbidden to come into his majestys presence because he stood excommunicated by the kirk and degraded and forfaulted by the judicatory of the kingdom with which demand his majesty declared his being very much offended which he made manifest by using the marquis with the more countenance and in holding the more frequent conferences with him  but when the marquis clearly perceived that it was not possible that the lords of the other parties would ever unite with him and that his attendance on the king might possibly bring some prejudice to his service he therefore proposed that his majesty would give him letters and credentials to several princes in germany and to the northern crowns by which he might appear ambassador extraordinary from the king if he should find it expedient to the end he might by the help of these princes obtain the loan of moneys arms and ammunition to enable him to prosecute his intended descent into scotland and the king says my author the earl of clarendon glad that he did not press for ready money which he was not able to supply him with gave him such letters as he desired and a commission to gather such a force together as by the help of those princes he might be enabled to do upon which the marquis went for hamburgh which he appointed for the rendezvous for all those troops which he expected from germany and from whence he could in the mean time visit such courts of the neighbor princes as he should be encouraged to do and keep such intelligence with his friends in scotland as should provide for his reception in a word he sent or went in person both to sweden and denmark where he found the performance very disproportionable to the hopes and encouragement he had received from thence so that the marquis was obliged to return to hamburgh with very small supplies from either or both these kingdoms and there he received no better account from those officers whom he had sent to germany and therefore concluding upon the whole that all his hopes from germany and those northern princes would not increase the strength he had already which did not amount to above five hundred he caused those soldiers he had drawn together to be embarked for scotland and sent officers with them who knew the country with directions that they should land in such a place and remain there till he came to them or sent them orders and then in another vessel commanded by a captain very faithful to the king he embarked himself and near an hundred officers and landed in another creek not far from the other place whither his soldiers were directed and both the one and the other party were set safely on shore in the orkneys on the   th of april    0 memoirs of the marquis of montrose  from thence he came over to caithness history of the revolutions in england by a french clergyman where montroses expedition is particularly narrated  and presently repaired to the house of a gentleman of quality with whom he corresponded by whom he was well received and thought himself to be in security till he might put his affairs in some method after he had staid there a short time he quickly possessed himself of an old castle which in respect of the situation in a country so impossible for an army to march in thought strong enough for his purpose thither he convoyed the arms ammunition and troops which he had brought with him and then he published his declaration that he came with the kings commission to assist those his good subjects and to preserve them from oppression that he did not intend to give any interruption to the treaty that he heard was entered into with his majesty but on the contrary hoped that his being in the head of an army how small soever that was faithful to the king might advance the same however he had given sufficient proof in his former actions that if any agreement were made with the king upon the first order from his majesty he should lay down his arms and dispose himself according to his majestys good pleasure with these declarations which he sent to his friends to be scattered by them and dispersed among the people as they could be able he writ likewise to those of the nobility and the principal heads of the highland clans to draw such forces together as they thought necessary to join with him and he received answers from many of them by which they desired him to advance more into the lowlands and assured him that they would resort to him with good numbers of their friends and followers which many of them did prepare to do with great sincerity  the alarm of montroses landing startled the parliament which was then sitting at edinburgh in so much that it gave them no leisure to think of any thing else than of sending forces to hinder the recourse of others to join with him and therefore sent colonel strachan with a choice party of the best horse they had to make all possible haste toward him and to prevent the insurrections which they feared would be in several parts of the highlands and within few days after lieutenant general lesly followed with a stronger party of horse and foot the encouragement the marquis received from his friends and the unpleasantness of the quarters in which he was prevailed with him to march with these few troops more into the land and the highlanders flocking to him from all quarters made him undervalue any enemy who he thought was yet like to encounter him and the marquis being without any body of horse to discover the motion of an enemy but depending upon all necessary intelligence from the affections of the people strachan made such haste toward him that he was within a small distance of him before he heard of his approach and those highlanders who had seemed to come with much zeal to him whether terrified or corrupted left him on a sudden or threw down their arms so that he had none left but a company of good officers and five or six hundred foreigners dutch and germans with these he betook himself to a place of some advantage by the inequality of the ground and there they made a defense for some time with notable courage but the enemy being so much superior in number the common soldiers being all foreigners after about a hundred of them were killed upon the place threw down their arms and the marquis seeing all lost threw away his ribband and george and found means to change his clothes with a fellow of the country and so after having gone on foot two or three miles he got into a house of a gentleman mleod of assint mercurius politicus ad annum       where he remained concealed about two days but whether by the owner of the house or any other way the marquis was discovered and became their prisoner and was the next day or soon thereafter delivered to the general who was come up with his forces and had now nothing left to do but to carry him in triumph to edinburgh  when he came to one of the gates of edinburgh he was met by some of the magistrates to whom he was delivered and by them presently put into a new cart purposely made in which there was a high chair or bench upon which he sat that the people might have a full view of him being bound with a cord drawn over his breast and shoulders and fastened through holes made in the cart when he was in this posture the hangman took off his hat and rode himself before the cart in his livery and with his bonnet on the other officers who were taken prisoners with him walking two and two before the cart in this manner he was carried to the common goal and received and treated as a common malefactor  within two days after he was brought before the parliament where the chancellor made a very bitter and virulent speech against him told him he had broken all the covenants by which the nation stood obliged and had impiously rebelled against god the king and the kingdom that he had committed many horrible murders treasons and impieties for all which he was now brought to suffer condign punishment with all those reproaches says my author against his person and his actions which the liberty of that place gave him leave to use  permission was then given him to speak and without the least trouble in his countenance or disorder upon all the indignities he had suffered he told them since the king had owned them o far as to treat with them he had appeared before them with reverence and bare headed which otherwise he would not willingly have done that he had done nothing of which he was ashamed or had cause to repent that the first covenant he had taken and complied with it and with them who took it as long as the ends for which it was ordained were observed but when he discovered which was now evident to all the world that private and particular men designed to satisfy their own ambition and interest instead of considering the public benefit and that under the pretense of reforming some errors in religion they resolved to abridge and take away the kings just power and lawful authority he had withdrawn himself from that engagement that for the league and covenant he had never taken it and therefore could not break it and it was now too apparent to the whole christian world what monstrous mischiefs it had produced that when under color of it an army from scotland had invaded england in assistance of the rebellion that was then against their lawful king he had by his majestys command received a commission from him to raise forces in scotland that he might thereby divert them from the other odious persecution that he had executed that commission with the obedience and duty he owed to the king and in all the circumstances of it had proceeded like a gentleman and had never suffered any blood to be shed but in the heat of the battle and that he saw many persons there whose lives he had saved that when the king commanded him he laid down his arms and withdrew out of the kingdom which they could not have compelled him to have done he said he was now again entered into the kingdom by his majestys command and with his authority and what success soever it might have pleased god to have given him he would always have obeyed any commands he should have received from him he advised them to consider well of the consequence before they proceeded against him and that all his actions might be examined and judged by the laws of the land or those of nations  as soon as he had ended his discourse he was ordered to withdraw and after a short space was again brought in and told by the chancellor that he was on the morrow being the one and twentieth of may    0 to be carried to edinburgh cross and there to be hanged up on a gallows thirty foot high for the space of three hours and then to be taken down and his head to be cut off upon a scoffold and hanged on edinburgh tolboth his legs and arms to be hanged up in other public towns of the kingdom and his body to be buried at the place where he was to be executed except the kirk should take off his excommunication and then his body might be buried in the common place of burial and it is admirable to consider with what magnanimity and firmness of soul he heard the judgment that condemned him to be quartered concerning which he said to the chancellor that pronounced it that he was prouder to have his head set upon the place it was appointed to be than he could have been to have had his picture hang in the kings bedchamber that he was so far from being troubled that his four limbs were to be hanged in four principal cities of the kingdom that he heartily wished he had flesh enough to be sent to every city in christendom as a testimony of the cause for which he suffered  he desired after the sentence to have said somewhat to the parliament but was not suffered and so was carried back to prison and the next day every part and circumstance of the sentence was executed upon him with all the inhumanity imaginable and he bore it with all the courage and magnanimity and the greatest piety that a good christian could manifest when he had ended all he had to say and was expecting to expire they acted yet one scene more of their barbarity upon him the hangman brought the book that had been published of his truly heroic actions whilst he commanded in the kingdom which together with his declaration was tied in a small cord that was put about his neck at this new instance of their malice the marquis smiled and thanked them for it and said he was glad it should be there and was prouder of wearing it than ever he had been of the garter and so renewing some devote ejaculations he patiently endured the last act of the executioner  thus died the gallant marquis of montrose after he had given says the earl of clarendon in his character of him as great a testimony of loyalty and courage as a subject can do and performed as wonderful actions in several battles upon as great inequality of numbers and as great disadvantages in respect of arms and other preparations for war as have been performed in this age and he adds that montrose was in his nature fearless of danger and never declined any enterprise for the difficulty of going through with it but exceedingly affected those which seemed desperate to other men and did believe somewhat to be in himself above other men which made him live more easy toward those who were or were wiing to be inferior to him toward whom he exercised wonderful civility and generosity than with his superiors or equals he was naturally jealous and suspected those who did not concur with him in the way not to mean so well as he he was not without vanity but his virtues were much superior and he well deserved to have his memory preserved and celebrated amongst the most illustrious persons of the age in which he lived  his body was interred at the place of execution where it rested till the restoration of the king that by his majestys special appointment his scattered parts were gathered together and deposited in the abbeychurch of holyroodhouse where it remained till the   th of may      his corpse was with the greatest magnificence and solemnity that could be devised carried to the cathedral

southesk by whom he had james his son and heir  this noble lord was too young to have had a part in the war under his father after whose death being divested of his estate he lived quietly and privately under the powers that then prevailed retaining his affection and fidelity to the crown which he made manifest in performing all the offices of fidelity and duty to the king throughout the whole course of the usurpation that a generous and worthy person could find any opportunity for with which his majesty was abundanty satisfied and pleased  upon the return of the king the marquis was restored to his estate and the act of his fathers forfaulture repelled and he was named one of the lords of his majestys privy council but that which was thought strange and administered much discourse both then and afterward was that his lordship was not preferred to any of the great offices of the crown considering the transcendent merit of his father and the great value and esteem the king had of himself as a nobleman of great honor and integrity but the reason i have ever heard assigned for it was that the marquis did not affect any public character a life of privacy and quiet being really his own choice and what was more suited to his humor and nature and dying in the month of february in the      charta in cancellaria s d n r  was upon the   d of of april thereafter interred at the chapel of aberruthven in perth shire where the bones of his ancestors were committed to their rest and his funeral sermon was preached by dr alexander burnet then archbishop of glasgow

immediate and eminent care made him first captain of the guard and then that he might fit him by degrees for the greatest trust and employments preferred him to be president of the privy council but death overtook him not long thereafter in the prime of his years upon the   th of april      charta in cancellatia s d n r data   d february   0   to the general regret of the whole nation and the particular sorrow of his own relations who lamented his death exceedingly as a great loss to his family by christian his wife daughter of john duke of rothes he had only a son james the present duke of montrose  this noble lord being a person of very bright and distinguishing parts and the head of a very noble family that had in no time swerved in its fidelity to the crown her majesty queen anne

crown of this realm in consideration whereof as well as in respect of his lordships personal merit and in honor of his noble family for which the queen did always prosess a very great value and regard her majesty was pleased by letters patent   th of april   0  to make the marquis duke of montrose ibidem  and it is to be observed as a special instance of her majestys more immediate favou that the honor was not restricted to the heirs male of the dukes own body but was to descend to his heirs of entail  his grace continued lord president of the council till the parliament of great britain

privy seal in his place  the dukes firm and inviolable adherence to the protestant succession which his grace had so early and with so much zeal maintained and asserted could not fail to entitle him to a more than ordinary favor of the illustrious family in whom the right was established by law and therefore when the successor his electoral highness the duke of brunswick was by act of parliament

earl thought by this favor to bring the earl of morton over to his interest but he soon found himself mistaken for though he had all duty and gratitude to him as a friend yet the wicked earl bothwel did no sooner propose to him the design and craved his assistance toward the murder of the lord darnly the queens husband as a piece of service which would be very acceptable to her majesty but he conjured him to lay side the thoughts of so base and unworthy an enterprise and which would be attended with so much infamy and danger and when he could not prevail in that point in testimony he did abhor so detestable a design he left the court and retired to the country when that bloody and barbarous tragedy was to be acted and i think the earl of mortons circumstances at this time cannot but be pitied for if he had revealed the earl of bothwels design of taking away the kings life it had cost him his own and his concealing it then brought him to die upon a scaffold many years thereafter  after the murder of king henry when the nation both protestants and papists began to be alarmed with the queens marriage with the earl of bothwell who was shrewdly suspected as the murderer of her former husband and the danger the young prince was in by such an union the earl of morton was one of the most forward among the nobility who entered into an association for the preservation of the prince and when the queen resigned the government to the end her son might be invested in the sovereignty the earl of morton took the coronation oath for the infant king at his inauguration on the   th of july       in this new turn of affairs the earl of mortons share was so considerable that as soon as the earl of murray had accepted the regency the earl of morton was declared chancellor upon the removal of the earl of huntly who adhered to the queen and made heritable lord high admiral of scotland and sheriffprincipal of edinburghshire charta penes comitem de morton ad annum    0  he held

here enter upon the detail of the earl of mortons administration during his regency that would not consist with the brevity of this work and generally his proceedings are complained of on one side or commended on the other as opinions and party lead men to i shall only take notice that the first motion he made to resign the government in the      was accepted in a general convention of the nobility wherein it was agreed to that the young king should take upon him the administration when he was not full thirteen years of age and yet the new court kept fair with the earl for they procured a parliament to be called wherein the late regent obtained a remission and exoneration during his regency in the most ample manner he himself could devise and after that he played his game so well that he was in a short time again made president of the council and was in great credit with his majesty melvils memoirs  but that being what was not at all acceptable to the other party who had the young king in their hands and who were willing to be rid of the earl of morton at any rate for that end sir john mattland and sir robert melvil his professed enemies brought about his ruin by pushing on captain james stewart the lord ochiltrees son to accuse him as accessory to the murder of the kings father which the captain did before the council where the earl himself was present on the   st of december    0 whereupon he was committed prisoner to the castle of edinburgh and was thence sent under a strong guard to dunbarton from whence he was on the first of june thereafter brought to his trial at edinburgh and being found guilty by his peers of art and part in the murder of the kings father in so far as he had concealed and not revealed it when the earl of bothwell proposed it to him he was condemned to be hanged drawn and quartered which the king was pleased to mitigate so far that instead of being hanged he had the favor to be beheaded which was accordingly execute on him at the cross of edinburgh on the  d of june       upon the death and forfaulture of the regent the title of earl of morton was bestowed upon the lord maxwell but his majesty having recalled and revoked that deed and being further willing and desirous that all animosities and grounds of contention among the nobility might be removed for that end a parliament was called in the      wherein his majesty passed an act of oblivion whereby every body who had been forfaulted during the troubles in the kings minority were indemnified except such as had been accessory to his fathers murder and though the earl of morton had been convicted of that crime and suffered for it yet his majesty considering bona fidelia gratuita servitia nobis facta per quondam comitem de morton in gubernatione and

recalling that deed she was afterward graciously pleased to bestow the earldom of murray upon james prior of st andrews  he was the natural son of king james v by margaret daughter of john lord erskine who being by the care of his father as of all the rest of his illegitimate sons were bred to the church he was when very young provided to the priory of st andrews anno      then void by the promotion of patrick hepburn to the episcopal see of murray but by reason of his nonage dr alexander miln abbot of cambuskenneth and president of the college of justice was appointed administrator of the benefice charta in pub arch  both with respect to the spiritual and temporal discharge of the function  by reason of the priors youth i have met with nothing memorable of him till the beginning of the reformation he was among the first who embraced the protestant reformed religion thohe was far from giving any countenance to the popular reformation as is manifest from the many and frequent addresses he and others of the protestant nobility made to the queen regent that she would please to concur by her authority in reforming of the church  but the queen peremptorily refusing not only to comply with their supplications but having also violated some articles of pacification she had very solemnly entered into with the protestant lords of which the prior of st andrews himself stood guarantee he thereupon left her and joined himself with the lords of the congregation as they were called whereupon the prior the lord james was summoned before the council but he did not think fit to answer the charge otherwise than to return this answer to the messenger that her majesty had broken the conditions with the lords of the congregation which by warrant from herself he had made and entered into with them he would have no more meddling in such dishonest courses and would do the best to repair things he could this answer gave occasion to the queen to signify to the prior that she suspected that religion was the least thing he or his party had in their thoughts and that she did not doubt but that under the covert and pretext of religion he intended to make an attempt upon the crown the prior in the mean time disowns the charge and thought himself obliged for his further vindication to make a very solemn protestation that he had no other view or design in what he had done than the advancement of the true reformed religion and the preservation of the liberties of his country which he could not but bewail he saw so signally invaded by her at least by those who pretended to act by and derive their authority from her after which he was so hearty a promoter of the reformation that he became the head of the protestant party  when queen mary became a widow by the death of king francis ii the prior of st andrews was sent by the protestant nobility to invite the queen home and soon after her arrival her majesty having named a new privy council the lord james her brother was appointed one of the number and not long thereafter he was sent with a commission of lieutenancy to the borders to suppress an insurrection that was threatened in those parts and he discharged the trust reposed in him with such courage and fidelity that upon his return the queen was graciously pleased to bestow upon her brother the earldom of mar then in the crown but the lord erskine being found to have right to the earldom of mar that lord was by way of justice restored to that honor in lieu whereof the prior of st andrews was made earl of murray  0th february      charta in pub arch   after this the earl continued in the greatest favor with the queen without any interruption till the      that her majesty declared her resolution to marry the lord darnly that my lord murray and many others did oppose the match upon pretext of the danger that might arise to religion and to the state by that union forasmuch as it had not been practiced at any time to impose a king upon the nation without the advice and consent of parliament and in order to put a more effectual stop thereto they made says sir james melvil an essay to take the lord darnly in the queens company at the raid of both and as they alleged to have sent him to england but sailing in their enterprise they were so closely pursued by the queens troops that they thought it the safest course for them to flee to england where they met but with a very cold reception from queen elizabeth though she had very much encouraged them underhand to enter into those measures to disturb the peace and tranquillity of scotland and to fully the glory of queen marys reign  after the queens marriage with the lord darnly a parliament was called before which the earl of murray and his associates were summoned to answer a charge of high treason which was prepared against them and the earl would have undoubtedly been denounced rebel and forfaulted had not the murder of david rizio prevented it which happened three days before the sitting down of the parliament at the day appointed the earl of murray returned home and went straight to the parliament house and took instruments that he was ready to answer the summons of treason but such was the confusion of affairs that no evidence came against him and the queen believing him innocent of rizios murder was pleased to give him a gracious pardon restore him to her wonted favor and to place an unsuspected confidence in him but the broils of the country still increasing more and more especially after the murder of the lord darnly he obtained the queens leave to travel which he did first into england and thence into france where he remained till the queen had made a resignation of the government and the prince king james vi her son set upon the throne that he was called hom to be regent to the young king to which office he was chosen by those of the nobility who adhered to the prince in his absence on the   d of august      in december thereafter he called a parliament wherein the popes authority was abolished and the true protestant religion received a new sanction thereafter having settled the government and seeming secure in it he was on the   d of january    0 unexpectedly as he was riding through the street of linlithgow far from apprehending any danger shot from a window with a musket in the lower part of his belly by james hamilton of bothwelhaugh in revenge of a private injury the regent had done him and in the instant falling from his horse died the same evening few days after his body was removed to edinburgh and with great funeral solemnity interred in st giless church where a monument was erected over his grave with this inscription upon it pietas sine vindice luget jus exarmatum est januarii    0 jacobo

tutor and faithful friend draws a very fair and bright one of him and some later writers whose pens perhaps have been directed as much by malice as truth have endeavored to give the world a very ill impression of him and i observe that generally men pass their judgments upon him according to the party they are of for these reasons i shall not take his character from any party writer either of the one or the other side and therefore shall rather choice to recite that given by bishop spotiswood than add any of my own his death says that reverend author was by all men greatly lamented especially by the commons who loved him as their father whilst he lived and now murnd grievously at his death the great things he had wrought in his life having in the space of one year and little more quieted the state which he found broken and disordered made his very enemies speak of him with praise and commendation above all his virtues which were not a few he shined in piety toward god ordering himself and his family in such sort as it did more resemble a church than a court for therein besides the exercise of devotion which he never omitted there was no wickedness to be seen nay not an uneemly wanton word to be heard a man truly good and worthy to be ranked among the best governors that this kingdom has enjoyed and therefore to this day is honored with the title of the good regent  the regent married agnes daughter of william earl marischal by whom he had two daughters margaret countess of murray the heir of his honor and estate and mary married to francis earl of errol  which margaret was married with james stewart lord down who in right of her his wife became earl of murray he was a person of great parts magnanimity and courage nota the lord downs paternal ancessor was

son who married the countess of murray as above henry lord st colm and two daughters mary married to sir john weems of thatilk and jean to simon lord lovat and wanted nothing but age and experience to have rendered him a most accomplished nobleman upon some matters of interest there fell a misunderstanding betwixt him and the earl of hantly which grew into such an animosity between them that the king very much apprehended the danger of those divisions there having been some blood shed and men killed upon their private contests so that the country was passionately divided between them his majesty therefore in order to settle the whole dispute upon the hearing all that could be said by either party and being desirous to accommodate the matter himself caused summon them before the council and both the earls obeying the charge it was determined that the earl of huntly should be ordered home to the country and my lord murray to stay at court for some time but asson says sir james melvil as huntly went home he triumphed and took sundry advantages upon the earl of murray s lands giving him just cause of complaint and murray after sundry representations getting no redress he retired himself from the court and became so malecontent that he took plain part with the earl of bothwell wh had attempted to seize upon the kings person at his palace of holyroodhouse in order to oblige his majesty to receive him into favor the earl of huntly being advertised continues my author that his adversary murray was an outlaw with the earl of bothwell he returned to court to get some advantage of him but in the mean time the lord ochiltree endeavoring to agree them with consent of his majesty in order thereto drew the earl of murray to dunibirsel a seat of his own in fife to be near hand that conditions and articles might be added and pared at the pleasure of their friends the earl of huntly being made privy to murray s coming to dunibirsel obtained incontinently a commission to pursue the earl of bothwell and all his partakers whereupon with an armed force consisting most of his own vassals and retainers he unexpectedly beset the house of dunibirsel and upon the earls refusing to surrender himself to huntly the house was set on fire notwithstanding the earl made his way through the flames and also bravely through his more merciless enemies and had so far succeeded in his escape that he was got fairly out of their hands and had concealed himself among the rocks by the sea but the tip of his headpiece which had taken fire before he left the house

routed at dunbar yet his reputation was so entire as an officer of great experience and the king thought him so faithful to him and worthy of any trust or command he should confer on him that as soon as another army was raised to march into england with the king of which his majesty was himself general he appointed lieutenant general lesly lieutenant general under him and though neither in the march nor yet in the fatal day at worcester did he perform the office of a general with that vigor and spirit as he had done formerly on other occasions yet the king did not believe he had been false to him for upon all the enquiries that were afterward made when most of the false and treacherous actions which had been committed were discovered there appeared no cause to suspect that the lieutenant general had been unfaithful in his charge and as it was not a little vindication to him that from the time of his imprison meant that he was taken after worcester till the restoration of the king he never received any favor from the english parliament nor from cromwell but underwent the same hardships and severities the most loyal of his countrymen suffered clarendons hist of the

marks of our favor and esteem yet seeing we are told that malice and slander do not give over to persecute you we have thought fit to give you this further testimony and to declare under our hand that while ye was our lieutenant general of our army of scotland you did both in scotland and england behave yourself with als much conduct resolution and honesty as was possible or could be expected from

ochiltree a very hopeful young nobleman who died about the age of sixteen at the university of eainburgh the   th of february      with many circumstances of regret of which this was not the least that with him did the honor of this illustrious family expire and come to an end i have been told by some who knew this lord ochltree that he was a most hopeful scholar a great friend to the muses and there are some fragments of his poetical fancy extant which very much discover the excellency of his genius that way  oliphant lord oliphant the ancestor of this ancient family david de oliphard was one of those barons who accompanied king david i to england with an army to the assistance of maude the empress his niece against king stephen of whom it is memorable that after the raising of the siege of winchester in the      king david was so closely pursued that he was in a very great hazard of being made a prisoner had it not been for the singular valor of this noble person who had the honor to rescue and bring off the king his sovereign to his immortal honor dalrymples collections p      this piece of signal and eminent service was enough to entitle him to a more than ordinary share of that good kings favor who with out doubt rewarded him according to his merit and that he was much about him afterward in some office of trust or attendance appears from the frequency of his being found witnessing the deeds of that prince to many religious places he is witness to the kings grants to coldingham and dunfermling  particularly in one to the prioy o  whereto his seal is appendd which by the bearing thereupon viz  crescents clearly prove him to be the ancestor of this noble family who still bear the same figures in their ensigns armorial  another david de oliphard perhaps the son of the former david was no less the favorite of king malcolm and king william than his predecessor had been of king david in a charter by king malcolm to the monks of scoon he david de

oliphard his son who in the  th of king william was one of the hostages given for the ransom of the said king when he was taken prisoner by the english at the battle of alnwick on the   th of july

scotland required upon his alledgance to attend him in person with his men horse and arms to go over with him to france in order to assist him in the recovering of his province of gascony rymers

london where he remained till the      he was liberated upon condition to return by a certain day prefixed and withal to stay no longer at home than was necessary to put himself in equipage to attend and serve king edward in the army he designed to employ against france but i have all the reason in the world to believe he had little regard to the promise he had made for as soon as he came home he heartily and personally engagd himself in the war against king edward for recovering the honor and freedom of his country which that prince had so signally invaded and thereafter when the english invaded scotland in   0  sir william olyfend was appointed governor of stirlingcastle which he defended with great resolution and courage for the space of three months notwithstanding the english

well known did make a division of his estate among three of his sons the bulk whereof together with the title of earl he made over with consent of king james iii to william sinclair the eldest son of

the present earl of panmure and the other branches of that most noble family  maule earl of panmure boethius and some other historians of the scots nation do reckon that the first ancestor of this ancient and noble family came from hungary to scotland in the reign of king malcolm iii in the retinue of edward the outlaw of england and of margaret his sister thereafter queen of scotland but as this assertion of mr boiss is without authority or even so much as probability so i rather incline with some modern antiquaries who have enquired with great curiosity into the origin and progress of sirnames among us to think the first ancestor of the maules to have come from france and extracted from the noble family of de maulia so called from a fair lordship of that name in the duchy of nor mandy the first of whom i have found using the surname was petrus de maulia filtus ansoldi filit guarini who gave anno  0   to the monks of uttica the churches of st mary st vincent and st germain in villa quae nuncupatur maulia for the salvation of his soul odericus vitalis in his ecclesiastical history book v printed in andrew du chynes collecton of the norman writers  according to the devotion of these times when good works were believed to be meritorious with almighty god and departing this life in january   0  ibidem  was interd in the cloister of uttica with an epitaph over his grave of

ansold theobald guarin and william  which ansold was a very warlike man and did eminently signalize himself in the wars of italy ibidem  particularly in the battle where alexius the emperor of constantinople received a signal overthrow likeas in   0  he ratified to the monastry of uttica the rights his father had made to that church and afterward retiring from the world for the better disposing himself as he thought to devotion he took upon him the habit of a monk of st bennet in that cloister where he ended his days not long after and was there interred with this epitaph upon his tomb writ by odo of monstrewel si quis erit si scire velit dum vivus adesset quis fuerat quem tumba tegit quod nomen haberet ansoldi nomen suit huic and militis omen etc   by oldenine his wife daughter of radulphus de malevicine he had seven sons petrus radulphus guarinus liscardus guido ansoldus and hugo  which petrus de maulia married addo daughter of the count de ghisne but being a turbulent man louis the gross king of france for his insolent demeanor demolished his castle and deprived him of his lordship of maulta and though he was afterward so far reconciled to his prince as that he accompanied him to the battle of breunivil against henry i of england in the     ibidem  yet for what i have found he never recovered so much favor as to be restored to the possession of his estate and it is highly probable at least much more so than boethius story that upon the falling low of the family of de maulia in france a branch of them was transplanted to stland in the time of king david i whoe bounty and generosity we know was not confined to his own subjects but was also very liberally extended to foreigners of birth and merit who were willing to put themselves under his protection for in the end of that reign william de mulia is witness in a donation by prince hnry of the lands of clerkingtoun to the church of haddingtoun regsters of the priory of st andrews  but

lands of brakis and bothmernock to the monks of arbroth ibidem and chartul of arbroth in the lawyers library  in the tenement of panmure for the salvation of their souls as appears from a

this loyal gentleman was after this under no necessity of ever appearing in any public action by virtue of the kings dispensation yet he no sooner saw his country threatened with danger by party and faction after the death of king james v than at the command of the regent the earl of arran he raised his vassals and reainers joined the lord gray and others and attacked the town of perth which the

to the satisfaction of the governor mr maules hist ms  at the same time the lord of panmure was a strenuous opposer of the intended match betwixt queen mary and edward vi of england from an apprehension his country might suffer not only in its freedom and independency but also in its other valuable privileges by such an union so that when the war broke out betwixt the two nations on the breach of the articles that had been formerly agreed to and on which ensued the battle of pinky panmures affections being known that way the english governor of bruchty detached a strong party from the garrison to seize and apprehend him in his own house and notwithstanding of the surprise yet a very noble and brisk defense was made within and the old gentleman himself received diverse wounds

did then politically release all the scots prisoners of note and character in hopes to engage them to promote the union he designed of the two kingdoms by the marriage of his son prince edward and queen mary but though the lord of panmure had a very grateful sense of the favor that prince had done him yet it had never the least influence on him to engage him in any interest or party that proved

those parts had not the afflicted circumstances of his family called him to return home with the queens permission so that he was not at the fight of corichy which happened soon thereafter but her majesty did not want any further testimony of his loyalty having been fully satisfied in his fidelity and affection to the crown by many repeated instances through the whole course of his life before  when the troubles broke out in this reign he did not meddle much with either party but kept himself as much if not more out of the broils of the times than any other of his quality in the kingdom for in all the public transactions during the course of the war i dont find him ever concerned in any public deed save in that association  bond at gasgow now printed which was entered into in the year of

greatest promoters of the reformation but even by others of the nobility and gentry who were of the roman religion and afterward adhered to the queen with great firmness and fidelity which gives me ground to believe they were not then thoroughly acquainted with the circumstances by which the dimission was extorted from her otherwise i cannot think that men of honor could have shifted as so many

of the noble family of which he was a son and in which no doubt there were several great men as also another treatise de antiquitate gentis scotorum in a tolerable pure latin style which he says was written contra anglorum calumnias and mendacia and seems to be plainly levelled against the english antiquary mr cambden who about that time i think had published his britannia wherein he asserts some things that the scots antiquaries were mightily displeased with and none more than commissar maule who was one of the most strenuous asserters of the freedom and independency of scotland and among the first who attacked cambden in which he was seconded by mr hume of godscroft and afterward by the learned mr drummond of hawthornden beside other very judicious remarks on the history of his country i observe from the little i have seen of mr maules m s that he has happily hit upon a better notion of the ancient culdees than any author before him and when i have occasion to peruse more of his book in relation to that matter i shall not fail to do his memory all imaginable justice and frankly own the helps i had from him in a dissertation concerning the culdees i have by me and which i intend

make so great an appearance as some of his predecessors it being a time of profound peace he lived in tho we cannot say what figure he might have made had he had any opportunity to exert himself in the service of his country in the wars against the english but then all national animosities were outwardly removed by the union of the crowns in the person of king james vi of glorious memory who before the time of his accession to the english crown as a mark of his favor to the lord of panmure did make him heretable bailiff of the barony of barry an office his ancestors had exerced by commission from the abbots of balmerino or others who had that abbacy in commendam and which office his successors enjoy heretably to this time and dying the first of may   0  charta penes comitem de

patrick being a person of good parts and qualities and of a family which had always been firm to the crown in his youth betook himself to the court of king james and being of a pleasant humor and disposition of a notable affability in his behavior and well qualified by his breeding for any service his master should think fit to employ him in he quickly grew to be very acceptable to the king and into a general esteem with the court insomuch as his majesty in a short time made him one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber about the time or a little after his entrance to england in   0  and as he attended his majesty into that kingdom so he lived upon his own fortune without any other support than the profits of his place and his majestys favor mr maule lived always decently and in a fair intelligence with the favorites having always credit enough to provide for his own interest without troubling himself with that of other men and that which made him exceedingly beloved in the court was that he never desired to get that for himself which others labored for but was ever ready to use his interest with his master to promote the pretenses of worthy men as this his behavior made him many friends so few or none had the confidence to avow themselves to be his enemies and as he had always a full share in his majestys esteem and favor who looked on him as a wise and faithful servant so he was graciously pleased to give many testimonies thereof particularly in a new charter to him under the great seal of his ancient barony of panmure in    0 the narrative bears the grant to be made by his majesty i consideration of the good loyal and acceptabe service done and performed to us by our entirely beloved familiar faithful and domestic servant patrick maule of panmure one of the gentlemen of our bedchamber in his faithful and diligent attendance upon our royal person for these many years past even from his youth and his ready disposition and capacity to do us all laudable service at all times and on all occasions as he shall be commanded by us of which his most faithful and acceptable service we have full and sufficient experience moreover in the new gift of the same charter whereby the king dispones to him the patronage of the church of panbride his majesty declares his motive to the grant to be upon his own sufficient experience of the wisdom dicretion and judgment of the said patrick maule of panmure and his prudent management of his own affairs and of the ardent zeal and affection which he has for the propagation of the gospel  for king james was ever most solicitous after the restoring of episcopacy to have the laick patronages in the hands of such persons as were friends to the church as then established by law and his son king charles of ever blessed memory who did not come short of his royal father but rather exceeded him in his zeal for the church being fully satisfied of mr maules affection that way and of his unblemished integrity in the protestant religion his majesty gave his royal consent and approbation to the transaction which passed betwixt him and the earl of dysart by which he purchased the abbacy of aberbrothock which was

maule of panmure lived in the greatest favor and esteem with king james who had always a very good opinion of him so at his death he commended him to his son king charles as a person to be relied on in honor and fidelity of which that prince himself was also very well satisfied and pleased for he not only continued him in his bedchamber but made him also sheriffprincipal of forfarshire when the crown acquired the hereditary right of that office from the family of gray in      charta in rotulis caroli i ad annum      the king always lodging these new acquired jurisdictions in the hands of such persons as he could confide in  when the troubles broke out mr maule being a person of most eminent affection and of entire devotion to the crown adhered to the king with great honor and fidelity was with him in all the battles in which his majesty was engaged in his own royal person and thereafter went with him to oxford where he stayed till the first war was brought to an end by his majestys putting himself in the scots army before newark  as soon as it was known where the king was mr maule repaired to him and waited on him thence to newcastle when his majesty thought fit to put a lasting mark of his favor on his old faithful servant and made him a peer by the title of earl of panmure august  d      charta penes comitem de panmure  with as great circumstances of grace and favor as could be expressed for in the preamble to the patent his majesty was graciously pleased to call to remembrance his lordships services to his father and his fidelity to himself which he declared in these words whereas we have particular knowledge of the long and faithful service of our well beloved patrick maule baron of panmure one of the gentlemen of our bedchamber both in the reign of our most dear father of ever blessed memory and also ever since our accession to the throne now these one and twenty years by a close adherence to our sacred person and seeing we are most ready to bestow some mark of our royal favor on the said patrick now that he is turning old know ye therefore that we have created etc  thereafter when the king was delivered up by the scots army to such persons whom the english parliament had appointed to receive him the earl of panmure attended on his majesty to holmby in northamptonshire and tho the parliaments commissioners had declared that his majesty should be treated with all demonstration of respect and duty and waited on by such of his servants as he should appoint yet he had not continued there many days before the parliament gave orders to dismiss such of his servants as were there and had waited on him at oxford and tho the demand was very grating to the king journal by the earl of panmure of what passed during his lordships attendance on his majesty at holmb penes comitem de panmure  yet that he might not seem to refuse to give them satisfaction in any thing they required he yielded to their desire but in the instant they were to be discharged the king signified that it would be well pleasing to him that the commissioners would allow only two of his old trusty servants to attend him and this he would look upon as a testimony of their respect to him which being granted his majesty was pleased to pitch upon the earl of panmure and the earl of dirletoun both the earls being persons in whom his majesty had an absolute confidence and that he was sure neither of them would either deceive or betray him the earl of panmure was with his majesty when cornet joice came on the  d of june      with a troop of horse and violently seized on the kings person and carried him from holmby to the army and after to hampton court his lordship having liberty to attend his master in all the removes he made which was to his majestys great satisfaction and tho at first the king enjoyed himself much more having the liberty of his own servants than he had before when he was at homby yet alas it was not long before the chief officers of the army seemed more regardless of the king and treated his servants with less civility insomuch as his majesty from an apprehension they had some secret design upon his life made his escape upon the   th november      from hampton court clarendons history of the rebellion  and unhappily went to the island of wight which proved so fatal to him thither his lordship so soon as he had intelligence where the king was gone repaired to him having no reason to doubt but that his presence would be very acceptable to his master journal by the earl of panmure while his lordship waited on the king during his imprisonment  and his lordship attended in his office in the bedchamber till his majesty having refused to give his royal assent to the four bills the parliament had then sent to him which he said did divest him of all sovereignty that colonel hamond the governor of the place by order from his masters caused all the kings servants to be immediately put out of carisbrook castle and forbid any of them to repair thither any more upon their peril clarendons history of the rebellion  whereupon the earl after the king had used many gracious expressions of his lordships faithful services kissed his majestys hands and took a sad farewell of his master appearing to have little hope ever to see him again in this world and departing for scotland lived quietly at his own house in the country keeping his heart and affections always entire for the king  after the murder of his majesty and the total suppression of the royal cause tho the earl of panmure was very aged and so out of capacity himself to have appeared in any action for the kings service yet when cromwell prevailed and got himself made protector that archtyrant and traitor did by an ordinance of his council very arbitrarily impose a fine on the earl of panmure of  0000 lib sterling printed ordinance of cromwells council in      penes me  for no other reason but his being a person of known loyalty and having his sons engaged in the kings service  after which he lived with ease and plenty in his fortune which was very great and in great reputation with all those who wished well to the crown the restoration of which as no man more heartily wished so he had the comfort of seeing it brought about by a most surprising act of providence when there appeared least hope of it and least worldly means to bring it to pass which was the thing his lordship had longed most passionately to see before he should leave the world he died on the   d of december      and was interred in the vault of his family at panbride church with his ancestors  this noble earl married three wives first frances daughter of sir edward stanhope of grimstoun of the county of york knight of the same family with the earl of chesterfield in england by whom he had four children viz  george lord brechin his successor in the honor  colonel hary maule of balmakelly who in the end of the reign of king charles i betook himself to the service of the king and had a regiment bestowed on him in the army that was raised in order to redeem his majesty from prison and restore him to his freedom and liberty but being taken prisoner at the battle of preston he found means to make his escape into scotland and with the same affections the colonel engaged again in the service of king charles ii and had the command of a regiment of foot at the unfortunate battle of dunbar where he gained the reputation of a stout and active officer  he married first jean daughter of john earl of weems by whom he had a daughter mary who died at panmure anno      and again margaret a lady of the douglasses of spot by whom he left only one daughter margaret married to alexander cochran of barbachly and had issue and dying in the spring of the year      was on the  th of april register of the church of holyroodhouse interred in the abbay church of holyroodhouse  lady jean eldest daughter to patrick earl of panmure was married to david earl of ethie and northesk and had a numerous issue  lady elizabeth first to john earl of kinghorn ancestor to the present earl of strathmore and again to george earl of linlithgow justicegeneral of scotland in the reign of king charles ii and was mother to three earls viz strathmore linlithgow and calendar  the earl married to his second wife mrs mary waldrum one of the maids of honor to the queen and after that the lady mary erskine daughter of john earl of mar lord hightreasurer of scotland by the lady mary stewart his wife daughter of esme duke of lennox widow of william earl marshal but by neither the other lady nor the countess marshal had he any children that came to age  to patrick earl of panmure succeeded george lord brechin his son this noble lord was too young to be engaged in the war when it first broke out during which time he had his education in france and italy but by the time king charles ii arrived in scotland in    0 pursuant to the treaty of breda his lordship being now of age of parts and undoubted loyalty and affection to the crown waited on his majesty his father the old earl being now struck in years and troubled with the infirmities of age and as soon as the parliament raised an army for the king the lord brechin being a nobleman not only firm to the principles of monarchy but also of great duty and affection to the person of the king heartily engaged in the service himself and endeavored to dispose all those upon whom he had influence to take the same resolutions and it soon appeared his interest in the country was very great for his lordship being appointed colonel of the forfarshie regiment of horse many of the principal gentlemen engaged themselves in the service and came to his regiment out of devotion and respect to his lordship as well as duty to the king and served under him as officers his lordship was at the head of his regiment at the unsuccessful battles of dunbar and inverkeithing at both which he fought with very remarkable courage and at the last of these his regiment behaved so well and suffered so much that he himself was wounded his lieutenant colonel and major and many other of his officers killed and when the action was over his soldiers were so dispersed that scarce sixty of them could ever be got together again but that misfortune did not in the least discourage him from being every way as active and forward again in advancing and conducing all he could toward his majestys service for after the coronation was over in which his lordship assisted as a young peer mr douglasss sermon preached at the coronation of king charles ii first of january    0  when the parliament appointed another army to be raised for the recovery of his other two kingdoms scotland being entirely united in his majestys service no body appeared more forward to advance the work in hand than the lord brechin in order to which his lordship was one of those who met with old general lesly earl of levin and several other peers and officers of note at eliot in augus as a place which was thought very favorable for making levies which they all intended but they had not stayed long there when the lord brechin gave it as his opinion that the place where they were had nothing for defense and advised the general to draw further into the country for their security and told the general that he was not sure that if a detachment from the garrison of dundee should make a brisk attempt they might not be all surprised and taken out of their beds but the general being of another mind his lordship who better knew the country than any of the other lords and so more sensible of the danger to secure himself left the committee and retired to sidlawhills and it was soon evident what the lord brechin had advised was right for the very evening of the day or soon after he had left them the whole committee was surprised and taken prisoners by a strong party of the english and sent to london and committed to the tower where all of them except general lesly underwent a long imprisonment even till the restoration of the king  the lord brechin being at liberty in the hills the loyalists from all quarters resorted to him after the fight of worcester and put themselves under his command and his lordship behaved in that station very worthily and made often skirmishes n b when the government was first alarmed by an insurrection in the south in      so soon as the resolution was declared to raise an army to suppress it they who had the chief direction of affairs did repose such confidence both in the earl of panmnres loyalty and skill in military affairs that he was appointed to command the gentry of forfarshire but the defeat at pentland by general dalziel prevented the raising that or any of the northern counties the peace of the kingdom being thereby secured with the enemy and sometimes with notable advantage and made frequent incursions in the night into the english quarters which gave general monk some trouble but being convinced of the impossibility of keeping up an attempt which at last must prove ruinous to himself and could do the king no service he made his peace with the general next year without any other compliance to the present powers than the laying down his arms and thereupon retired to his own house where he remained quietly prepared and disposed to run the fortune of the crown to which he was most entirely devoted in any other attempt  when the king came home in    0 his lordship repaired to london to congratulate his majesty and the royal family upon their happy restoration and though his majesty received his lordship with a very good countenance yet he was not rewarded with any great dignity or preferment as was expected and with which some others were who had not been so faithful to the king as the earl of panmure but as that was the fate of very many of the loyal party who had served the king with the utmost fidelity as well as his lordship so it was much more to be imputed to the ministry than to the king himself for it is reported that some in great credit with his majesty endeavored to instill into the kings mind a principle that he must prefer his enemies and advance them to gain them to be his friends and for his old friends it was no matter how he used them for they would be so still and indeed it fell out so that very many who had suffered most in their persons and fortunes for the crown were not recompensed upon the restoration according to their merit or considered as they deserved of which number this noble earl i may truly say was one of the most eminent instances which mistaken politic of the then statesmen as it was observed through that whole reign so many great and wise men have thought that its being followed did bring no small prejudice and inconveence to the crown thereafter but notwithstanding his lordship was overlooked as to any preserment yet he did not on that account as many others did oppose himself to the court but in all the parliaments and national conventions which were called while he lived and on which his lordship constantly attended he always distinguished himself by a hearty concurrence in whatsoever was proposed for advancing the honor of the crown and the welfare and happiness of the kingdom which he made manifest by his several speeches whereby he left behind him lasting monuments of his great knowledge in our constitution and laws of his unshaken loyalty to his prince and his entire love to his country insomuch as i have heard some eminent men who were his contemporaries speak of him with great honor as a nobleman in as high reputation for his great abilities and eminent integrity as any man of his time and dying    of march      he was interred at panbride with his ancestors  this noble earl married jean eldest daughter of john earl of lowdoun lord high chancellor of scotland in the reign of king charles i by whom he had three sons and a daughter viz  george lord maule his successor in the honor  james maule of balumby now earl of panmure  hary maule of kelly who in his younger years traveled into foreign parts and spent much of his time at the courts of france and england at the revolution he was a member of the convention of estates which he left when he perceived they would forfeit king james and has never since been concerned in any public affairs having always continued a nonjuror but in his retirement has greatly improved his natural parts by a close application to the history and laws of his country he married first mary daughter of william earl of wigton by henrietta his wife daughter of charles earl of dumfermling lord privy seal in the reign of king charles ii by whom he had george who died an infant james maule esquire william maule esquire and two daughters henrietta who died young and jean he married to his second wife anne daughter of mr patrick lindsay of kilbirny and of margaret his wife daughter

mary maule only daughter of george earl of panmure was married first to charles earl of mar and thereafter to colonel john erskine son of sir charles erskine of alva  george earl of panmure being a young nobleman of very bright and conspicuous parts was by king charles ii when he came to age called to his majestys privy council as he was likewise of the council to king james he married jean only

great loss to his country he was interred in the same vault with his father and grandfather at the church of panbride the estate and honor of the family devolving on  james maule of balumby his brother who alter having passed the course of his studies at home together with his younger brother traveled abroad into foreign parts he served as a volunteer at the siege of luxemburgh where he eminently signalized his courage insomuch as his valor was very particulary taken notice of  upon his accession to the honor he was named one of the lords of his majestys privy council from which he was soon thereafter removed for not complying with the design of the court in taking away the penal laws against popery but though his lordship did always show himself very firm to the protestant interest through the whole of that reign yet in the convention of estates he vigorously appeared for the interest of king james and when the crown was settled on king william and queen mary he left the meeting and has since continued a nonjuror  when the great affair of the union with england came to be considered in the parliament though his lordship did not think fit to qualify himself by taking the oaths enjoined by law to enter his dissent against it in a parliamentary way as a peer yet no body was more heartily averse to it as appeared both from his meeting with the principals of those who were the most zealous opposers of it and in promoting and influencing addresses against it from the places where his interest lay judging it against the honor and interest of the nation and subversive of the sovereignty and fundamental constitution of the kingdom his lordship married the lady margaret third and youngest daughter of william and anne duke and duchess of hamilton but has no

nature his father took great care to breed him in the study of the law and in which he made a very notable progress by an early eminence in practice and learning insomuch as he was by the choice of his majesty king charles i and the full and hearty approbation of the council preferred to be clerk to the privy council on the  d of september      charta penes comitem de rosebery  a place his father had long and worthily filled and the king had so good an opinion of mr primeroses fidelity judgment and discrerion that by a letter under his own royal hand bearing date   th december      he ordered him to transmit to court an account weekly of what was transacted in the council as his father had done and which he continued to do till all private correspondence with his majesty and all about the court was discharged upon the highest penalty during the civil war he was a great loyalist and after the battle of kilsyth repaired to the marquis of montrose at the time when he was joined by diverse of the nobility and officers of state bishop guthrys memoirs page      and continued with him till the unfortunate battle of philiphaugh he was made prisoner and tried and found guilty of high treason by the parliament at st andrews      and though several others who were not more guilty than he were put to death yet by the intercession and interposition of his friends particularly the marquis of argyle who was his ladys near relation his life was sprd yet he continued a prisoner till the marquis of montrose and the committee of estates came to a capitulation whereby the marquis was to depart the kingdom which he did and thereupon several of his friends were set at liberty of which number this worthy person whose memoirs i write was one thereafter when the parliament declared for the king and aisd an army to relieve him when he was a prisoner in the isle of wight no body appeared more forward in a prudent way to advance that enterprise than sir archbald primerose which was afterward very gratefully remembered by the crown upon a more favorable conjuncture  when sir archbald had the honor of knighthood conferred on him i cannot say but i apprehend it was in the end of      when he was set at liberty that he waited on his majesty when he put himself into the hands of the scots army before newark though i have not found him so designed in any write for some time after  sir archbald having continued his faithful services to king charles ii the time he remained in scotland he likewise marched with him into england when his majesty by a patent under his royal hand bearing date at woodhouse in our royal army on the south borders of scotland   st of august      charta penes comitem de rosebery  made him a baronet in consideration of the many good and faithful services performed to us and our royal father of blessed memory in our most special affairs by sir archbald primerose clerk to our privy council and being desirous to gratify the deserving of so faithful a servant with some special mark of our royal favor therefore etc after the defeat at  that the royal party were totally suppressed sir archbald primerose being reckoned among the first form of malignants his estate was not only questrated but even what sm of money could be discovered to be owing him in private hands were discharged to be paid him for sir archbald being a great creditor upon sir john jhston of elphing ouns estate i have seen an order from general disborough straightly inhibiting and discharging sir john to pay to the said sir archbald any sus of money he might be owing him upon his peril  during the remainder of the usurpation sir archbald lived in a private and retired manner till the joyful restoration of the king the he received the reward of his merit for his majesty in august    0 did appoint him lord register of scotland charta penes comitem de rosebery  and one of the senators of the college of justice where he sat many years and discharged the office with great judgment and learning  the great services he did his master the king and his country when he was first made lord register were acknowledged not only by letters under his majestys own royal hand but by several of the great men in england particularly the earl of clarendon then lord chancellor of england who wrote him a very civil letter wherein he has these remarkable words i cannot my lord but congratulate you for the meritorious part you have had in restoring the king and kingdom meaning scotland to its primitive honur and interest ibid  and concluding he says i with the same good spirit may possess you to the end and with the same success while we here endeavor to follow your example which indeed has already been of great use to us  he was a great lover of his country which he alwise manifested for in the matter of the billoting in parliament though he was the parl of middletons friend yet he could never be brought to favor that project but opposed it with all his power which the earl of middleton did not resent against sir archbald well knowing as he himself owns that the lord registers opposing him in the project of the billoting did not proceed from any dislike to his lordships person but from his known principles of moderation and the earl did not only then acknowledge the sincerity of the registers friendship to him but even afterward at a time when professing to be the lord middletons friend was not thought very meritorious  thereafter when the ministry in that reign did as was thought outface the law by many bold pressures upon the subject sir archbald primerose though he was courted to enter into a strict union with them and that on his own terms yet could never be induced to concur in any thing that had not a sufficient foundation in law but rejected all offers that were made for his own private advantage that were not consistent with the good of his country and therefore he joined with those lords who appeared most zealous for the redress of grievances which brought him so much into the jealousy of the courtparty that upon a very trivial account he was together with the duke of hamilton the earls of drumfrieze and kineardine and the lord cochran all in one day turned out of the council but the resentment was carried further against the lord carringtoun and  a charta penes comitem de rosebery many and very powerful efforts were made to get him turned out of his place too but his majesty who had a great esteem of him as a very wise man and very worthy the trust he had reposed in him could not for a long time be prevailed with to hearken to any overture that could be made for his removal till the court party which the king resolved to support did represent that it was necessary to have a person in his post in whom they could confide and that sir archbald being struck in years he himself desired to exchange his office with another of an easier nature and upon this very supposition and on no other consideration did the king give order for his removal from the registers place and at the same time peferd him to be justice general but he continuing still firm to his party the torrent against him ran so high that his majesty who still retained a very great kindness for and esteem of him thought fit at length to take his place from him to which sir george mackenzie of tarbat a person of great honor and worth was preferred the   th of october       thereafter when the differences run high betwixt the two parties the duke of hamilton the marquis of athole and the other lords of that side who desired the grievances of the nation might be redressed humbly petitioned the king for a hearing in his own royal presence that the matters in difference might be more clearly understood and more freely transacted and his majesty having granted their desire thought fit to propose that some fit persons might be allowed to treat with the like number of the other side in such a manner as might best tend to compose all things in a peaceable way and sir archbald primers being looked on as a person of the greatest wisdom and experience and one who thoroughly understood the whole frame and constitution of the government in church and state the duke of hamilton the marquis of athole the earls of cassils perth and kincardine lieutenant general drummond and the lord cochran well knowing how very useful sir archbald would be in the present exigence did all conjunctly write very pressingly that he should hasten up to london to be present at the conference which was to be in his majestys presence and the earl of perth wrote him a most pathetical letter lively representing the dangers which threatened and were like to overwhelm the nation if not prevented by a speedy remedy that now they had an opportunity of making their country happy by removing all grievances if he and others would do their duty and therefore conjured him by many arguments no longer to defer his coming up and concludes with these words my lord you see how scotland is you see how your friends reputation lies at stake you see there is but this pull for it and you see how fairly it lies at your hand the great god direct you toward doing what is for his honor your countrys good the kings interest your friends reputation and your perpetual credit  sir archbald thinking he had now a fair opportunity of advancing the public good and doing all those offices to his country he had ever so earnestly desired and notwithstanding he was stricken in years and troubled with the infirmities of age yet he undertook a journey to london that he might be assisting in carrying on this good work both parties being heard before the king and his majesty finding there could be no compounding this dispute amicably but that one side must be suppressed he resolved therefore in the end by the advice of some in his nearest confidence to dismiss the lords of the country party without a present redress forasmuch as it would reflect dishonor upon his own government if he did not approve of the administration of a great minister whom he had so long employed in his service and solely and entirely trusted in all that related to scotland and scots affairs and now all endeavors for redress of the nations grievances being rendered fruitless and to no effect sir archbald with all convenient expedition set out for scotland and sickning in his return died within a few weeks thereafter on the   th of november       he married first elizabeth daughter of james keith of benholm son

the treasury being turned into commission the duke of queensbery was made president of the council but the measures that were soon after taken at court not suiting with his temper and principles and for his not complying with the project of taking away the penal laws against popery he was in six months thereafter deprived of all public employments and thereafter lived prudently and cautiously

council and lieutenant colonel of a regiment of horse commanded by lieutenant general graham thereafter viscount of dundee and he continued in these posts till the year      about which time he quitted them for ill usage at court and upon the account of the disagreement of his principles with their measures  the revolution then happening to come on he appeared early in it and was by the prince of orange upon his acceptance of the government made colonel of the scots horseguards and at the same time one of the privy council and one of the gentlemen of his majestys bedchamber  in the    0 king william sent him into scotland to command a separate body of troops under lieutenant general mackay two years after he was made one of the lords of the treasury and in the parliament      he was authorized to sit and vote as lord high treasurer his father being then alive and he not a peer could not otherwise sit but as an officer of state which depends on the sovereigns nomination  the duke his father departing this life as aforesaid in      he laid aside all thoughts of military employments quitted the command of the guards and was thereupon made lord privy seal and one of the extraordinary lords of the session  his majesty in   00 was pleased to make him lord high commissioner to represent his royal person in parliament where he held two sessions by virtue of two distinct patents and upon his return to court his majesty on the   th june   0  was pleased to honor the duke with a distinguishing mark of his royal favor for that evening a chapter being held of the most noble order of the garter at kensingtoun where the sovereign was present the duke was then elected a companion of the order and installed at windsor the  0th of july thereafter his grace having served king william as long as he lived with great fidelity her majesty queen anne upon her accssion to the throne first made him secretary of state and entertaining the same just sentiments of his ability and conduct appointed him to be her commissioner to represent her royal person in that session of parliament which met at edinburgh the  th of june   0  but the legality of that session meeting with great opposition from a strong party in the parliament who declared openly that they did not conceive themselves warranted to meet and act in that session as a parliament the duke of hamilton presented a paper which contained the reasons of his dissent which may be seen at large in the history of europe and the memoirs of scotland but is foreign to my purpose to insert it here  and therefore did not only dissent from any thing that should be done or acted therein but withdrew and removed from their attendance wherefore her majesty to quiet the minds of her people was pleased to order the duke to prorogue the parliament which his grace did and thereupon set out for london where he was soon thereafter appointed one of the commissioners upon the part of scotland for treating of an union betwixt both nations but though the commissioners of the respective kingdoms met several times and settled preliminaries on both sides yet upon a more mature deliberation the court concluded that it was not a fit season to promote that business but to suspend the further prosecution of it until a more favorable conjuncture the former parliament being dissolved it was necessary another should be called as had been usual at the entrance of all sovereigns to the crown and therefore her majesty issued out writs for the calling of a new parliament which met according to summons upon the  th of may   0  to which the queen was pleased to honor the duke of queensberry by appointing his grace to represent her royal person as lord high commissioner the parliament being opened with great solemnity they began cheerfully in passing an act recognizing her majestys title to the crown but that unanimity did not long continue among them for a very strong party in the parliament having brought in and carried an act for the security of the kingdom presented it to the lord commissioner for the royal assent but the act of security being transmitted to the court the english ministry were so wholly averse to it and the country party in the parliament of scotland as strenuously insisting to have it pass all the duke could well do in such a conjuncture was to keep it off till he should receive instructions from above which he did with the outmost dexterity till her majesty having declared that some difficulties having fallen in in that affair so much pressed she would take time to consider them before she could be determined to give the royal approbation and therefore ordered the lord high commissioner to adjourn the parliament on the   th of september after they had sat full three months which the lord chancellor did in the usual forms  how great soever these services of the dukes were esteemed to be for a time yet it is certain that in less than a year thereafter upon a change of some measures at court his grace was removed from all public employments except that of one of the extraordinary lords of the session which was for life and of which he could not be deprived  but upon another change at court in the   0  when the duke of argyle was declared commissioner for holding the session of parliament that year the duke of queensbery was made lord privy seal in place of the earl of rothes and one of the commissioners of the treasuy it is foreign to my design to assign the reasons here of the change that was found in the disposition of the english ministry in reference to the act of security which hd passed in the parliament   0  from what it had been in the session before wherein the duke preceded as lord high commissioner however the forementioned act of security put the english ministry under a necessity of effecting the union of the two kingdoms and in order thereto her majesty being impwered by the parliament in   0  did nominate and appoint commissioners to treat with those of england for uniting the two kingdoms of which number the duke of queensberry the lord privy seal was one  the commissioners of both kingdoms having accordingly met at london on the   th of april   0  the preliminaries were easily agreed to on the   th the two succeeding months were taken up in carrying on of the treaty and being much forwarded by her majestys royal presence and recommendation to bring it to a conclusion the articles were completed and signed on the   d of july therefer  though the treaty of union was concluded by the respective commissioners of scotland and england yet it bhooved to be approven and confimed by both parliaments before it could be perfected and the parliament of scotland being to meet for that end the  th of octber the duke of queensberry was pitched on as the fitte person to be her majestys commissioner to bring that great affair about in parliament  so difficult and nice a work as incorporating the two kingdoms could not be effected without very considerable opposition both from within doors and without but his grace being supported by her majestys authority and a fll and hearty concurece of a majority in the parliament who were well affected to the union went on vigorously in the prosecution of his duty and with so much dispatch that the whole treaty was enacted and ratified on the   th of january   0  by the lord commissioner by the touch f the royal scepter in the usual manner  the duke of queensberry having thus concluded the union and surmounted all the difficulties he met in his way to complete it in april thereafter set out for london where he ound that gracious reception from the queen which his eminent services hd deserved and it was but very just that he who had expended so much of his time in the public service should have some suitable compensation and therefore the queen gave him the compliment of a pension of  000 l per annum out of the fost office her majestys goodness and bounty did not stop here seeing she was pleased in may   0  to create him a peer of great britain by the titles of baron rippon maquis of beverly and due of dover which honors were to descend to the earl of solloway his second son  the queen continuing still her royal favors to his grace was pleased on the  th of february   0  to declare in council that by reason of the increase of the public business she thought fit to appoint a  d secretary of state of great britain and having named the duke of queensberry the person he was thereupon sworn into the

an opportunity of doing the justice to this noble family by perusing their writings as i could have wished it cannot be reasonably expected but that my memoirs of the house of rothes should be less

in his accounts of the families he treats of except balquhain whose writs it would appear he had seen and perused the rest especially rothes is such a mass of confused unchronological stuff that no

 and dying anno      left issue by christian de seton his wife  sir george lesly his son and heir who was by king james ii in      raised to the dignity of earl of rothes he married christian daughter of sir walter hallyburton lord of dirletoun charta penes comitem de rothes  by her he had andrew master of rothes who in the lifetime of his father married elizabeth daughter of william earl of orkney and caithness ibidem  and left three sons john who left no issue george who was his grandfathers successor but he dying likewise without any issue male the honor fell to his younger brother william who was slain at pinky leaving issue by margaret his wife daughter of michael balfour of montquhany george his successor and john lesly of parkhill  which george being a nobleman of great wisdom and prudence was much esteemed by king james v who carried him over to france in the      when his majesty was espoused to magdalen a daughter of that crown after whose death during the regency of the duke of chattlerault he was sent ambassador to denmark in which negotiation he behaved himself with great prudence and dexterity and being looked on generally throughout the kingdom as a very wise man he was named one of the commissioners to go to france to the queens marriage with the dauphine where he died at deip on the  th of november      not without suspicion of being poisoned  i am heartily sorry there are not such documents in my hands as should fully enable me to set the marriages of this noble earl in a true light mr lesly gives the preference to lady margaret crichton as the earls first lawful wife though i think his authority is little to be valued for it is clear from a charter of george earl of rothes in the      wherein he gives both nicolas somervel and margaret crichton a liferent out of the same lands mrs somervel is expressly called his wife and is first mentioned before the other lady who is no otherwise designed than by her name though she was of much greater quality of birth than the other yet it is also clear by another charter in the      that lady margaret crichton is designed countess of rothes charta in pub arch ad annum       and then is certainly his lawful wife for the clearing this matter i shall humbly offer my opinion about it from such writs as i have seen relative to it the case i take to have been this the earl of rothes in the heat of youth and without a dispensation according to the rites of the chuch for the earl and the lady were within the forbidden degrees did uncanonically marry lady mary crichton the lord crichtons daughter which then in the construction of the law could not be valid without a dispensation or the children considered as begot in lawful marriage though certainly the earl thought otherwise himself for when norman his son by her was a very young man he put him in fie of his estate and in all the transactions afterward about it upon his forfaulture he is never designed the earls natural son but only his son simply and fiar of the earldom of rothes  and probably the earl and the lady disagreeing they chose to live separate or she left him and he married again as was commonly done in that time nicholas somervel daughter of sir john somervel of camnethan and widow of john lord fleming by whom he had andrew his fathers successor in the estate and honor and the lady dying soon thereafter the earl was again reconciled to lady margaret chrichton and legally married her otherwise she could not have been as i observed she was designed countess of rothes and in this state of lawful marriage she bare the earl a son robert lesly the founder of the house of findrassy and from his being brother to norman the master of rothes both of the same father and mother has the mistake proceeded and the story been patched up of his being as he is called the righteous rothes for it is plain that norman being forfaulted for the murder of cardinal beaton his father the earl redeemed his own estate again in the terms he had made it over to him and so could not but in justice settle it upon his son andrew who being indisputeably born in lawful marriage was preferable to robert who was not born of margaret crichton till very long after the death of dame nicholas somervel for it is plain at first the earl had no other son by margaret crichton but the aforesaid norman master of rothes  andrew earl of rothes so succeeding his father was very faithful to queen mary throughout her whole unfortunate life and was highly honored by king james as a nobleman of great honor and probity he married first jean daughter of sir james hamilton of evandale by whom he had james master of rothes and andrew lord lindores likewise three daughters   margaret married to archbald earl of angus   eupham to james lord lindsay   elizabeth to david weems younger of thatilk and again to james first earl of findlater  he married again jean daughter of patrick lord ruthven and after that margaret daughter of durrie of thatilk and had margaret married to sir william cunninghame of capringtoun mary to robert lord melvil and isobel to james master of sinclair  james master of rothes in the lifetime of his father married first margaret daughter of patrick lord lindsay by whom he had four daughters  margaret married to mr john murray minister of dunfermling a brother of the family of abercairny  isobel to of newhall  anne to alexander wardlaw of torrie  grisel to alexander earl of dunfermling  his second wife was catharine daughter of patrick lord drummond by whom he had a son john who succeeded his grandfather and a daughter jean married to alexander menzies of weem  which john being a nobleman of very good parts and great address was one of those peers who were most forward and leading for the rdress of grievances when the troubles first broke out in      and the earl being the person of the greatest parts interest and experience in all the popular party it cannot be denied but he came to be generally looked on as the principal and governing person of the nation at that time and after the treaty of rippon at which he was the first commissioner when the pacification was concluded his majesty resolved and actually did adjust all his business with that party by the earl who undertook that scotland should rest satisfied with the concessions which were in the treaty and his majesty was well satisfied says my author clarendons history of the rebellion  with the promises made to him by the earl and it is certain the king expected by his help and interest to have found such a party in scotland as would he adds have been more tender of his honor than they after expressed themselves and did alwise impute the failing thereof to the absence of the earl who falling sick at the kings coming down to scotland within six weeks thereafter died at london in august      which his majesty thought an irreparable loss to his service  he married anne daughter of john earl of mar by whom he had john his son and heir and two daughters margaret married first to alexander lord balgony next to francis earl of buccleugh and last of all to david earl of weems and christian to hugh earl of eglingtoun  john earl of rothes was too young to have been concerned in the war when it first broke out in the time of king charles i but when the parliament      raised an army for the service of king charles ii for the recovery of england the earl being then of age put himself into the army and attended the king thither upon the defeat at worcester he had the misfortune to fall into the enemies hand who committed him to prison where he remained till the kings restoration that his majesty king charles ii to reward his merit and sufferings was pleased to make him lord president of the

sessions thereof he behaved himself with singular honor and integrity for though he was under very great temptations and at the same time had very considerable offers made him if he would comply with the measures of the court in relation to the union yet nothing could corrupt him or make him swerve from what he thought was the interst of his country so that he gave the union all the opposition that was in his power and voted against every article of it and he was wont to say that though the union was attended with no other inconveniency than the making the peers elective he wondered very much how any of that rank could be for it for being all peers by right of inheritance their being made elective he took to be a divesting them of their peerage because not being sure of being always chosen to every pariament of great britain they consequently must lose when left out the benefit of sitting in parliament what was ever deemed an inseparable right of the peerage beside his lordship

the most ancient sirnames are local the era we reckon they were first hereditarily affid to families at least with us was in the reign of king david i for before that the most eminent persons we find are distinguished either by some personal appellative or patronymically by the name of the father as is clear from the most ancient writs that are extant and of which many instances could here be given and that which further confirms this opinion is that the very first sirnames are all taken from lands as douglass hume crawford cathcart dalrymple etc all which have been assumed from their own lands by the then proprietars when hereditary appellations became customary  the first using this surname is adam de dalrymple who was possessed of the barony of dalrymple in airshire in the time of king alexander iii there is a charte in the rolls of king robert ii the first year of his reign anno      ratifying a ant which malcolm filius gilchrist filius adae de dalrymple made of the half of the barony of dalrymple to sir john kennedy and the granter having then a son john dalrymple who ges a charter about the same time of the whole dominium de dalrymple it is no stretch but a very modest computation in chronology to place adam the great grandfather as high as lexander the iiis me  adam was succeeded by gilchrist his son and he again by malcolm his son from whom sprang john and roland de dalrymples who had the barony of dalrymple divided betwixt them which their heirs made over to sir john kennedy in the       although the dalrymples ceased to possess their old original estate of dalrymple yet some of them continued to make a very considerable figure jacobus de dalrymple was clericus rgis in the time of king robert iii charta in pub arch  and another john de dalrymple of bolton in the time of king james ii being a man of parts and experience in affairs was joined in commission with dr nicol otterburn and sent upon a solemn embassy to the duke of burgundy ibidem ad

of all the dalrymples they came first to possess the barony of stair which lies near to dalrymple in right of marjory the daughter and heir of sir john de montgomery the montgomeries of sta were

heir who in the beginning of the reign of queen mary was among the very first of any account who made open profession of the protestant religion to which he always continued very firm and constant in the year      he joined with the earls of lennox and glencarn against the governor the earl of arran whom the protestants pretended was not then altogether so zealous for the reformation as he had been at first and was at the conflict on glasgow moor for which he got afterward from the duke of chattlerault the regent a remission for his being in feir of weir at the unlawful convocation of the queens leidges on the moor of glasgow with matthew sumetime earl of lennox and william earl of glencairn ibidem ad annum       he married isobel daughter of george crawford of lochnorris by whom he had  james his son and heir who with his fathers other virtues inherited his zeal for the protestant religion for as soon as a confession of faith was compiled by our reformers and ratified by act of parliament he was one of those who signed it and entered into a solemn association for the defense of the tree reformed religion as it was then publicly professed in the kingdom knoxs history  in the      we find he was one of those who with the duke of chatlerault and others opposed the queens marriage with the lord darnley by reason of the danger they apprehended might arise to religion by that union but the duke sailing in the attempt he made to seize darnley and to send him to england his adherents were obliged to take remissions for it the lord of stairs i have seen in      charta in rotulis priva sigilli ad annum      for treason and assisting the duke of chattlerault to defend the castles of drassan and hamilton against the queens authority  soon after this when the nation was alarmed with the murder of the lord darnley the queens husband and the measures that were then taken no body appeared more zealous in a prudent way than this gentleman for the safety of the young prince king james vi and the preservation of the protestant religion for we find he was one of the many barons who together with the bulk of the nation entered into that famous association bond at edinburgh       wherein they bind themselves to inaugurate the prince and with all their strenth and forcis promote concur fortify and assist to the promoting and establishing him in his kingdom and government as becumis faithful and true subjects to do to their prince and to resist all sick as would oppon them theirto or to make any trouble or impediement to him theirin and dying in      left issue by isobel his wife daughter of thomas kennedy of bargany memorial of the viscount of stair  james dalrymple of stair who by janet his wife daughter of fergus kennedy of knockdaw had james the first viscount of stair  this excellent person was born in may      charta in pub arch  his father dying when he was very young he was by the singular care and affection of his mother well brought up and at a proper age having been taught his humanity at the best schools in the country was sent to the university of glasgow where having run through his course of philosophy with great application and success he took the degree of master of arts in the      the civil war breaking out soon thereafter mr dalrymple betook himself to the service of the parliament and had a company of foot bestowed on him in the earl of glencairns regiment while he was a captain upon the earnest solicitation of some of the professors of glasgow upon the falling vacant of a philosophy chair in that university he was prevailed on to stand a candidate at a comparative trial for the post to which he was preferred with great applause and he successfully performed that provence for some time and bred several scholars who proved afterward very eminent both in church and state while mr dalrymple continued in this station he studied the greek and latin with the history and antiquities of greece and rome the better to qualify him for the study of the civil law to which he betook himself and wherein he made a very eminent progress  mr dalrymple being esteemed a man of great parts and good address was employed by the university to solicit grants for the increase of their revenues and other affairs which led him to see the form of proceedings in the courts of justice and brought him to be known and acquainted with the great men who were then at the head of affairs and the most eminent lawyers both on the bench and at the bar at length in the beginning of the      mr dalrymple with these useful preparations and advantages entered an advocate and in short time time became very eminent in his profession for his abilities and reputation for judgment and integrity in so much as when the parliament      proclaimed king charles ii and named certain commissioners to go over to breda to treat with him about his coming to the exercise of his royal power mr dalrymple was pitched on to be secretary to the committee whereby he had an opportunity to be known to the king and the great men about the court who were very well pleased with the abilities sincerity and moderation he showed in the whole of his demeanor on that critical occasion for which the king did ever afterward esteem him and was pleased to express himself very obligingly of him even at the time when he was prevailed on by his ministers to remove him from the presidentship of the session as being in no degree a friend to the designs then on foot and i cannot but remark that though mr dalrymple was then but a young lawyer yet he was so well esteemed for his knowledge in the laws that the parliament in his absence while he was in holland named him one of the commissioners to revise the laws acts of parliament and practice of the several judicatures but what advances they made in that matter is to me unknown  mr dalrymple returned with the commissioners before the king in the    0 and so soon as his majesty arrived he waited on him at his first landing and was very well received and thereafter in the course of affairs he used his outmost endeavors and did all he could to unite all parties for his majestys service especially in the grand affair of raising an army to invade england upon which all the hope of his restoration depended  after the defeat of the royal party at worcester mr dalrymple continued his practice in the law during the u supation till the oath called the tender abjuring the royal family of the searts was imposed that he and most of the eminent men of that profession withdrew from the bar till cromwell thought fit by some act of connivance to dispense with it and a correspondence being made up betwixt the bench and the bar we find mr dalrymple was one of the four deputed by the faculty of advocates to declare to the judges that it was their opinion that for the better administration of justice to restore the ancient form of the outerhouse which had been suppressed and which they accordingly thought fit to comply with  mr dalrymple still increasing in reputation and practice he was upon the death of judge learmont of balcomy pitched on by general monk with consent of the protectors council to be his successor and the choice proceeded merely upon the fame of his abilities and integrity and he was far from seeking after the employment he having no inclination to have any office under that administration but there being such an universal desire of the people that the post should be filed with a scotsman and a person eminent for integrity and knowledge of the laws and being importuned from people of all ranks and persuasions he was at last persuaded to accept of the place and so he suffered himself to be made one of the judges without any other compliance with the then prevailing powers than taking the oath de fideli administratione as the act of his admission bears july  st      while this worthy judge continued in this station he took all opportunities that offered to serve his country and to do all the good offices he could for his friends with those in power in getting grievances redressed which as it mightily increased his reputation and very much recommended him to men of all degrees so it brought him into a particular acquaintance with general monk who had a great esteem and value for him insomuch as the day before he marched with his army to england he reposed so much considence in judge dalrymple as a very wise man and of an excellent understanding that he called him to a private conference and desired he would give his opinion freely what he thought was the likeliest way to settle the three nations to which he readily answered that the wisest and fairest way was to procure a free and full parliament to be called and at the same time he very earnestly recommended to the general to interpose at london for setting the courts of justice a going which were then stopped by reason of the disorder and discomposures of the times which counsel the general followed as appears from his letter to judge dalrymple dated from dunstable the  th day of january       upon the restoration mr dalrymple went up with the earl of cassils to london to pay his duty to the king and congratulate his majestys happy restoration and the king the first time mr dalrymple waited on him was graciously pleased as a mark of his favor to make him a knight and as a further testimony of the trust and confidence he reposed in him named him one of the senators of the college of justice at the first settlement of that judicature in the year      and in november thereafter the lord president sir john gilmoir being called up to london the lords applied to the earl of middleton his majestys commissioner to name a president in the absence of the president and his grace was pleased to name the lord stair to be vice president and i cannot fail to remark that the lords themselves had such an esteem for the lord stair that they ever choosd him vice president as often as sir john gilmoirs health or other occasions hindered him to be present except once when he was at london in the wintersession    0 as one of the commissioners for the treaty that was then set on foot betwixt the two nations  the parliament      having appointed an oath to be taken called the declaration by which all who were in public offices were obliged to declare against defensive arms and the conduct of the late troubles particularly against the national covenant as explained in the year      and the solemn league and covenant entered into betwixt the two nations in      as contrary to the fundamental laws and liberties of the kingdom this caused no small uneasiness to the lord stair some things being in the oath disagreeable to his principles and withal being absent in the country at his mothers funeralobsequies when the rest of the lords subscribed the declaration they acquainted him that the king in his letter to the privy council had ordered the places of such of the lords as did not sign the declaration by a precise day should be declared void and that no written explanation or declaration should be admitted which would look like the stating of a party to which the lord stair returned answer excusing his not compliance for that he had sent his demission to the king before the date of the letter whereupon the lords declared his place vacant on the   th of january       the lord stair being thus at liberty took a tour into france with john his eldest son who then about sixteen years of age began to travel for his improvement and my lord stair returning by the way of london and having had the honor to wait on the king his majesty was pleased to tell him that he would not accept of his demission and allowed him to clear or explain his mind in what sense he would take the declaration and accordingly his lordship having satisfied his majesty the king by a letter to the lords signified that being well satisfied with sir james dalrymple of stair one of their number his clearing himself in the matter of the declaration and of his affection to his service and of his great abilities to serve in that station therefore it was his pleasure that the lord stair signing the declaration continue in his place as if the demission had never been made upon receipt of the letter and sir jamess signing the declaration the lords rescinded their former act declaring his place void and he took his place on the bench again at the sitting down of the summersession      about this time his majesty as a further mark of his royal favor to the lord stair was pleased to create him a knight baronet and to the heirs male of his body for ever  in the    0 when a treaty was set on foot for uniting the two kingdoms of scotland and england the lord stair was named one of the commissioners for that important affair and tho the treaty did not take effect yet the lord stair in the several discourses that passed on that subject gave such clear proofs of his great knowledge in our constitution and the laws that the next ensuing year sir john gilmoir lord president resigning his office his majesty was pleased to confer it upon him and his promotion was not attended with any envy or dislike so far as i have ever heard  as my lord stair was a great lover of his country and had the true interest of it always very much at heart so he embraced every opportunity to promote and advance the good of the nation for it was the lord president and several other patriots who concurred with him who represented to the duke of lauderdale upon his coming down in the      several abuses and illegal practices that had been committed and the duke thereupon was pleased to get several acts of council made correctory of these abuses particularly that of citing persons for churchirregularities without libelling special circumstances of time and place which was very ill taken and highly resented by the archbishop of st andrews and several of his highflying brethren  my lord stair did with the same fidelity labor to dissuade the duke from bringing in the highland host upon the west and from obtaining an order of council for a bond to be taken for discovering apprehending and bringing to judgment presbyterian ministers who held conventicles but though he did not prevail in this point yet the lord president could never be induced either to subscribe the bond or approve the highland inroad for reasons founded both in law and religion  when his royal highness the duke of albany came down to scotland in the end of the      the lords of the session and other members of the college of justice thought it their duty to wait on his highness at the abbay of holyroodhouse when the lord president made a fine congratulatory speech in the name of the society wherein among other expressions he had one to this effect that it was a matter of great joy to the nation to see one of the royal family among them after being for so many years deprived of that honor and the nation being entirely protestant it was the fittest place his highness could make his recess to at that time his lordship did afterward with a becoming freedom and the ourmost fidelity dissuade his highness not to attempt any thing that might seem to have the least tendency to weaken the establishment of the reformed religion as it was secured by the laws in the parliament      to which his royal highness the duke of albany was his majestys high commissioner the lord president was chosen a member for the shire of wigtoun in the beginning of the session his lordship the earl of argile and several others were named on a committee of the articles for religion which by the custom of all scots parliaments was the first thing treated of accordingly the committee did prepare an act securing the protestant religion which act did ratify the act approving the confession of faith and also the act containing the coronation oath appointed by several standing laws and acts of parliament to be taken by our kings before their entry to the exercise of the government but this draught which the committee had prepared was laid aside in respect it was thought to limit too much the power of a popish successor to the crown in place whereof a general statute did pass ratifying all former laws for settling and securing the liberty and freedom of the protestant religion however when the act asserting the right of succession to the crown according to the proximity of blood without respect to any difference in religion did pass it was thought expedient even by those who promoted it to have a more special law made for security of the protestant religion accordingly a daught of the act about religion was transmitted to the parliament which provided only for the preservation of the protestant religion as contained in the word of god which could not discover papists who pretend to walk conform to that rule the lord stair the earl of argyle and other patriots were forward to have a particular standard of the protestant religion established that might more effectually prevent roman catholics getting into public offices in the event of a popish prince upon the throne and the lord president urged the matter with so much strength of reason that the first clause in the test which was agreed to did exclude all persons from public trust in the government who did not swear that they owned and sincerely professed the true protestant religion contained in the confession of faith recorded in the parliament      and that they believed the same to be founded on and agreeable to the written word of god and that they should adhere thereunto all the days of their lifetime and educate their children therein and that they should never consent to any change or alteration contrary thereunto though the act passed yet the urging of that clause by the lord president was highly reented by his royal highness the duke of albany the lord high commissioner who the very night the act passed said to some about him and in his nearest confidence that the lord stair by bringing in the confession of faith into the test had ruined all honest men meaning roman catholics  though the lord president was pleased with the first part of the testact which seemed to be a very effectual security against popery yet he could not sign the latter part of it which struck against presbyterian dissenters therein called fanatics and therefore he went up to the king to declare so much and to desire his majestys leave to retire and to lay down his employment but before he arrived at london his behavior in the parliament was improved as so heavy a charge against him at court that he was removed from his office in the session without mentioning of any cause though he held his place in the ordinary way of judges ad vitam aut culpam but his remove from his place was not all he was like to suffer for after that he was not allowed to live without disturbance in his retirement at his seat in the country for his tenants were harassed with grievous fynes for nonconformity and he got a hint from his friend sir george mackenzie the lord advocate that he could not secure him that he might not be thrown in prison my lord stair finding himself in these circumstances thought it safer for him to retire and to go into a voluntary exile into holland in the end of      where he printed his philosophia nova experimentalis which as it gained him great reputation with the learned so it is generally read with great applause  while the lord stair was abroad many witnesses were examined and reexamined not only his own domestics but some of his nearest relations to find out matter for a criminal pursuit against him but nothing was discovered save that some persons suspected to have been engaged in the rebellion      lived upon his ground or luked about his house in the country while he attended on the session at edinburgh however he was pursued for treason first before the justiciary and then before the parliament upon the common ground of harbor and reset of rebels but the probation was so scrimp that by their own rules they could not condemn him for he was a wise man and had taken care to live with all possible circumspection and caution  the lord stair sojourned in holland till the      he came over with the prince of orange in his expedition to britain to relieve these nations from popery and arbitrary power in which glorious design no man engaged more frankly than the old lord stair and when the prince was just setting sail for england it is reported his lordship took the freedom to ask his highness what his true design was in going to england to which the prince was pleased to answer that he designed the glory of god and the security of the protestant religion upon which it is said the lord stair pulled off his wig and said though i be now in the  0 th year of mine age i am willing to venture that meaning his head and his own and his childrens fortunes in such an undertaking this the prince took in very good part and reported it to others as that which very much encouraged him to prosecute his design  when the prince landed at torby his highness expressed a particular concern about the lord stair and sent to enquire concerning his health and understanding his horses were not come up the prince sent him horses of his for his accommodation  upon the advancement of the prince and princess of orange to the throne their majestys who had a very great kindness and esteem for the lord stair as a person of great integrity and of unquestionable zeal for the protestant religion were pleased to restore him to his office of president of the session in the      conform to the claim of right but their majestys thought this piece of justice was not enough to reward the lord stairs great merit wherefore they were further pleased to raise him to the peerage by the style and title of viscount of stair by letters patent bearing date  0th april    0 after which his lordship continued without the least interruption in the favor of his prince and enjoyed his office which he had discharged in all times with great abilities and singular integrity till his death which happened on the   th of november      aged    and was with great funeral solemnity interred in the cathedral church of st giles  this excellent person married margaret eldest daughter of james ross of balneel with whom he had a fair fortune in land and had issue by her    sir john dalrymple thereafter earl of stair    sir james dalrymple of borthwick who being a person of great parts and learning was bred to the law and became an advocate and was afterward made one of the principal clerks of the session and a baronet sir jamess genius even from his youth having led him to the study of antiquities my noble and very worthy friend sir james dalrymple did collect and furnish sir george mackenzie with the most of the materials of what he wrote in defense of the royal line and his jus regium though without any acknowledgment to his friend mr dalrymple which i and many others have wondered at when it was so well known at that time sir james has also published a new edition of cambdens britannia wherein he gives us the first right draught of the line of the royal family of the stewarts and rescued it from the blunders and mistakes of all that ever wrote before him which is such an eminent and notable service to the crown and his country that ought never to be forgotten but gratefully remembered to his honor and the honor of his memory for i can well say that all that has been advanced since on the history of the royal family are but superstructures upon that foundation which sir james has there laid down  particularly those of his own country he became a wonderful proficient and one of the learned men of that profssion of which his book collections concerning the scots history is a pregnant instance a book full of learning and that learning so closely and solidly applied that it has justly gained him a very great reputation with learned men as one of the greatest antiquaries this or indeed any other age has produced    sir hugh dalrymple of nortberwick baronet who likewise applying himself from his youth to the study of the law commenced advocate and advancing daily in reputation and practice after he had been some time one of the commissaries of edinburgh he was in the school promoted to be lord president of the session which had been vacant from the death of his father here is a large field to expatiate upon the great learning and other qualities of this gentleman but he being still alive i shall entirely wave it    dr thomas dalrymple first physician in ordinary to his majesty for the kingdom of scotland    sir david dalrymple of hailes baronet who being a person of incomparable parts and having studied the law in his younger years came to the bar with great applause and growing very eminent in reputation and practice insomuch as her majesty queen anne was pleased to make him solicitor and then lord advocate from which office he was removed toward the end of that reign but upon the accession of king george to the crown he was restored to his former digaity which he at present enjoys with the universal approbation of the whole nation and the general applause of all men for his justice integrity sound judgment and eminent sufficiency in the discharge of his office a praise which was never denied him at any time  janet eldest daughter of james viscount of stair was married to david dunbar son and heir apparent to sir david dunbar of buldoon bart but had no issue    elizabeth to allan the present lord cathcart    sarah to charles lord crichton son and heir of william earl of dumfreis    isobel to sir david cuninghame of milnraig bart and had issue  john first viscount thereafter earl of stair was by the care of his father though his eldest son bred to the study of the law and being admitted to the bar in short time became very eminent in practice insomuch as when the earl of argyle was pursued for high treason in the      for his giving an explanation of the test when he took it sir john dalrymple who was by this time very much taken notice of as a lawyer of great ability and learning was one of the earls council but quickly after this the court conceiving a displeasure against the lord stair sir johns father and it being well known that his own principles were altogether against the measures that were then taken they had a very jealous eye upon him and he became so much the object of their envy that in the end of the      upon pretense that he as heritable baillie of the regality of glenlace interfeiring in jurisdiction with the new named justiciar and sheiff of galloway graham of claverhoase had fined his own and his fathers tenants too low for haunting conventicles and though he had never meddled in any public matters yet he was committed prisoner to the castle of edinbargh and fined in  00 lib sterling but being set at liberty he was again in the      upon various pretenses seized on at his own house in the country and though the officer that apprehended him brought him to the abbay of holy rod house in expectation that he might have been bailed yet so great was the torrent against him that though they could not find any ground of accusation whereupon to found an indictment yet he was committed to the tolbooth of edinburgh where he lay three months and for some weeks was a close prisoner  though sir john dalrymple was very much frowned on at this time by the court he would by no means forego his principles though his wisdom and experience put him upon acting circumspectly and with great caution during the remainder of king charles his reign but after king jamess coming to the crown that prince upon his own observation of sir john dalrymples abilities in his pleadings as a lawyer was pleased to conceive a very good opinion of him insomuch as he was pleased to make him lord advocate upon the removal of sir george mackenzie who was laid aside in the      for not complying with the design of the court in taking away the penal laws against popery though it could never be said by sir john dalrymples greatest enemies that he had in any degree contributed thereto but on the contrary endeavored all he could to animate the members of parliament to stand firm to their religion and not to open a door to let in popery and many other inconveniences sir john behaved with great moderation and temper while he held that office but sir george mackenzie having found means to reconcile himself to the court he was restored to be advocate and sir john dalrymple was thereupon made justiceclerk upon a vacancy through the demise of sir james foulis of colingtoun and he continued in the office till the government was dissovd by king jamess leaving england and retiring to france  sir john dalrymple being a very zealous protestant all the favors he had conferred on him by king james and others he might have expected were no temptations to bring him into the courtmeasures at that time and the revolution coming about he fell heartily in with it and with those who were the most zealous promoters of it  in the convention of estates      sir john dalrymple showed himself a steady asserter of the religion and liberties of his country and particularly expressed on that occasion a hearty desire that a treaty might be set on foot for a nearer union of the two nations but that design meeting with opposition from persons of very different principles it was dropped at that time and when the grand affair of settling the crown came to be debated the estates found at first great difficulty how to declare the throne vacant at length sir john dalrymple ended the debate by such reasons that the convention went into his proposals and settled the crown upon the prince and princess of orange so soon as it passed into an act he was one of the commissioners sent up from the convention with the offer of the crown to the prince and princess of orange with the nations grievances and claim of right which their highnesses having accepted of they were graciously pleased to reward sir johns merit and zeal shown for their advancement to the throne by making him lord advocate in    0 and in less than a year thereafter he was constituted one of the principal secretaries of state and he discharged the office with eminent sufficiency till the      that the parliament having made some attempts against him about the affair of the horrid massacre of glenco he resigned his place merely that the king might not be made uneasy by his continuing in so eminent a post so near his royal person though his majesty did highly resent the treatment the secretary had met with and turned all those out of his service who had been the greatest sticklers against him  though the master of stair did not think he had been well used yet he never showed the least resentment against the court but on the contrary by his great wisdom and temper interposed to moderate the heats and animosities which arose both in the parliament and in the country upon the disappointments of darien and the figure he made in the public debates by his speeches in parliament were sufficient to convince every body that he might have been employed again in some of the highest offices of state but he constantly declined preferment for he was resolved never to be further concerned in public affairs than as a privy counselor et at the same time not to omit what he really thought his duty to his country upon any occasion  when queen anne came to the crown the viscount of stair was named on of the lords of the privy council and as a further testimony of her majestys favor was raised to the honor of earl of stair by letters patent the  th of april   0  charta in pb archiis   the earl of stair had from his youth entertained an opinion that an entire union of both kingdoms was the most likely way to procure the lasting tranquillity and happiness of britain and for that end very readily concurred in the session of parliament   0  that power should be given to the queen to name commissioners to treat of an union pursuant to which commissioners were nmed by her majesty of which number the earl himself was one but that treaty breaking off without coming o any conclusion it had no other effect than o let both nations se it was practicable and it being agin resumed in the   0  by new authority from the parliament of both kingdoms his lordship was by her majesty named one of the commissioners upon the part of scotland in the carrying on of which he had so considerable a share both in the time of the treaty and in the parliament of scotland that many have thought that without the earl of stair it could not have been brought to a conclusion considering the many difficulties were raised against it all which he just lived to see overcome for being exceedingly sollicitous to have the union perfected he assisted the day before his death at the debates on that subject in the parliament pressing the point with great earnestness and tho he walked home and dined very cheerfully with company yet about four next morning he ll into an apoplexy which in a few hours put an end to his days the  th of january   0  aged     he married elizabeth daughter and heir of sir john dundas of newliston by whom he had john

of stair was born at edinburgh the  0th of july      he gave very early marks of a lively and great genius having succeeded beyond his fellows in his first studies of latin and greek both at home and in holland whether at the desire of his grandfather then at leden our young student was sent when he was about eleven years old in a very few months he acquired the habit of speaking french and dutch in both which he has been since improved to a degree of perfection to which seldom any stranger has attained his masters at leyden were exceedingly pleased with him and remaked that though he seemed fond of play and solicited his fellows to it yet he was never found out of his place at school but while he seemed thus devoted to his play he advanced in his learning as if he had minded nothing else he was promoted from class to class with the approbation of the magistrates professors and masters of the school at leyden and had one of the first praemiums at every promotion according to the custom of that school for distinguishing the merit of the best scholars and for exciting in them a greater desire of going forward  after the earl had made a good progress in the schools there he returned to his father in scotland and in the university of edinburgh pursued the study of the greek and latin adding the study of the logicks and other parts of philosophy under mr kennedy then regent in that university he studied the mathematics under the learned and very justly celebrated doctor david gregory then professor at edinburgh and afterward savilian professor at oxford the earl had also the assistance of mr gregory the present professor of the mathematics at edinburgh and he had the constant happiness to be the favorite of his masters and to be much beloved by his follow students  in the beginning of the year      he went again to holland to visit his grandfather and grandmother to whom he was very dear and returned in october that year to scotland to reassume his studies in the university but the commotions that happened at edinburgh in november interrupted the stated course of every thing till the revolution was completed and the government established in the person of king william in the beginning of the year      he went with his father to london from this time forward the present earl then mr dalrymple begun to ply the study of the living languages as well as that of the dead and to improve himself in these kinds of exercises that belong to a young gentleman still with the same constancy and good effect  he returned again to scotland with his father and saw the meeting of the estates and the two first sessions of the parliament of scotland under king william and queen mary in the year      and    0  his father being made secretary of state in the beginning of the year      his son the present earl had the advantage to be much at court which was a new kind of education that added both ornament and useful improvement to those he had acquired before and when his father followed the king to flanders the earl went along in the summer he was in the camp and was present at the battle of steenkirk where the brave earl of angus was killed on the head of his regiment with whom the present earl of stair advanced to the enemy as a volunteer  in the winter the earl returned once more to his studies at leyden heard the famous professors there read on grotius and the institutions of the civil law and had at the same time colleges of history employing every minute to the best advantage  after these foundations laid there remained nothing more to fit the earl for business but traveling to see how men of different tempers and religions lived among themselves and other men and to learn from the first hand the genius manners constitutions and languages of some of the most considerable nations in europe he set out with the lord lexington who went in the year   00 to vienna ambassador the earl having been some time at that court went on to italy visiting on his way the several great cities republics and courts in italy at rome he applied himself to the knowledge of antiquities architecture and other things which are taught there studying with much application the italian language and because he could not then go into france during the war then between king william and that crown he studied the french very carefully by the help of a french abbe whom he found at rome that he might enter deeper into the strength genius and beauties of that language so universally in use  having made the tour of germany and italy he returned to england in the   0  and that year came to scotland with his father where he continued until the   0  at which time there being new regiments to be raised in scotland he went to court to offer his service upon the appearance of an approaching war the king received him very graciously but a scheme of officers was formed for these regiments leaving him out his majesty having observed it told that he was resolved to provide for mr dalrymple who by that scheme was neglected and for that reason his majesty resolved to make him second lieutenant colonel of his regiment of foot guards in scotland but king williams death happening just then his commission as second lieutenant colonel of the regiment of foot guards was signed by queen anne on one of the first days of her reign  being now in the army where his inclination had ever led him to serve he embraced the first opportunities to appear in that way which soon happened for the late queen being engaged with the confederates in the second war against france and having sent over an army under the command of the duke of marlborough the earl made the very first campaign as a volunteer and distinguished himself in the actions of greatest hazard and consequence as at the taking of venlo and liege and at the cannonade of peer he was also employed by the duke as his aidde camp it was in this campaign that he laid the foundation of that friendship with which that great general has constantly honored him since  the account of the earl from that period is so interwoven with the great events civil and military that have happened that tho all the materials for going through with a just and exact history were at hand yet the nature of this undertaking would not admit of pursuing it or the share he had in these great actions which besides has been remarkable enough by many very considerable circumstances well known i have therefore contented my self in a plain way and without enlarging on particulars to set forth what concerns his youth and education which has been one constant series of application to those things which might fit him for the eminent station where he is now placed  i shall therefore finish what concerns him with the bare enumeration of the employments he has gone through  he had a commission as colonel of foot in the dutch service in april   0  in the year   0  he succeeded brigadeer general

having an inclination and a talent from his youth to poetry he declined all other business and delivered himself up entirely to his own genius in which he made a wonderful proficiency in the study of the ancient poets by whom he formed an excellent goust of poetry insomuch as in a short time he came to be looked on as one of the most eminent of that profession k james who then reigned was a prince of great learning and knowledge and delighted much in the conversation of learned men particularly mr alexander who presented him with several elegant poems to the kings great delight and the gaining the applause of persons of the first rank for quality and wit to himself to whom in a short time he grew very acceptable after he had lived some years about the court his majesty who looked on him as a wise man was pleased to prefer him to be master of requests and a knight in      but his majestys bounty did not rest in the conferring one single favor on him for sir william being a learned and projecting man and having settled a colony in nova scotia in america upon his own charges king james made him a grant of it by his royal deed on the    of september      and did intend to erect the order of baronet for encouraging and advancing so good a work but the two or three last years of that princes reign having been less pleasant to him by the jealousies which about that time began in england he thought fit to suspend the further prosecution of that affair until a more favorable conjuncture which he lived not to see but king charles i who with his fathers other virtues inherited his affection to his native kingdom immediately upon his coming to the crown proposed nothing more than the furthering of that design which was projected to be of so great a benefit to the nation and therefore made sir william alexander lieutenant of new scotland and instituted the order of knightbaronet for the encouraging and advancing of that colony and gave him the privilege of coining small coppermoney a gift which was inveighed against even at that time with great bitterness but his majesty who thought that too great encouragement could not be given to learned and worthy men such as sir

gordon of gordonstoun baronet and very accurately epitomized by mr ross in latin the author of the pansebeia wherein both sir robert and mr ross have been at much pains to vouch the antiquity and illustrate the descent of the earls of sutherlands and they have done it so well and instructed it so clear that the peerage of this illustrious family is not only one of the oldest with us in scotland but for what i know of any other nation of europe and i cannot but remark that our historians do make mention that the family of sutherland were thanes before the title of earl was introduced among us for not only sir robert gordon and mr ross but even our public national historians do take notice that allan thane of sutherland a brave and warlike man gave a very signal defeat to a detachment of the danish army who invaded the country of sutherland and that he was cruelly put to death and murdered under the usurpation of macbeth for his firm adherence to his rightful sovereign king malcolm canmore king duncans son and for endeavoring to set him on his fathers throne and when in providence that was happily brought about that heroic and generous prince thought it but just to restore the children of such who had been forfeited on his account during the usurpation and therefore walter the son of allan thane of sutherland in memory of his fathers merit as well as his own signal services in contributing toward the restoration was not only restored to his estate and honor but was likewise one of those whom that king further dignified with the then introduced title of

county of twedale where his parts were quickly taken notice of and having behaved himself very well in all things relating to the crown his majesty king james vi was pleased to call him to his council and to confer the honor of knighthood on him  king charles i soon after his coming to the crown contracted an extraordinary opinion of sir john stewart as a man wll versed in all parts of learning and of great experience in affairs insomuch as he preerred him to the honor of the peerage   th of april      charta in cancellaria s d n r by the title of lord steuart of traquar and made him treasurerdepute at the time when the earl of mortoun was made lord hightreasurer and his lordship having a near relation to the court and much in it he contracted a great friendship and familiarity ith dr laud then bishop of london and being well able to spea in the affairs of the church took care to be thought by the bishop a very zealous defender of it and of the episcopal oder which very much endeared him to the bishop by whom he was recommended to the king as fittest to be trusted not only in the administration of civil affairs in which indeed it cannot be denied but he had great experience but also in the conferring of ecclesiastical preferments in which he was not always very fortunate  when king charles made a journey into his kingdom of scotland to be there crowned the lord traquair attended on his majesty throughout that whole progress and at the solemnity of the coronation was raised to the honor of earl of traquair by letters patent bearing date at holyroodhouse june         charta in cancellaria s d n r  and growing every day more in credit with the king and in favor with dr laud who by this time was become archbishop of canterbury his majesty was pleased to make him lord hightreasurer of scotland in the      upon the surrender of that office by the earl of mortoun the earl being thus invested in the greatest office of benefit in the kingdom and his majesty believing he had provided a strong support to his government both in church and state and having exceedingly set his heart upon the uniting of his three kingdoms in one form of gods worship and public devotions by a public liturgy he committed entirely the bringing about of that business so far as related to the civil part of it to the lord treasurer and though his lordship was very well affected to the work in hand in his own judgment yet he did not think the season was ripe for it is being published when it was by the kings proclamation appointed to be first read at easter      and therefore the lord treasurer persuaded his majesty to defer it for a time till some good preparation might be made for the more favorable reception of it and as this pause gave the discontented party more time for their negotiations so the consequence of it made him suspected to be secretly an enemy to the liturgy and the bishops of this the lord clarendon clears him and says that there was never any ground either then or in all the after part of his life for that suspicion but that if the lord treasurer had been as much depended upon to advise the bishops in the prosecution of the liturgy and for the conduct of it as he was to assist them in the carrying on whatsoever they proposed it is very probable either so much would not have been undertaken together or that it would have succeeded better but whatever suspicion some of the bishops might entertain of the lord treasurers not being devoted to some of them it is certain the king had no jealousy of the earl as if he had been in any degree corrupted or disaffected to the government as it was established by law insomuch as when his majesty was pleased in the      to call a parliament and an assembly of the clergy in order to appease the commotions and to extinguish the fire that the endeavor of bringing in the liturgy and the book of canons had kindled he pitched on the lord treasurer whom he knew to be as wise a man as the nation then had and very equal to the work to represent his royal person both in the parliament and the assembly in that great and difficult trust he acquitted himself to his majestys great satisfaction and did with the outmost vigor and fidelity assert the royal prerogative as established by law or ancient custom and when he thought that was invaded either in the parliament or in the assembly of the church he opposed it with all his power and gave them all the trouble he could  as the faithful discharge of his great trust did very much establish and confirm the treasurer in his majestys good opinion so it drew upon him the implacable resentment of the other party who pursued him with so extraordinary animosity that in the next parliament of      they prevailed with his majesty to take the whitestaff from him and impeached him of high treason of which they likewise found him guilty but having referred his punishment to the king his majesty was so far from conceiving the earl had merited such a severe prosecution that he gave orders that in all events a pardon might be prepared under the great seal the remission i have seen and perused in the hands of the earl of traquair  wherein his majesty does not only very fully absolve him from the crimes objected against him in the impeachment but annexes to the remission an ample testimony of his great abilities and singular integrity in the discharge of all the great employments he had been entrusted with under the crown  but this testimony of the kings gracious affection to the earl did him very little service for during the civil war by virtue of the judgments that had formerly passed on him his estate was sequestrated and taken from him and for the greater security of his person he was forced to flee out of the country and though they allowed him to return home and live at his own house yet he continued under restraint till the      that he was enlarged and suffered to sit in the parliament where he endeavored all he could to bring the nation to a thorough engagement to redeem and relieve the king who was then a prisoner in the isle of wight and the parliament having raised an army the earl of traquair upon his own charges levied a regiment of horse and mached  the head of them to the battle of prestoun where both his lordship and the lord linton his son were taken prisoners and by order of the english parliament sent to warwick castle where the old earl continued for the space of four years and though he was set at liberty yet the sequestration of his estate was continued nor did the malice of the usurpers abate toward him till they had reduced him to the lowest penury and want that can be imagined and in that disconsolate low condition of fortune he spent the after part of his life till the end of september anno      death put an end to his days  this noble lord married katharine daughter of david the first earl of southesk by whom he had charles his son and heir and four

under yet he still preserved a very good reputation and a very great interest in his country as appeared by the supplies he brought to the kings army at philiphaugh many gentlemen of twedaleshire engaging themselves in the service out of their personal affection to him as well as conscience of the cause and though he survived those times of usurpation and anarchy and saw the king restored yet it cannot be denied he was not recompensed according to his merit or considered as his sufferings deserved but in this his lordship was not singular for the current doctrine of that time was that it

and charers in the earl of wigtouns hands making this clear that the barony of cumbernald belonged  cummings from the time of king william  besides other donations of a less value by daughter of his

gave his descendants a title to assume the coat of frazer into the achievements of their own family and which they still wear even to this time  which sir malcolm fleming lord of fulwood and cumbernald was in great favor with king robert i who in memory of his fathers services and his own merit made him a grant of the lands of achindenan and of pontoun in wigtounshire inventar of the registers of the chancery pene haton de wihaw  but king robert his favors to sir malcolm did not stop here for he did afterward make him sheriff of the county and governor of dunrtoun castle both which offices he discharged with singular fidelity the same great man obtained from walter lord highsteward of scotland in consideration of services done and to be done by him an annuity payable to

his own father constituted governor of dunbartouncastle bess history of king david the bruce  and he discharged the trust with the outmost fidelity for after the fatal overthrow of duplin whereby the royal interest was much weakened the governor having an entire confidence in sir malcolms loyalty committed the tuition of the young king david and his royal consort to his care and things growing every day worse on the kings side after the loss of the battle of halldownhill when it was resolved that for the security of his majestys royal person that he might not fall into the enemies hands to send him over to france sir malcolm fleming was pitched on to wait on his young master which he did and performed the whole of that service with honor and approbation having left the young king in france in full security e returned to his command of dunbertouncastle and tho most other places of strength submitted to edward balo after the battle of hallydownhill yet sir malcolm keept out his foess for his lawful sovereign and during the whole of the usurpation of balil this castle was a place to which the royalists did freely and with great security resort to and it would not be forgot that sir malclm fleming had the honor to shelter and protect in that evil time that ilustrious and magnanimous prince robert lord highsteward of scotland afterward king robert ii the kings nephew whose blood baliol did in a very particular manner thirst after but afterward when the kings affairs took a more favorable turn and that his own presence at home was judged necessary the brave and generous sir malcolm fleming was again sent over to france to attend and wait on the king home who happily arriving on the   of july      on the  th of november thereafter his highness was graciously

with its pertinents as freely as it was enjoyed by his grandfather charta penes comitem de wigtoun   th of king david the second  suspending nevertheless for some reasons of state the regality

general the earl of douglass and many other gallant men were slain  in the   0  sir david was employed in an embassy to england when he concluded a truce betwixt the two realms rymer  and upon his return he had in consideration of his acceptable services a grant of the lands of barbeth castles and henrule in comitatu de carrick charta penes comitem de wigtoun  and of the barony of cavers together with the sheriffship of roxburghshire by recognition isobel countess of mar having dispond these lands and that office without the kings consent  which was ratified by the countesss husband sir alexander stewart knight as to his works of piety i find this memorable viz that he gave to the abbacy of cambuskenneth the lands of muretoun for the health of his soul and to the convent of holyroodhouse he gave in pure and perpetual alms an annuity of twenty five merks out of his estate which he made redeemable from the monks for a hundred pounds when he or his heirs should offer the redemption in any time thereafter as sir david was a very wise and devout man so he seems to have been a person of great generosity for our historians tell us that it was he who gave the exiled earl of northumberland notice of his being to be given up to his sovereign the king of england by an article in a treaty which was then concluded betwixt the two nations whereupon the earl shifted for himself and this act of generosity was so highly resented by sir james douglass who had some pretense that the earl was his prisoner that he set upon sir david at langhermistoun as he was returning home after having conducted prince james to the bass whence he embarked for france and most cruelly murdered him wintons history  with many circumstances of barbarity he married first margaret daughter of sir david barclay lord of brichen by whom he had one daughter marion married to william maule of panmure next isobel heiress of the barony of monycabo by whom he had sir malcolm the heir of the family and sir david of whom sprung the flemings of boghall  which malcolm had the honor of knighthood conferred on him by king robert iii by whose favor he obtained the lady elizabeth stewart daughter of robert duke of albany in marriage charta penes comitem de wigtoun of the barony of biggar which is finely engraven by mr anderson in his book de rebus diplom  during the government of duke murdo his brother in law sir malcolm fleming was frequently employed in managing treaties with england particularly with relation to the redemption of king james i which being happily brought about he was one of the hostages for the ransom but all this signal loyalty did not secure him upon the kings return from being suspected of having concurred in the dukes illegal administration and therefore when the duke of albany was first arrested and made prisoner so was sir malcolm fleming drummonds history of king james i  and others who had been in the dukes greatest confidence but as his greatest crime seems to have been his near alliance with the late regent so the court were soon so sensible of his innocence that he was shortly thereafter released without ever being charged with any particular crime it is plain sir malcolm fleming lived retired and did not meddle in any faction during the reign of king james i probably he was disgusted with the treatment the duke of albanys family had met with yet he stuck close to his friends the douglasses which cost him dear for he was together with the earl of douglass and his younger brother by the contrivance of the lord crichton

unwarrantable and illegal in regard he had not that time allowed him for clearing himself that the law allows the greatest criminal ibidem  and protested that it should not be prejudicial to him likeas there was another instrument taken by sir alexander livingston of calendar who was in the ministry in presence of the bishops of st andrews glasgow dunkeld and dunblain and of the earl of douglass justicegeneral besouth the river of forth whereby he declared upon oath that he had given no counsel assistance or consent to the death and slaughter of sir malcolm fleming this lords father  moreover it would appear that when king james ii himself came to age he was so much satisfied with the injustice sir mallm fleming had met with that he gave order to direct precepts to the sheriffs of the several counties where sir robert flemings estate lay to inseft him as heir to his father who by several inquests of persons of great honor is found and declared to have died at the faith and peace of his sovereign lord king james ii then reigning ibidem  notwithstanding of his pretended forfaulture  but it seems the king did not think the justice of restoring sir robert enough to atone for the sufferings of his father wherefore he was graciously pleased to raise and establish him in the rank of those barons who were henceforth fixed heredetary peers ibidem ad annum       this noble
