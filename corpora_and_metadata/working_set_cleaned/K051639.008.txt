letters and passages restored from the original manuscripts of the history of clarissa to which is subjoined a collection of such of the moral and instructive sentiments cautions aphorisms reflections and observations contained in the history as are presumed to be of general use and service digested under proper heads  published for the sake of doing justice to the purchasers of the two first

unsophisticate by art owns and applauds the labors of thy pen preface to the third edition in eight volumes in twelves and to the fourth edition in octavo the following history is given in a series of letters written principally in a double yet separate correspondence  between two young ladies of virtue and honor bearing an inviolable friendship for each other and writing not merely for amusement but upon the most interesting subjects in which every private family more or less may find itself concerned and  between two gentlemen of free lives one of them glorying in his talents for stratagem and invention and communicating to the other in confidence all the secret purposes of an intriguing head and resolute heart  but here it will be proper to observe for the sake of such as may apprehend hurt to the morals of youth from the more freely written letters that the gentlemen though professed libertines as to the female sex and making it one of their wicked maxims to keep no faith with any of the individuals of it who are thrown into their power are not however either infidels or scoffers nor yet such as think themselves freed from the observance of those other moral duties which bind man to man  on the contrary it will be found in the progress of the work that they very often make such reflections upon each other and each upon himself and his own actions as reasonable beings must make who disbelieve not a future state of rewards and punishments and who one day propose to reform  one of them actually reforming and by that means giving an opportunity to censure the freedoms which fall from the gayer pen and lighter heart of the other  and yet that other although in unbosoming himself to a select friend he discover wickedness enough to entitle him to a general detestation preserves a decency as well in his images as in his language which is not always to be found in the works of some of the most celebrated modern writers whose subjects and characters have less warranted the liberties they have taken  in the letters of the two young ladies it is presumed will be found not only the highest exercise of a reasonable and practicable friendship between minds endowed with the noblest principles of virtue and religion but occasionally interspersed such delicacy of sentiments particularly with regard to the other sex such instances of impartiality each freely as a fundamental principle of their friendship blaming praising and setting right the other as are strongly to be recommended to the observation of the younger part more especially of the female readers  the principal of these two young ladies is proposed as an exemplar to her sex nor is it any objection to her being so that she is not in all respects a perfect character it was not only natural but it was necessary that she should have some faults were it only to show the reader how laudably she could mistrust and blame herself and carry to her own heart divested of selfpartiality the censure which arose from her own convictions and that even to the acquittal of those because revered characters whom no one else would acquit and to whose much greater faults her errors were owing and not to a weak or reproachable heart as far as is consistent with human frailty and as far as she could be perfect considering the people she had to deal with and those with whom she was inseparably connected she is perfect to have been impeccable must have left nothing for the divine grace and a purified state to do and carried our idea of her from woman to angel as such is she often esteemed by the man whose heart was so corrupt that he could hardly believe human nature capable of the purity which on every trial or temptation shone out hers  besides the four principal persons several others are introduced whose letters are characteristic and it is presumed that there will be found in some of them but more especially in those of the chief character among the men and the second character among the women such strokes of gaiety fancy and humor as will entertain and divert and at the same time both warn and instruct  all the letters are written while the hearts of the writers must be supposed to be wholly engaged in their subjects the events at the time generally dubious so that they abound not only with critical situations but with what may be called instantaneous descriptions and reflections proper to be brought home to the breast of the youthful reader as also with affecting conversations many of them written in the dialogue or dramatic way   much more lively and affecting says one of the principal characters must be the style of those who write in the height of a present distress the mind tortured by the pangs of uncertainty the events then hidden in the womb of fate than the dry narrative unanimated style of a person relating difficulties and dangers surmounted can be the relater perfectly at ease and if himself unmoved by his own story not likely greatly to affect the heart of the reader  what will be found to be more particularly aimed at in the following work is  to warn the inconsiderate and thoughtless of the one sex against the base arts and designs of specious contrivers of the other  to caution parents against the undue exercise of their natural authority over their children in the great article of marriage  to warn children against preferring a man of pleasure to a man of probity upon that dangerous but too commonlyreceived notion that a reformed rake makes the best husband  but above all to investigate the highest and most important doctrines not only of morality but of christianity by showing them thrown into action in the conduct of the worthy characters while the unworthy who set those doctrines at defiance are condignly and as may be said consequentially punished  from what has been said considerate readers will not enter upon the perusal of the piece before them as if it were designed only to divert and amuse it will probably be thought tedious to all such as dip into it expecting a light novel or transitory romance and look upon story in it interesting as that is generally allowed to be as its sole end rather than as a vehicle to the instruction  fault having been found particularly by elderly readers and by some who have weak eyes with the smallness of the type on which some parts of the three last volumes were printed which was done in order to bring the work that had extended to an undesirable length into as small a compass as possible the present edition is uniformly printed on the largersized letter of the three made use of before but the doing this together with the additions abovementioned has unavoidably run the seven volumes into eight  the work having been originally published at three different times and a greater distance than was intended having passed between the first publication and the second a preface was thought proper to be affixed to the third and fourth volumes being the second publication a very learned and eminent hand was so kind as to favor the editor at his request with one but the occasion of inserting it being temporary and the editor having been left at liberty to do with it as he pleased it was omitted in the second edition when the whole work came to be printed together as was for the same reason the preface to the first volume and a short advertisement to the reader inserted instead of both that advertisement being also temporary the present address to the reader is substituted in its place  in the second edition an ample table of contents to the whole work was prefixed to the first volume but that having in some measure anticipated the catastrophe and been thought to detain the reader too long from entering upon the history it has been judged advisable to add and that rather than prefix to each volume its particular contents which will serve not only as an index but as a brief recapitulation of the most material passages contained in it and which will enable the reader to connect in his mind the perused volume with that which follows and more clearly show the characters and views of the particular correspondents  an ingenious gentleman having made a collection of many of the moral and instructive sentiments in this history and presented it to the editor he thought the design and usefulness of the work could not be more strikingly exhibited than by inserting it greatly enlarged at the end of the last volume the reader will accordingly find it there digested under proper heads with references to the pages where each caution aphorism reflection or observation is to be found either wrought into the practice of the respective correspondents or recommended by them as useful theory to the youth of both sexes there was a kind of necessity to omit in this volume which contains the restured passages and letters the references to the particular pages as there were two editions to be referred to had they been inserted which would have only served to puzzle and perplex the reader and it is humbly presumed that the sentiments or maxims are generally of such importance as to be sound not unworthy of the observation of the youthful reader although they were not to have the close relation which they have to the history of clarissa   different persons as might be expected have been of different opinions in relation to the conduct of the heroine in particular situations and several worthy persons have objected to the general catastrophe and other parts of the history whatever is thought material of these shall be taken notice of by way of postscript at the conclusion of the history for this work being addressed to the public as a history of life and manners those parts of it which are proposed to carry with them the force of an example ought to be as unobjectible as is consistent with the design of the whole and with human nature  addenda to the

should reflect upon my mother what my dear if her meekness should not be rewarded is the want of reward or the want even of a grateful acknowlegement a reason for us to dispense with what we think our

laboring under a paroxysm and his paroxysms becoming more and more frequent as well as more and mote severe give up her own will her own likings to oblige a husband thus afflicted whose love for her was unquestionable  and if so was it not too natural human nature is not perfect my dear that the husband thus humoured by the wife should be unable to bear control from anybody else much less contradiction from his children  if then you would avoid my highest displeasure you must spare my mother and surely you will allow me with her to pity as well as to love and honor my father  i have no friend but you to whom i can appeal to whom i dare complain unhappily circumstanced as i am it is but too probable that i shall complain because it is but too probable that i shall have more and more cause given me for complaint but be it your part if i do to sooth my angry passions and to soften my resentments and this the rather as you know what an influence your advice has upon me and as you must also know that the fredoms you take with my friends can have no other tendency but to weaken the sense of my duty to them without answering any good end to myself  i cannot help owning etc  vol i

my uncle harlowe were gone away and as they have all engaged to act in concert messengers were dispatched to my uncle and aunt to desire them to be there to breakfast in the morning  monday night    oclock i am afraid i shall not be thought worthy   just as i began to fear i should not be thought worthy of an answer betty wrapped at my door and said if i were not in bed she had a letter for me i had but just done writing the above dialogue and stepped to the door with the pen in my hand  always writing miss said the bold wench it is admirable how you can get away what you write  but the fairies they say are always at hand to help lovers  she retired in so much haste that had i been disposed i could not take the notice of this insolence which it deserved  i enclose my brothers letter he was resolved to let me see that i should have nothing to expect from his kindness but surely he will not be permitted to carry every point the assembling of my friends tomorrow is a good sign and i will hope something from that and from proposals so reasonable and now i will try if any repose will fall to my lot for the remainder of this night   to miss clarissa harlowe inclosed in the preceding

and edit ii p  00 l   after airs accordingly insert nevertheless as i said above i will hope better things from those who have not the interest my brother has to keep open these unhappy differences  tuesday march    would you not have thought my dear miss how as well as i that my proposal must have been accepted and that my brother by the last article of his unbrotherly letter where he threatens to go to scotland if it should be hearkened to was of opinion that it would  for my part after i had read the unkind letter over and over i concluded upon the whole that a reconciliation upon terms so disadvantageous to myself as hardly any other person in my case i dare say would have proposed must be the result of this mornings conference and in that belief i had begun to give myself new trouble in thinking this difficulty over how i should be able to pacify lovelace on that part of my engagement by which i undertook to break off all correspondence with him unless my friends should be brought by the interposition of his powerful friends and any offers they might make which it was rather his part to suggest than mine to intimate to change their minds  thus was i employed not very agreeably you may believe because of the vehemence of the tempers i had to conflict with when breakfastingtime approached and my judges began to arrive  and oh how my heart fluttered on hearing the chariot of the one and then of the other rattle through the courtyard and the hollowsounding footstep giving notice of each persons stepping out to take his place on the awful bench which my fancy had formed for them and my other judges  that thought i is my aunt heryeys that my uncle harlowes now comes my uncle antony and my imagination made a fourth chariot for the odious solmes although it happened that he was not there  and now thought i are they all assembled and now my brother calls upon my sister to make her report now the hardhearted bella interlards her speech with invective now has she concluded her report now they debate upon it  now does my brother flame now threaten to go to scotland now is he chidden and now soothed  and then i ran through the whole conference in my imagination forming speeches for this person and that pro and con till all concluded as i flattered myself in an acceptance of my conditions and in giving directions to have an instrument drawn to tie me up to my good behavior while i supposed all agreed to give solmes a wife every way more worthy of him and with her the promise of my grandfathers estate in case of my forfeiture or dying unmarried on the righteous condition he proposes to entitle himself to it with me  and now thought i am i to be ordered down to recognize my own proposals and how shall i look upon my awful judges how shall i stand the questions of some the set surliness of others the returning love of one or two how shall i be affected  then i wept then i dried my eyes then i practiced at my glass for a look more cheerful than my heart  and now as anything stirred is my sister coming to declare the issue of all tears gushing again my heart fluttering as a bird against its wires drying my eyes again and again to no purpose  and thus my nancy excuse the fanciful prolixity was i employed and such were my thoughts and imaginations when i found a very different result from the hopeful conference  for about ten oclock up came my sister with an air of cruel triumph waving her hand with a light flourish   obedience without reserve is required of you clary my papa is justly incensed that you should presume to dispute his will and to make conditions with him he knows what is best for you and as you own matters are gone a great way between this hated lovelace and you they will believe nothing you say except you will give the only instance that will put them out of doubt of the sincerity of your promises  what child are you surprised  cannot you speak  then it seems you had expected a different issue had you  strange that you could  with all your acknowlegements and confessions so creditable to your noted prudence   i was indeed speechless for some time my eyes were even fixed and ceased to flow but upon the hardhearted bellas proceeding with her airs of insult indeed i was mistaken said i indeed i was  for in you bella i expected i hoped for a sister   what interrupted she with all your mannerly flings and your despising airs did you expect that i was capable of telling stories for you  did you think that when i was asked my own opinion of the sincerity of your declarations i could not tell them how far matters had gone between you and your fellow  when the intention is to bend that stubborn will of yours to your duty do you think i would deceive them  do you think i would encourage them to call you down to contradict all that i should have invented in your favor  well well bella i am the less obliged to you that is all i was willing to think that i had still a brother and sister but i find i am mistaken  pretty mopsaeyed soul was her expression  and was it willing to think it had still a brother and sister and why dont you go on clary mocking my halfweeping accent i thought too i had a father and mother two uncles and an aunt but i am mis  taken that is all  come clary say this and it will in part be true because you have thrown off their authority and because you respect one vile wretch more than them all  how have i deserved this at your hands sister  but i will only say i pity you  and with that disdainful air too clary  none of that bridled neck none of your scornful pity girl i beseech you  this sort of behavior is natural to you surely bella  what new talents does it discover in you  but proceed  if it be a pleasure to you proceed bella and since i must not pity you i will pity myself for nobody else will  because you dont said she   hush bella interrupting her because i dont deserve it  i know you were going to say so i will say as you say in everything and that is the way to please you  then say lovelace is a villain  so i will when i think him so  then you dont think him so  indeed i dont you did not always bella  and what clary mean you by that bristling up to me  tell me what you mean by that reflection  tell me why you call it a reflection  what did i say  thou art a provoking creature  but what say you to two or three duels of that wretchs  i cannot tell what to say unless i knew the occasions  do you justify duelling at all  i do not neither can i help his duelling  will you go down and humble that stubborn spirit of yours to your mamma  i said nothing  shall i conduct your ladyship down offering to take my declined hand  what not vouchsafe to answer me  i turned from her in silence  what turn your back upon me too  shall i bring up your mamma to you love following me and taking my struggling hand what not speak yet come my sullen silent dear speak one word to me  you must say two very soon to mr solmes i can tell you that  then gushing out into tears which i could not hold in longer they shall be the last words i will ever speak  well well insultingly wiping my averted face with her handkerchief while her other hand held mine in a ridiculing tone i am glad anything will make thee speak then you think you may be brought to speak the two words  only they are to be the last  how like a gentle lovyer from its tender bleeding heart was that  ridiculous bella  saucy clary changing her sneering tone to an imperious one but do you think you can humble yourself to go down to your mamma  i am tired with such stuff as this tell me bella if my mamma will condescend to see me  yes if you can be dutiful at last  i can i will  but what call you dutiful  to give up my own inclinations  that is something more for you to tell of  in obedience to my parents commands and to beg i may not be made miserable with a man that is fitter for anybody than for me  for me do you mean clary  why not since you have put the question you have a better opinion of him than i have my friends i hope would not think him too good for me and not good enough for you  but cannot you tell me bella what is to become of me without insulting over me thus  if i must be thus treated remember that if i am guilty of any rashness the usage i meet with will justify it  so clary you are contriving an excuse i find for somewhat that we have not doubted has been in your head a great while  if it were so you seem resolved for your part and so does my brother for his that i shall not want one  but indeed bella i can bear no longer this repetition of the worst part of yesterdays conversation i desire i may throw myself at my fathers and mothers feet and hear from them what their sentence is i shall at least avoid by that means the unsisterly insults i meet with from you  heyday what is this you is it you my meek sister clary  yes it is i bella and i will claim the protection due to a child of the family or to know why i am to be thus treated when i offer only to preserve to myself the liberty of refusal which belongs to my sex and to please my parents would give up my choice i have contented myself till now to take secondhand messengers and firsthand insults you are but my sister my brother is not my sovereign and while i have a father and mother living i will not be thus treated by a brother and sister and their servants all setting upon me as it should seem to make me desperate and to do a rash thing  i will know in short sister bella why i am to be constrained thus  what is intended by it  and whether i am to be considered as a child or a slave  she stood aghast all this time partly with real partly with affected surprise  and is it you is it indeed you  well clary you amaze me but since you are so desirous to refer yourself to your father and mother i will go down and tell them what you say your friends are not yet gone i believe they shall assemble again and then you may come down and plead your own cause in person  let me then but let my brother and you be absent you have made yourselves too much parties against me to sit as my judges and i desire to have none of yours or his interpositions i am sure you could not have represented what i proposed fairly i am sure you could not nor is it possible you should be commissioned to treat me thus  well well i will call up my brother to you  i will indeed  he shall justify himself as well as me  i desire not to see my brother except he will come as a brother laying aside the authority he has unjustly assumed over me  and so clary it is nothing to him or to me is it that our sister shall disgrace her whole family  as how bella disgrace it  the man whom you thus freely treat is a man of birth and fortune he is a man of parts and nobly allied  he was once thought worthy of you and i wish to heaven you had had him i am sure it was not my fault you had not although you treat me thus  this set her into a flame i wish i had forborne it o how the poor bella raved i thought she would have beat me once or twice and she vowed her fingers itched to do so  but i was not worth her anger yet she flamed on  we were heard to be high  and betty came up from my mother to command my sister to attend her  she went down accordingly threatening me with letting every one know what a violent creature i had shown myself to be   tuesday noon march    i have as yet heard no more of my sister and i have not courage enough to insist upon throwing myself at the feet of my father and mother as i thought in my heat of temper i should be able to do and i am now grown as calm as ever and were bella to come up again as fit to be played upon as before  i am indeed sorry that i sent her from me in such disorder but my papas letter threatening me with my uncle antonys house and chapel terrifies me strangely and by their silence i am afraid some new storm is gathering  but what shall i do with this lovelace i have just now by the unsuspected hole in the wall that i told you of in my letter by hannah got a letter from him  so uneasy is he for fear i should be prevailed upon in solmess favor so full of menaces if i am so resenting the usage i receive for how i cannot tell but he has undoubtedly intelligence of all that is done in the family such protestations of inviolable faith and honor such vows of reformation such pressing arguments to escape from this disgraceful confinement  o my nancy what shall i do with this lovelace    vol ii edit i p    l  0 after absurdities call for insert you this passage is inserted

place or in the place of those who are still more indifferent to the case than i can be  if you can  but although i have you not often at advantage i will not push you  permit me however to subjoin

in vol ii p    of the  d edition it will be unnecessary to remind the reader that although mr lovelace proposes as above to miss how that her fair friend should have recourse to the protection of mrs how if farther driven yet he had artfully taken care by means of his agent in the harlowefamily not only to inflame the family against her but to deprive her of mrs howes and of every other protection

apprehensions that it is impossible for me ever to obtain a share in the affections of your beloved daughter o that it were not too evident to every one as well as to myself even to our very servants that my love for her and my assiduities expose me rather to her scorn forgive me madam the hard word than to the treatment due to a man whose proposals have met with your approbation and who loves her above all the women in the world  well might the merit of my passion be doubted if like mr solmes to the truly admirable miss clarissa harlowe i could continue my addresses to miss howes distaste yet what will not the discontinuance cost me  give me leave nevertheless dearest worthiest lady to repeat what i told you on monday night at mrs larkinss with a heart even bursting with grief that i wanted not the treatment of that day to convince me that i am not nor ever can be the object of miss howes voluntary favor what hopes can there be that a lady will ever esteem as a husband the man whom as a lover she despises will not every act of obligingness from such a one be construed an unmanly tameness of spirit and entitle him the more to her disdain  my heart is full forgive me if i say that miss howes treatment of me does no credit either to her education or fine sense  since then it is too evident that she cannot esteem me and since as i have heard it justly observed by the excellent miss clarissa harlowe that love is not a voluntary passion would it not be ungenerous to subject the dear daughter to the displeasure of a mother so justly fond of her and you madam while you are so good as to interest yourself in my favor to uneasiness and why were i to be even sure at last of succeeding by means of your kind partiality to me should i wish to make the bestbeloved of my soul unhappy since mutual must be our happiness or misery for life the consequence to both  my best wishes will for ever attend the dear the everdear lady may her nuptials be happy they must be so if she marry the man she can honor with her love yet i will say that whoever be the happy the thrice happy man he never can love her with a passion more ardent and more sincere than mine  accept dear madam of my most grateful thanks for a distinction that has been the only support of my presumption in the address i am obliged as utterly hopeless to discontinue a distinction on which and not on my own merits i had entirely relied but which i find can avail me nothing to the last hour of my life it will give me pleasure to think that had your favor your recommendation been of sufficient weight to conquer what seems to be an invincible aversion i had been the happiest of men  i am dear madam with inviolable respect your everobliged and faithful humble servant charles hickman   mrs how to charles hickman esquire thursday march  0 i cannot but say mr hickman but you have cause to be dissatisfied  to be out of humor  to be displeased  with nancy  but upon my word but indeed  what shall i say  yet this i will say that you good young gentlemen know nothing at all of our sex shall i tell you  but why should i and yet i will say that if nancy did not think well of you in the main she is too generous to treat you so freely as she does  dont you think she has courage enough to tell me she would not see you and to refuse at any time seeing you as she knows on what account you come if she had not something in her head favorable to you  fie that i am forced to say thus much in writing when i have hinted it to you twenty and twenty times by word of mouth  but if you are so indifferent mr hickman  if you think you can part with her for her skittish tricks  if my interest in your favor  why mr hickman i must tell you that my nancy is worth bearing with if she be foolish  what is that owing to is it not to her wit let me tell you sir you cannot have the convenience without the inconvenience what workman loves not a sharp tool to work with but is there not more danger from a sharp tool than from a blunt one and what workman will throw away a sharp tool because it may cut his fingers wit may be likened to a sharp tool and there is something very pretty in wit let me tell you often and often have i been forced to smile at her arch turns upon me when i could have beat her for them and pray dont i bear a great deal from her  and why because i love her and would you not wish me to judge of your love for her by my own and would not you bear with her  dont you love her what though with another sort of love as well as i do i do assure you sir that if i thought you did not  well but it is plain that you dont  and is it plain that you dont  well then you must do as you think best  well might the merit of your passion be doubted you say if like mr solmes  fiddlesaddle  why you are a captious man i think  has nancy been so plain in her repulses of you as miss clary harlowe has been to mr solmes  does nancy love any man better than you although she may not show so much love to you as you wish for  if she did let me tell you she would have let us all hear of it  what idle comparisons then  but it may be you are tired out it may be you have seen somebody else  it may be you would wish to change mistresses with that gay wretch mr lovelace it may be too that in that case nancy would not be sorry to change lovers  the truly admirable miss clarissa harlowe and the excellent miss clarissa harlowe  goodlack  but take care mr hickman that you do not praise any woman living let her be as admirable and as excellent as she will above your own mistress no polite man will do that surely and take care too that you do not make her or me think you are in earnest in your anger  just though it may be as anger only  i would not for a thousand pounds that nancy should know that you can so easily part with her if you have the love for her which you declare you have be sure if you are not absolutely determined that you do not so much as whisper the contents of this your letter to your own heart as i may say  her treatment of you you say does no credit either to her education or fine sense very home put truly nevertheless so say i but is not hers the disgrace more than yours i can assure you that everybody blames her for it and why do they blame her  why because they think you merit better treatment at her hands and is not this to your credit who but pities you and blames her do the servants who as you observe see her skittish airs disrespect you for them do they not at such times look concerned for you are they not then doubly officious in their respects and services to you  i have observed with pleasure that they are  but you are afraid you shall be thought tame perhaps when married that you shall not be thought manly enough i warrant  and this was poor mr howes fear and many a tug did this lordly fear cost us both god knows  many more than needed i am sure  and more than ought to have been had he known how to bear and forbear as is the duty of those who pretend to have most sense  and pray which would you have to have most sense the woman or the man  well sir and now what remains if you really love nancy so well as you say you do  why i leave that to you you may if you please come to breakfast with me in the morning but with no full heart nor resenting looks i advise you except you can brave it out that have i when provoked done many a time with my husband but never did i get anything by it with my daughter much less will you of which for your observation i thought fit to advertise you as from  your friend annabella how   vol ii edit i p     l   on the words could be gathered add the following note it will be seen this note is inserted vol ii p     of the  d edition in vol i letter xxxiv that mr lovelaces motive for sparing his rosebud was twofold first because his pride was gratified by the grandmothers desiring him to spare her granddaughter many a pretty rogue says he had i spared whom i did not spare had my power been acknowleged and my mercy in time implored but the debellare superbos should be my motto were i to have a new one  his other motive will be explained in the following passage in the same letter i never was so honest for so long together says he since my matriculation it behooves me so to be some way or other my recess at this little inn may be found out and it will then be thought that my rosebud has attracted me a report in my favor from simplicities so amiable may establish me etc  accordingly as the reader will hereafter see mr lovelace finds by the effects his expectations from the contrivance he set on foot by means of his agent joseph leman who plays as above upon betty barnes fully answered though he could not know what passed on the occasion between the two ladies  this explanation is the more necessary to be given as several of our readers through want of due attention have attributed to mr lovelace on his behavior to his rosebud a greater merit than was due to him and moreover imagined that it was improbable that a man who was capable of acting so generously as they supposed in this instance should be guilty of any atrocious vileness not considering that love pride and revenge as he owns in vol i letter xxxi were ingredients of equal force in his composition and that resistance was a stimulus to him  vol iii edit i p  0 l     on the

afterward with too much reserve and even with haughtiness surely those who have thought her to blame on this account have not paid a due attention to the story how early as above and in what immediately follows does he remind her of the terms of distance which she prescribed to him before she was in his power in hopes to leave a door open for the reconciliation with her friends which her heart was set upon and how artfully does he unrequired promise to observe the conditions which she in her present circumstances and situation in pursuance of miss howes advice would gladly have dispensed with  to say nothing of the resentment which she was under a necessity to show at the manner of his getting her away in order to justify to him the sincerity of her refusal to go off with

begin mr lovelaces letter thus thursday apr    why jack thou needst not make such a wonderment as the girls say if i should have taken large strides already toward reformation for do thou not see that while i have been so assiduously night and day pursuing this single charmer i have infinitely less to answer for than otherwise i should have had let me see how many days and nights  forty i believe after open trenches spent in the sap only and never a mine sprung yet  by a moderate computation a dozen kites might have fallen while i have been only trying to ensnare this single lark nor yet do i see when i shall be able to bring her to my lure more innocent days yet therefore  but reformation for my stalkinghorse i hope will be a sure though a slow method to effect all my purposes  then jack thou will have a merit too in engaging my pen since thy time would be otherwise worse employed and after all who knows but by creating new habits at the expense of the old a real reformation may be brought about i have promised it and i believe there is a pleasure to be found in being good reversing that of not lees madmen  which none but good men know  by all this see thounot how greatly preferable it is on twenty accounts to pursue a difficult rather than an easy chase i have a desire to inculcate this pleasure upon thee and to teach thee to fly at nobler game than daws crows and wigeons i have a mind to show thee from time to time in the course of the correspondence thou have so earnestly wished me to begin on this illustrious occasion that these exalted ladies may be abased and to obviate one of the objections that thou made to me when we were last together that the pleasure which attends these nobler aims remunerates not the pains they bring with them since like a paltry fellow as thou were thou assertedst that all women are alike  thou know nothing jack of the delicacies of intrigue nothing of the glory of outwitting the witty and the watchful of the joys that fill the mind of the inventive or contriving genius ruminating which to use of the different webs that offer to him for the entanglement of a haughty charmer who in her day has given him unnumbered torments  thou jack who like a dog at his ease contentest thyself to growl over a bone thrown out to thee do not know the joys of the chase and in pursuing a winding game these i will endeavor to rouse thee to and thou will have reason doubly and trebly to thank me as well because of thy present delight as with regard to thy prospects beyond the moon  to this place i had written purely to amuse myself before i was admitted to my charmer but now i have to tell thee that i was quite right in my conjecture that she would set up for herself and dismiss me for she has declared in so many words that such was her resolution and why because to be plain with me the more she saw of me and of my ways the less she liked of either  this cut me to the heart  i did not cry indeed  had i been a woman i should though and that most plentifully but i pulled out a white cambrick handkerchief that i could command but not my tears  she finds fault with my protestations with my professions with my vows i cannot curse a servant the only privilege a master is known by but i am supposed to be a trooper see vol iii edit i p    edit ii p     i must not say by my soul nor as i hope to be saved why jack how particular this is would she not have me think i have a precious soul as well as she  if she thinks my salvation hopeless what a devil  another exceptionable word does she propose to reform me for  so i have not an ardent expression left me  what can be done etc  vol iii edit i p    l   from the bottom and edit ii p    l ult after her own heart insert well jack thou see it is high time to change my measures i must run into the pious a little faster than i had designed  what a sad thing would it be were i after all to lose her person as well as her opinion the only time that further acquaintance and no blow struck nor suspicion given ever lessened me in a ladys favor a cursed mortification  it is certain i can have no pretense for holding her if she will go  no such thing as force to be used or so much as hinted at lord send us safe at london  that is all i have for it now and yet it must be the least part of my speech  but why will etc  vol iii edit i p  00 l    on the

attention this note is inserted vol iii p  0  of the  d edition of such of the fair sex as are more apt to read for the sake of amusement than instruction is requested to this letter of mr lovelace  vol iii edit i p     l   and edit ii p   0 l    after what i did dele the two following lines and insert had i owned that i was overreached and forced away against my intention might they not as a proof of the truth of my assertion have insisted upon my immediate return to them and if i did not return would they not have reason to suppose that i had now altered my mind if such were my mind or had not the power to return  then were i to have gone back must it not have been upon their own terms no conditioning with a father is a maxim with my father and with my uncles if i would have gone mr lovelace would have opposed it so i must have been under his control or have run away from him as it is supposed i did to him from harloweplace in what a giddy light would this have made me appear  had he constrained me could i have appealed to my friends for their protection without risquing the very consequences to prevent which setting up myself presumptuously as a middle person between flaming spirits i have run into such terrible inconveniences  but after all must it not give me great anguish of mind to be forced to sanctify as i may say by my seeming afterapprobation a measure i was so artfully tricked into and which i was so much resolved not to take  how one evil brings on another is sorrowfully witnessed to by  your everobliged etc  vol iii edit i and ii p         after the date sunday morning dele the seven following paragraphs and read ah this man my dear we have had warmer dialogues than ever yet we have had at fair argument i find i need not fear him see this confirmed by mr lovelace vol iii edit i and ii p     but he is such a wild such an ungovernable creature  he reformed that i am halfafraid of him  he again on my declaring myself uneasy at his stay with me here proposed that i would put myself into lady bettys protection assuring me that he thought he could not leave me at mrs sorlingss with safety to myself and upon my declining to do that for the reasons i gave you in my last ibid p      he urged me to make a demand of my estate  he knew it i told him to be my resolution not to litigate with my father  nor would he put me upon it he replied but as the last thing but if my spirit would not permit me to be obliged as i called it to anybody and yet if my relations would refuse me my own he knew not how i could keep up that spirit without being put to inconveniences which would give him infinite concern  unless  unless  unless he said hesitating as if afraid to speak out  unless i would take the only method i could take to obtain the possession of my own  what is that sir  sure the man saw by my looks when he came with his creeping unlesss that i guessed what he meant  ah madam can you be at a loss to know what that method is  they will not dispute with a man that right which they would contest with you  why said he with a man instead of with him yet he looked as if he wanted to be encouraged to say more  so sir you would have me employ a lawyer would you notwithstanding what i have ever declared as to litigating with my papa  no i would not my dearest creature snatching my hand and pressing it with his lips  except you would make me the lawyer  had he said me at first i should have been above the affectation of mentioning a lawyer  i blushed the man pursued not the subject so ardently but that it was more easy as well as more natural to avoid it than to fall into it  would to heaven he might without offending  but i so overawed him   overawed him  your see vol iii edit i and ii p         notion my dear and so the overawed bashful man went off from the subject repeating his proposal that i would demand my own estate or empower some man of the law to demand it if i would not he put in empower a happier man to demand it but it could not be amiss he thought to acquaint my two trustees that i intended to assume it  i should know better what to do i told him when he was at a distance from me and known to be so i suppose sir that if my father propose my return and engage never to mention solmes to me nor any other man but by my consent and i agree upon that condition to think no more of you you will acquiesce  i was willing to try whether he had the regard to all my previous declarations which he pretended to have to some of them  he was struck all of a heap  what say you mr lovelace you know all you mean is for my good surely i am my own mistress surely i need not ask your leave to make what terms i please for myself so long as i break none with you  he hemmed twice or thrice  why madam why madam i cannot say  then pausing  and rising from his seat with petulance i see plainly enough said he the reason why none of my proposals can be accepted at last i am to be a sacrifice to your reconciliation with your implacable family  it has always been your respectful way mr lovelace to treat my family in this free manner but pray sir when you call others implacable see that you deserve not the same censure yourself  he must needs say there was no love lost between some of my family and him but he had not deserved of them what they had of him  yourself being judge i suppose sir  all the world you yourself madam being judge  then sir let me tell you had you been less upon your defiances they would not have been irritated so much against you but nobody ever heard that avowed despite to the relations of a person was a proper courtship either to that person or to her friends  well madam all that i know is that their malice against me is such that if you determine to sacrifice me you may be reconciled when you please  and all that i know sir is that if i do give my father the power of a negative and he will be contented with that it will be but my duty to give it him and if i preserve one to myself i shall break through no obligation to you  your duty to your capricious brother not to your father you mean madam  if the dispute lay between my brother and me at first surely sir a father may choose which party he will take  he may madam  but that exempts him not from blame for all that if he take the wrong   different people will judge differently mr lovelace of the right and the wrong you judge as you please shall not others as they please and who has a right to control a fathers judgment in his own family and in relation to his own child  i know madam there is no arguing with you but nevertheless i had hoped to have made myself some little merit with you so as that i might not have been the preliminary sacrifice to a reconciliation  your hopes sir had been better grounded if you had had my consent to my abandoning of my fathers house   always madam and for ever to be reminded of the choice you would have made of that damned solmes  rather than   not so hasty not so rash mr lovelace i am convinced that there was no intention to marry me to that solmes on wednesday  so i am told they now give out in order to justify themselves at your expense everybody living madam is obliged to you for your kind thoughts but i  excuse me good mr lovelace waving my hand and bowing that i am willing to think the best of my father  charming creature said he with what a bewitching air is that said  and with a vehemence in his manner would have snatched my hand but i withdrew it being much offended with him  i think madam my sufferings for your sake might have entitled me to some favor  my sufferings sir for your impetuous temper set against your sufferings for my sake i humbly conceive leave me very little your debtor  lord madam assuming a drolling air what have you suffered  nothing but what you can easily forgive you have been only made a prisoner in your fathers house by the way of doing credit to your judgment  you have only had an innocent and faithful servant turned out of your service because you loved her  you have only had your sisters confident servant set over you with leave to teaze and affront you   very well sir  you have only had an insolent brother take upon him to treat you like a slave and as insolent a sister to undermine you in everybodys favor on pretense to keep you out of hands which if as vile as they vilely report are not however half so vile and cruel as their own  go on sir if you please  you have only been persecuted in order to oblige you to have a sordid fellow whom you have professed to hate and whom everybody despises the license has been only got the parson has only been held in readiness the day a near a very near day has been only fixed and you were only to be searched for your correspondencies and still closer confined till the day came in order to deprive you of all means of escaping the snare laid for you  but all this you can forgive you can wish you had stood all this inevitable as the compulsion must have been  and the man who at the hazard of his life has delivered you from all these mortifications is the only person you cannot forgive  cannot you go on sir you see i have patience to hear you cannot you go on sir  i can madam with my sufferings which i confess ought not to be mentioned were i at last to be rewarded in the manner i hoped  your sufferings then if you please sir   affrontingly forbidden your fathers house after encouragement given without any reasons they knew not before to justify the prohibition forced upon a rencounter i wished to avoid the first i ever so provoked wished to avoid and that because the wretch was your brother  wretch sir  and my brother  this could be from no man breathing but from him before me  pardon me madam  but oh how unworthy to be your brother  the quarrel grafted upon an old one when at college he universally known to be the aggressor and revived for views equally sordid and injurious both to yourself and me  giving life to him who would have taken away mine  your generosity this sir not your sufferings a little more of your sufferings if you please  i hope you do not repent that you did not murder my brother  my private life hunted into my morals decried some of the accusers not unfaulty  that is an aspersion sir  spies set upon my conduct one hired to bribe my own servants fidelity perhaps to have poisoned me at last if the honest fellow had not   facts mr lovelace  do you want facts in the display of your sufferings  none of your perhapss i beseech you  menaces every day and defiances put into every ones mouth against me forced to creep about in disguises  and to watch all hours   and in all weathers i suppose sir  that i remember was once your grievance  in all weathers sir see vol iii edit i and ii p       and all these hardships arising from yourself not imposed by me   like a thief or an evesdropper proceeded he and yet neither by birth nor alliances unworthy of their relation whatever i may be and am of their admirable daughter of whom they every one of them are at least as unworthy  these madam i call sufferings justly call so if at last i am to be sacrificed to an imperfect reconciliation  imperfect i say for can you expect to live so much as tolerably under the same roof after all that is passed with that brother and sister  o sir sir what sufferings have yours been and all for my sake i warrant  i can never reward you for them  never think of me more i beseech you  how can you have patience with me  nothing has been owing to your own behavior i presume nothing to your defiances for defiances nothing to your resolution declared more than once that you would be related to a family which nevertheless you would not stoop to ask a relation of nothing in short to courses which everybody blamed you for you not thinking it worth your while to justify yourself had i not thought you used in an ungentlemanly manner as i have heretofore told you you had not had my notice by pen and ink see vol iii edit i and ii p  0  that notice gave you a supposed security and you generously defied my friends the more for it and this brought upon me perhaps not undeservedly my fathers displeasure without which my brothers private pique and selfish views would have wanted a foundation to build upon so that all that followed of my treatment and your redundant onlys i might thank you for principally as you may yourself for all your sufferings your mighty sufferings  and if voluble sir you have founded any merit upon them be so good as to revoke it and look upon me with my forfeited reputation as the only sufferer  for what  pray hear me out sir for he was going to speak have you suffered in but your pride your reputation could not suffer that it was beneath you to be solicitous about and had you not been an unmanageable man i should not have been driven to the extremity i now every hour as the hour passes deplore  with this additional reflection upon myself that i ought not to have begun or having begun not continued a correspondence with one who thought it not worth his while to clear his own character for my sake or to submit to my father for his own in a point wherein every father ought to have an option   darkness light light darkness by my soul  just as you please to have it o charmer of my heart snatching my hand and pressing it between both his to his lips in a strange wild way take me take me to yourself mould me as you please i am wax in your hands give me your own impression and seal me for ever yours  we were born for each other  you to make me happy and save a soul  i am all error all crime i see what i ought to have done but do you think madam i can willingly consent to be sacrificed to a partial reconciliation in which i shall be so great so irreparable a sufferer  anything but that  include me in your terms prescribe to me promise for me as you please  put a halter about my neck and lead me by it upon condition of forgiveness on that disgraceful penance and of a prostration as servile to your fathers presence your brother absent and i will beg his consent at his feet and bear anything but spurning from him because he is your father but to give you up upon cold conditions d  n me said the shocking wretch if i either will or can  these were his words as near as i can remember them for his behavior was so strangely wild and fervent that i was perfectly frighted i thought he would have devoured my hand i wished myself a thousand miles distant from him  i told him i by no means approved of his violent temper he was too boisterous a man for my liking i saw now by the conversation that had passed what was his boasted regard to my injunctions and should take my measures accordingly as he should soon find and with a halffrighted earnestness i desired him to withdraw and leave me to myself  he obeyed and that with extreme complaisance in his manner but with his complexion greatly heightened and a countenance as greatly dissatisfied  but on recollecting all that passed i plainly see that he means not if he can help it to leave me to the liberty of refusing him which i had nevertheless preserved a right to do but looks upon me as his by a strange sort of obligation for having run away with me against my will  yet you see he but touches upon the edges of matrimony neither and that at a time generally when he has either excited ones passions or apprehensions so that one cannot at once descend but surely this cannot be his design  and yet such seemed to be his behavior to my sister see vol i edit i and ii p        when he provoked her to refuse him and so tamely submitted as he did to her refusal  but he dare not  what can one say of so various a man  i am now again out of conceit with him i wish i were fairly out of his power  he has sent up three times to beg admittance in the two last with unusual earnestness but i have sent him word i will first finish what i am about  what to do about going from this place i cannot tell i could stay here with all my heart as i have said to him the gentlewoman and her daughters are desirous that i will although not very convenient for them i believe neither but i see he will not leave me while i do  so i must remove somewhere  i have long been sick of myself and now i am more and more so but let me not lose your good opinion if i do that loss will complete the misfortunes of  your cl harlowe   sunday night  april    i may send to you although you are forbid to write to me may i not  for that is not a correspondence is it where letters are not answered  i am strangely at a loss what to think of this man he is a perfect proteus i can but write according to the shape he assumes at the time dont think me the changeable person i beseech you if in one letter i contradict what i wrote in another nay if i seem to contradict what i said in the same letter for he is a perfect chameleon or rather more variable than the chameleon for that it is said cannot assume the red and the white but this man can and though black seems to be his natural color yet has he taken great pains to make me think him nothing but white  but you shall judge of him as i proceed only if i anywhere appear to you to be credulous i beg you to set me right for you are a standerby as you say in a former see vol iii edit i p       and edit ii p     would to heaven i were not to play for i think after all i am held to a desperate game  before i could finish my last to you he sent up twice more to beg admittance i returned for answer that i would see him at my own time i would neither be invaded nor prescribed to  considering how we parted and my delaying his audience as he sometimes calls it i expected him to be in no very good humor when i admitted of his visit and by what i wrote you will conclude that i was not yet mine soon changed when i saw his extreme humility at his entrance and heard what he had to say  i have a letter madam said he from lady betty lawrance and another from my cousin charlotte but of these more byandby i came now to make my humble acknowlegements to you upon the arguments that passed between us so lately  i was silent wondering what he was driving at  i am a most unhappy creature proceeded he unhappy from a strange impatiency of spirit which i cannot conquer  it always brings upon me deserved humiliation but it is more laudable to acknowledge than to persevere when under the power of conviction  i was still silent  i have been considering what you proposed to me madam that i should acquiesce with such terms as you should think proper to comply with in order to a reconciliation with your friends  well sir  and i find all just all right on your side and all impatience all inconsideration on mine  i stared you may suppose whence this change sir and so soon  i am so much convinced that you must be in the right in all you think fit to insist upon that i shall for the future mistrust myself and if it be possible whenever i differ with you take an hours time for recollection before i give way to that vehemence which an opposition to which i have not been accustomed too often gives me  all this is mighty good sir but to what does it tend  why madam when i came to consider what you had proposed as to the terms of reconciliation with your friends and when i recollected that you had always referred to yourself to approve or reject me according to my merits or demerits i plainly saw that it was rather a condescension in you that you were pleased to ask my consent to those terms than that you were imposing a new law and i now madam beg your pardon for my impatience whatever terms you think proper to come into with your relations which will enable you to honor me with the conditional effect of your promise to me these be pleased to consent to and if i lose you insupportable as that thought is to me yet as it must be by my own fault i ought to thank myself for it  what think you miss how  do you believe he can have any view in this  i cannot see any he could have and i thought it best as he put it in so right a manner to appear not to doubt the sincerity of his confession and to accept of it as sincere  he then read to me part of lady bettys letter turning down the beginning which was a little too severe upon him he said for my eye and i believe by the style the remainder of it was in a corrective strain  it was too plain i told him that he must have great faults that none of his relations could write to him but with mingled censure for some bad action  and it is as plain my dearest creature said he that you who know not of any such faults but by surmise are equally ready to condemn me  will not charity allow you to infer that their charges are no better grounded  and that my principal fault has been carelessness of my character and too little solicitude to clear myself when aspersed which i do assure you is the case  lady betty etc   vol iii edit i p     l   from the bottom and edit ii p     l       after had never erred insert a fine rakish notion and hope and too much encouraged i doubt my dear by the generality of our sex  this brought on a more serious question or two you will see by it what a creature an unmortified libertine is  i asked him if he knew what he had said alluded to a sentence in the best of books that there was more joy in heaven   he took the words out of my mouth  over one sinner that repents than over ninetyandnine just persons which need no repentance luke xv   the parable is concerning the    sheep not the prodigal son as mr lovelace erroneously imagines  were his words  yes madam i thought of it as soon as i said it but not before i have read the story of the prodigal son i will assure you and one day when i am settled as i hope to be will write a dramatic piece on the subject i have at times had it in my head and you will be too ready perhaps to allow me to be qualified for it  you so lately sir stumbled at a word with which you must be better acquainted ere you can be thoroughly master of such a subject that i am amazed you should know anything of the scripture and be so ignorant of that see vol iii edit i p         edit ii p       o madam i have read the bible as a fine piece of ancient history  but as i hope to be saved it has for some few years past made me so uneasy when i have popped upon some passages in it that i have been forced to run to music or company to divert myself  poor wretch lifting up my hands and eyes   the denunciations come so slapdash upon one so unceremoniously as i may say without even the byyourleave of a rude london chairman that they overturn one horse and man as st paul was overturned there is another scripture allusion madam the light in short as his was is too glaring to be borne  o sir do you want to be complimented into repentance and salvation but pray mr lovelace do you mean anything at all when you swear so often as you do by your soul or bind an asseveration with the words as you hope to be saved  o my beloved creature shifting his seat let us call another cause  why sir dont i neither use ceremony enough with you  dearest madam forbear for the present i am but in my noviciate your foundation must be laid brick by brick you will hinder the progress of the good work you would promote if you tumble in a whole waggonload at once upon me  lord bless me thought i what a character is that of a libertine  what a creature am i who have risqued what i have risqued with such a one  what a task before me if my hopes continue of reforming such a wild indian as this  nay worse than a wild indian for a man who errs with his eyes open and against conviction is a thousand times worse for what he knows and much harder to be reclaimed than if he had never known anything at all  i was equally shocked at him and concerned for him and having laid so few bricks to speak to his allusion and those so illcemented i was as willing as the gay inconsiderate to call another cause as he termed it  another cause too more immediately pressing upon me from my uncertain situation  i said etc  vol

perceive that my charmer is more sullen when she receives and has perused a letter from that vixen than at other times but as the sweet maid shows even then more of passive grief than of active spirit i hope she is rather lamenting than plotting and indeed for what now should she plot when i am become a reformed man and am hourly improving in my morals  nevertheless i must contrive some way or other to get at their correspondence  only to see the turn of it that is all  but no attempt of this kind must be made yet a detected invasion in an article so sacred etc  vol iii edit i p     l  0 and edit ii p     l    after if i would insert when he comes to that part where the lady says in a sarcastic way waving her hand and bowing  excuse me good mr lovelace that i am willing to think the best of my father see before p     he gives a description of her air and manner greatly to her advantage and says  i could hardly forbear taking her into my arms upon it in spite of an expected tempest so much wit so much beauty such a lively manner and such exceeding quickness and penetration o belford she must be nobodys but mine i can now account for and justify herods command to destroy his mariamne if he returned not alive from his interview with caesar for were i to know that it were but probable that any other man were to have this charming creature even after my death the very thought would be enough to provoke me to cut that mans throat were he a prince  i may be deemed by this lady a rapid a boisterous lover  and she may like me the less for it but all the ladies i have met with till now loved to raise a tempest and to enjoy it nor did they ever raise it but i enjoyed it too  lord send as once happily to london  mr lovelace gives the following account of his rude rapture when he seized her hand and put her by his wild manner as she expresses it ibid p        into so much terror  darkness and light i swore were convertible at her pleasure she could make any subject plausible i was all error she all perfection and i snatched her hand and more than kissed it i was ready to devour it there was i believe a kind of phrensy in my manner which threw her into a panic like that of semele perhaps when the thunderer in all his majesty surrounded with ten thousand celestial burningglasses was about to scorch her into a cinder  had not my heart misgiven me and had i not just in time recollected that she was not so much in my power but that she might abandon me at her pleasure having more friends in that house than i had i should at that moment have made offers that would have decided all one way or other  but apprehending that i had showed too much meaning in my passion i gave it another turn  but little did the charmer think what an escape either she or i had as the event might have proved from the sudden gust of passion which had like to have blown me into her arms she was born i told her to make me happy and to save a soul  he gives the rest of his vehement speech pretty nearly in the same words as the lady gives them and then proceeds  i saw she was frighted and she would have had reason had the scene been london and that place in london which i have in view to carry her to she confirmed me in my apprehension that i had alarmed her too much she told me that she saw what my boasted regard to her injunctions was and she would take proper measures upon it as i should soon find that she was shocked at my violent airs and if i hoped any favor from her i must that instant withdraw and leave her to her recollection  she pronounced this in such a manner as showed she was set upon it and having stepped out of the gentle the polite part i had so newly engaged to act i thought a ready obedience was the best atonement and indeed i was sensible from her anger and repulses that i wanted time myself for recollection and so i withdrew with the same veneration as a petitioning subject would withdraw from the presence of his sovereign but oh belford had she had but the least patience with me  had she but made me think that she would forgive this initiatory ardor  surely she will not be always thus guarded   i had not been a moment by myself but i was sensible that i had halfforfeited my newlyassumed character it is exceedingly difficult thou see for an honest man to act in disguises as the poet says thrust nature back with a pitchfork it will return i recollected that what she had insisted upon was really a part of that declared will before she left her fathers house to which in another case to humble her i had pretended to have an inviolable regard and when i remembered her words of taking her measures accordingly i was resolved to sacrifice a leg or an arm to make all up again before she had time to determine upon any new measures  how seasonably to this purpose have come in my aunts and cousins letters  i have sent in again and again to implore her to admit me to her presence but she will conclude a letter she is writing to miss how before she will see me  i suppose to give an account of what has just passed  curse upon her perverse tyranny how she makes me wait for an humble audience though she has done writing some time a prince begging for her upon his knees should not prevail upon me to spare her if i can but get her to london  oons jack i believe i have bit my lip through for vexation  but one day hers shall smart for it  mr lovelace beginning a new date gives an account of his admittance and of the conversation that followed which differing only in style from that the lady gives in the next letter is omitted  he collects etc  vol iii edit i p     l   after have them to marry insert nor upon second thoughts this passage is inserted vol iii p     of the  d edition  would the presence of her norton or of her aunt or even of her mother have saved the dear creature had i decreed her fall  vol iii edit i p   0 l    and edit ii p     l    after of your alliance insert they really are every one of them your very great admirers and as for lord m he is so much pleased with you and with the confidence as he calls it which you have reposed in his nephew that he vows he will disinherit him if he reward it not as he ought you must take care that you lose not both families  i hear mrs norton is enjoined as she values the favor of the other family not to correspond either with you or with me  poor creatures  but they are your  yet they are not your relations neither i believe had you had any other nurse i should have concluded you had been changed i suffer by their low malice  excuse me therefore  you really hold this man to his good behavior with more spirit than i thought you mistress of especially when i judged of you by that meekness which you always contended for as the proper distinction of the female character and by the love which think as you please you certainly have for him you may rather be proud of than angry at the imputation since you are the only woman i ever knew read or heard of whose love was so much governed by her prudence but once the indifference of the husband takes place of the ardor of the lover it will be your turn and if i am not mistaken this man who is the only selfadmirer i ever knew who was not a coxcomb will rather in his day expect homage than pay it  your handsome husbands my dear make a wifes heart ache very often and though you are as fine a person of a woman at the least as he is of a man he will take too much delight in himself to think himself more indebted to your favor than you are to his distinction and preference of you but no man take your finer mind with your very fine person can deserve you so you must be contented should your merit be underrated since that must be so marry whom you will perhaps you will think i indulge these sort of reflections against your narcissuss of men to keep my mothers choice for me of hickman in countenance with myself  i dont know but there is something in it at least enough to have given birth to the reflection  i think there can etc  vol iii edit i p     l    and edit ii p     l    after anything of the matter insert we have all our defects we have often regreted the particular fault which though in venerable characters we must have been blind not to see  i remember what you once said to me and the caution was good let us my nancy were your words let us who have not the same failings as those we censure guard against other and greater in ourselves nevertheless i must needs tell you that my mother has vexed me a little very lately by some instances of her jealous narrowness i will mention one of them though i did not intend it she wanted to borrow thirty guineas of me only while she got a note changed i said i could lend her but eight or ten eight or ten would not do she thought i was much richer i could have told her i was much cunninger than to let her know my stock which on a review i find ninetyfive guineas and all of them most heartily at your service  i believe your uncle tony put her upon this wise project for she was out of cash in an hour after he left her if he did you will judge that they intend to distress you if it will provoke you to demand your own in a legal way i wish they would since their putting you upon that course will justify the necessity of your leaving them and as it is not for your credit to own that you were tricked away contrary to your intention this would afford a reason for your going off that i should make very good use of you will see that i approve of lovelaces advice upon this subject i am not willing to allow the weight to your answer to him on that head which perhaps ought to be allowed it see vol iii edit i p     and edit ii p   0   you must be the less surprised at the inventions of this man because of his uncommon talents whatever he had turned his head to he would have excelled in or been or done things extraordinary he is said to be revengeful a very bad quality i believe indeed he is a devil in everything but his foot  this therefore is my repeated advice  provoke him not too much against yourself but unchain him and let him loose upon your sisters vile betty and your brothers joseph leman this is resenting low but i know to whom i write or else i would go a good deal higher i will assure you  your next i suppose etc  vol iii edit i p     l   after am mistress of insert you are afraid this passage is inserted vol iii p     of the  d edition  that my mother will question me on this subject and then you think i must own the truth  but little as i love equivocation and little as you would allow of it in your anna how it is hard if i cannot were i to be put to it ever so closely find something to say that would bring me off and not impeach my veracity with so little money etc  vol iii edit i p  0  add the following paragraph to clarissas letter as to the money this passage is inserted vol iii p  0  of the  d edition you so generously and repeatedly offer dont be angry with me if i again say that i am very desirous that you should be able to averr without the least qualifying or reserve that nothing of that sort has passed between us i know your mothers strong way of putting the question she is intent upon having answered but yet i promise that i will be obliged to nobody but you when i have occasion  vol iii edit i p   0      for the abstracted letters of joseph leman and mr lovelace insert the following to robert lovelace esquire his honor these letters are inserted at large as follows vol iii p          of the  d edition  may it plese your honor sat apr    this is to let your honor kno as how i have been employed in a bisness i would have been excused from if so be i could for it is to gitt evidense

and the two old squiers would not have been abell to be half so hardharted as they be for all what my young master and young mistress says  and here is the sad thing they cannot come to clear up matters with my dearest young lady because as your honor has ordered it they have these stories as if bribed by me out of your honners sarvant which must not be known for fere you should killn and me

grate wit and i a poor crature not worthy notice and your honor able to answer for all but howsomever i am  your honners fethful sarvant in all dewtie joseph leman april    and     mr lovelace to joseph leman monday april    honest joseph you have a worse opinion of your invention than you ought to have i must praise it again of a plain mans head i have not known many better than yours how often have your forecast and discretion answered my wishes in cases which i could not foresee not knowing how my general directions would succeed or what might happen in the execution of them you are too doubtful of your own abilities honest joseph that is your fault but it being a fault that is owing to natural modesty you ought rather to be pitied for it than blamed  the affair of miss betterton was a youthful frolic i love dearly to exercise my invention i do assure you joseph that i have ever had more pleasure in my contrivances than in the end of them i am no sensual man but a man of spirit  one woman is like another  you understand me joseph  in coursing all the sport is made by the winding hare a barndoor chick is better eating now you take me joseph  miss betterton was but a tradesmans daughter the family indeed were grown rich and aimed at a new line of gentry and were unreasonable enough to expect a man of my family would marry her i was honest i gave the young lady no hope of that for she put it to me she resented kept up and was kept up a little innocent contrivance was necessary to get her out  but no rape in the case i assure you joseph  she loved me i loved her indeed when i got her to the inn i asked her no questions it is cruel to ask a modest woman for her consent it is creating difficulties to both had not her friends been officious i had been constant and faithful to her to this day as far as i know  for then i had not known my angel  i went not abroad upon her account she loved me too well to have appeared against me she refused to sign a paper they had drawn up for her to found a prosecution upon and the brutal creatures would not permit the midwifes assistance till her life was in danger and i believe to this her death was owing  i went into mourning for her though abroad at the time a distinction i have ever paid to those worthy creatures who died in childbed by me  i was ever nice in my loves these were the rules i laid down to myself on my entrance into active life to set the mother above want if her friends were cruel and if i could not get her an husband worthy of her to shun common women a piece of justice i owed to innocent ladies as well as to myself to marry off a former mistress if possible before i took to a new one to maintain a lady handsomely in her lyingin to provide for the little one if it lived according to the degree of its mother to go into mourning for the mother if she died and the promise of this was a great comfort to the pretty dears as they grew near their times  all my errors all my expenses have been with and upon women so i could acquit my conscience acting thus honorably by them as well as my discretion as to point of fortune  all men love women and find me a man of more honor in these points if you can joseph  no wonder the sex love me as they do  but now i am strictly virtuous i am reformed so i have been for a long long time resolving to marry as soon as i can prevail upon the most admirable of women to have me i think of nobody else it is impossible i should i have spared very pretty girls for her sake very true joseph so set your honest heart at rest  you see the pains i take to satisfy your qualms  but as to miss betterton  no rape in the case i repeat rapes are unnatural things and more rare than are imagined joseph  i should be loath to be put to such a straight i never was miss betterton was taken from me against her own will in that case her friends not i committed the rape  i have contrived to see the boy twice unknown to the aunt who takes care of him loves him and would not now part with him on any consideration the boy is a fine boy i thank god no father need be ashamed of him he will be well provided for if not i would take care of him he will have his mothers fortune they curse the father ungrateful wretches but bless the boy  upon the whole there is nothing vile in this matter on my side a great deal on the bettertons  wherefore joseph be not thou in pain either for my head or for thy own neck nor for the blue boar nor for thy pretty sow   i love your jesting jesting better becomes a poor man than qualms  i love to have you jest all we say all we do all we wish for is a jest he that makes life itself not so is a sad fellow and has the worst of it  i doubt not joseph but you have had your joys as you say as well as your betters may you have more and more honest joseph  he that grudges a poor man joy ought to have none himself jest on therefore jesting i repeat better becomes thee than qualms  i had no need to tell you of miss betterton did i not furnish you with stories enough without hers against myself to augment your credit with your cunning masters besides i was loath to mention miss betterton her friends being all living and in credit i loved her too for she was taken from me by her cruel friends while our joys were young  but enough of dear miss betterton dear i say for death endears  rest to her worthy soul  there joseph off went a deep sigh to the memory of miss betterton  as to the journey of little titus i now recollect the fellow by his name let that take its course a lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago no process begun in her lifetime refusing herself to give evidence against me whilst she lived  pretty circumstances to found an indictment for a rape upon  as to your young lady the everadorable miss clarissa harlowe i always courted her for a wife others rather expected marriage from the vanity of their own hearts than from my promises for i was always careful of what i promised you know joseph that i have gone beyond my promises to you i do to everybody and why because it is the best way of showing that i have no grudging or narrow spirit a promise is an obligation a just man will keep his promise a generous man will go beyond it this is my rule  if you doubt my honor to your young lady it is more than she does she would not stay with me an hour if she did mine is the steadiest heart in the world have thou not reason to think it so  why this squeamishness then honest joseph  but it is because thou art honest so i forgive thee whoever loves my divine clarissa loves me  let james harlowe call me what names he will for his sisters sake i will bear them do not be concerned for me her favor will make me rich amends his own vilely malicious heart will make his blood boil over at any time and when it does think thou that i will let it touch my conscience  and if not mine why should it touch thine ah joseph joseph what a foolish teazer is thy conscience such a conscience as gives a plain man trouble when he intends to do for the best is weakness not conscience  but say what thou will write all thou know or hear of to me ill have patience with everybody why should i not when it is as much the desire of my heart as it is of thine to prevent mischief  so now joseph having taken all this pains to satisfy thy conscience and answer all thy doubts and to banish all thy fears let me come to a new point  your endeavors and mine which were designed by roundabout ways to reconcile all even against the wills of the most obstinate have not we see answered the end we hoped they would answer but on the contrary have widened the unhappy differences between our families but this has not been either your fault or mine it is owing to the black pitchlike blood of your venomoushearted young master boiling over as he owns that our honest wishes have hitherto been frustrated  yet we must proceed in the same course we shall tire them out in time and they will propose terms and when they do they shall find how reasonable mine shall be little as they deserve from me  persevere therefore joseph honest joseph persevere and unlikely as you may imagine the means our desires will be at last obtained  we have nothing for it now but to go through with our work in the way we have begun for since as i told you in my last my beloved mistrusts you she will blow you up if she be not mine if she be i can and will protect you and as if there will be any fault in her opinion it will be rather mine than yours she must forgive you and keep her husband secrets for the sake of his reputation else she will be guilty of a great failure in her duty so now you have set your hand to the plough joseph there is no looking back  and what is the consequence of all this one labor more and that will be all that will fall to your lot at least of consequence  my beloved is resolved not to think of marriage till she has tried to move her friends to a reconciliation with her you know they are determined not to be reconciled she has it in her head i doubt not to make me submit to the people i hate and if i did they would rather insult me than receive my condescension as they ought she even owns that she will renounce me if they insist upon it provided they will give up solmes so to all appearance i am still as far as ever from the happiness of calling her mine indeed i am more likely than ever to lose her if i cannot contrive some way to avail myself of the present critical situation and then joseph all i have been studying and all you have been doing will signify nothing  at the place where we are we cannot long be private the lodgings are inconvenient for us while both together and while the refuses to marry she wants to get me at a distance from her there are extraordinary convenient lodgings in my eye in london where we could be private and all mischief avoided when there if i get her thither she will insist that i shall leave her miss how is for ever putting her upon contrivances that you know is the reason i have been obliged by your means to play the family off at harloweplace upon mrs how and mrs how upon her daughter  ah joseph  little need for your fears for my angel i only am in danger  but were i the free liver i am reported to be all this could i get over with a wet finger as the saying is  but by the help of one of your hints i have thought of an expedient which will do everything and raise your reputation though already so high higher still this singleton i hear is a fellow who loves enterprising the view he has to get james harlowe to be his principal owner in a larger vessel which he wants to be put into the command of may be the subject of their present close conversation but since he is taught to have so good an opinion of you joseph see vol iii p          of the first edition for the remainder of this letter  etc   vol iii edit i p     l  0 and edit ii p     l   after half so well as now insert has she not demonstrated that even the highest provocations were not sufficient to warp her from her duty to her parents though a native and as i may say an originally involuntary duty because native and is not this a charming earnest that she will sacredly observe a still higher duty into which she proposes to enter when she does enter by plighted vows and entirely as a volunteer  that she loves thee etc  vol iii edit i p     l     0 after proper to be frustrated dele the rest of that paragraph and all the following and read if you consider this passage is inserted vol iii p         of the  d edition this malediction as it ought to be considered a person of your piety must and will rather pity and pray for your rash father than terrify yourself on the occasion none but god can curse parents or others whoever they be can only pray to him to curse and such prayers can have no weight with a just and allperfect being the motives to which are unreasonable and the end proposed by them cruel  has not god commanded us to bless and curse not pray for your father then i repeat that he incur not the malediction he has announced on you since he has broken as you see a command truly divine while you by obeying that other precept which enjoins us to pray for them that persecute and curse us will turn the curse into a blessing  my mother blames them etc  vol iii edit i p     l    and edit ii p     l    dele the paragraph beginning i will not repeat and read you assume my dear says she your usual and everagreeable style in what you write of the two gentlemen and how unaptly you think they have chosen mr hickman in addressing you mr lovelace me but i am inclinable to believe that with a view to happiness however two mild tempers might agree two high ones would make sad work of it both at one time violent and unyielding you two might indeed have raqueted the ball betwixt you as you say but mr hickman by his gentle manners seems formed for you if you go not too far with him if you do it would be a tameness in him to bear it which would make a man more contemptible than mr hickman can ever deserve to be made nor is it a disgrace for even a brave man who knows what a woman is to vow to him afterward to be very obsequious beforehand  do you think it is to the credit of mr lovelaces character that he can be offensive and violent does he not as all such spirits must subject himself to the necessity of making submissions for his excesses far more mortifying to a proud heart than those condescensions which the highspirited are so apt to impute as a weakness of mind in such a man as mr hickman  let me tell you my dear that mr hickman is such a one as would rather bear an affront from a lady than offer one to her he had rather i dare say that she should have occasion to ask his pardon than he hers but my dear you have outlived your first passion and had the second man been an angel he would not have been more than indifferent to you  my motives for suspending etc  vol iii edit i p     l   from the bottom and edit ii p     l    from the bottom after would repeat it insert i see with great regret that your mamma is still immoveably bent against our correspondence what shall i do about it  it goes against me to continue it or to wish you to favor me with returns  yet i have so managed my matters that i have no friend but you to advise with it is enough to make one indeed wish to be married to this man though a man of errors as he has worthy relations of my own sex and i should have some friends i hope  and having some i might have more  for as money is said to increase money so does the countenance of persons of character increase friends while the destitute must be destitute  it goes against my heart to beg of you to discontinue corresponding with me and yet it is against my conscience to carry it on against parental prohibition but i dare not use all the arguments against it that i could use  and why  for fear i should convince you and you should reject me as the rest of my friends have done i leave therefore the determination of this point upon you  i am not i find to be trusted with it but be mine all the fault and all the punishment if it be punishable  and certainly it must when it can be the cause of those overlively sentences wherewith you conclude the letter i

with her for not praising me for this my delicacy when she is so ready to call me to account for the least failure in punctilio however i believe i can excuse her too upon this generous consideration

into her own and the colonels praises and tourville and mowbray may be both her vouchers  i and you and belton must be only hearsay confirmers  as poverty is generally suspectible the widow must be got handsomely aforehand and no doubt but she is the elegance of her house and furniture and her readiness to discharge all demands upon her which she does with ostentation enough and which makes her neighbors i suppose like her the better demonstrate this she will propose to do handsome things by her two nieces sally is near marriage  with an eminent woolendraper in the strand if ye have a mind

keep thy brothervarlets from blundering for as thou must have observed from what i have written we have the most watchful and most penetrating lady in the world to deal with a lady worth deceiving but whose eyes will pierce to the bottom of your shallow souls the moment she hears you open do thou therefore place thyself between mowbray and tourville their toes to be played upon and commanded by thine if they go wrong thy elbows to be the ministers of approbation  as to your general behavior no hypocrisy  i hate it so does my charmer if i had studied for it i believe i could have been an hypocrite but my general character is so well known that i should have been suspected at once had i aimed at making myself too white but what necessity can there be for hypocrisy unless the generality of the sex were to refuse us for our immoralities the best of them love to have the credit of reforming us let the sweet souls try for it if they fail their intent was good that will be a consolation to them and as to us our work will be the easier our sins the fewer since they will draw themselves in with a very little of our help and we shall save a parcel of cursed falsehoods and appear to be what we are both to angels and men mean time their very grandmothers will acquit us and reproach them with their selfdo selfhave and as having erred against knowledge and ventured against manifest appearances what folly therefore for men of our character to be hypocrites  be sure to instruct the rest and do thou thyself remember not to talk obscenely you know i never permitted any of you to talk obscenely time enough for that when ye grow old and can only talk besides ye must consider priscs affected character my goddesss real one far from obscenity therefore do not so much as touch upon the double entendre what as i have often said cannot you touch a ladys heart without wounding her ear  it is necessary that ye should appear worse men than myself you cannot help appearing so you will

oppose him but fear not i shall not give the argument all my force  she must have some curiosity i think to see what sort of men my companions are she will not expect any of you to be saints are ye

it not require great virtue to forbear the use of that power is not the devil said to be the god of this world are we not children of this world well then  let me tell thee my opinion  it is this that

request of so fine a young lady who had engaged to honor me at my collation on condition that my beloved would be present at it  to be obliged to appear before my friends as what she was not she was for insisting that i should acquaint the women here with the truth of the matter and not go on propagating stories for her to countenance making her a sharer in my guilt  but what points will not perseverance carry especially when it is covered over with the face of yielding now and parthianlike returning to the charge anon do not the sex carry all their points with their men by the same methods have i conversed with them so freely as i have done and learnt nothing of them did thou ever know that a womans denial of any favor whether the least or the greatest that my heart was set upon stood her in any stead the more perverse she the more steady i that is my rule  but the point thus so much against her will carried i doubt thou will see in her more of a sullen than of an obliging charmer for when miss partington was withdrawn what was miss partington to her in her situation she wanted no new acquaintance and what were my four friends to her in her present circumstances she would assure me if ever again  and there she stopped with a twirl of her hand  when we meet i will in her presence tipping thee a wink show thee the motion for it was a very pretty one quite new yet have i seen an hundred pretty passionate twirls too in my time from other fairones how universally engaging it is to put a woman of sense to whom a man is not married in a passion let the reception given to every ranting scene in our plays testify take care my charmer now thou art come to delight me with thy angry twirls that thou temptest me not to provoke a varicty of them from one whose every motion whose every air carries in it so much sense and soul  but angry or pleased this charming creature must be all loveliness her features are all harmony and made for one another no other feature

them on her resolution to go to church and of his proposal of st pauls and desire of attending her she praises his good behavior there as also the discourse and the preacher is pleased with its seasonableness gives particulars of the conversation between them afterward and commends the good observations he makes upon the sermon  i am willing says she to have hopes of him but am so unable to know how to depend upon his seriousness for an hour together that all my favorable accounts of him in this respect must be taken with allowance  being very much pressed i could not tell how to refuse dining with the widow and her nieces this day i am better pleased with them than i ever thought i should be i cannot help blaming myself for my readiness to give severe censures where reputation is concerned peoples ways humors constitutions education and opportunities allowed for my dear many persons as far as i know may appear blameless whom others of different humors and educations are too apt to blame and who from the same fault may be as ready to blame them i will therefore make it a rule to myself for the future never to judge peremptorily on first appearances but yet i must observe that these are not people i should choose to be intimate with or whose ways i can like although for the stations they are in they may go through the world with tolerable credit  mr lovelaces behavior has been such as makes me call this so far as it is passed an agreeable day yet when easiest as to him my situation with my friends takes place in my thoughts and causes me many a tear  i am the more pleased with the people of the house because of the persons of rank they are acquainted with and who visit them   sunday evening i am still well pleased with mr lovelaces behavior we have had a good deal of serious discourse together the man has really just and good notions he confesses how much he is pleased with this day and hopes for many such nevertheless he ingenuously warned me that his unlucky vivacity might return but he doubted not that he should be fixed at last by my example and conversation  he has given me an entertaining account of the four gentlemen he is to meet tomorrow night entertaining i mean for his humorous description of their persons manners etc but such a description as is far from being to their praise yet he seemed rather to design to divert my melancholy it than to degrade them i think at bottom my dear that he must be a goodnatured man but that he was spoiled young for want of check or control  i cannot but call this my circumstances considered an happy day to the end of it indeed my dear i think i could prefer him to all the men i ever knew were he but to be always what he has been this day you see how ready i am to own all you have charged me with when i find myself out it is a difficult thing i believe sometimes for a young creature that is able to deliberate with herself to know when she loves or when she hates but i am resolved as much as possible to be determined both in my hatred and love by actions as they make the man worthy or unworthy  she dates again on monday and declares herself highly displeased etc vol iii edit i p     l

piddle before you nowandthen if her viands be unsavory swallowing with them a relishing tear or two then she comes to eat and drink to oblige you then resolves to live for your sake her exclamations will in the next place be turned into blandishments her vehement upbraidings into gentle murmurings  how dare you traitor  into how could you dearest she will draw you to her instead of pushing you from her no longer with unsheathed claws will she resist you but like a pretty playful wanton kitten with gentle paws and concealed talons tap your cheek and with intermingled smiles and tears and caresses implore your consideration for her and your constancy all the favor she then has to ask of you  and this is the time were it given to man to confine himself to one object to be happier every day than other  now belford were i to go no farther than i have gone with my beloved miss harlowe how shall i know the difference between her and another bird to let her fly now what a pretty jest would that be how do i know except i try whether she may not be brought to sing me a fine song and to be as well contented as i have brought other birds to be and very shy ones too  but now let us reflect a little upon the confounded partiality of us human creatures i can give two or three familiar and if they were not familiar they would be shocking instances of the cruelty both of men and women with respect to other creatures perhaps as worthy as at least more innocent than themselves by my soul jack there is more of the savage in human nature than we are commonly aware of nor is it after all so much amiss that we sometimes avenge the more innocent animals upon our own species  to particulars  how usual a thing is it for women as well as men without the least remorse to ensnare to cage and torment and even with burning knittingneedles to put out the eyes of the poor feathered songster thou see i have not yet done with birds which however in proportion to its bulk has more life than themselves for a bird is all soul and of consequence has as much feeling as the human creature when at the same time if an honest fellow by the gentlest persuasion and the softest arts has the good luck to prevail upon a mewdup lady to countenance her own escape and she consents to break cage and be set a flying into the allchearing air of liberty mercy on us what an outcry is generally raised against him  just like what you and i once saw raised in a paltry village near chelmsford after a poor hungry fox who watching his opportunity had seized by the neck and shouldered a sleekfeathered goose at what time we beheld the whole vicinage of boys and girls old men and old women all the furrows and wrinkles of the latter filled up with malice for the time the old men armed with prongs pitchforks clubs and catsticks the old women with mops brooms fireshovels tongs and pokers and the younger fry with dirt stones and brickbats gathering as they ran like a snowball in pursuit of the windoutstripping prowler all the mongrel curs of the circumjacencies yelp yelp yelp at their heels completing the horrid chorus  remembrest thou not this scene surely thou must my imagination inflamed by a tender sympathy for the danger of the adventurous marauder represents it to my eye as if it were but yesterday and do thou not recollect how generously glad we were as if our own case that honest reynard by the help of a lucky style over which both old and young tumbled upon one another and a winding course escaped their brutal fury and flying catsticks and how in fancy we followed him to his undiscovered retreat and imagined we beheld the intrepid thief enjoying his dearearned purchase with a delight proportioned to his past danger  i once made a charming little savage severely repent the delight she took in seeing her tabby favorite make cruel sport with a pretty sleek beadeyed mouse before she devoured it egad my love said i to myself as i sat meditating the scene i am determined to lie in wait for a fit opportunity to try how thou will like to be tossed over my head and be caught again how thou will like to be patted from me and pulled to me yet will i rather give life than take it away as this barbarous quadrupede has at last done by her prey and after all was over between my girl and me i reminded her of the incident to which my resolution was owing  nor had i at another time any mercy upon the daughter of an old epicure who had taught the girl without the least remorse to roast lobsters alive to cause a poor pig to be whipped to death to scrape carp the contrary way of the scales making them leap in the stew pan and dressing them in their own blood for sauce and this for luxurysake and to provoke an appetite which i had without stimulation in my way and that i can tell thee a very ravenous one  many more instances of the like nature could i give were i to leave nothing to thyself to show that the best take the same liberties and perhaps worse with some sort of creatures that we take with others all creatures still and creatures too as i have observed above replete with strong life and sensible feeling  if therefore people pretend to mercy let mercy go through all their actions i have read somewhere that a merciful man is merciful to his beast  so much at present for those parts of thy letter in which thou urgest to me motives of

dreads is now to be dreaded  i have the highest opinion that man can have thou know i have of the merit and perfections of this admirable woman of her virtue and honor too although thou in a former

been too much attached i had not taken the pains to attempt so officiously as i did the prevention of mischief between him and some of my family which first induced the correspondence between us and was the occasion of bringing the apprehended mischief with double weight upon myself my vanity and conceit as far as i know might have part in the inconsiderate measure for does it not look as if i thought myself more capable of obviating difficulties than anybody else of my family  but you must not my dear suppose my heart to be still a confederate with my eye that deluded eye now clearly sees its fault and the misled heart despises it for it hence the application i am making to my uncle hence it is that i can say i think truly that i would atone for my fault at any rate even by the

not be supposed to know so much of his designs as the reader does by means of his letters to belford yet she was but too well convinced of his faulty morals and of the necessity there was from the

her neglected education as it is matter of so much regret to herself else there would not be much in it as the low and illiterate are the most useful people in the commonwealth since such constitute the laboring part of the public and as a lettered education but too generally sets people above those servile offices by which the business of the world is carried on nor have i any doubt that there are take the world through twenty happy people among the unlettered to one among those who have had a school education  this however concludes not against learning or letters since one would wish to lift to some little distinction and more genteel usefulness those who have capacity and whose parentage one respects or whose services one would wish to reward  were my mind quite at ease i could enlarge perhaps not unusefully upon this subject for i have considered it with as much attention as my years and little experience and observation will permit  but the extreme illiterateness and indocility of this maid are surprising considering that she wants not inquisitiveness appears willing to learn and in other respects has quick parts this confirms to me what i have heard remarked that there is a docible season a learningtime as i may say for every person in which the mind may be led step by step from the lower to the higher year by year to improvement how industriously ought these seasons as they offer to be taken hold of by tutors parents and other friends to whom the cultivation of the genius of children and youth is committed since once elapsed and no foundation laid they hardly ever return  and yet it must be confessed that there are some geniuss which like some fruits ripen not till late and industry and perseverance will do prodigious things  but for a learner to have those first rudiments to master at twenty years of age suppose which others are taught and they themselves might have attained at ten what an uphill labor  these kind of observations you have always wished me to intersperse as they arise to my thoughts but it is a sign that my prospects are a little mended or i should not among so many more interesting ones that my mind has been of late filled with have had heartsease enough to make them  let me give you my reflections on my more hopeful prospects  i am now in the first place better able to account for the delays about the house than i was before  poor mrs fretchville  though i know her not i pity her  next it looks well that he had apprised the women before this conversation with them of his intention to stay in this house after i was removed to the other by the tone of his voice he seemed concerned for the appearance this new delay would have with me  so handsomely did miss martin express herself of me that i am sorry methinks that i judged so hardly of her when i first came hither  free people may go a great way but not all the way and as such are generally unguarded precipitate and thoughtless the same quickness changeableness and suddenness of spirit as i may call it may intervene if the heart be not corrupted to recover them to thought and duty  his reason for declining to go in person to bring up the ladies of his family while my brother and singleton continue their machinations carries no bad face with it and one may the rather allow for their expectations that so proud a spirit as his should attend them for this purpose as he speaks of them sometimes as persons of punctilio  other reasons i will mention for my being easier in my mind than i was before i overheard this conversation  such as the advice he has received in relation to singletons mate which agrees but too well with what you my dear wrote to me in yours of may the  0th  his not intending to acquaint me with it  his cautions to the servants about the sailor if he should come and make enquiries about us  his resolution to avoid violence were he to fall in either with my brother or this singleton and the easy method he has chalked out in this case to prevent mischief since i need only not to deny my being his but yet i should be exceedingly unhappy in my own opinion to be driven into such a tacit acknowlegement to any new persons till i am so although i have been led so much against my liking to give countenance to the belief of the persons below that we are married  i think myself obliged from what passed between mr lovelace and me on wednesday and from what i overheard him say to consent to go with him to the play and the rather as he had the discretion to propose one of the nieces to accompany me  i cannot but acknowledge that i am pleased to find that he has actually written to lord m  i have promised to give mr lovelace an answer to his proposals as soon as i have heard from you my dear on the subject  i hope that in my next letter i shall have reason to confirm these favorable appearances favorable i must think them in the wreck i have suffered  i hope that in the trial which you hint may happen between me and myself as you see before p    express it if he should so behave as to oblige me to leave him i shall be able to act in such a manner as to bring no discredit upon myself in your eye and that is all now that i have to wish for but if i value him so much as you are pleased to suppose i do the trial which you imagine will be so difficult to me will not i conceive be upon getting from him when the means to effect my escape are lent me but how i shall behave when got from him and if like the israelites of old i shall be so weak as to wish to return to my egyptian bondage  i think it will not be amiss notwithstanding the present favorable appearances that you should perfect the scheme whatever it be which you tell me you have thought of in order to procure for me an asylum in case of necessity mr lovelace is certainly a deep and dangerous man and it is therefore but prudence to be watchful and to be provided against the worst lord bless me my dear how am i reduced  could i ever have thought to be in such a situation as to be obliged to stay with a man of whose honor by me i could have but the shadow of a doubt  but i will look forward and hope the best  i am certain that your letters are safe  be perfectly easy therefore on that head  mr lovelace will never be out of my company by his good will otherwise i have no doubt that i am

and so he ought to think as i to have that observed too much in his power cast upon him by the cruelty of my relations no other protection to fly to but his one plain path before us yet such embarrasses such difficulties such subjects for doubt for cavil for uneasiness as fast as one is obviated another to be introduced and not by myself  i know not how introduced  what pleasure can i propose to myself in meeting such a wretch  perfect for me my dearest miss how perfect for me i beseech you your kind scheme with mrs townsend and i will then leave this man  my temper i believe is changed no wonder if it be i question whether ever it will be what it was but i cannot make him half so uneasy by the change as i am myself see you not how from step to step he grows upon me  i tremble to look back upon his encroachments and now to give me cause to apprehend more evil from him than indignation will permit me to express  o my dear perfect your scheme and let me fly from so strange a wretch  yet to be first an eloper from my friends to him as the world supposes and now to be so from him to whom i know not how hard to one who ever endeavored to shun intricate paths but he must certainly have views in quarreling with me thus which he dare not own  yet what can they be  i am terrified but to think of what they may be  let me but get from him  as to my reputation if i leave him  that is already too much wounded for me now to be careful about anything but how to act so as that my own heart shall not reproach me as to the worlds censure i must be content to suffer that  an unhappy composition however  what a wreck have my fortunes suffered to be obliged to throw overboard so many valuables to preserve indeed the only valuable  a composition that once it would have halfbroken my heart to think there would have been the least danger that i should be obliged to submit to  you my dear could not be a stranger to my most secret failings although you would not tell me of them what a pride did i take in the applause of every one  what a pride even in supposing i had not that pride  which concealed itself from my unexamining heart under the specious veil of humility doubling the merit to myself by the supposed and indeed imputed gracefulness in the manner of conferring benefits when i had not a single merit in what i did vastly overpaid by the pleasure of doing some little good and impelled as i may say by talents given me  for what  not to be proud of  so desirous in short to be considered as an example a vanity which my partial admirers put into my head  and so secure in my own virtue  i am punished enough enough mortified for this my vanity  i hope enough if it so please the allgracious inflicter since now i verily think i more despise myself for my presumptuous selfsecurity as well as vanity than ever i secretly vaunted myself on my good inclinations secretly i say however for indeed i had not given myself leisure to reflect till i was thus mortified how very imperfect i was nor how much truth there is in what divines tell us that we sin in our best performances  but i was very young  but here let me watch over myself again for in those four words i was very young is there not a palliation couched that were enough to take all efficacy from the discovery and confession  what strange imperfect beings  but self here which is at the bottom of all we do and of all we wish is the grand misleader  i will not apologize to you my dear for these grave reflections is it not enough to make the unhappy creature look into herself and endeavor to detect herself who from such an high reputation left to proud and presumptuous self should by one thoughtless step be brought to the dreadful situation i am in  let me however look forward to despond would be to add sin to sin and whom have i to raise me up whom to comfort me if i desert myself  thou o father who i hope have not yet deserted have not yet cursed me  for i am thine  it is

has only acted by thy impulse through thy agent joseph leman upon the folly of old tony the uncle  no matter for that she believes she acts upon her own judgment and deserves to be punished for pretending to judgment when she has none  every living soul but myself i can tell thee shall be punished that treats either cruelly or disrespectfully so adored a lady  what a plague is it not enough that she is teazed and tormented in person by me  i have already broken the matter to our three confederates as a supposed not a resolvedon case indeed and yet they know that with me in a piece of mischief execution with its swiftest feet is seldom three paces behind projection which hardly ever limps neither  mowbray is not against it it is a scheme he says worthy of us and we have not done anything for a good while that has made a noise  belton indeed hesitates a little because matters go wrong between him and his thomasine and the poor fellow has not the courage to have his sore place probed to the bottom  tourville has started a fresh game and shrugs his shoulders and should not choose to go abroad at present if i please for i apprehend that from the nature of the project there will be a kind of necessity to travel till all is blown over  to me one country is as good as another and i shall soon i suppose choose to quit this paltry island except the mistress of my fate will consent to cohabit at home and so lay me under no necessity of surprising her into foreign parts traveling thou know gives the sexes charming opportunities of being familiar with one another a very few days and nights must now decide all matters betwixt me and my fair inimitable  doleman who can act in these causes only as chambercounsel will inform us by pen and ink his right hand and right side having not yet been struck and the other side beginning to be sensible of all that shall occur in our absence  as for thee we had rather have thy company than not for although thou art a wretched fellow at contrivance yet art thou intrepid at execution but as thy present engagements make thy attendance uncertain i am not for making thy part necessary to our scheme but for leaving thee to come after us when abroad i know thou can not long live without us  the project in short is this  mrs how has an elder sister in the isle of wight who is lately a widow and i am well informed that the mother and daughter have engaged before the latter is married to pay a visit to this lady who is rich and intends miss for her heiress and in the interim will make her some valuable presents on her approaching nuptials which as mrs how who loves money more than anything but herself told one of my acquaintance would be worth fetching  now jack nothing more need be done than to hire a little trim vessel which shall sail a pleasuring backward and forward to portsmouth spithead and the isle of wight for a week or fortnight before we enter upon our parts of the plot and as mrs how will be for making the best bargain she can for her passage the master of the vessel may have orders as a perquisite allowed him by his owners to take what she will give and the masters name be it what it will shall be ganmore on the occasion for i know a rogue of that name who is not obliged to be of any country any more than we  well then we will imagine them on board i will be there in disguise they know not any of ye four  supposing the scheme so inviting that thou can be one  it is plaguey hard if we cannot find or make a storm  perhaps they will be seasick but whether they be or not no doubt they will keep their cabin  here will be mrs how miss how mr hickman a maid and a footman i suppose and thus we will order it  i know it will be hard weather i know it will and before there can be the least suspicion of the matter we shall be in sight of guernsey jersey dieppe cherbourg or anywhither on the french coast that it shall please us to agree with the winds to blow us and then securing the footman and the women being separated one of us according to lots that may be cast shall overcome either by persuasion or force the maidservant that will be no hard task and she is a likely wench i have seen her often one mrs how nor can there be much difficulty there for she is full of health and life and has been long a widow another  that says the princely lion must be i the saucy daughter who will be too much frighted to make great resistance  violent spirits in that sex are seldom true spirits  it is but where they can   and after beating about the coast for three or four days for recreations sake and to make sure work and till we see our sullen birds begin to eat and sip we will set them all ashore where it will be most convenient sell the vessel to mrs townsends agents with all my heart or to some other smugglers or give it to ganmore and pursue our travels and tarry abroad till all is hushed up  now i know thou will make difficulties as it is thy way while it is mine to conquer them my other vassals made theirs and i condescended to obviate them as thus i will thine first stating them for thee according to what i know of thy phlegm  what in the first place will thou ask shall be done with hickman who will be in full parade of dress and primness in order to show the old aunt what a devilish clever fellow of a nephew she is to have  what  i will tell thee  hickman

will thou  no no  that is not necessary to the project  i hate to do mischiefs supererogatory the skiff shall be ready to save him while the vessel keeps its course he shall be set on shore with the loss of wig and hat only and of half of his little wits at the place where he embarked or anywhere else  well but shall we not be in danger of being hanged for three such enormous rapes although hickman should escape with only a bellyful of seawater  yes to be sure when caught  but is there any likelihood of that  besides have we not been in danger before now for worse facts  and what is there in being only in danger  if we actually were to appear in open day in england before matters are made up there will be greater likelihood that these women will not prosecute than that they will  for my own part i should wish they may would not a brave fellow choose to appear in court to such an arraignment confronting women who would do credit to his attempt the country is more merciful in these cases than in any others i should therefore like to put myself upon my country  let me indulge a few reflections upon what thou may think the worst that can happen i will suppose that thou art one of us and that all five are actually brought to trial on this occasion how bravely shall we enter a court i at the head of you dressed out each man as if to his weddingappearance  you are sure of all the women old and young of your side  what brave fellows  what fine gentlemen  there goes a charming handsome man  meaning me to be sure  who could find in their hearts to hang such a gentleman as that whispers one lady sitting perhaps on the right hand of the recorder i suppose the scene to be in london while another disbelieves that any woman could fairly swear against me all will crowd after me it will be each mans happiness if ye shall chance to be bashful to be neglected i shall be found to be the greatest criminal and my safety for which the general voice will be engaged will be yours  but then comes the triumph of triumph that will make the accused look up while the accusers are covered with confusion  make room there  stand by  give back  one receiving a rap another an elbow half a score a push apiece   enter the slowmoving hoodedfaced downlooking plaintiffs   and first the widow with a sorrowful countenance though halfveild pitying her daughter more than herself the people the women especially who on this occasion will be fivesixths of the spectators reproaching her  you would have the conscience would you to have five such brave gentlemen as these hanged for you know not what  next comes the poor maid  who perhaps had been ravished twenty times before and had not appeared now but for companysake mincing simpering weeping by turns not knowing whether she should be sorry or glad  but every eye dwells upon miss  see see the handsome gentleman bows to her  to the very ground to be sure i shall bow and kiss my hand  see her confusion see she turns from him  ay that is because it is in open court cries an arch one  while others admire her  ay that is a girl worth venturing ones neck for  then we shall be praised  even the judges and the whole crowded bench will acquit us in their hearts and every single man wish he had been me  the women all the time disclaiming prosecution were the case to be their own to be sure belford the sufferers cannot put half so good a face upon the matter as we  then what a noise will this matter make  is it not enough suppose us moving from the prison to the sessions house within these few years past a passage has been made from the prison to the sssions house whereby malefactors are carried into court without going through the street lovelaces triumph on their supposd march shows the wisdom of this alteration  to make a noble heart thump it away most gloriously when such an one finds himself attended to his trial by a parade of guards and officers of miens and aspects warlike and unwarlike himself their whole care and their business  weapons in their hands some bright some rusty equally venerable for their antiquity and inoffensiveness others of more authoritative demeanor strutting before with fine painted staves shoals of people following with a which is he whom the young lady appears against  then let us look down look up look round which way we will we shall see all the doors the shops the windows the signirons and balconies garrets gutters and chimneytops included all whitecapt blackhooded and periwiggd or cropeard up by the immobile vulgus while the floating streetswarmers who have seen us pass by at one place run with stretchedout necks and strained eye balls a roundabout way and elbow and shoulder themselves into places by which we have not passed in order to obtain another sight of us every street continuing to pour out its swarms of latecomers to add to the gathering snowball who are content to take descriptions of our persons behavior and countenances from those who had the good fortune to have been in time to see us  let me tell thee jack i see not why to judge according to our principles and practices we should not be as much elated in our march were this to happen to us as others may be upon any other the most mobattracting occasion  suppose a lord mayor on his gaudy suppose a victorious general or ambassador on his public entry  suppose as i began with the lowest the grandest parade that can be supposed a coronation  for in all these do not the royal guard the heroic trainedbands the pendent clinging throngs of spectators with their waving heads rolling toandfro from housetops to housebottoms and streetways as i have above described make the principal part of the rareeshew  and let me ask thee if thou do not think that either the mayor the ambassador or the general would not make very pitiful figures on their galas did not the trumpets and tabrets call together the canaille to gaze at them  nor perhaps should we be the most guilty heroes neither for who knows how the magistrate may have obtained his gold chain while the general probably returns from cutting of throats and from murders sanctified by custom only  caesar we are told pliny gives this account putting the number of men slain at   000   see also lipsius de constantia  had won at the age of fiftysix when he was assassinated fifty pitched battles had taken by assault above a thousand towns and slain near   00000 men i suppose exclusive of those who fell on his own side in slaying them are not you and i jack innocent men and babes in swaddling cloths compared to caesar and to his predecessor in heroism alexander dubbed for murders and depredation magnus  the principal difference that strikes me in the comparison between us and the mayor the ambassador the general on their gawdies is that the mob make a greater noise a louder huzzaing in the one case than in the other which is called acclamation and ends frequently in higher taste by throwing dead animals at one another before they disperse in which they have as much joy as in the former part of the triumph while they will attend us with all the marks of an awful or silent at most only a whispering respect their mouths distended as if set open with gags and their voices generally lost in goggleeyed admiration  well but suppose after all we are convicted what have we to do but in time make over our estates that the sheriffs may not revel in our spoils  there is no fear of being hanged for such a crime as this while we have money or friends  and suppose even the worst that two or three were to die have we not a chance each man of us to escape the devils in em if they will hang five for ravishing three  i know i shall get off for one  were it but for familysake and being a handsome fellow i shall have a dozen or two of young maidens all dressed in white go to court to beg my life  and what a pretty show they will make with their white hoods white gowns white petticoats white scarves white gloves kneeling for me with their white handkerchiefs at their eyes in two pretty rows as majesty walks through them and nods my pardon for their sakes  and if once pardoned all is over for jack in a crime of this nature there lies no appeal as in a murder  so thou see the worst that can happen should we not make the grand tour upon this occasion but stay and take our trials but it is most likely that they will not prosecute at all if not no risque on our side will be run only taking our pleasure abroad at the worst leaving friends tired of us in order after a time to return to the same friends endeared to us as we to them by absence  this jack is my scheme at the first running i know it is capable of improvement  for example i can land these ladies in france whip over before they can get a passage back or before hickman can have recovered his fright and so find means to entrap my beloved on board  and then all will be right and i need not care if i were never to return to

we took while in the coach  she had received a letter from miss how yesterday i presumed  she made no answer how happy should i think myself to be admitted into their correspondence i would joyfully make an exchange of communications  so though i hoped not to succeed by her consent and little did she think i had so happily in part succecded without it i thought it not amiss to urge for it for several reasons among others that i might account to her for my constant employment at my pen in order to take off her jealousy that she was the subject of thy correspondence and mine and that i might justify my secrecy and uncommunicativeness by her own  i proceeded therefore  that i loved familiarletterwriting as i had more than once told her above all the species of writing it was writing from the heart without the fetters prescribed by method or study as the very word correspondence implied not the heart only the soul was in it nothing of body when friend writes to friend the mind impelling sovereignly the vassalfingers it was in short friendship recorded friendship given under hand and seal demonstrating that the parties were under no apprehension of changing from time or accident when they so liberally gave testimonies which would always be ready on failure or infidelity to be turned against them  for my own part it was the principal diversion i had in her absence but for this innocent amusement the distance she so frequently kept me at would have been intolerable  sally knew my drift and said she had had the honor to see two or three of my letters and of mr belfords and she thought them the most entertaining that she had ever read  my friend belford i said had a happy talent in the letterwriting way and upon all subjects  i expected my beloved would have been inquisitive after our subjects but lying perdue as i saw not a word said she so i touched upon this article myself  our topics were various and diffuse sometimes upon literary articles she was very attentive upon this sometimes upon the public entertainments sometimes amusing each other with the fruits of the different correspondencies we held with persons abroad with whom we had contracted friendships sometimes upon the foibles and perfections of our particular friends sometimes upon our own present and future hopes sometimes aiming at humor and raillery upon each other  it might indeed appear to savor of vanity to suppose my letters would entertain a lady of her delicacy and judgment but yet i could not but say that perhaps she would be far from thinking so hardly of me as sometimes she had seemed to do if she were to see the letters which generally passed between mr belford and me i hope jack thou have more manners than to give me the lie though but in thy heart  she then spoke after declining my compliment in such a manner as only a person could do who deserved it she said for her part she had always thought me a man of sense a man of sense jack what a niggardly praise  and should therefore hope that when i wrote it exceeded even my speech for that it was impossible be the letters written in as easy and familiar a style as they would but that they must have that advantage from sitting down to write them which prompt speech could not always have she should think it very strange therefore if my letters were barren of sentiment and as strange if i gave myself liberties upon premeditation which could have no excuse at all but from a thoughtlessness which itself wanted excuse  but if mr belfords letters and mine were upon subjects so general and some of them equally she presumed instructive and entertaining she could not but say that she should be glad to see any of them and particularly those which miss martin had seen and praised  this was put close  i looked at her to see if i could discover any tincture of jealousy in this hint that miss martin had seen what i had not shown to her but she did not look it so i only said i should be very proud to show her not only those but all that passed between mr belford and me but i must remind her that she knew the condition  no indeed with a sweet lip pouted out as saucy as pretty implying a lovely scorn that yet can only be lovely in youth so blooming and beauty so divinely distinguished  how i long to see such a motion again her mouth only can give it  but i am mad with love  yet eternal will be the distance at the rate i go on now fire now ice my soul is continually upon the hiss as i may say in vain however is the trial to quench  what after all is unquenchable  prythee belford forgive my nonsense and my vulcanlike metaphors  did i not tell thee not that i am sick of love but that i am mad with it why brought i such an angel into such a house into such company  and why do i not stop my ears to the sirens who knowing my aversion to wedlock are perpetually touching that string  i was not willing to be answered so easily i was sure that what passed between two such young ladies friends so dear might be seen by everybody i had more reason than anybody to wish to see the letters that passed between her and miss how because i was sure they must be full of admirable instruction and one of the dear correspondents had deigned to wish my entire reformation  she looked at me as if she would look me through i thought i felt eyebeam after eyebeam penetrate my shivering reins  but she was silent nor needed her eyes the assistance of speech  nevertheless a little recovering myself i hoped that nothing unhappy had befallen either miss how or her mother the letter of yesterday sent by a particular hand she opening it with great emotion  seeming to have expected it sooner  were the reasons for my apprehensions  we were then at muswellhill a pretty country within the eye to polly was the remark instead of replying to me  but i was not so to be answered  i should expect some charming subjects and characters from two such pens i hoped everything went on well between mr hickman and miss how her mothers heart i said was set upon that match mr hickman was not without his merits he was what they ladies called a sober man but i must needs say that i thought miss how deserved a husband of a very different cast  this i supposed would have engaged her into a subject from which i could have wiredrawn something  for hickman is one of her favorites  why i cannot divine except for the sake of opposition of character to that of thy honest friend  but she cut me short by a look of disapprobation and another cool remark upon a distant view and how far off miss horton do you think that clump of trees may be pointing out of the coach  so i had done  here ends all i have to write concerning our conversation on this our agreeable airing  we have both been writing etc  vol iv edit i p   0 l   and edit ii p     l  0 add the following paragraph it is true i have owned more than once that i could have liked mr lovelace above all men i remember the debates you and i used to have on this subject when i was your happy guest you used to say and once you wrote that men of his cast are the men that our sex do not naturally dislike while i held that such were not however that might be the men we ought to like but what with my relations precipitating of me on one hand and what with his unhappy character and embarrassing ways on the other i had no more leisure than inclination to examine my own heart in this particular and this reminds me of a passage in one of your former letters which i will transcribe though it was written in raillery may it not be say you see vol i p    of both editions  that you have had such persons to deal with as have not allowed you to attend to the throbs or if you had them a little nowandthen whether having had two accounts to place them to you have not by mistake put them to the wrong one a passage which although it came into my mind when mr lovelace was least exceptionable yet that i have denied any efficacy to when he has teazed and vexed me and given me cause of suspicion for after all my dear mr lovelace is not wise in all his ways and should we not endeavor as much as is possible where we are not attached by natural ties to like and dislike as reason bids us and according to the merit or demerit of the object if love as it is called is allowed to be an excuse for our most unreasonable follies and to lay level all the fences that a careful education has surrounded us by what is meant by the doctrine of subduing our passions  but o my dearest friend am i not guilty of a punishable fault were i to love this man of errors and has not my own heart deceived me when i thought i did not and what must be that love that has not some degree of purity for its object i am afraid of recollecting some passages in my cousin mordens letter see vol iii edit i p     and seq and edit ii p   0 and seq   and yet why fly i from subjects that duly considered might tend to correct and purify my heart i have carried i

i have made no greater progress with my blooming fairone she loves me the ipecacuanha contrivance convinces me that she loves me where there is love there must be confidence or a desire of having reason to confide generosity founded on my supposed generosity has taken hold of her heart shall i not now see since i must be for ever unhappy if i marry her and leave any trial unessayed what i can make of her love and her newlyraised confidence  will it not be to my glory to succeed and to hers and to the honor of her sex if i cannot  where then will be the hurt to either to make the trial and

company as i might say assembled once a week in one place and each in his or her best attire to worship the god that made them nor could it be a hardship upon a man liberally educated to make one on so solemn an occasion and to hear the harangue of a man of letters though far from being the principal part of the service as it is too generally looked upon to be whose studies having taken a different turn from his own he must always have something new to say  she shook her head and repeated the word new but looked as if willing to be satisfied for the present with this answer to be sure

that a young conscience growing up like the phoenix from the ashes of the old one it cannot be surely but if it were it would be hard if i could not overlay a young conscience  well then it must be love i fansy love itself inspiring love of an object so adorable  some little attention possibly paid too to thy whining arguments in her favor  let love then be allowed to be the moving principle and the rather as love naturally makes the lover loath to disoblige the object of its flame and knowing that an offense of the meditated kind will be a mortal offense to her cannot bear that i should think of giving it  let love and me talk together a little on this subject  be it a young conscience or love or thyself jack thou see that i am for giving every whiffler audience but this must be the last debate on this subject for is not her fate in a manner at its crisis and must not my next step be an irretrievable one tend it which way it will  and now the debate is over  a thousand charming things for love is gentler than conscience has this little urchin suggested in her favor  he pretended to know both our hearts and he would have it that though my love was a prodigious strong and potent love and though it has the merit of many months faithful service to plead and has had infinite difficulties to struggle with yet that it is not the right sort of love  right sort of love  a puppy  but with due regard to your deityship said i what merit has she with you that you should be of her party is hers i pray you a right sort of love is it love at all she dont pretend that it is she owns not your sovereignty what a d  l moves you to plead thus earnestly for a rebel who despises your power  and then he came with his ifs and ands  and it would have been and still as he believed would be love and a love of the exalted kind if i would encourage it by the right sort of love he talked of and in justification of his opinion pleaded her own confessions as well those of yesterday as of this morning and even went so far back as to my ipecacuanhaillness  i never talked so familiarly with his godship before thou may think therefore that his dialect sounded oddly in my ears and then he told me how often i had thrown cold water upon the most charming flame that ever warmed a ladys bosom while yet but young and rising  i required a definition of this right sort of love he tried at it but made a sorry hand of it nor could i for the soul of me be convinced that what he meant to extol was love  upon the whole we had a notable controversy upon this subject in which he insisted upon the unprecedented merit of the lady nevertheless i got the better of him for he was struck absolutely dumb when waveing her present perverseness which yet was a sufficient answer to all his pleas i asserted and offered to prove it by a thousand instances impromptu that love was not governed by merit nor could be under the dominion of prudence or any other reasoning power and that if the lady were capable of love it was of such a sort of love as he had nothing to do with and which never before reigned in a female heart  i asked him what he thought of her flight from me at a time when i was more than half overcome by the right sort of love he talked of  and then i showed him the letter she wrote and left behind her for me with an intention no doubt absolutely to break my heart or to provoke me to hang drown or shoot myself to say nothing of a multitude of declarations from her defying his power and imputing all that looked like love in her behavior to me to the persecution and rejection of her friends which made her think of me but as a last resort  love then gave her up the letter he said deserved neither pardon nor excuse he did not think he had been pleading for such a declared rebel and as to the rest he should be a betrayer of the rights of his own sovereignty if what i had alleged were true and he were still to plead for her  i swore to the truth of all and truly i swore which perhaps i do not always do  and now what think thou must become of the lady whom love itself gives up and conscience cannot plead for  vol v p  00 dele paragr penult and read i

years of age mowbray will have very little difficulty with her i believe for one cannot do everything ones self and yet sometimes women of this free cast when it comes to the point answer not the promises their cheerful forwardness gives a man who has a view upon them  miss rawlins is an agreeable young lady enough but not beautiful she has sense and would be thought to know the world as it is called but for her knowledge is more indebted to theory than experience a mere whiptsyllabub knowledge this jack that always fails the person who trusts to it when it should hold to do her service for such young ladies have so much dependence upon their own understanding and wariness are so much above the cautions that the less opinionative may be benefited by that their presumption is generally their overthrow when attempted by a man of experience who knows how to flatter their vanity and to magnify their wisdom in order to take advantage of their folly but for miss rawlins if i can add experience to her theory what an accomplished person will she be  and how much will she be obliged to me and not only she but all those who may be the better for the precepts she thinks herself already so well qualified to give dearly jack do i love to engage with these preceptgivers and examplesetters  now belford although there is nothing striking in any of these characters yet may we at a

are great darers and incentives not one of them loving to be outdone or outdared when their hearts are thoroughly warmed  i know at first the difficulty will be the accidental absence of my dear mrs

rout as my beloved has done about such an affair as that we were assembled upon young ladies as i have observed on an hundred occasions fear not half so much for themselves as their mothers do for them but here the girls were forced to put on grave airs and to seem angry because the antiques made the matter of such high importance yet so lightly sat anger and fellowfeeling at their hearts that they were forced to purse in their mouths to suppress the smiles i nowandthen laid out for while the elders having had roses that is to say daughters of their own and knowing how fond men are of a

passionate girls have high pulses and a clever fellow may make what sport he pleases with their unevennesses  now too high now too low you need only to provoke and appease them by turns to bear with them and forbear to teaze and ask pardon and sometimes to give yourself the merit of a sufferer from them then catching them in the moment of concession conscious of their ill usage of you they are all your own  but these sedate contemplative girls never out of temper but with reason when that reason is given them hardly ever pardon or afford you another opportunity to offend  it was in part the apprehension that this would be so with my dear miss harlowe that made me carry her to a place where i believed she would be unable to escape me although i were not to succeed in my first attempts else widow sorlingss would have been as well for me as widow sinclairs for early i saw that there was no credulity in her to graft upon no pretending to whine myself into her confidence she was proof against amorous persuasion she had reason in her love her penetration and good sense made her hate all compliments that had not truth and nature in them what could i have done with her in any other place and yet how long even there was i kept in awe in spite of natural incitement and unnatural instigations as i now think them by the mere force of that native dignity and obvious purity of mind and manners which fill every one with reverence if not with holy love as thou call it the moment he sees her  else think thou not it was easy for me to be a fine gentleman and a delicate lover or at least a specious and flattering one  lady sarah and lady betty finding the treaty upon the success of which they have set their foolish hearts likely to run into length are about departing to their own seats having taken from me the best security the nature of the case will admit of that is to say my word to marry the lady if she will have me  and after all methinks thou ask art thou still resolved to repair if reparation be put into thy power  why jack i must needs own that my heart has nowandthen some retrograde motions upon thinking seriously of the irrevocable ceremony we do not easily give up the desire of our hearts and what we imagine essential to our happiness let the expectation or hope of compassing it be ever so unreasonable or absurd in the opinion of others recurrings there will be hankerings that will on every but remotelyfavourable incident however before discouraged and beaten back by ill success pop up and abate the satisfaction we should otherwise take in contrariant overtures  it is ungentlemanly jack man to man to lie  but matrimony i do not heartily love  although with a clarissa  yet i am in earnest to marry her  but i am often thinking that if now this dear creature suffering time and my penitence my relations prayers and miss howes meditation to soften her resentments her revenge thou have prettily distinguished away and to recall repulsed inclination should consent to meet me at the altar  how vain will she then make all thy eloquent periods of execration  how many charming interjections of her own will she spoil and what a couple of old patriarchs shall we become going on in the millhorse round getting sons and daughters providing nurses for them first governors and governesses next teaching them lessons their father never practiced nor which their mother as her parents will say was much the better for and at last perhaps when life shall be turned into the dullysober stilness and i become desirous to forget all my past rogueries what comfortable reflections will it afford to find them all revived with equal or probably greater trouble and expense in the persons and manners of so many young lovelaces of the boys and to have the girls run away with varlets perhaps not half so ingenious as myself clumsy fellows as it might happen who could not afford the baggages one excuse for their weakness besides those disgraceful ones of sex and nature  o belford who can bear to think of these things  who at my time of life especially and with such a byas for mischief  of this i am absolutely convinced that if a man ever intends to marry and to enjoy in peace his own reflections and not be afraid of retribution or of the consequences of his own example he should never be a rake  this looks like conscience

neither better nor worse for them  repentance jack i have a notion should be set about while a man is in health and spirits what is a man fit for not to begin a new work surely when he is not himself nor master of his faculties  hence as i apprehend it is that a deathbed repentance is supposed to be such a precarious and ineffectual thing  as to myself i hope i have a great deal of time before me since i intend one day to be a reformed man i have very serious reflections nowandthen yet am i halfafraid of the truth of what my charmer once told me that a man cannot repent when he will  not to hold it i suppose she meant by fits and starts i have repented a thousand times  casting my eye over the two preceding paragraphs i fansy there is something like contradiction in them but i will not

man to boast of as to sagacity and penetration when he is as easily brought to cover and rear and even to love and often to prefer the product of anothers guilt with his wife or mistress as a hen or a goose the eggs and even young of others of their kind  nay let me ask if instinct as it is called in the animal creation does not enable them to distinguish their own much more easily than we with our boasted reason and sagacity in this nice particular can do  if some men who have wives but of doubtful virtue considered this matter duly i believe their inordinate ardor after gain would be a good deal cooled when they could not be certain though their mates could for whose children they were elbowing bustling gripeing and perhaps cheating those with whom they have concerns whether friends neighbors or more certain nextofkin by the mothers side however  but i will not push this notion so far as it might be carried because if propagated it might be of unsocial or unnatural consequence since women of virtue would perhaps be more liable to suffer by the mistrusts and caprices of badhearted and foolishheaded husbands than those who can screen themselves from detection by arts and hypocrisy to which a woman of virtue cannot have recourse and yet were this notion duly and generally considered it might be attended with no bad effects as good education good inclinations and established virtue would be the principally soughtafter qualities and not money when a man not biased by mere personal attractions was looking round him for a partner in his fortunes and for a mother

thou should then be living but i think thou must much sooner than thou imaginest be called to thy account  knocked on the head perhaps by the friends of those whom thou have injured for if thou escapest this fate from the harlowe family thou will go on tempting danger and vengeance till thou meetest with vengeance and this whether thou marriest or not for the nuptial life will not i doubt till age join with it cure thee of that spirit for intrigue which is continually running away with thee in spite of thy better sense and transitory resolutions  well then i will suppose thee laid down

that insanity i doubt runs through her that she had in a stronger degree in the first week of my operations her contempt of life her proclamations her refusal of matrimony and now of money from her most intimate friends are sprinklings of this kind and no other way i think to be accounted for  her apothecary is a good honest fellow i like him much but the silly dears harping so continually upon one string dying dying dying is what i have no patience with i hope all this melancholy jargon is owing entirely to the way i would have her to be in and it being as new to her as the bible beauties to thee no wonder she knows not what to make of herself and so fancies she is breeding death when the event will turn out quite the contrary  thou art a sorry fellow in thy remarks on the education and qualification of smarts and beaux of the rakish order if by thy wes and uss thou meanest thyself or me for i pretend to say that the picture has no resemblance of us who have read and conversed as we have done it may indeed and i believe it does resemble the generality of the fops and coxcombs about town but that let them look to for if it affects not me to what purpose thy random shot  if indeed thou find by the new light darted in upon thee since thou have had the honor of conversing with this admirable creature that the cap fits thy own head why then according to the qui capit rule even take and clap it on and i will add a string of bells to it to complete thee for the forehorse of the idiot team  although i just now said a kind thing or two for this fellow hickman yet i can tell thee i could to use one of my noble peers humble phrases eat him up without a corn of salt when i think of his impudence to salute my charmer twice at parting and have still less patience with the lady herself for presuming to offer her cheek or lip thou say not which to him and to press his clumsy fist between her charming hands an honor worth a kings ransom and what i would give  what would i not give to have  and then he in return to press her as thou say he did to his stupid heart at that time no doubt more sensible than ever it was before  by thy description of their parting i see thou will be a delicate fellow in time my mortification in this ladys displeasure will be thy exaltation from her conversation i envy thee as well for thy opportunities as for thy improvements and such an impression has thy concluding paragraph made upon me that i wish i do not get into a reformationhumour as well as thou and then what a couple of lamentable puppies shall we make howling in recitative to each others discordant music  let me improve upon the thought and imagine that turned hermits we have opened the two old caves at hornsey or dug new ones and in each of our cells set up a deaths head and an hourglass for objects of contemplation  i have seen such a picture but then jack had not the old penitent fornicator a suffocating long gray beard what figures would a couple of brocaded or lacedwaistcoated toupets make with their sour screwed up halfcockd faces and more than halfshut eyes in a kneeling attitude recapitulating their respective rogueries this scheme were we only to make trial of it and return afterward to our old ways might serve to better purpose by far than horners in the country wife to bring the pretty wenches to us  let me see the author of hudibras has somewhere a description that would suit us when met in one of our caves and comparing our dismal notes together this is it suppose me described   he sat upon his rump his head like one in doleful dump betwixt his knees his hands applied unto his cheeks on either side and by him in another hole sat stupid belford cheek by jowl   i know thou will think me too ludicrous i think myself so it is truly to be ingenuous a forced put for my passions are so wound up that i am obliged either to laugh or cry like honest drunken jack daventry poor fellow  what an unhappy end was his  thou know i used to observe that whenever he rose from an entertainment which he never did sober it was his way as soon as he got to the door to look round him like a carrierpigeon just thrown up in order to spy out his course and then taking to his heels he would run all the way home though it were a mile or two when he could hardly stand and must have tumbled on his nose if he had attempted to walk moderately

thy brotherbears at hockley in the hole to the music of a scots bagpipe methinks i see thy clumsy sides shaking and shaking the sides of all beholders in these very attitudes thy fat head archly beating time on thy porterly shoulders right and left by turns as i once beheld thee practicing to the hornpipe at preston thou remembrest the frolic as i have done an hundred times for i never before saw thee appear so much in character  but i know what i shall get by this  only that notable observation repeated that thy outside is the worst of thee and mine the best of me and so let it be nothing

displeased that i send the enclosed letter to you  that her handwriting forsooth should go into the hands of a single man  there is encouragement for thee belford this is a certain sign that thou may have her if thou will and yet till she had given me this unerring demonstration of her glancing toward thee i could not have thought it indeed i have often in pleasantry told her that i would bring such an affair to a bear but i never intended it because she really is dainty girl and thou art such a clumsy fellow in thy person that i should have as soon have wished her a rhinoceros for an husband as thee but poor little dears they must stay till their times come they will not have this man and they will not have that man from seventeen to twentyfive but then afraid as the saying is that god has forgot them and finding their bloom departing they are glad of whom they can get and verify the fable of the parson and the pears  vol vii p     l    after with my letter insert one word more as to a matter of erudition which you greatly love to hear me start and dwell upon dr lewen once in your presence as you my good patron cannot but remember in a smartish kind of debate between him and me took upon him to censure the parenthetical style as i call it he was a very learned and judicious man to be sure and an ornament to our function but yet i must needs say that it is a style which i greatly like and the good doctor was then past his youth and that time of life of consequence when a fertile imagination and rich fancy pour in ideas so fast upon a writer that parentheses are often wanted and that for the sake of brevity as well as perspicuity to save the reader the trouble of reading a passage more than once every man to his talent as i said before we are all so apt to set up our natural byasses for general standards that i wondered the less at the worthy doctors stiffness on this occasion he smiled at me you may remember sir  and whether i was right or not i am sure i smiled at him and you my worthy patron as i had the satisfaction to observe seemed to be of my party but was it not strange that the old gentleman and i should so widely differ when the end with both that is to say perspicuity or clearness was the same  but what shall we say   errare est hominis sed non persistere   i think i have nothing to add etc  vol vii p     l    after i left them insert as to what thou say of thy charming cousin let me know if thou have any meaning in it i have not the vanity to think myself deserving of such a lady as miss montague and should not therefore care to expose myself to her scorn and to thy derision but were i assured i might avoid both these i would soon acquaint thee that i should think no pains nor assiduity too much to obtain a share in the good graces of such a lady  but i know thee too well to depend upon anything thou say on this subject thou love to make thy friends the object of ridicule to ladies and imaginest from the vanity and in this respect i will say littleness of thine own heart that thou shinest the brighter for the foil  thus did thou once play off the rough mowbray with miss hatton till the poor fellow knew not how to go either backward or forward  vol vii p   0 dele the two first paragraphs of colonel mordens letter and read i should not my dearest cousin have been a fortnight in england without either doing myself the honor of waiting upon you in person or of writing to you if i had not been busying myself almost all the time in your service in hopes of making my visit or letter still more acceptable to you  acceptable as i have reason to presume either will be from the unquestionable love i ever bore you and from the esteem you always honored me with  little did i think that so many days would have been required to effect my wellintended purpose where there used to be a love so ardent on one side and where there still is as i am thoroughly convinced the most exalted merit on the other  i was yesterday with mr lovelace etc  vol vii p     dele the paragraph beginning mr brands recantationletters etc and insert mr brand to mr john walton sat night sept   dear mr walton i am obliged to you for the very handsomely penned and elegantly written letter which you have sent me on purpose to do justice to the character of the younger miss harlowe and yet i must tell you that i had reason before that came to think and to know indeed that we were all wrong and so i had employed the greatest part of this week in drawing up an apologetical letter to my worthy patron mr john harlowe in order to set all matters right between me and them and  as far as i could between them and miss so it required little more than connection and transcribing when i received yours and it will be with mr harlowe aforesaid tomorrow morning and this and the copy of that will be with you on monday morning  you cannot imagine how sorry i am that you and mrs walton and mrs barker and i myself should have taken matters up so lightly judging alasaday by appearance and conjecture where character and reputation are concerned horace says truly et semel emissum volat irrevocabile verbum  that is words once spoken cannot be recalled but mr walton they may be contradicted by other words and we may confess ourselves guilty of a mistake and express our concern for being mistaken and resolve to make our mistake a warning to us for the future and this is all that can be done and what every worthy mind will do and what nobody can be readier to do than we four undesigning offenders as i see by your letter on your part and as you will see by the enclosed copy on mine which if it be received as i think it ought and as i believe it will must give me a speedy opportunity to see you when i visit the lady to whom as you will see in it i expect to be sent up with the olive branch  the matter in which we all erred must be owned to be very nice and mr belfords character considered appearances ran very strong against the lady but all that this serves to show is that in doubtful matters the wisest people may be mistaken for so says the poet fallitur in dubiis hominum solertia rebus  if you have an opportunity you may as if from yourself and unknown to me show the enclosed to mr belford who you tell me resenteth the matter very heinously but not to let him see or hear read those words that relate to him in the paragraph at the bottom of the second page beginning  but yet i do insist upon it to the end of that paragraph for one would not make ones self enemies you know and i have reason to think that this mr belford is as passionate and fierce a man as mr lovelace what pity it is the lady could find no worthier a protector you may paste those lines over with blue or black paper before he sees it and if he insisteth upon taking a copy of my letter for he or anybody that sees it or hears it read will no doubt be glad to have by them the copy of a letter so full of the sentiments of the noblest writers of antiquity and so well adapted as i will be bold to say they are to the point in hand i say if he insisteth upon taking a copy let him give you the strongest assurances not to suffer it to be printed on any account and i make the same request to you that you will not for if anything be to be made of a mans works who but the author should have the advantage and if the spectators the tatlers the examiners the guardians and other of our polite papers make such a strutting with a single verse or so by way of motto in the front of each days paper and if other authors pride themselves in finding out and embellishing the titlepages of their books with a verse or adage from the classical writers what a figure would such a letter as the enclosed make so full fraught with admirable precepts and apropos quotations from the best authority  i have been told that a certain noble lord who once sat himself down to write a pamphlet in behalf of a great minister after taking infinite pains to no purpose to find a latin motto gave commission to a friend of his to offer to any one who could help him to a suitable one but of one or two lines a hamper of claret accordingly his lordship had a motto found him from juvenal which he unhappily mistaking not knowing juvenal was a poet printed as a prose sentence in his title page  if then one or two lines were of so much worth a hamper of claret no less of what inestimable value would such a letter as mine be deemed  and who knows but that this noble p  r who is now i e at the time this letter was written living if he should happen to see this letter shining with such a glorious string of jewels might give the writer a scarf in order to have him always at hand or be a means some way or other to bring him into notice and i will be bold to say  bad as the world is a man of sound learning wants nothing but an initiation to make his fortune  i hope my good friend that the lady will not die i shall be much grieved if she does and the more because of mine unhappy misrepresentation so will you for the same cause so will her parents and friends they are very rich and very worthy gentlefolks  but let me tell you bytheby that they had carried the matter against her so far that i believe in my heart they were glad to justify themselves by my report and would have been less pleased had i made a more favorable one and yet in their hearts they dote upon her but now they are all as i hear inclined to be friends with her and forgive her her brother as well as the rest  but their cousin col morden a very fine gentleman has had such high words with them and they with him that they know not how to stoop lest it should look like being frighted into an accommodation hence it is that i have taken the greater liberty to press the reconciliation and i hope in such good season that they will all be pleased with it for can they have a better handle to save their pride all round than by my mediation and let me tell you inter nos betwixt ourselves very proud they all are  by this honest means for by dishonest ones i would not be archbishop of canterbury i hope to please everybody to be forgiven in the first place by the lady whom being a lover of learning and learned men i shall have great opportunities of obliging  for when she departed from her fathers house i had but just the honor of her notice and she seemed highly pleased with my conversation and next to be thanked and respected by her parents and all her family as i am i bless god for it by my dear friend mr john harlowe who indeed is a man that professes a great esteem for men of erudition and who with singular delight i know will run over with me the authorities i have quoted and wonder at my memory and the happy knack i have of recommending mine own sense of things in the words of the greatest sages of antiquity  excuse me my good friend for this seeming vanity the great cicero you must have heard i suppose had a much greater spice of it and wrote a long letter begging and praying to be flattered but if i say less of myself than other people who know me say of me i think i keep a medium between vanity and false modesty the latter of which oftentimes gives itself the lie when it is declaring off the compliments that everybody gives it as its due an hypocrisy as well as folly that i hope i shall for ever scorn to be guilty of  i have another reason as i may tell to you my old schoolfellow to make me wish for this fine ladys recovery and health and that is by some distant intimations i have heard from mr john harlowe that it is very likely because of the slur she has received that she will choose to live privately and penitently  and will probably when she comes into her estate keep a chaplain to direct her in her devotions and penitence  if she does who can stand a better chance than myself  and as i find by your account as well as by everybodys that she is innocent as to intention and is resolved never to think of mr lovelace more who knows what in time may happen  and yet it must be after mr lovelaces death which may possibly sooner happen than he thinks of by means of his detestable courses for after all a man who is of public utility ought not for the finest woman in the world to lay his throat at the mercy of a man who boggleth at nothing  i beseech you let not this hint go farther than to yourself your spouse and mrs barker i know i may trust my life in your hands and theirs there have been let me tell ye unlikelier things come to pass and that with rich widows some of quality truly whose choice in their first marriages has perhaps been guided by motives of convenience or mere corporalities as i may say but who by their second have had for their view the corporal and spiritual mingled which is the most eligible no doubt to substances composed of both as men and women are  nor think sir that should such a thing come to pass either would be disgraced since the lady in me would marry a gentleman and a scholar and as to mine own honor as the slur would bring her high fortunes down to an equivalence with my mean ones if fortune only and not merit be considered so has not the life of this lady been so tainted either by length of time or naughtiness of practice as to put her on a foot with the cast abigails that tootoo often god knows are thought good enough for a young clergyman who perhaps is drawn in by a poor benefice and if the wicked one be not quite worn out grows poorer and poorer upon it by an increase of family he knows not whether is most his or his noble ignoble i should say patrons  but all this apart and in confidence  i know you made at school but a small progress in languages so i have restrained myself from many illustrations from the classics that i could have filled this letter with as i have done the enclosed one and being at a distanc i cannot explain them to you as i do to my friend mr john harlowe who after all is obliged to me for pointing out to him many beauties of the authors i quote which otherwise would lie concealed from him as they must from every common observer  but this too inter nos  for he would not take it well to have it known  jays you know old schoolfellow jays you know will strut in peacocks feathers  but whither am i running i never know where to end when i get upon learned topics and albeit i cannot compliment you with the name of a learned man yet are you a sensible man and as such must have pleasure in learned men and in their writings  in this confidence mr walton with my kind respects to the good ladies your spouse and sister and in hopes for the young ladys sake soon to follow this long long epistle in person i conclude myself  your loving and faithful friend elias brand you will perhaps mr walton wonder at the meaning of the lines drawn under many of the words and sentences underscoring we call it and were my letters to be printed those would be put in a different character now you must know sir that we learned men do this to point out to the readers who are not so learned where the jet of our arguments lies and the emphasis they are to lay upon those words whereby they will take in readily our sense and cogency some pragmatical people have said that an author who does a great deal of this either calls his readers fools or tacitly condemns his own style as supposing his meaning would be dark without it or that all his force lay in words but all of those with whom i have conversed in the learned way think as i think and to give a very pretty though familiar illustration i have considered a a page distinguished by different characters as verdant field overspread with butterflowers and daisies and other summerflowers these the poets liken to enamelling  have you not read in the poets of enamelled meads and so forth     mr brand to john harlowe esquire sat night sept   worthy sir i am under no small concern that i should unhappily be the occasion i am sure i intended nothing like it of widening differences by light misreport when it is the duty of one of my function and no less consisting with my inclination to heal and reconcile  i have received two letters to set me right one from a particular acquaintance whom i set to enquire of mr belfords character and that came on tuesday last informing me that your unhappy niece was greatly injured in the account i had had of her for i had told him of it and that with very great concern i am sure apprehending it to be true so i then set about writing to you to acknowledge the error and had gone a good way in it when the second letter came a very handsome one it is both in style and penmanship from my friend mr walton though i am sure it cannot be his inditing expressing his sorrow and his wifes and his sisterinlaws likewise for having been the cause of misleading me in the account i gave of the said young lady whom they now say upon further enquiry they find to be the most unblameable and most prudent and it seems the most pious young lady that ever once committed a great error as to be sure hers was in leaving such worthy parents and relations for so vile a man as mr lovelace but what shall we say  why the divine virgil tells us improbe amor quid nonmortalia pectora cogis  for my part i was but too much afraid for we have great opportunities you are sensible sir at the university of knowing human nature from books the calm result of the wise mens wisdom as i may say haurit aquam cribro qui discere vult sine libro uninterrupted by the noise and vanities that will mingle with personal conversation which in the turbulent world is not to be enjoyed but over a bottle where you have an hundred foolish things pass to one that deserves to be remembered i was but too much afraid i say that so great a slip might be attended with still greater and worse for your horace and my horace the most charming writer that ever lived among the pagans for the lyric kind of poetry i mean for to be sure homer and virgil would otherwise be first named in their way well observes and who understood human nature better than he  nec vera virtus cum semel excidit curat reponi deterioribus and ovid no less wisely observes et mala sunt vicina bonis errore sub illo pro vitio virtus crimina saepe tulit   who that can draw knowledge from its fountainhead the works of the sages of antiquity improved by the comments of the moderns but would prefer to all others the silent quiet life which contempaire men lead in the seats of learning were they  called out according to their dedication to the vice and instruction of the world  now sir another favorite poet of mins not the less a favorite for being a christian  us that it is the custom of some when in a fa to throw the blame upon the backs of others  hominum quoque mos est quae nos cunque premunt alieno imponere tergo mant but i though in this case misled wellintendedly nevertheless both in the misleaders and misled and therefore entitled to lay hold of that plea if anybody is so entitled will not however be classed among such extenuators but contrarily will always keep in mind that verse which comfort in mistake as well as instructs and which i quoted in my last letter errare est hominis sed non persisiere  and will own that i was very rash to take up with conjectures and consequences drawn from probabilities where especially the character of so fine a lady was concerned  credere fallaci gravis est dementia famae mant notwithstanding miss clarissa harlowe i must be bold to say is the only young lady that ever i heard of or indeed read of that having made such a false step so soon of her own accord as i may say recovered herself and conquered her love of the deceiver a great conquest indeed and who flies him and resolves to die rather than to be his which now to her neverdying honor i am well assured is the case  and in justice to her i am now ready to take to myself with no small vexation that of ovid heu patior telis vulnera facta meis  but yet i do insist upon it that all that part of my information which i took upon mine own personal enquiry which is what relates to mr belford and his character is literally true for there is not anywhere to be met with a man of a more libertine character as to women mr lovelace excepted than he bears  and so sir i must desire of you that you will not let any blame lie upon my intention since you see how ready i am to accuse myself of too lightly giving ear to a rash information not knowing it so to be however for i depended the more upon it as the people i had it from are very sober and live in the fear of god and indeed when i wait upon you you will see by their letter that they must be conscientious good people wherefore sir let me be entitled from all your good family to that of my lastnamed poet aspera confesso verba remitte reo  and now sir what is much more becoming of my function let me instead of appearing with the face of an accuser and a rash censurer which in my heart i have not deserved to be thought assume the character of a reconciler and propose by way of penance to myself for my fault to be sent up as a messenger of peace to the pious young lady for they write me word absolutely and i believe in my heart truly that the doctors have given her over and that she cannot live alas alas what a sad thing would that be if the poor bough that was only designed as i very well know and am fully assured to be bent should be broken  let it not dear sir seem to the world that there was anything in your resentments which while meant for reclaiming were just and fit that has the appearance of violence and fierce wrath and inexorability as it would look to some if carried to extremity after repentance and contrition and humiliation on the fair offenders side for all this while it seems she has been a second magdalen in her penitence and yet not so bad as a magdalen in her faults faulty nevertheless as she has been once the lord knows  nam vitiis nemo sine nascitur optimus ille est qui minimis urgetur  says horace now sir if i may be named for this blessed employment for blessed is the peacemaker i will hasten to london and as i know miss had always a great regard to the function i have the honor to be of i have no doubt of making myself acceptable to her and to bring her by sound arguments and good advice into a liking of life which must be the first step to her recovery for when the mind is made easy the body will not long suffer and the love of life is a natural passion that is soon revived when fortune turns about and smileth vivere quisque diu quamvis and egenus and aeger optat  ovid  and the sweet lucan truly observes  fatis debentibus annos mors invita subit    and now sir let me tell you what shall be the tenor of my pleadings with her and comfortings of her as she is as i may say a learned lady and as i can explain to her those sentences which she cannot so readily construe herself and this in order to convince you did you not already know my qualifications how well qualified i am for the christian office to which i commend myself  i will in the first place put her in mind of the common course of things in this sublunary world in which joy and sorrow sorrow and joy succeed one another by turns in order to convince her that her griefs have been but according to that common course of things gaudia post luctus veniunt post gaudia luctus  secondly i will remind her of her own notable description of sorrow when she was once called upon to distinguish wherein sorrow grief and melancholy differed from each other which she did impromptu by their effects in a truly admirable manner to the high satisfaction of every one i myself could not by study have distinguished better nor more concisely  sorrow said she wears grief tears but melancholy sooths  my inference to her shall be that since a happy reconciliation will take place grief will be banished sorrow dismissed and only sweet melancholy remain to sooth and indulge her contrite heart and show to all the world the penitent sense she has of her great error  thirdly that her joys joy let me here observe my dear sir by way of note is not absolutely inconsistent with melancholy a soft gentle joy not a rapid not a rampant joy however but such a joy as shall lift her temporarily out of her soothing melancholy and then let her down gently into it again for melancholy to be sure her reflection will generally make to be herstate  when restored to health and favor will be the greater the deeper her griefs were gaudia quae multo parta labor placent  fourthly that having really been guilty of a great error she should not take impatiently the correction and anger with which she has been treated  leniter ex merito quicquid patiare ferundum est fifthly that virtue must be established by patience as says prudentius haec virtus vidua est quam non patientia firmat  sixthly that in the words of horace she may expect better times than of late she had reason to look for grata superveniet quae non sperabitur hora  seventhly that she is really now in a way to be happy since according to ovid she can count up all her woe felix qui patitur quae numerare potest  and those comforting lines estque serena dies post longos gratior imbres et post triste malum gratior ipsa salus   eighthly that in the words of mantuan her parents and uncles could not help loving her all the time they were angry at her aequa tamen semper mens est and amica voluntas sit licet in natos facies austera parentum   ninthly that the ills she has met with may be turned by the good use to be made of them to her everlasting benefit for that cum furit atque ferit deus olim parcere quaerit  tenthly that she will be able to give a fine lesson a very fine lesson to all the young ladies of her acquaintance of the vanity of being lifted up in prosperity and the weakness of being cast down in adversity since no one is so high as to be above being humbled so low as to need to despair for which purpose the advice of ausonius dum fortuna juvat caveto tolli dum fortuna tonat caveto mergi   i shall tell her that lucan says well when he calls adversity the element of patience  gaudet patientia duris  that fortunam superat virtus prudentia famam  that while weak souls are crushed by fortune the brave mind makes the fickle deity afraid of it fortuna fortes metuit ignavos premit  eleventhly that if she take the advice of horace fortiaque adversis opponite pectora rebus it will delight her hereafter as virgil says to revolve her past troubles  forsan and haec olim meminisse juvabit  and to the same purpose juvenal speaking of the prating joy of mariners after all their dangers are over gaudent securi narrare pericula nautae  which suiting the case so well you will forgive me sir for popping down in english meter as the translative impulse pardon a new word and yet we scholars are not fond of authenticating new words came upon me uncalled for the seaman safe on shore with joy does tell what cruel dangers him at sea befell   with these sir and an hundred more wise adages which i have always at my fingers end will i when reduced to form and method entertain miss and as she is a wellread and i might say but for this one great error a wise young lady i make no doubt but i shall prevail upon her if not by mine own arguments by those of wits and capacities that have a congeniality as i may say to her own to take heart  nor of the laws of fate complain since though it has been cloudy now t clears up again    oh what wisdom is there in these noble classical authors a wise man will upon searching into them always find that they speak his sense of men and things hence it is that they so readily occur to my memory on every occasion  though this may look like vanity it is too true to be omitted and i see not why a man may not know those things of himself which everybody sees and says of him who nevertheless perhaps know not half so much as he in other matters  i know but of one objection sir that can lie against my going and that will arise from your kind care and concern for the safety of my person in case that fierce and terrible man the wicked mr lovelace of whom every one stands in fear should come cross me as he may be resolved to try once more to gain a footing in misss affections but i will trust in providence for my safety while i shall be engaged in a cause so worthy of my function and the more trust in it as he is a learned man as i am told  strange too that so vile a rake i hope he will never see this should be a learned man that is to say that a learned man should find leisure to be a rake although possibly a learned man may be a sly sinner and take opportunities as they come in his way  which however i do assure you i never did  i repeat that as he is a learned man i shall vest myself as i may say in classical armor beginning meekly with him for sir bravery and meekness are qualities very consistent with each other and in no persons so shiningly exert themselves as in the christian priesthood beginning meekly with him i say from ovid corpora magnanimo satis est prostrasse leoni  so that if i should not be safe behind the shield of mine own prudence i certainly should behind the shields of the everadmirable classics of horace particularly who being a rake and a jovial rake too himself must have great weight with all learned rakes  and who knows but i may be able to bring even this goliath in wickedness although in person but a little david myself armed with the slings and stones of the ancient sages to a due sense of his errors and what a victory would that be  i could here sir pursuing the allegory of david and goliath give you some of the stones hard arguments may be called stones since they knock down a pertinacious opponent which i could pelt him with were he to be wroth with me and this in order to take from you sir all apprehensions for my life or my bones but i forbear them till you demand them of me when i have the honor to attend you in person  and now my dear sir what remains but that having shown you what yet i believe you did not doubt how well qualified i am to attend the lady wih the olive branch i beg of you to dispatch me with it out of hand for if she be so very ill and if she should not live to receive the grace which to my knowledge all the worthy family design her how much will that grieve you all and then sir of what avail will be the eulogies you shall all peradventure join to give to her memory for as martial wisely observes  post cineres gloria sera venit  then as ausonius lays it down with equal propriety that those favors which are speedily conferred are the most graceful and obliging  and to the same purpose ovid gratia ab officio quod mora tardat abest  and sir whatever you do let the ladys pardon be as ample and as cheerfully given as she can wish for it that i may be able to tell her that it has your hands your countenances and your whole hearts with it  for as the latin verse has it and i presume to think i have not weakened its sense by my humble advice dat been dat multum qui dat cum munere vultum  and now sir when i survey this long letter and here by way of note permit me to say that no sermon i ever composed cost me half the pains that this letter has done  but i know your great appetite after as well as admiration of the ancient wisdom which you so justly prefer to the modern  and indeed i join with you to think that the modern is only borrowed as the moon does its light from the sun at least that we excel them in nothing and that our best cogitations may be found generally speaking more elegantly dressed and expressed by them  albeit i see it enamelled as a beautiful meadow is enamelled by the spring or summer flowers very glorious to behold i begin to be afraid that i may have tired you and the more likely as i have written without that method or order which think constituteth the beauty of good writing which method or order nevertheless may be the better excused in a familiar epistle as this may be called you pardoning sir the familiarity of the word but yet not altogether here i must needs own because this is a letter and not a letter as i may say but a kind of short and pithy discourse touching upon various and sundry topics every one of which might be a fit theme to enlarge upon even to volumes if this epistolary discourse then let me call it should be pleasing to you as i am inclined to think it will because of the sentiments and aphorisms of the wisest of the ancients which glitter through it like so many dazzling sunbeams i will at my leisure work it up into a methodical discourse and perhaps may one day print it with a dedication to my honored patron if sir i have your leave singly first but not till i have thrown out anonymously two or three smaller things by the success of which i shall have made myself of some account in the commonwealth of letters and afterward in my works  not for the vanity of the thing however i will say but for the use it may be of to the public for as one well observes though glory always follows virtue yet it should be considered only as its shadow contemnit laudem virtus licet usque sequatur gloria virtutem corpus ut umbra suum a very pretty saying and worthy of all mens admiration  and now  most worthy sir my very good friend and patron referring the whole to yours and to your two brothers and to young mr harlowes consideration and to the wise consideration of good madam harlowe and her excellent daughter miss arabella harlowe i take the liberty to subscribe myself what i truly am and ever shall delight to be in all cases and at all times  your and their most ready and obedient as well as faithful servant elias brand   vol vii p     l   from the bottom after whose more transient insert now lovelace let me know if the word grace can be red from my pen without a sneer from thee and thy associates i own that once it sounded oddly in my ears but i shall never forget what a grave man once said on this very word  that with him it was a rakes shibboleth see judges xii    he had always hopes of one who could bear the mention of it without ridiculing it and ever gave him up for an abandoned man who made a jest of it or of him who used it  dont be disgusted etc  vol vii p     l    after thy wise consideration insert mr belford returns a very serious answer to the preceding letter which appears not  in it he most heartily wishes that he had withstood mr lovelace whatever had been the consequence in designs so elaboratelybase and ungrateful and so long and steadily pursued against a lady whose merit and innocence entitled her to the protection of every man who had the least pretenses to the title of a gentleman and who deserved to be even the public care  he most severely censures himself for his false notions of honor to his friend on this head and recollects what the divine lady as he calls her said to him on this very subject as related by himself in his letter to lovelace vol vi p         to which lovelace also both instigator and accuser refers and to his own regret and shame on the occasion he distinguishes however between an irreparable injury intended to a clarissa and one designed to such of the sex as contribute by their weakness and indiscretion to their own fall and thereby entitle themselves to a large share of the guilt which accompanies the crime  he offers not he says to palliate or extenuate the crimes he himself has been guilty of but laments for mr lovelaces own sake that he gives him with so ludicrous and unconcerned an air such solemn and useful lessons and warnings nevertheless he resolves to make it his whole endeavor he tells him to render them efficacious to himself and should think himself but too happy if he shall be enabled to set him such an example as may be a means to bring about the reformation of a man so dear to him as he has always been from the first of their acquaintance and who is capable of thinking so rightly and deeply though at present to such little purpose as makes his very knowledge add to his condemnation  vol vii p     l   after pursue his vengeance insert and the rather as through an absence of six years high as just report and the promises of her early youth from childhood had raised her in his esteem he could not till now know one half of her excellencies  till now that we have lost for ever lost the admirable creature   but i will force myself from the subject etc  vol vii p     l  0 from the bottom after all the authority with her that dele the rest of that and the following paragraph and read  a mother ought to have miss how is indeed a woman of fine sense but it requires a high degree of good understanding as well as a sweet and gentle disposition of mind and great discretion in a child when grown up to let it be seen that she mingles reverence with her love to a parent who has talents visibly inferior to her own  miss how is open generous noble the mother has not any of her fine qualities parents in order to preserve their childrens veneration for them should take great care not to let them see anything in their conduct or behavior or principles which they themselves would not approve of in others  mr hickman has however this consideration to comfort himself with that the same vivacity by which he suffers makes miss howes own mother at times equally sensible and as he sees enough of this beforehand he will have more reason to blame himself than the lady should she prove as lively a wife as she was a mistress for having continued his addresses and married her against such threatening appearances  there is also another circumstance which goodnatured men who engage with even lively women may look forward to with pleasure a circumstance which generally lowers the spirits of the ladies and domesticates them as i may call it and which as it will bring those of mr hickman and miss how nearer to a par that worthy gentleman will have double reason when it happens to congratulate himself upon it  but after all etc  vol vii p     l penult after will confirm this dele the four following paragraphs and read in her dress she was elegant beyond imitation and generally led the fashion to all the ladies round her without seeming to intend it and without being proud of doing so  she was rather tall than of a midling stature and had a dignity in her aspect and air that bespoke the mind that animated every feature  this native dignity as i may call it induced some superficial persons who knew not how to account for the reverence which involuntarily filled their hearts on her appearance to impute pride to her but these were such as knew that they should have been proud of any one of her perfections judging therefore by their own narrowness they thought it impossible that the lady who possessed so many should not think herself superior to them all  indeed i have heard her noble aspect found fault with as indicating pride and superiority but people awed and controuled though but by their own consciousness of inferiority will find fault right or wrong with those of whose rectitude of mind and manners their own culpable hearts give them to be afraid but in the bad sense of the word miss clarissa harlowe knew not what pride was  you may if you touch upon this subject etc  vol vii p     l    after to condemn it insert once i remember in a large circle of ladies every one of which i among the rest having censured a generally reported indiscretion in a young lady  come my miss how said she for we had agreed to take each other to task when either thought the other gave occasion for it and when by blaming each other we intended a general reprehension which as she used to say it would appear arrogant or assuming to level more properly let me be miss fanny darlington then removing out of the circle and standing up  here i stand unworthy of a seat with the rest of the company till i have cleared my self and now suppose me to be her let me hear your charge and do you hear what the poor culprit can say to it in her own defense and then answering the conjectural and unproved circumstances by circumstances as fairly to be supposed favorable she brought off triumphantly the censured lady and so much to every ones satisfaction that she was led to her chair and voted a double rank in the circle  as the reinstated miss fanny darlington and as miss clarissa harlowe  very few persons she used to say would be condemned or even accused in the circles of ladies were they present it is generous therefore nay it is but just said she to take the part of the absent if not flagrantly culpable  but though wisdom was her birthright as i may say yet she had not lived years enough to pretend to so much experience as to exempt her from the necessity of sometimes altering her opinion both of persons and things but when she found herself obliged to do this she took care that the particular instance of mistaken worthiness in the person should not narrow or contract her almost universal charity into general doubt or jealousy an instance of what i mean occurs to my memory you must everywhere etc  vol vii p     dele the four last lines and p     line   after caution and prudence insert indeed when she was convinced of any error or mistake however seemingly derogatory to her judgment and sagacity no one was ever so acknowleging so ingenuous as she it was a merit she used to say next in degree to that of having avoided error frankly to own an error and that the offering at an excuse in a blameable matter was the undoubted mark of a disingenuous if not of a perverse mind  but i ought to add on this head of her great charity where character was concerned and where there was room for charity that she was always deservedly severe in her reprehensions of a wilful and studied vileness how could she then forgive the wretch by whose premeditated villainy she was entangled  if you mention etc  vol vii p     l    after with him than before insert and yet his behavior before her was too specious to have been very exceptionable to a woman who had a less share of that charming delicacy and of that penetration which so much distinguished her  in obedience etc  ibid l   from the bottom after discard him for ever insert she was an admirable mistress of all the graces of elocution the hand she wrote for the neat and free cut of her letters like her mind solid and above all flourish for its fairness evenness and swiftness distinguished her as much as the correctness of her orthography and even punctuation from the generality of her own sex and left her none amongst the most accurate of the other who excelled her  her ingenuity etc  vol vii p     l    after all natural beauty insert then stiffened and starched let me add into dry and indelectable affectation one sort of these scholars assume a style as rough as frequently are their manners they spangle over their productions with metaphors they rumble into bombast the sublime with them lying in words and not in sentiment they fansy themselves most exalted when least understood and down they sit fully satisfied with their own performances and call them masculine while a second sort aiming at wit that wicked misleader forfeit all title to judgment and a third sinking into the classical pits there poke and scramble about never seeking to show genius of their own all their lives spent in commonplace quotation fit only to write notes and comments upon other peoples texts all their pride that they know those beauties of two thousand years old in another tongue which they can only admire but not imitate in their own  and these truly must be learned men and despisers of our insipid sex  but i need not mention the exceptions which my beloved friend always made and to which i subscribe in favor of men of sound learning true taste and extensive abilities nor in particular her respect even to reverence for gentlemen of the cloth which i dare say will appear in every paragraph of her letters wherever any of the clergy are mentioned indeed the pious dr lewen the worthy dr blome the ingenious mr arnold and mr tompkins gentlemen whom she names in one article of her will as learned divines with whom she held an early correspondence well deserved her respect since to their conversation and correspondence she owed many of her valuable acquirements  nor were the little slights she would nowandthen following as i must own my lead put upon such mere scholars and her stupid and pedantic brother was one of those who deserved those slights as despised not only our sex but all such as had not had their opportunities of being acquainted with the parts of speech i cannot speak low enough of such and with the dead languages owing to that contempt which some affect for what they have not been able to master for she had an admirable facility in learning languages and red with great ease both italian and french she had begun to apply herself to latin and having such a critical knowledge of her own tongue and such a foundation from the two others would soon have made herself an adept in it  and one hint etc  vol vii p     l  0 after what she acquires dele the two next paragraphs and read all that a woman can learn she used to say expatiating on this maxim above the useful knowledge proper to her sex let her learn this will show that she is a good housewife of her time and that she not a narrow or confined genius but then let her not give up for these those more necessary and therefore not meaner employments which will qualify her to be a good mistress of a family a good wife and a good mother for what can be more disgraceful to a woman than either through negligence of dress to be found to be a learned slattern or through ignorance of housholdmanagement to be known to be a stranger to domestic economy  then would she instance to me two particular ladies one of which while she was fond of giving her opinion in the company of her husband and of his learned friends upon doubtful or difficult passages in virgil or horace knew not how to put on her clothes with that necessary grace and propriety which should preserve to her the love of her husband and the respect of every other person while the other affecting to be thought as learned as men could find no better way to assert her pretensions than by despising her own sex and by dismissing that characteristic delicacy the loss of which no attainment can supply  she would have it indeed sometimes from the frequent ill use learned women make of that respectable acquirement that it was no great matter whether the sex aimed at anything but excelling in the knowledge of the beauties and graces of their mother tongue and once she said that this was field enough for a woman and an ampler was but endangering her family usefulness but i who think our sex inferior in nothing to the other but in want of opportunities of which the narrowminded mortals industriously seek to deprive us lest we should surpass them as much in what they chiefly value themselves upon as we do in all the graces of a fine imagination could never agree with her in that and yet i was entirely of her opinion that those women who were solicitous to obtain that knowledge or learning which they supposed would add to their significance in sensible company and in their attainment of it imagined themselves above all domestic usefulness deservedly incurred the contempt which they hardly ever failed to meet with  perhaps you will not think it amiss etc  vol vii p     l    after who saw her in it dele that and the following paragraph and read her grandfather in honor of her dexterity and of her skill in all the parts of the dairymanagement as well as of the elegance of the offices allotted for that use would have his seat before known by the name of the grove to be called the dairyhouse she had an easy convenient and graceful habit made on purpose which she put on when she employed herself in these works and it was noted of her that in the same hour that she appeared to be a most elegant dairymaid she was when called to a change of dress the finest lady that ever graced a circle  her grandfather father mother uncles aunt and even her brother and sister made her frequent visits there and were delighted with her silent ease and unaffected behavior in her works for she always out of modesty chose rather the operative than the directive part that she might not discourage the servant whose proper business it was  each was fond of taking a regale from her hands in her dairyhouse her mother and aunt hervey generally admired her in silence that they might not give uneasiness to her sister a spiteful perverse unimitating thing who usually looked upon her all the time with speechless envy nowandthen however the pouting creature would suffer extorted and sparing praise to burst open her lips though looking at the same time like saul meditating the pointed javelin at the heart of david the glory of his kingdom and now methinks i see my angelfriend too superior to take notice of her gloom courting her acceptance of the milkwhite curd from hands more pure than that  her skill and dexterity in every branch of family management seem to be the only excellence of her innumerable ones which she owed to her family whose narrowness immensely rich and immensely carking put them upon indulging her in the turn she took to this part of knowledge while her elder sister affected dress without being graceful in it and the fine lady which she could never be and which her sister was without studying for it or seeming to know she was so  it was usual with the one sister when company was expected to be half the morning dressing while the other would give directions for the whole business and entertainment of the day and then go up to her dressing room and before she could well be missed  having all her things in admirable order come down fit to receive company and with all that graceful ease and tranquillity as if she had had nothing else to think of  long after her hours perhaps of previous preparation having passed down would come rustling and bustling the tawdry and awkward bella disordering more her native disorderliness at the sight of her serene sister by her sullen envy to see herself so much surpassed with such little pains and in a sixth part of the time  yet was this admirable creature mistress of all these domestic qualifications without the least intermixture of narrowness she knew how to distinguish between frugality a necessary virtue and niggardliness an odious vice and used to say that to define generosity it must be called the happy medium betwixt parsimony and profusion  she was the most graceful reader i ever knew she added by her melodious voice graces to those she found in the parts of books she redout to her friends and gave grace and significance to others where they were not she had no tone no whine her accent was always admirably placed the emphasis she always forcibly laid as the subject required no buskinelevation no tragedypomp could mislead her and yet poetry was poetry indeed when she red it  but if her voice was melodious when she red it was all harmony when she sung and the delight she gave by that and by her skill and great compass was heightened by the ease and gracefulness of her air and manner and by the alacrity with which she obliged  nevertheless she generally chose rather to hear others sing or play than either to play or sing herself  she delighted to give praise where deserved yet she always bestowed it in such a manner as gave not the least suspicion that she laid out for a return of it to herself though so universally allowed to be her due  she had a talent of saying uncommon things in such an easy manner that everybody thought they could have said the same and which yet required both genius and observation to say them  even severe things appeared gentle though they lost not their force from the sweetness of her air and utterance and the apparent benevolence of her purpose  we form the truest judgment of persons by their behavior on the most familiar occasions i will give an instance or two of the correction she favored me with on such a one  when very young i was guilty of the fault of those who want to be courted to sing she cured me of it at the first of our happy intimacy by her own example and by the following correctives occasionally yet privately enforced  well my dear shall we take you at your word shall we suppose that you sing but indifferently is not however the act of obliging the company so worthy preferable to the talent of singing and shall not young ladies endeavor to make up for their defects in one part of education by their excellence in another  again you must convince us by attempting to sing that you cannot sing and then we will rid you not only of present but of future importunity  an indulgence however let me add that but tolerable singers do not always wish to meet with  again i know you will favor us byandby and what do you by your excuses but raise our expectations and enhance your own difficulties  at another time has not this accomplishment been a part of your education my nancy how then for your own honor can we allow of your excuses  and i once pleading a cold the usual pretense of those who love to be entreated  sing however my dear as well as you can the greater the difficulty to you the higher the compliment to the company do you think you are among those who know not how to make allowances you should sing my love lest there should be anybody present who may think your excuses owing to affectation  at another time when i had truly observed that a young lady present sung better than i and that therefore i chose not to sing before that lady  fie said she drawing me on one side is not this pride my nancy does it not look as if your principal motive to oblige was to obtain applause a generous mind will not scruple to give advantage to a person of merit though not always to her own advantage and yet she will have a high merit in doing that supposing this excelling person absent who my dear if your example spread shall sing after you you know every one else must be but as a foil to you indeed i must have you as much superior to other ladies in these smaller points as you are in greater  so she was pleased to say to shame me  she was as much above reserve etc  vol vii p     l   from the bottom after the sweet instructress dele the two next paragraphs and read she had a pretty hand at drawing which she obtained with a very little instruction her time was too much taken up to allow though to so fine an art the attention which was necessary to make her greatly excel in it and she used to say that she was afraid of aiming at too many things for fear she should not be tolerable at anything  for her years and her opportunities she was an extraordinary judge of painting in this as in everything else nature was her art her art was nature she even prettily performed in it her grandfather for this reason bequeathed to her all the family pictures charming was her fancy alike sweet and easy was every touch of her pencil and her pen yet her judgment exceeded her performance she did not practice enough to excel in the executive part she could not in everything excel but upon the whole she knew what every subject required according to the nature of it in other words was an absolute mistress of the shouldbe  to give a familiar instance for the sake of young ladies she untaught observed when but a child that the sun moon and stars never appeared at once and were therefore never to be in one piece that bears tigers lions were not natives of an english climate and should not therefore have place in an english landschape that these ravagers of the forest consorted not with lambs kids or fawns nor kites hawks and vulturs with doves partridges and pheasants  and alas she knew before she was nineteen years of age by fatal experience she knew that all these beasts and birds of prey were outdone in treacherous cruelty by man vile barbarous plotting destructive man who infinitely less excuseable than those destroys through wantonness and sport what those only destroy through hunger and necessity  the mere pretenders to those branches of science which she aimed at acquiring she knew how to detect and all from nature propriety another word for nature was as i have hinted her law as it is the foundation of all true judgment but nevertheless she was always uneasy if what she said exposed those pretenders to knowledge even in their absence to the ridicule of lively spirits  let the modern ladies who have not any one of her excellent qualities whose whole time in the short days they generally make and in the inverted night and day where they make them longer is wholly spent in dress visits cards plays operas and musical entertainments wonder at what i have written and shall further write and let them look upon it as an incredible thing that when at a maturer age they cannot boast one of her perfections there should have been a lady so young who had so many  these must be such as know not how she employed her time and cannot form the least idea of what may be done in those hours in which they lie enveloped with the shades of death as she used to call sleep  but before i come to mention the distribution she usually made of her time let me say a few words upon another subject in which she excelled all the young ladies i ever knew  this was her skill in almost all sorts of fine needleworks of which however i shall say the less since possibly you will find it mentioned in some of the letters  that piece which she bequeaths etc  vol vii p     l    after and not presents dele to the words against playing high and read as to her diversions the accomplishments and acquirements she was mistress of will show what they must have been she was far from being fond of cards the fashionable foible of modern ladies nor as will be easily perceived from what i have said and more from what i shall further say had she much time for play she never therefore promoted their being called for and often insensibly diverted the company from them by starting some entertaining subject when she could do it without incurring the imputation of particularity  indeed very few of her intimates would propose cards if they could engage her to read to talk to touch the keys or to sing when any new book or new piece of music came down but when company was so numerous that conversation could not take that agreeable turn which it oftenest does among four or five friends of like years and inclinations and it became in a manner necessary to detach off some of it to make the rest better company she would not refuse to play if upon castingin it fell to her lot and then she showed that her disrelish to cards was the effect of choice only and that she was an easy mistress of every genteel game played with them but then she always declared against playing high except for trifles etc  vol vii p     l   from the bottom after what is our neighbors dele the four next paragraphs and read she was exceedingly charitable the only one of her family that knew the meaning of the word and this with regard both to the souls and the bodies of those who were the wellchosen objects of her benevolence she kept a list of these whom she used to call her poor entering one upon it as another was provided for by death or any other way but always made a reserve nevertheless for unforeseen cases and for accidental distresses and it must be owned that in the prudent distribution of them she had neither example nor equal  the aged the blind the lame the widow the orphan the unsuccessful industrious were particularly the objects of it and the contributing to the schooling of some to the putting out to trades and husbandry the children of others of the laboring or needy poor aod setting them forward at the expiration of their servitude were her great delights as was the giving good books to others and when she had opportunity the instructing the poorer sort of her honest neighbors and fathers tenants in the use of them that charity she used to say which provides for the morals as well as for the bodily wants of the poor gives a double benefit to the public as it adds to the number of the hopeful what it takes from that of the profligate and can there be in the eyes of that god she was wont to say who requires nothing so much from us as acts of beneficence to one another a charity more worthy  her uncle antony when he came to settle in england with his vast fortune obtained in the indies used to say this girl by her charities will bring down a blessing upon us all and it must be owned they trusted pretty much to this presumption  but i need not say more on this head nor perhaps was it necessary to say so much since the charitable bequests in her will sufficiently set forth her excellence in this branch of duty  she was extremely moderate in her diet  quantity in food she used to say was more to be regarded than quality that a full meal was the great enemy both to study and industry that a well built house required but little repairs  by this moderation in her diet she enjoyed with a delicate frame of body a fine state of health was always serene lively cheerful of course and i never knew but of one illness she had and that was by a violent cold caught in an open chaise by a sudden storm of hail and rain in a place where was no shelter and which threw her into a fever attended with dangerous symptoms that no doubt were lightened by her temperance but which gave her friends who then knew her value infinite apprehensions for her in her commonplacebook she has the following note upon the recollection of this illness in the time of her distress  in a dangerous illness with which i was visited a few years before i had the unhappiness to know this ungrateful man would to heaven i had died in it my bed was surrounded by my dear relations  father mother brother sister my two uncles weeping kneeling round me then put up their vows to heaven for my recovery and i fearing that i should drag down with me to my grave one or other of my sorrowing friends wished and prayed to recover for their sakes  alas how shall parents in such cases know what to wish for how happy for them and for me had i then been denied to their prayers  but now am i eased of that care all those dear relations are living still  but not one of them such as they think has been the heinousness of my error but far from being grieved would rejoice to heat of my death     in all her readings and in her conversations upon them she was fonder of finding beauties than blemishes and chose to applaud both authors and books where she could find the least room for it yet she used to lament that certain writers of the first class who were capable of exalting virtue and of putting vice out of countenance too generally employed themselves in works of imagination only upon subjects merely speculative disinteresting and unedifying from which no useful moral or example could be drawn  but she was a severe censurer of pieces of a light or indecent turn which had a tendency to corrupt the morals of youth to convey polluted images or to wound religion whether in itself or through the sides of its professors and this whoever were the authors and how admirable soever the execution she often pitied the celebrated dr swift for so employing his admirable pen that a pure eye was afraid of looking into his works and a pure ear of hearing anything quoted from them such authors she used to say were nor hones to their own talents nor grateful to the god who gave them nor would she on these occasions admit their beauties as a palliation on the contrary she held it as an aggravation of their crime that they who were so capable of mending the heart should in any places show a corrupt one in themselves which must weaken the influences of their good works and pull down with one hand what they built up with the other  all she said and all she did was accompanied with a natural ease and dignity which set her above affectation or the suspicion of it insomuch that that degrading fault so generally imputed to a learned woman was never laid to her charge for with all her excellencies she was forwarder to hear than speak and hence no doubt derived no small part of her improvement  although she was well read in the english french and italian poets and had read the best translations of the latin classics yet seldom did she quote or repeat from them either in her letters or conversation though exceedingly happy in a tenacious memory principally through modesty and to avoid the imputation of that affectation which i have just mentioned  mr wyerley once said of her she had such a fund of knowledge of her own and made naturally such fine observations upon persons and things being capable by the egg that was his familiar expression of judging of the bird that she had seldom either room or necessity for foreign assistances  but it was plain from her whole conduct and behavior that she had not so good an opinion of herself however deserved since whenever she was urged to give her sentiments on any subject although all she thought fit to say was clear and intelligible yet she seemed in haste to have done speaking her reason for it i know was twofold that she might not lose the benefit of other peoples sentiments by engrossing the conversation and lest as were her words she should be praised into loquaciousness and so forfeit the good opinion which a person always maintains with her friends who knows when she has said enough  it was finally a rule with her to leave her hearers wishing her to say more rather than to give them cause to show by their inattention an uneasiness that she had said so much    you are curious to know etc  vol vii p     l    after age and sex insert her sex did i say what honor to the other does this imply when one might challenge the proudest pedant of them all to say he has been disciplined into greater improvement than she had made from the mere force of genius and application but it is demonstrable to all who know how to make observations on their acquaintance of both sexes arrogant as some are of their superficialities that a lady at eighteen take the world through is more prudent and conversable than a man at twentyfive i can prove this by nineteen instances out of twenty in my own knowledge yet how do these poor boasters value themselves upon the advantages their education gives them who has not seen some one of them just come from the university disdainfully smile at a mistaken or illpronounced word from a lady when her sense has been clear and her sentiments just and when he could not himself utter a single sentence fit to be repeated but what he borrowed from the authors he had been obliged to study as a painful exercise to slow and creeping parts but how i digress  this excellent young lady used to say etc  vol vii p   0 l    after dispensed with her rules insert  in mere indulgence to my foibles and idler habits for i also though i had the benefit of an example i so much admired am too much of a modern yet as to morning risings i had corrected myself by such a precedent in the summertime and can witness to the benefit i found by it in my health as also to the many useful things i was enabled by that means with ease and pleasure to perform and in her accountbook etc  vol vii p   0 l   from the bottom after for my reward dele the next paragraph and read i had indeed too much impatience in my temper to observe such a regularity in accounting between me and myself i satisfied myself in a lump account as i may call it if i had nothing greatly wrong to reproach myself with when i looked back on a past week as she had taught me to do  for she used indulgently to say i do not think all i do necessary for another to do nor even for myself but when it is more pleasant to me to keep such an account than to let it alone why may i not proceed in my supererogatories  there can be no harm in it it keeps up my attention to accounts which one day may be of use to me in more material instances those who will not keep a strict account seldom long keep any i neglect not more useful employments for it and it teaches me to be covetous of time the only thing of which we can be allowably covetous since we live but once in this world and when gone are gone from it for ever  she always reconciled the necessity under which these interventions as she called them laid her of nowandthen breaking into some of her appropriations saying there was good sense and good manners too in the common lesson when at rome do as they do at rome and that to be easy of persuasion in matters where one could oblige without endangering virtue or worthy habits was an apostolical excellency since if a person conformed with a view of making herself an interest in her friends affectins in order to be heeded in greater points it was imitating his example who became all things to all men that he might gain some nor is it to be doubted had life been spared her that the sweetness of her temper and her cheerful piety would have made virtue and religion appear so lovely that her example would have had no small influence upon the minds and manners of those who would have had the honor of conversings with her  o mr belford etc  vol vii p     dele the two last paragraphs and read and still the less as the inconsolable mother rested not till she had procured by means of colonel morden large extracts from some of the letters that compose this history which convinced them all that the very correspondence which clarissa while with them renewed with mr lovelace was renewed for their sakes more than for her own that she had given him no encouragement contrary to her duty and to that prudence for which she was so early noted that had they trusted to a discretion which they owned she had never brought into question she would have extricated them and herself as she once proposed see vol i p     to her mother from all difficulties as to lovelace that she if any woman ever could would have given a glorious instance of a passion conquered or at least kept under by reason and by piety the man being too immoral to be implicitly beloved  the unhappy parents and uncles from the perusal of these extracts too evidently for their peace saw that it was entirely owing to the avarice the ambition the envy of her implacable brother and sister and to the senseless confederacy entered into by the whole family to compel her to give her hand to a man she must despise or she had not been a clarissa and to their consequent persecutions of her that she ever thought of quitting her fathers house and that even when she first entertained such a thought it was with intent if possible to procure for herself a private asylum with mrs how or at some other place of safety but not with mr lovelace nor with any of the ladies of his family though invited by the latter from whence she might propose terms which ought to have been complied with and which were entirely consistent with her duty  that though she found herself disappointed of the hopedfor refuge and protection she intended not by meeting mr lovelace to put herself into his power all that she aimed at by taking that step being to endeavor to pacify so fierce a spirit lest he should as he indeed was determined to do pay a visit to her friends which might have been attended with fatal consequences but was spirited away by him in such a manner as made her an object of pity rather than of blame  these extracts further convinced them all that it was to her unaffected regret that she found that marriage was not in her power afterward for a long time and at last but on one occasion when their unnatural cruelty to her on a new application she had made to her aunt hervey to procure mercy and pardon rendered her incapable of receiving his proffered hand and so obliged her to suspend the day intending only to suspend it till recovered  they saw with equal abhorrence of lovelace and of their own cruelty and with the highest admiration of her that the majesty of her virtue had awed the most daring spirit in the world so that he durst not attempt to carry his base designs into execution till by wicked potions he had made her senses the previous sacrifice  but how did they in a manner adore her memory how did they recriminate upon each other when they found that she had not only preserved herself from repeated outrage by the most glorious and intrepid behavior in defiance and to the utter confusion of all his libertine notions but had the fortitude constantly and with a noble disdain to reject him  whom  why the man she once could have loved kneeling for pardon and begging to be permitted to make her the best reparation then in his power to make her that is to say by marriage his fortunes high and unbroken she his prisoner at the time in a vile house rejected by all her friends upon repeated application to them for mercy and forgiveness rejected  mercy and forgiveness and a last blessing afterward imploring and that as much to lighten their future remorses as for the comfort of her own pious heart  yet though savagely refused on a supposition that she was not so near her end as was represented departed forgiving and blessing them all  then they recollected that her posthumous letters instead of reproaches were filled with comfortings that she had in her last will in their own way laid obligations upon them all obligations which they neither deserved nor expected as if she thought to repair the injustice which selfpartiality made some of them conclude done to them by her grandfather in his will  these intelligences and recollections were perpetual subjects of recrimination to them heightened their anguish for the loss of a child who was the glory of their family and not seldom made them shun each other at the times they were accustomed to meet together that they might avoid the mutual reproaches of eyes that spoke when tongues were silent  their stings also sharpened by time what an unhappy family was this well might colonel morden in the words of juvenal challenge all other miserable families to produce such a growing distress as that of the harlowes a few months before so happy were able to produce  humani generis mores tibi nosse volenti sufficit una domus paucos consume dies and dicere te miserum postquam illinc veneris aude mrs harlowe lived about two years and an half after the lamented death of her clarissa  mr harlowe had the additional affliction to survive his lady about half a year her death by newpointing his former anguish and remorse hastening his own  both in their last hours etc  vol vii p     l   after names and families dele the following paragraph and read as those sisters in iniquity sally martin and polly horton had abilities and education superior to what creatures of their cast generally can boast of and as their histories are nowhere given in the preceding papers in which they are frequently mentioned it cannot fail of gratifying the readers curiosity as well as answering the good ends designed by the publication of this work to give a brief account of their parentage and manner of trainingup preparative to the vile courses they fell into and of what became of them after the dreadful exit of the infamous sinclair  sally martin was the daughter of a substantial mercer at the court end of the town to whom her mother a grocers daughter in the city brought a handsome fortune and both having a gay turn and being fond of the fashions which it was their business to promote and which the wives and daughters of the uppermost tradesmen especially in that quarter of the town generally affect to follow it was no wonder that they brought up their daughter accordingly nor that she who was a very sprightly and readywitted girl and reckoned very pretty and very genteel should every year improve upon such examples  she early found herself mistress of herself all she did was right all she said was admired early very early did she dismiss blushes from her cheek she could not blush because she could not doubt and silence whatever were the subject was as much a stranger to her as diffidence  she never was left out of any party of pleasure after she had passed her ninth year and in honor of her prattling vein was considered as a principal person in the frequent treats and entertainments which her parents fond of luxurious living gave with a view to increase their acquaintance for the sake of their businese not duly reflecting that the part they suffered her to take in what made for their interest would probably be a means to quicken the appetites and ruin the morals of that daughter for whose sake as an only child they were solicitous to obtain wealth  the child so much a woman what must the woman be  at fifteen or sixteen she affected both in dress and manners to ape such of the quality as were most apish the richest silks in her fathers shop were not too rich for her at all public diversions she was the leader instead of the led of all her female kindred and acquaintance though they were a third older than herself she would bustle herself into a place and make room for her more bashful companions through the frowns of the first possessors at a crowded theater leaving every one near her amazed at her selfconsequence wondering she had no servant to keep place for her whisperingly enquiring who she was and then sitting down admiring her fortitude  she officiously made herself of consequence to the most noted players who as one of their patronesses applied to her for her interest on their benefitnights she knew the christian as well as surname of every pretty fellow who frequented public places and affected to speak of them by their former  those who had not obeyed the call her eyes always made upon all of them for notice at her entrance or before she took her seat were spoken of with haughtiness as jacks or toms while her favorites with an affectedlyendearing familiarity and a prettiness of accent were jackeys and tommys and if they stood very high in her graces dear devils and agreeable toads  she sat in judgment and an inexorable judge she was upon the actions and conduct of every man and woman of quality and fashion as they became the subjects of conversation she was deeply learned in the scandalous chronicle she made every character every praise and every censure serve to exalt herself she should scorn to do so or so  or that was ever her way and just what she did or liked to do and judging herself by the vileness of the most vile of her sex she wiped her mouth and sat down satisfied witli her own virtue  she had her chair to attend her wherever she went and found people among her betters as her pride stooped to call some of the most insignificant people in the world to encourage her visits  she was practiced in all the arts of the cardtable a true spartan girl and had even courage occasionally to wrangle off a detection late hours turning night into day and day into night were the almost unavoidable consequence of her frequent play her parents pleased themselves that their sally had a charming constitution and as long as she suffered not in her health they were regardless of her morals  the needle she hated and made the constant subjects of her ridicule the fine works that used to employ and to keep out of idleness luxury and extravagance and at home were they to have been of no other service the women of the last age when there were no vauxhalls ranelaghs marybones and suchlike places of diversion to dress out for and gad after  and as to familymanagement her parents had not required any knowledge of that sort from her and she considered it as a qualification only necessary for hirelings and the lowborn and as utterly unworthy of the attention of a modern fine lady  although her father had great business yet living in so high and expensive a way he pretended not to give her a fortune answerable to it neither he nor his wife having set out with any notion of frugality could think of retrenching nor did their daughter desire that they should retrench they thought glare or ostentation reputable they called it living genteelly and as they lifted their heads above their neighbors they supposed their credit concerned to go forward rather than backward in outward appearances they flattered themselves and they flattered their girl and she was entirely of their opinion that she had charms and wit enough to attract some man of rank of fortune at least and yet this daughter of a mercerfather and grocermother could not bear the thoughts of a creeping cit encouraging herself with the few instances  comparatively few which she had always in her head as common ones of girls much inferior to herself in station talents education and even fortune who had succeeded  as she doubted not to succeed handsome settlements and a chariot that tempting gewgaw to the vanity of the middling class of females were the least that she proposed to herself but all this while neither her parents nor herself considered that she had appetites indulged to struggle with and a turn of education given her as well as a warm constitution unguarded by sound principles and unbenefited by example which made her much better qualified for a mistress than a wife  her twentieth year to her own equal wonder and regret passed over her head and she had not had one offer that her pride would permit her to accept of a girl from fifteen to eighteen her beauty then beginning to blossom will as a new thing attract the eyes of men but if she make her face cheap at public places she will find that new faces will draw more attention than fine faces constantly seen policy therefore if nothing else were considered would induce a young beauty if she could tame her vanity just to show herself and to be talked of and then withdrawing as if from discretion and discreet it will be to do so expect to be sought after rather than to be thought to seek for only reviving nowandthen the memory of herself at the public places in turn if she find herself likely to be forgotten and then she will be new again but this observation ought young ladies always to have in their heads that they can hardly ever expect to gratify their vanity and at the same time gain the admiration of men worthy of making partners for life they may in short have many admirers at public places but not one lover  sally martin knew nothing of this doctrine her beauty was in its bloom and yet she found herself neglected sally martin the mercers daughter she never fails being here was the answer and the accompanying observation made to every questioner who is that lady  at last her destiny approached it was at a masquerade that she first saw the gay the handsome lovelace who was just returned from his travels she was immediately struck with his figure and with the brilliant things that she heard fall from his lips as he happened to sit near her he who was not then looking out for a wife was taken with sallys smartness and with an air that at the same time showed her to be equally genteel and selfsignificant and signs of approbation mutually passing he found no difficulty in acquainting himself where to visit her next day and yet it was some mortification to a person of her selfconsequence and gay appearance to submit to be known by so fine a young gentleman as no more than a mercers daughter so natural is it for a girl brought up as sally was to be occasionally ashamed of those whose folly had set her above herself  but whatever it might be to sally it was no disappointment to mr lovelace to find his mistress of no higher degree because he hoped to reduce her soon to the lowest condition that an unhappy woman can fall into  but when miss martin had informed herself that her lover was the nephew and presumptive heir of lord m she thought him the very man for whom she had been so long and so impatiently looking out and for whom it was worth her while to spread her toils and here it may not be amiss to observe that it is very probable that mr lovelace had sally martin in his thoughts and perhaps two or three more whose hopes of marriage from him had led them to their ruin when he drew the following whimsical picture in a letter to his friend belford not inserted in the preceding collection  methinks says he i see a young couple in courtship having each a design upon the other the girl plays off she is very happy as she is she cannot be happier she will not change her single state the man i will suppose is one who does not confess that he desires not that she should she holds ready a net under her apron he another under his coat each intending to throw it over the others neck she over his when her pride is gratified and she thinks she can be sure of him he over hers when the watchedfor yielding moment has carried consent too far  and suppose he happens to be the more dextrous of the two and whips his net over her before she can cast hers over him how i would fain know can she be justly entitled to cry out upon cruelty barbarity deception sacrifices and all the rest of the exclamatory nonsense with which the pretty fools in such a case are wont to din the ears of their conquerors is it not just think thou when she makes her appeals to gods and men that both gods and men should laugh at her and hitting her in the teeth with her own felonious intentions bid her sit down patiently under her deserved disappointment  in short sallys parents as well as herself encouraged mr lovelaces visits they thought they might trust to a discretion in her which she herself was too wise to doubt pride they knew she had and that in these cases is often called discretion  lord help the sex says lovelace if they had not pride  nor did they suspect danger from that specious air of sincerity and gentleness of manners which he could assume or lay aside whenever he pleased  the second masquerade which was no more than their third meeting abroad completed her ruin from so practiced though so young a deceiver and that before she well knew she was in danger for having prevailed on her to go off with him about twelve oclock to his aunt forbess a lady of honor and fortune to whom he had given reason to expect her future niece the only hint of marriage he ever gave her he carried her to the house of the wicked woman who bears the name of sinclair in these papers and there by promises which she understood in the favorable sense for where a woman loves she seldom doubts enough for her own safety obtained an easy conquest over a virtue that was little more than nominal  he found it not difficult to induce her to proceed in the guilty commerce till the effects of it became too apparent to be hid her parents then in the first fury of their disappointment and vexation for being deprived of all hopes of such a soninlaw turned her out of doors  her disgrace thus published she became hardened and protected by her seducer whose favorite mistress she then was she was so incensed against her parents for an indignity so little suiting with her pride and the head they had always given her that she refused to return to them when repenting of their passonate treatment of her they would have been reconciled to her and becoming the favorite daughter of her mother sinclair at the persuasions of that abandoned woman she practiced to bring on an abortion which she effected though she was so far gone that it had like to have cost her her life  thus unchastity her first crime murder her next her conscience became seared and young as she was and fond of her deceiver soon grew indelicate enough having so thoroughpaced a schoolmistress to do all she could to promote the pleasures of the man who had ruined her scrupling not with a spirit truly diabolical to endeavor to draw in others to follow her example and it is hardly to be believed what mischiefs of this sort she was the means of effecting woman confiding in and daring woman and she a creature of specious appearance and great art  a still viler wickedness if possible remains to be said of sally martin  her father dying her mother in hopes to reclaim her as she called it proposed to her to quit the house of the infamous sinclair and to retire with her into the country where her disgrace and her then wicked way of live would not be known and there so to life as to save appearances the only virtue she had ever taught her besides that of endeavoring rather to delude than to be deluded  to this sally consented but with no other intention as she often owned and gloried in it than to cheat her mother of the greatest part of her substance in revenge for consenting to her being turned out of doors long before and by way of reprisal for having persuaded her father as she would have it to cut her off in his last will from any share in his fortune  this unnatural wickedness in half a years time she brought about and then the serpent retired to her obscene den with her spoils laughing at what she had done even after it had broken her mothers heart as it did in a few months time a severe but just punishment for the unprincipled education she had given her  it ought to be added that this was an iniquity of which neither mr lovelace nor any of his friends could bear to hear her boast and always checked her for it whenever she did condemning it with one voice and it is certain that this and other instances of her complicated wickedness turned early lovelaces heart against her and had she not been subservient to him in his other pursuits he would not have endured her for speaking of her he would say let not any one reproach us jack there is no wickedness like the wickedness of a woman ecclus xxv      a bad education was the preparative it must be confessed and for this sally martin had reason to thank her parents as they had reason to thank themselves for what followed but had she not met with a lovelace she had avoided a sinclair and might have gone on at the common rate of wives so educated and been the mother of children turned out to take their chance in the world as she was so many lumps of soft was fit to take any impression that the first accident gave them neither happy nor making happy everything but useful and well off if not extremely miserable  polly horton was the daughter of a gentlewoman well descended whose husband a man of family and of honor was a captain in the guards  he died when polly was about nine years of age leaving her to the care of her mother a lively young lady of about twentysix with a genteel provision for both  her mother was extremely fond of her polly but had it not in herself to manifest the true the genuine fondness of a parent by a strict and guarded education dressing out and visiting and being visited by the gay of her own sex and casting out her eye abroad as one very ready to try her fortune again in the married state  this induced those airs and a love to those diversions which make a young widow of so lively a turn the unfittest tutress in the world even to her own daughter  mrs horton herself having had an early turn to music and that sort of reading which is but an earlier debauchery for young minds preparative to the grosser at riper years to wit romances and novels songs and plays and those without distinction moral or immoral she indulged her daughter in the same taste and at those hours when they could not take part in the more active and lively amusements and killtimes as some call them used to employ miss to read to her happy enough in her own imagination that while she was diverting her own ears and sometimes as the piece was corrupting her own heart and her childs too she was teaching miss to read and improve her mind for it was the boast of every teatable halfhour that miss horton in propriety accent and emphasis surpassed all the young ladies of her age and at other times complimenting the pleased mother  bless me madam with what a surprising grace miss horton reads  she enters into the very spirit of her subject  this she could have from nobody but you an intended praise but as the subjects were would have been a severe satire in the mouth of an enemy  while the fond the inconsiderate mother with a delighted air would cry why i cannot but say miss horton does credit to her tutress and then a comehither my best love and with a kiss of approbation what a pleasure to your dear papa had he lived to see your improvements my charmer  concluding with a sigh of satisfaction her eyes turning round upon the circle to take in all the silent applauses of theirs but little thought the fond the foolish mother what the plant would be which was springing up from these seeds little imagined she that her own ruin as well as her childs was to be the consequence of this fine education and that in the same illfated hour the honor both of mother and daughter was to become a sacrifice to the intriguing invader  this the laughing girl when abandoned to her evil destiny and in company with her sister sally and others each recounting their settingsout their progress and their fall frequently related to be her education and manner of trainingup  this and to see a succession of humble servants buzzing about a mother who took too much pride in addresses of that kind what a beginning what an example to a constitution of tinder so prepared to receive the spark struck from the steely forehead and flinty heart of such a libertine as at last it was their fortune to be encountered by  in short as miss grew up under the influences of such a directress and of books so light and frothy with the inflaming additions of music concerts operas plays assemblies balls and the rest of the rabble of amusements of the modern life it is no wonder that like early fruit she was soon ripened to the hand of the insidious gatherer  at fifteen she owned she was ready to fansy herself the heroine of every novel and of every comedy she read so well did she enter into the spirit of her subject she glowed to become the object of some heros flame and perfectly longed to begin an intrigue and even to be run away with by some enterprising lover yet had neither confinement nor check to apprehend from her indiscreet mother which she thought absolutely necessary to constitute a parthenissa  nevertheless with all these fine modern qualities did she complete her nineteenth year before she met with any address of consequence one half of her admirers being afraid because of her gay turn and but middling fortune to make serious applications for her favor while others were kept at distance by the superior airs she assumed and a third sort not sufficiently penetrating the foibles either of mother or daughter were kept off by the supposed watchful care of the former  but when the man of intrepidity and intrigue was found never was heroine so soon subdued never goddess so early stripped of her celestials for at the opera a diversion at which neither she nor her mother ever missed to be present she beheld the specious lovelace beheld him invested with all the airs of heroic insult resenting a slight affront offered to his sally martin by two gentlemen who had known her in her more hopeful state one of whom mr lovelace obliged to sneak away with a broken head given with the pommel of his sword the other with a bloody nose neither of them well supporting that readiness of offense which it seems was a part of their known characters to be guilty of  the gallantry of this action drawing every bystander on the side of the hero o the brave man cried polly horton aloud to her mother in a kind of rapture how needful the protection of the brave to the fair with a softness in her voice which she had taught herself to suit her fansied high condition of life  a speech so much in his favor could not but take the notice of a man who was but too sensible of the advantages which his fine person and noble air gave him over the gentler hearts who was always watching every female eye and who had his ear continually turned to every affected voice for that was one of his indications of a proper subject to be attempted  affectation of every sort he used to say is a certain sign of a wrongturned head of a faulty judgment and upon such a basis i seldom build in vain  he instantly resolved to be acquainted with a young creature who seemed so strongly prejudiced in his favor never man had a readier invention for all sorts of mischief he gave his sally her cue he called her sister in their hearing and sally whisperingly gave the young lady and her mother in her own way the particulars of the affront she had received making herself an angel of light to cast the brighter ray upon the character of her heroic brother she particularly praised his known and approved courage and mingled with her praises of him such circumstances relating to his birth his fortune and endowments as left him nothing to do but to fall in love with the enamoured polly  mr lovelace presently saw what turn to give to his professions so brave a man yet of manners so gentle hit the young ladys taste nor could she suspect the heart that such an aspect covered this was the man the very man she whispered to her mother and when the opera was over his servant procuring a coach he undertook with his specious sister to set them down at their own lodgings though situated a quite different way from his and there were they prevailed upon to alight and partake of a slight repast  sally pressed them to return the favor to her at her aunt forbess and hoped it would be before her brother went to his own seat  they promised her and named their evening  a splendid entertainment was provided the guests came having in the interim found all that was said of his name and family and fortune to be true persons of so little strictness in their own morals took it not into their heads to be very inquisitive after his  music and dancing had their share in the entertainment these opened their hearts already halfopened by love the aunt forbes and the lovers sister kept them open by their own example the hero sung vowed promised their gratitude was moved their delights were augmented their hopes increased their confidence was engaged all their appetites up in arms the rich wines cooperating beat quite off their guard and not thought enough remaining so much as for suspicion miss detached from her mother by sally soon fell a sacrifice to the successful intriguer  the widow herself half intoxicated and raised as she was with artful mixtures and inflamed by love unexpectedly tendered by one of the libertines his constant companions to whom an opportunity was contrived to be given to be alone with her and that closely followed by importunity fell into her daughters error the consequences of which in length of time becoming apparent grief shame remorse seized her heart her own indiscretion not allowing her to arraign her daughters and she survived not her delivery leaving polly with child likewise who when delivered being too fond of the gay deluder to renounce his company even when she found herself deluded fell into a course of extravagance and dissoluteness ran through her fortune in a very little time and as an high preferment at last with sally was admitted a quarterpartner with the detestable sinclair  all that is necessary to add to the history of these unhappy women will be comprised in a very little compass  after the death etc  vol vii p     l   from the bottom on the words deny it him add the following note several worthy persons have wished that the heinous practice of duelling had been more forcibly discouraged by way of note at the conclusion of a work designed to recommend the highest and most important doctrines of christianity it is humbly presumed that those persons have not sufficiently attended to what is already done on that subject in vol ii letter x and in vol vii letters lxixxciiixcivxcv  vol vii p     add the following postscript in which several objections that have been made as well to the catastrophe as to different parts of the preceding history are briefly considered the foregoing work having been published at three different periods of time the author in the course of its publication was favored with many anonymous letters in which the writers differently expressed their wishes with regard to the apprehended catastrophe  most of those directed to him by the gentler sex turned in favor of what they called a fortunate ending some of the fair writers enamoured as they declared with the character of the heroine were warmly solicitous to have her made happy and others likewise of their mind insisted that poetical justice required that it should be so and when says one ingenious lady whose undoubted motive was goodnature and humanity it must be concluded that it is in an authors power to make his piece end as he pleases why should he not give pleasure rather than pain to the reader whom he has interested in favor of his principal characters  others and some gentlemen declared against tragedies in general and in favor of comedies almost in the words of lovelace who was supported in his taste by all the women at mrs sinclairs and by sinclair herself i have too much feeling said he see vol iv p     there is enough in the world to make our hearts sad without carrying grief into our diversions and making the distresses of others our own  and how was this happy ending to be brought about why by this very easy and trite expedient to wit by reforming lovelace and marrying him to clarissa  not however abating her one of her trials nor any of her sufferings for the sake of the sport her distresses would give to the tenderhearted reader as she went along the last outrage excepted that indeed partly in compliment to lovelace himself and partly for delicacysake they were willing to spare her  but whatever were the fate of his work the author was resolved to take a different method he always thought that sudden conversions such especially as were left to the candor of the reader to suppose and make out had neither art nor nature nor even probability in them and that they were moreover of very bad example to have a lovelace for a series of years glory in his wickedness and think that he had nothing to do but as an act of grace and favor to hold out his hand to receive that of the best of women whenever he pleased and to have it thought that marriage would be a sufficient amends for all his enormities to others as well as to her he could not bear that nor is reformation as he has shown in another piece to be secured by a fine face by a passion that has sense for its object nor by the goodness of a wifes heart or even example if the heart of the husband be not graciously touched by the divine finger  it will be seen by this time that the author had a great end in view he has lived to see skepticism and infidelity openly avowed and even endeavored to be propagated from the press the great doctrines of the gospel brought into question those of selfdenial and mortification blotted out of the catalogue of christian virtues and a taste even to wantonness for outdoor pleasure and luxury to the general exclusion of domestic as well as public virtue industriously promoted among all ranks and degrees of people  in this general depravity when even the pulpit has lost great part of its weight and the clergy are considered as a body of interested men the author thought he should be able to answer it to his own heart be the success what it would if he threw in his mite toward introducing a reformation so much wanted and he imagined that if in an age given up to diversion and entertainment he could steal in as may be said and investigate the great doctrines of christianity under the fashionable guise of an amusement he should be most likely to serve his purpose remembering that of the poet a verse may find him who a sermon flies and turn delight into a sacrifice   he was resolved therefore to attempt something that never yet had been done he considered that the tragic poets have as seldom made their heroes true objects of pity as the comic theirs laudable ones of imitation and still more rarely have made them in their deaths look forward to a future hope and thus when they die they seem totally to perish death in such instances must appear terrible it must be considered as the greatest evil but why is death set in shocking lights when it is the universal lot  he has indeed thought fit to paint the death of the wicked as terrible as he could paint it but he has endeavored to draw that of the good in such an amiable manner that the very balaams of the world should not forbear to wish that their latter end might be like that of the heroine  and after all what is the poetical justice so much contended for by some as the generality of writers have managed it but another sort of dispensation than that with which god by revelation teaches us he has thought fit to exercise mankind whom placing here only in a state of probation he has so intermingled good and evil as to necessitate us to look forward for a more equal dispensation of both  the author of the history or rather dramatic narrative of clarissa is therefore well justified by the christian system in deferring to extricate suffering virtue to the time in which it will meet with the completion of its reward  but we have no need etc  vol   p     l    dele thus far mr addison and read this subject is further considered in a letter to the spectator see spect vol vii no       i find your opinion says the author of it concerning the lateinvented term called poetical justice is controverted by some eminent critics i have drawn up some additional arguments to strengthen the opinion which you have there delivered having endeavored to go to the bottom of that matter  the most perfect man has vices enough to draw down punishments upon his head and to justify providence in regard to any miseries that may befall him for this reason i cannot think but that the instruction and moral are much finer where a man who is virtuous in the main of his character falls into distress and sinks under the blows of fortune at the end of a tragedy than when he is represented as happy and triumphant such an example corrects the insolence of human nature softens the mind of the beholder with sentiments of pity and compassion comforts him under his own private affliction and teaches him not to judge of mens virtues by their successes a caution that our blessed savior himself gives in the case of the eighteen persons killed by the fall of the tower of siloam luke xiiia  i cannot think of one real hero in all antiquity so far raised above human infirmities that he might not be very naturally represented in a tragedy as plunged in misfortunes and calamities the poet may still find out some prevailing passion or indiscretion in his character and show it in such a manner as will sufficiently acquit providence of any injustice in his sufferings for as horace observes the best man is faulty though not in so great a degree as those whom we generally call vicious men vitiis nemo sine nascitur optimus ille qui minimis urgetur     if such a strict poetical justice proceeds the letterwriter as some gentlemen insist upon were to be observed in this art there is no manner of reason why it should not extend to heroic poetry as well as tragedy but we find it so little observed in homer that his achilles is placed in the greatest point of glory and success though his character is morally vicious and only poetically good if i may use the phrase of our modern critics the aeneid is filled with innocent unhappy persons nisus and euryalus lausus and pallas come all to unfortunate ends the poet takes notice in particular that in the sacking of troy ripheus fell who was the most just man among the trojans   cadit and ripheus justissimus unus qui fuit in teucris and servantissimus aequi diis aliter visum est  the gods thought fit  so blameless ripheus fell who loved fair justice and observed it well   and that pantheus could neither be preserved by his transcendent piety nor by the holy fillets of apollo whose priest he was   nec te tua plurima pantheu labentem pietas nec apollinis infula texit aen ii nor could thy piety thee pantheus save nor even thy priesthood from an early grave   i might here mention the practice of ancient tragic poets both greek and latin but as this particular is touched upon in the paper abovementioned i shall pass it over in silence i could produce passages out of aristotle in favor of my opinion and if in one place he says that an absolutely virtuous man should not be represented as unhappy this does not justify any one who should think fit to bring in an absolutely virtuous man upon the stage those who are acquainted with that authors way of writing know very well that to take the whole extent of his subject into his divisions of it he often makes use of such cases as are imaginary and not reducible to practice  i shall conclude says this gentleman with observing that though the spectator abovementioned is so far against the rule of poetical justice as to affirm that good men may meet with an unhappy catastrophe in tragedy it does not say that ill men may go off unpunished the reason for this distinction is very plain namely because the best of men as is said above have faults enough to justify providence for any misfortunes and afflictions which may befall them but there are many men so criminal that they can have no claim or pretense to happiness the best of men may deserve punishment but the worst of men cannot deserve happiness  mr addison as we have seen above tells us that aristotle in considering the tragedies that were written in either of the kinds observes that those which ended unhappily had always pleased the people and carried away the prize in the public disputes of the stage from those that ended happily  our fair readers etc  vol vii p   0 l   after chasle and virtuous insert these are the great authorities so favorable to the stories that end unhappily and we beg leave to reinforce this inference from them that if the temporary sufferings of the virtuous and the good can be accounted for and justified on pagan principles many more and infinitely stronger reasons will occur to a christian reader in behalf of what are called unhappy catastrophes from the consideration of the doctrine of future rewards which is everywhere strongly enforced in the history of clarissa  of this to give but one instance an ingenious modern distinguished by his rank but much more by his excellent defense of some of the most important doctrines of christianity appears convinced in the conclusion of a pathetic monody not long ago published in which after he had deplored as a man without hope expressing ourselves in the scripture phrase the loss of an excellent wife he thus consoles himself yet o my soul thy rising murmurs stay nor dare the allwise disposer to arraign or against his supreme decree with impious grief complain that all thy fullblown joys at once should fade was his most righteous will and be that will obeyed would thy fond love his grace to her control and in these low abodes of sin and pain her pure exalted soul unjustly for thy partial good detain no  rather strive thy groveling mind to raise up to that unclouded blaze that heavenly radiance of eternal light in which enthroned she now with pity sees how frail how insecure how slight is every mortal bliss   but of infinitely greater weight than all that has been above produced on this subject are the words of the psalmist  as for me says he psalm lxxiii  my feet were almost gone my steps had wellnigh slipped for i was envious at the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked for their strength is firm they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other men  their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than their heart could wish  verily i have cleansed mine heart in vain and washed my hands in innocence for all the day long have i been plagued and chastened every morning when i thought to know this it was too painful for me until i went into the sanctuary of god then understood i their end  thou shall guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to glory  this is the psalmists comfort and dependence and shall man presuming to alter the common course of nature and so far as he is able to elude the tenure by which frail mortality indispensably holds imagine that he can make a better dispensation and by calling it poetical justice indirectly reflect on the divine  the more pains have been taken to obviate the objections arising from the notion of poetical justice as the doctrine built upon it had obtained general credit among us and as it must be confessed to have the appearance of humanity and goodnature for its supports and yet the writer of the history of clarissa etc  vol vii p     l   after heaven only could reward insert we shall now according to expectation given in the preface to this edition proceed to take brief notice of such other objections as have come to our knowledge for as is there said this work being addressed to the public as an history of life and manners those parts of it which are proposed to carry with them the force of example ought to be as unobjectible as is consistent with the design of the whole and with human nature  several persons have censured the heroine as too cold in her love too haughty and even sometimes provoking but we may presume to say that this objection has arisen from want of attention to the story to the character of clarissa and to her particular situation  it was not intended that she should be in love but in liking only if that expression may be admitted it is meant to be everywhere inculcated in the story for examplesake that she never would have married mr lovelace because of his immoralities had she been left to herself and that her ruin was principally owing to the persecutions of her friends  what is too generally called love ought perhaps as generally to be called by another name cupidity or a paphian stimulus as some women even of condition have acted are not words too harsh to be substituted on the occasion however grating they may be to delicate ears but take the word love in the gentlest and most honorable sense it would have been thought by some highly improbable that clarissa should have been able to show such a command of her passions as makes so distinguishing a part of her character had she been as violently in love as certain warm and fierce spirits would have had her to be a few observations are thrown in by way of note in the present edition at proper places to obviate this objection or rather to bespeak the attention of hasty readers to what lies obviously before them for thus the heroine anticipates this very objection expostulating with miss how on her contemptuous treatment of mr hickman which far from being guilty of the same fault herself she did on all occasions and declares she would do whenever miss how forgot herself although she had not a day to live  o my dear says she that it had been my lot as i was not permitted to live single to have met with a man by whom i could have acted generously and unreservedly  mr lovelace it is now plain in order to have a pretense against me taxed my behavior to him with stiffness and distance you at one time thought me guilty of some degree of prudery difficult situations should be allowed for which often make seeming occasions for censure unavoidable i deserved not blame from him who made mine difficult and if i had had any other man to deal with than mr lovelace or had he had but half the merit which mr hickman has you my dear should have found that my doctrine on this subject should have governed my practice see this whole letter vol vii p        see also mr lovelaces letter no cxi vol vii p  0  and seq where just before his death he entirely acquits her conduct on this head  it has been thought by some worthy and ingenious persons that if lovelace had been drawn an infidel or scoffer his character according to the taste of the present worse than skeptical age would have been more natural it is however too well known that there are very many persons of his cast whose actions discredit their belief and are not the very devils in scripture said to believe and tremble  but the reader must have observed that great and it is hoped good use has been made throughout the work by drawing lovelace an infidel only in practice and this as well in the arguments of his friend belford as in his own frequent remorses when touched with temporary compunction and in his last scenes which could not have been made had either of them been painted as sentimental unbelievers not to say that clarissa whose great objection to mr wyerley was that he was a scoffer must have been inexcuseable had she known lovelace to be so and had given the least attention to his addresses on the contrary thus she comforts herself when she thinks she must be his  this one consolation however remains he is not an infidel an unbeliever had he been an infidel there would have been no room at all for hope of him but priding himself as he does in his fertile invention he would have been utterly abandoned irreclaimable and a savage see vol iv p      and it must be observed that scoffers are too witty in their own opinion in other words value themselves too much upon their profligacy to aim at concealing it  besides had lovelace added ribbald jests upon religion to his other liberties the freedoms which would then have passed between him and his friend must have been of a nature truly infernal and this farther hint was meant to be given by way of inference that the man who allowed himself in those liberties either of speech or action which lovelace thought shameful was so far a worse man than lovelace for this reason is he everywhere made to treat jests on sacred things and subjects even down to the mythology of the pagans among pagans as undoubted marks of the illbreeding of the jesters obscene images and talk as liberties too shameful for even rakes to allow themselves in and injustice to creditors and in matters of meum and tuum as what it was beneath him to be guilty of  some have objected to the meekness to the tameness as they will have it to be of the character of mr hickman and yet lovelace owns that he rose upon him with great spirit in the interview between them once when he thought a reflection was but implied on miss how see vol vi p  0   and another time when he imagined himself treated contemptuously see vol vi p   0  miss how it must be owned though not to the credit of her own character treats him ludicrously on several occasions but so she does her mother and perhaps a lady of her lively turn would have treated as whimsically any man but a lovelace mr belford speaks of him with honor and respect vol vi p   0      so does colonel morden vol vii p      and so does clarissa on every occasion and all that miss how herself says of him tends more to his reputation than discredit vol ii p      and vol iii p      as clarissa indeed tells her see vol ii p      and as to lovelaces treatment of him the reader must have observed that it was his way to treat every man with contempt partly by way of selfexaltation and partly to gratify the natural gaiety of his disposition he says himself to belford vol vi p      thou know i love him not jack and whom we love not we cannot allow a merit to perhaps not the merit they should be granted modest and diffident men writes belford to lovelace in praise of mr hickman wear not soon off those little precisenesses which the confident if ever they had them presently get over  but as miss how treats her mother as freely as she does her lover so does mr lovelace take still greater liberties with mr belford than he does with mr hickman with respect to his person air and address as mr belford himself hints to mr hickman vol vii p      and yet he is not so readily believed to the discredit of mr belford by the ladies in general as he is when he disparages mr hickman whence can this partiality arise   mr belford had been a rake but was in a way of reformation  mr hickman had always been a good man  and lovelace confidently says that the women love a man whose regard for them is founded in the knowledge of them see vol v p      nevertheless it must be owned that it was not proposed to draw mr hickman as the man of whom the ladies in general were likely to be very fond had it been so goodness of heart and gentleness of manners great assiduity and inviolable and modest love would not of themselves have been supposed sufficient recommendations he would not have been allowed the least share of preciseness or formality although those defects might have been imputed to his reverence for the object of his passion but in his character it was designed to show that the same man could not be everything and to intimate to ladies that in choosing companions for life they should rather prefer the honest heart of a hickman which would be all their own than to risque the chance of sharing perhaps with scores and some of those probably the most profligate of the sex the volatile mischievous one of a lovelace in short that they should choose if they wished for durable happiness for rectitude of mind and not for speciousness of person or address nor make a jest of a good man in favor of a bad one who would make a jest of them and of their whole sex  two letters however by way of accommodation are inserted in this edition which perhaps will give mr hickmans character some heightening with such ladies as love spirit in a man and had rather suffer by it than not meet with it  women born to be controlled stoop to the forward and the bold   says waller  and lovelace too  some have wished that the story had been told in the usual narrative way of telling stories designed to amuse and divert and not in letters written by the respective persons whose history is given in them the author thinks he ought not to prescribe to the taste of others but imagined himself at liberty to follow his own he perhaps mistrusted his talents for the narrative kind of writing he had the good fortune to succeed in the epistolary way once before a story in which so many persons were concerned either principally or collaterally and of characters and dispositions so various carried on with tolerable connection and perspicuity in a series of letters from different persons without the aid of digressions and episodes foreign to the principal end and design he thought had novelty to be pleaded for it and that in the present age he supposed would not be a slight recommendation  but besides what has been said above and in the preface on this head the following opinion of an ingenious and candid foreigner on this manner of writing may not be improperly inserted here  the method which the author has pursued in the history of clarissa is the same as in the life of pamela both are related in familiar letters by the parties themselves at the very time in which the events happened and this method has given the author great advantages which he could not have drawn from any other species of narration the minute particulars of events the sentiments and conversation of the parties are upon this plan exhibited with all the warmth and spirit that the passion supposed to be predominant at the very time could produce and with all the distinguishing characteristics which memory can supply in a history of recent transactions  romances in general and marivauxs amongst others are wholly improbable because they suppose the history to be written after the series of events is closed by the catastrophe a circumstance which implies a strength of memory beyond all example and probability in the persons concerned enabling them at the distance of several years to relate all the particulars of a transient conversation or rather it implies a yet more improbable confidence and familiarity between all these persons and the author  there is however one difficulty attending the epistolary method for it is necessary that all the characters should have an uncommon taste for this kind of conversation and that they should suffer no event nor even a remarkable conversation to pass without immediately committing it to writing but for the preservation of the letters once written the author has provided with great judgment so as to render this circumstance highly probable this quotation is translated from a critique on the history of clarissa written in french and published at amsterdam the whole citique is rendered into english and inserted in the gentlemans magazine of june and august      the author has done great honor in it to the history of clarissa and as there are remarks published with it answering several objections made to different passages by that candid foreigner the reader is referred to the aforesaid magazines for both   it is presumed that what this gentleman says of the difficulties attending a story thus given in the epistolary manner of writing will not be found to reach the history before us it is very well accounted for in it how the two principal female characters come to take so great a delight in writing their subjects are not merely subjects of amusement but greatly interesting to both yet many ladies there are who now laudably correspond when at distance from each other on occasions that far less affect their mutual welfare and friendships than those treated of by these ladies the two principal gentlemen had motives of gaiety and vainglory for their inducements it will generally be found that persons who have talents for familiar writeing as these correspondents are presumed to have will not forbear amusing themselves with their pens on less arduous occasions than what offer to these these four whose stories have a connection with each other out of a great number of characters which are introduced in this history are only eminent in the epistolary way the rest appear but as occasional writers and as drawn in rather by necessity than choice from the different relations in which they stand with the four principal persons  vol vii p     l   after the principal characters insert some there are and ladies too who have supposed that the excellencies of the heroine are carried to an improbable and even to an impracticable height in this history but the education of clarissa from early childhood ought to be considered as one of her very great advantages as indeed the foundation of all her excellencies and it is hoped for the sake of the doctrine designed to be inculcated by it that it will  she had a pious a wellred a not meanlydescended woman for her nurse who with her milk as mrs harlowe says see vol iv p     gave her that nurture which no other nurse could give her she was very early happy in the conversationvisits of her learned and worthy dr lewen and in her correspondencies not with him only but with other divines mentioned in her last will her mother was upon the whole a good woman who did credit to her birth and her fortune and both delighted in her for those improvements and seize which gave her and them in her a distinction that caused it to be said that when she was out of the family it was considered but as a common family see vol vii p    see also her mothers praises of her to mrs norton vol i p      she was moreover a country lady and as we have seen in miss howes character of her see vol vii p      took great delight in rural and household employments though qualified to adorn the brightest circle  it must be confessed that we are not to look for clarissas among the constant frequenters of ranelagh and vauxhall nor among those who may be called daughters of the cardtable if we do the character of our heroine may then indeed be justly thought not only improbable but unattainable but we have neither room in this place nor inclination to pursue a subject so invidious we quit it therefore after we have repeated that we know there are some and we hope there are many in the british dominions or they are hardly anywhere in the european world who as far as occasion has called upon them to exert the like humble and modest yet steady and useful virtues have reached the perfections of a clarissa  having thus briefly taken notice of the most material objections that have been made to different parts of this history it is hoped we may be allowed to add that had we thought ourselves at liberty to give copies of some of the many letters that have been written on the other side of the question that is to say in approbation of the catastrophe and of the general conduct and execution of the work by some of the most eminent judges of composition in every branch of literature most of what has been written in this postscript might have been spared  but as the principal objection with many has lain against the length of the piece we shall add to what we have said above on that subject in the words of one of those eminent writers that if in the history before us etc  to the author of clarissa if mid their round of pleasure to convey an useful lesson to the young and gay to swell their eyes with pearly drops and share with cards and dress the converse of the fair if with the boasted bards of classic age the attention of the learned to engage and in the bosom of the rake to raise a tender social feeling  merit praise the gay the fair the learned even rakes agree to give that praise to nature truth and thee transported now to harloweplace we view thy matchless maid her godlike tasks pursue visit the sick or needy and bestow drugs to relieve or words to soften woe or with the pious lewen hear her soar heights unattaind by female minds before then

construe even unavoidable accidents into slighs or neglects adversity is the state of trial of every good quality people in adversity should endeavor to preserve laudable customs that so if sunshine return they may not be losers by their trials when calamities befall us we ought to look into ourselves and far misfortunes are often sent to reduce us to a better reliance than that we have been accustomed to fix upon no one is out of the reach of misfortune no one therefore should glory in his prosperity be a persons provocations ever so great her calamities ever so heavy she should always remember that she is gods creature and not her own persons in calamity when they wish for death should be sure that they wish for it from proper motives worldly disappointments will not of themselves warrant such wishes adversity will call forth graces in a noble mind which could not have been brought to light in prosperous fortune people in affliction or distress cannot be hated by generous minds people who through calamity are careless of their health will not perhaps be able to escape death when they would wish to do so in the school of affliction we are taught to know ourselves to compassionate and bear with one another and to look up to a better state the unhappy never want enemies the person who makes a proper use of calamity may be said to be in the direct road to glory persons who labor under real evils will not puzzle themselves with conjectural ones calamity is the test of integrity distress makes the humbled heart diffident calamity calls out the fortitude that distinguishes a spirit truly noble certainty in a deep distress is more eligible than suspense  see consolation advice and cautions to women every ones eyes are upon the conduct the visits the visitors of a young lady made early independent encroaching and designing men make an artillery of a womans hopes and fears and play it upon her at their pleasure artful men frequently endeavor to entangle thoughtless women by bold supposals and offers and if not checked to reckon upon silence as concession women should be cautious how they give up their own sex in conversation with the other in articles that relate to delicacy women however prudent and reserved should be careful that they do not give the man they intend to encourage reason to think that they balance on other competitions men who want to get a woman into their power seldom scruple the means a woman who lends an ear to a seducer may by gentle words be insensibly drawn in to the perpetration of the most violent acts when women once enter themselves as lovers there is hardly any receding the man can have no good design who affects to a meekspirited woman an anger which is evidently manageable a daughter ought to look upon a man who would tempt her to go off with him clandestinely as the vilest and most selfish of seducers the woman who will correspond with a known libertine indirectly defies him to do his worst a woman who is above flattery and despises all praise but that which flows from the approbation of her own heart is morally speaking out of the reach of seduction women ought to be careful not to give cause to the man they love to think lightly of them for favors granted even to himself which may be supposed to spring from natural weakness women ought not to think gentleness of heart despicable in a man that mans natural disposition is to be suspected whose politeness is not regular nor constant nor wrought into habit but appears only in fits starts and sailles an acknowleged love sanctifies every little freedom and little freedoms beget great ones to give a woman an high opinion of her own sagacity is the measure that a designing man often takes to bring her to his will i love when i dig a pit says lovelace to have my prey tumble in with secure feet and open eyes for then a man can look down upon her with an oho charmer how came you there a woman in courtship for her own sake should so behave to the man she intends to marry as to show the world that she thinks him worthy of respect libertines consider all those of the sex over whom they obtain a power as fair prize there seldom can be peculiarity in the love of a rakish heart if a woman be not angry at indecent pictures or verses shown her by a libertine but smiles at them she may blame herself if she suffer from his afterattempts even innocent freedoms are not to be allowed to a libertine to be punished by the consequences of our own choice what a moral insultingly says lovelace lies there a judgment may be generally formed of the reading part of the sex by their books the man who complains of the distance a lady keeps him at wants to come too near one concession to a man is but a prelude to another the confidence which a woman places in a man for his respectful behavior to her ought to be withdrawn the moment that she sees in him an abatement of that reverence or respect which bgat her confidence a man who means honorably will not be fond of treading in crooked paths how vain a thing is it for a woman who has put herself into the power of a man to say what the will or will not do how can a woman who treating herself unpolitely gives a man an opportunity to run away with her expect him to treat her politely the man who makes a flagrant though unsuccessful attempt and is forgiven or expostulated with meets with encouragement to renew it at an opportunity which he may think more favorable women of penetration falling accidentally into company with a libertine and his associates will make them reflectingglasses to one another for her own service one devious step at first setting out frequently leads a person into a wilderness of doubt and error the man who is backward in urging a lady to give him her hand at the altar ought not to press her to favor him with it at public entertainments libertines in order the better to carry on their designs upon the unwary of the female sex particularly against those who are prudish frequently make pretenses to platonic love if a woman suffers her lover to see she is loath to disoblige him let her beware of an encroacher the libertine who by his specious behavior has laid asleep a womans suspicion and caution is in the way to complete all his views if a woman will keep company with a man who has reason to think himself suspected by her i am sure says lovelace it is a very hopeful sign women are apt to allow too much to a kneeling lover nine parts in ten of women who fall says lovelace owe their disgrace to their own vanity or levity or want of circumspection and proper reserve libertines equally tyrannical and suspicious expect that a wife should have no will no eyes no love no hate but at their direction traveling together gives opportunities of familiarity betwen the sexes says lovelace women therefore should be choice of the company they travel with women should be early taught to think highly of their sex for pride as lovlace says is an excellent substitute for virtue a woman of the brightest talents who throws herself into the power of a libertine brings into question those talents as well as her discretion not only with himself but with his lewd companions to whom in secret triumph he will be proud to show his prize a modest woman fallen into gross company should avow her correctives by her eye and not affect ignorance of meanings too obvious to be concealed a woman who has put herself into the power of a designing man must be satisfied with very poor excuses and pretenses for delay of marriage want of power is the only bound that a libertine puts to his views upon any of the sex a fallen woman is the more inexcuseable as from the cradle the sex is warned against the delusions of men men presume greatly on the liberties taken and laughed off in romping a lady conscious of dignity of person should mingle with it a sweetness of manners to make herself beloved as well as respected by all who approach her a man who insults the modesty of a woman as good as tells her that he has seen something in her conduct that warranted his presumption a man who has offered the last indignity to a woman yet expects forgiveness from her must think her as weak as be is wicked the woman who behaves with disrespect either to her accepted lover or to her husband gives every vain man hope of standing well with her clarissa apprehends that lovelace might have ground to doubt her conduct from having been able to prevail upon her to correspond with him against paternal prohibition and the light of her own judgment the nicest circumstances cannot be too nice to be attended to by women who are obliged either to converse or correspond with free livers a woman who when attempted descends to expostulation lets the offender know that she intends to forgive him a man whatever are his professions always thinks the worse of a woman who forgives him for making an attempt on her virtue a man who offers indecencies to a woman depends for secrecy and forgiveness upon his own confidence and her bashfulness the woman who takes any indirect steps in favor of a libertine if she escape present illtreatment from him intitles herself when his wife to his future jealousy and censure she who puts herself out of a natural protection is not to expert miracles in her favor the woman who hopes to reclaim a libertine may have reason to compare herself to one who attempting to save a drowning wretch is drawn in after him and perishes with him men take great advantages of even women of character who can bear their free talk and boasts of libertinism without resentment chastity like piety is an uniform grace if in look if in speech a girl give way to undue levity depend upon it says lovelace the devil has already got one of his cloven seet in her heart that woman must be indeed unhappy whose conduct has laid her under obligations to a mans silence a bold mans effrontery in company of women must be owing to his low opinion of them and his high one of himself a good woman who vows duty to a wicked man knowing him to be such puts to hazard her eternal happiness how dreadfully sunk is the woman who supplicates for marriage to a man who has robbed her of her honor and who can be thankful to him for doing her such poor justice how must such a one appear before his friends and her own divested of that noble confidence which arises from a mind unconscious of deserving reproach how does she subject herself to the violators upbraidings and to his insults of generosity and pity exerted in her favor it must cut to the heart a thoughtful mother whose husband continues in his profligate courses to look round upon her children with the reflection that she has given them a father destined without a miracle to perdition it would be as unpardonable in a lady says lovelace in the true libertine spirit to break her word with me as it would be strange if i kept mine to her in lovecases i mean for as to the rest i am an honest moral man if a woman is conscious of having shown weakness to a man wh has insulted her modesty she may then come to a composition with him and forgive him i never knew a man says miss how who deserved to be thought well of for his morals who had a slight opinion of our sex in general if a woman consents to go off with a man and he prove ever so great a villain to her she must take into her own bosom  the whole reproach and a share of his guilty baseness offenses against women and those of the most heinous nature constitute and denominate the man of gallantry the pen next to the needle of all employments whether for improvement or amusement is the most proper and best adapted to the genius of women the woman who neglects the useful and the elegant which distinguishes her own sex for the sake of obtaining the learning which is supposed peculiar to men incurs more contempt by what she foregoes than she gains credit by what she acquires the practical knowledge of the domestic duties is the principal glory of a woman the woman who aims at more than a knowledge of the beauties and graces of her mother tongue too often endangers her family usefulness young ladies should endeavor to make up for their defects in one part of their education by their excellence in another  see the articles courtship duty husband and wife libertine marriage parents and children reflections on women vows air and manner address air and manner are often more expressive than words that address in a man for which he is often most valued by a woman is generally owing to his assurance a concession should be made with a grace or not at all what a mere personal advantage is a plausible address without morals a specious address frequently abates even a justlyconceivd displeasure there is a manner in speaking that may be liable to exception when the words without that manner will bear none anger displeasure anger and disgust alter the property at least the appearance of things people hardly ever do anything in anger of which they do not repent a person of hard features should not allow himself to be very angry we should not be angry at a persons not doing that for us which he has a right either to do or to let alone faulty people should rather be sorry for the occasion they have given for anger than resent it nothing can be lovely in a mans eye with which he is displeased an angry or offended man will not allow to the person with whom he is displeased the merit which is his due angry people should never write while their passion holds anger unpolishes the most polite the displeasure of friends is to be borne even by an innocent person when it unquestionably proceeds from love an innocent person may be thankful for that displeasure in her friend which gives her an opportunity of justifying herself but then it is ungenerous in a displeased friend not to acknowledge and ask excuse for the mistake which caused the displeasure the moment he or she is convinced people of little understanding are most apt to be angry when their sense is called into question  see passion apprehensions fear the tender mind drawn in to pursue an irregular adventure will be rendy to start at every unexpected appearance the most apprehensive beginnings often make the happiest conclusions the certainty even of what we fear is often more tolerable than the suspense the very event of which we are most apprehensive is sometimes that which we ought to wish for threateners where they have an opportunity to put in force their threats are seldom to be feared it is better in a critical and uncertain situation to apprehend without cause than to subject ones self to surprise for want of forethought evils are often greater in apprehension than in reality an earnest disavowal of fear often proceeds from fear few men fear those whom they do not value beauty figure comeliness not having so much to lose as beauty has will hold when beauty will evaporate or fly off personal advantages are oftener snares than benefits though beauty is generally the creature of fancy yet are there some who will be beauties in every eye a good figure or person in man or woman gives credit at first sight to the choice of either men mre especially ought to value themselves rather for their intellectual than personal qualifications the pretty fool in all she says in all she does will please we know not why who would grudge the pretty fool her day when her butterfly flutters are over she will feel in the general contempt she will meet with the just effects of having neglected to cultivate her better faculties while the discreet matron who from youth has maintained her character will find solid veneration take place of airy admiration and more than supply the want of the latter a lovely woman whether angry or pleased will appear lovely that cruel distemper which often makes the greatest ravages in the finest faces is not always to be thought an evil goodness and generosity give grace and luster to beauty blushes blushing a distinction is to be made between the confusion which guilt will be attended with and the noble consciousness that overspreads the face of a fine spirit on its being thought capable of an imputed evil silence and blushes are now no graces says lovelace with our fine ladies hardened by frequent public appearances our modern fine ladies would be as much ashamed as men to be found guilty of blushing lovel the woman who at a gross hint puts her fan before her face seems to be conscious that her blush is not quite ready lovel  see modesty censure character the world illnatured as it is said to be is generally more just in giving characters speaking by what it feels than is usually imagined those who complain most of the censoriousness of the world perhaps ought to look inward for the occasion oftener than they do a wrong step taken by a woman who aims to excel subjects her to more severe censures from the world whose envy she has excited than that world would cast on a less perfect character characters very good or extremely bad are seldom justly given we should be particularly careful to keep clear of the faults we censure hasty censurers subject themselves to the charge of variableness in judgment we should always make allowances for the characters whether bad or good that are given us by interested persons many of those who have escaped censure have not merited applause where reputation is concerned we should not be in haste to censure we should never judge peremptorily on first appearances good people  or rather these who affect to be thought good says lovelace are generally so uncharitable that i should not choose to be good were the consequence to be that i must think hardly of everybody else every man and woman says lovelace is apt to judge of others by what they know of themselves a man who proves base to the confidence a woman places in him justifies the harshest censures of such of his enemies as would have persuaded her to reject him character runs away with and byasses all mankind in the very courts of justice character acquits and condemns as often as fact and sometimes in spite of fact lovel it is not always just to censure according to events difficult situations make seeming occasions for censure unavoidable censoriousness and narrowness generally prevail with those who affect to be thought more pious than their neighbors very few ladies would be condemned or even accused in the circles of ladies were they present human depravity it is feared will oftener justify those who judge harshly than those who judge favorably yet will not good people part with their charity nevertheless it is right to make that charity consist with caution and prudence charity beneficence benevolence benevolent spirits are sufficiently happy in the noble consciousness that attends their benevolence it is a generous pleasure in a landlord to love to see all his tenants look fat sleck and contented that spirit ought not to have the credit of being called bountiful that reserves not to itself the power of being just in cases where great good is wished to be done it is grievous to have the will without having the power true generosity is greatness of soul it incites us to do more by a fellow creature than can be strictly required of us innocent and benevolent spirits are sure to be considered as aliens and to be made to suffer by the genuine sons and daughters of earth a beneficent person diverted from her course by calamity will resume it the moment she can and go on doing good to all about her as before the power of conferring benefits is a godlike power a truly generous and beneficent person will in a sudden distress find out the unhappy before the sighing heart is overwhelmed by it a prudent person will suit her charities to the persons usual way of life persons blessed with a will should be doubly careful to preserve to themselves the power of doing good the honest industrious laboring poor whom sickness lameness or unforeseen accidents have reduced ought to be the principal objects of our charity small helps will set forward the sober and industrious poor an ocean of wealth will not be sufficient for the idle and proffigate it is not charity to relieve the dissolute if what is given to them deprive the worthy poor of such assistance as would set the wheels of their industry going that charity which provides for the morals as well as for the bodily wants of the poor gives a double benefit to the public as it adds to the number of the hopeful what it takes from that of the profligate can there be in the eyes of that god who requires nothing so much from us as acts of beneficence to one another a charity more worthy than that of providing for the souls as well as the bodies of our fellow creatures  see generosity church clergy the church is a good place to begin a reconciliation in if people mean anything by their prayers says lovelace who that has views either worldly or cruel can go to church and expect a blessing it is a juster satire upon human nature than upon the cloth if we suppose that those who have the best opportunities of being good are less perfect than others professional as well as national reflections are to be avoided the church ought to be the only marketplace for women and domestic excellence their capital recommendation a good clergyman must love and venerate the gospel he teaches and prefer it to all other learning the young clergyman who throws about to a christian audience scraps of latin and greek from the pagan classics shows something wrong either in his heart or head or in both a general contempt of the clergy even lovelace confesses is a certain sign of a man of free principles  see conscience death religion comedies tragedies music dancing libertines afraid to trust themselves with serious and solemn reflections run to comedies in order to laugh away compunction and to find examples of men as immoral as themselves very few of our comic performances give good examples mr lovelace mrs sinclair sally

the distresses of others our own libertines love not any tragedies but those in which they themselves act the parts of tyrants and executioners the woes of others well represented will unlock and open a tender heart lovel the female heart expands and forgets its forms when its attention is carried out of itself at an agreeable or affecting entertainment lovel women therefore should be cautious of the company they go with to public entertainments music and other maidenly amusements are too generally given up by women when married music says lovelace is an amusement that may be necessary to keep a young woman out of more active mischief wine is an opiate in degree how many women says lovelace have been taken at advantage by wine and intoxicating viands dancing is a diversion that women love but they ought to be wary of their company women to women when warmed by dancing music etc are great darers and provokers persons who sing and play tolerably yet plead inability wish not always to be believed condescension condescension that proceeds from force or even from policy may be often discovered to be forced by observing the eyes and lips condescension is not meanness iv     on the contrary the very word implies dignity there is a glory in yielding of which a violent spirit can hardly judge by gentleness and condescension a requester leaves favorable impressions upon an angry person which on cooler reflection may bring the benefit denied at the time that condescension which has neither pride nor insult in it gives a grace to the person as well as to the action which demonstrates it conscience consciousness persons of conscience will be afraid to begin the world unjustly a woman who by surprise or otherwise is brought to swerve loses all that noble selfconfidence which otherwise would have given her a visible superiority over her tempter how uneasy are our reflections upon every doubtful occurrence when we know we have been prevailed upon to do a wrong thing it is a satisfaction to a worthy mind to have borne its testimony against the vile actions of a bad one selfcomplacency is necessary to carry a woman through this life with tolerable satisfaction to herself the look of every person will be construed as a reproach by one who is conscious of having capitally erred as to the world and its censures says clarissa however desirous i always was of a fair same i never thought it right to give more than a second place to the worlds opinion a pure intention void of all undutiful resentments is what must be my consolation says clarissa whatever others may think of the measures i have taken when they come to be known consolation those who have not deserved illusage have reason to be the easier under it who would not with patience sustain even a great evil could she persuade herself that it might most probably be dispensed in order to prevent a still greater how much lighter on reflection will the same evils sit on the heart of one who has not brought them upon herself than upon one who has there is one common point in which all shall meet err widely as they may patience and perseverance overcome the greatest difficulties if a person in calamity can consider herself as called upon to give an example of patience and resignation she will find her mind greatly invigorated all nature and everything in it has its bright and gloomy side we should not always be thinking of the worst my mind says clarissa to lovelace and tomlinson is prepared for adversity that i have not deserved the evils i have met with is my consolation there must be a world after this to do justice to injured innocence and to punish barbarous perfidy we often look back with pleasure on the heaviest griefs when the cause of them is removed no one ought to think the worse of herself for having suffered what she could not avoid temporary evils may be borne with because they are but temporary none are made to suffer beyond what they can bear and therefore ought to bear we know not the methods of providence nor what wise ends it may have to serve in its seemingly severe dispensations a patient and innocent sufferer will look to a world beyond this for its reward many happy days may persons greatly unhappy live to see if they will not heighten unavoidable accidents into guilty despondency we should in an heavy evil comfort ourselves as we would in the like circumstances comfort others this world is designed but for a transitory state of probation a good person considering herself as traveling through it to a better will put up with all the hardships of the journey in hopes of an ample reward at the end of it had i says clarissa drawing near her end escaped the evils i labor under i might have been taken in the midst of some gay promising hope when my heart had beat high with desire of life and when the vanity of this earth had taken hold of me what happiness on reflection does that person enjoy who has not acted unworthy of herself in the time of trial and temptation all the troubles of this world as well as its joys are but of short duration things the most grievous to human nature at the time often in the event prove the happiest for us we remember those we have long lost with more pleasure than pain solemn impressions that seem to weaken the mind may by proper reflection be made to strengthen it where there is a reliance made on providence it seldom fails to raise up a new friend for every old one that falls off there is often a necessity for a considerate persons being unhappy in order to be happy good motions wrought into habits will yield pleasure at a time when nothing else can persons enured to afflictions and who have lived in constant hope of a better life and have no flagrant vices to reproach themselves with are the fittest comforters of friends in distress when a man has not great good to comfort himself with it is right says lovelace to make the best of the little that may offer there never was any discomfort happened to mortal man but some little ray of consolation would dart in if the wretch was not so much a wretch as to draw instead of undraw the curtain to keep it out

its laudable friendships or its generosity are likely to be wounded by it a man by seeming afraid of control often subjects himself to it people awed and controuled though but by their own

are gone from it for ever  see self courtship reverence to a woman in courtship is the less to be dispensed with as generally there is but little of it shown afterward a very ready consent often subjects a woman to contempt if a man cannot make a woman in courtship own herself pleased with him it is as much and oftentimes more to his purpose to make her angry with him lovel that disgust must be sincere which is conceived on a first visit and confirmed in every after one a woman who shows a very great dislike to the lover whom afterward she is induced to marry had need to have a double share of prudence to behave unexceptionably to her husband he who perseveres in his addresses to a woman whose aversion or dislike to him he has no reason to doubt wants the spirit that distinguishes a man very few people in courtship see each other as they are our courtshipdays are our best days favor destroys courtship distance increases it miss how a woman in courtship has reason to resent those passions in her lover which are predominant to that he pretends to have for her one of the greatest indignities that can be cast on a woman in courtship is for a man to be so profligate as to engage himself in lewd pursuits at the time he pretends his whole heart to be hers a woman accustomed to be treated with obsequiousness will expect obsequiousness to the end of the courtship chapter says miss how the man who expresses high respect to a woman is entitled if not to acceptance to civility a wise man will not discourage that discretion in a mistress which will be his glory and security in a wife the woman who in courtship treats haughtily or ill the man she intends to have gives room for the world to think either that she has a mean opinion of him and an high one of herself or that she has not generosity enough to use moderately the power which his great affection gives her such a woman gives reason to free livers to suppose and to presume upon it that the man to whom she intends to give her hand has no share in her heart and if she show that regard to him after marriage of which she showed none before it will be construed as a compliment to the husband made at the expense of the wifes and even of the sexs delicacy such a one will teach the world say her example to despise the man whom when her husband she would wish it to respect to condescend with dignity to command with kindness and sweetness of manners are points to be aimed at by a wise woman in courtship she should let her lover see that she has generosity to approve of and reward a wellmeant service that she has a mind that lifts her above the little captious follies which some attribute to the sex that she resents not if ever she has reason to be displeased through pride or with petulance that by insisting on little points she aims not to come at or to secure great ones perhaps not proper to be carried nor leaves room to suppose that she thinks she has so much cause to doubt her own merit as to make it needful to put her lover upon disagreeable or arrogant trials but lets reason be the principal guide of her actions and then she will hardly ever fail of that respect which will make her judgment after marriage consulted sometimes with a preference to a mans own at other times as a delightful confimation of his when judgment is at a loss to determine the choice of a lady who has several lovers fancy may the more allowably predominate women cannot put the question to a lover whether he mean honorably or not in his address without affronting their own virtue and personal graces they should therefore never admit of the address of a libertine the woman who in courtship uses ill the man she intends to have reflects not on the obligations her pride is laying her under to him for his patience with her  see advice to women husband and wife libertine love marriage parents and children reflections on women vows credulity women are sometimes drawn in to believe against probability

parents failings it is impolitic in patents to join two people in one interest whom they wish for ever to keep asunder though the parental authority should be deemed sacred yet parents should have reason in what they do where the heart of a child is sought to be engaged the eye ought not to be disgusted a worthy daughter would rather wish to appear amiable in the eyes of her own friends and relations than in those of all the world besides disgraceful treatment will often bring about the very end which it is intended to frustrate in family contentions when every expedient to bring about a reconciliation is tried whatever be the event the person so trying has the less to blame herself for how great must be the comfort of that young lady in an unhappy marriage who can reflect that she followed the advice of her friends and owes not her unhappiness to her own headstrong will the difference between the hard usage a child receives from a severe parent and the obsequious regard paid to her by a flattering lover is enough to make her run all risks with the latter in order to get out of the hands of the former parents sometimes make not those allowances for youth which when young they wished to be made for themselves parents must not always expect that advice should have the same force upon their children as experience has upon themselves in giving advice and remonstrating parents and guardians should proceed by patient reasoning and gentleness that they may not harden where they wish to convince unkind circumstances on the parents part and heedlese ones on the childs in a debate where both mean well will make small differences great ones a parent by forcing a child to marry the man she hates may occasion an utter dissipation of the childs morals and of consequence her everlasting perdition aversion in a child should be distinguished from wilfulness to endeavor to force a free mind is to dishonor it strings that are overstrained must either be relaxed or break the

cannot incur more disgrace than she already labors under harsh and cruel treatment humbles a child and makes her seem cheap in her own eyes is she not i then in the way to become the easy prey of a man whom otherwise she would have despised it is better for a good child to be able to say her parents were unkind to her than that she was undutiful to them the exertion of a seasonable lenity may save a penitent child from utter destruction the father and mother who would secure to themselves the undivided love of their children should avoid such durable contentions with each other as would distress their children which side to take when they would be glad to reverence both a good parent must have greater pain in the necessary restraint of an headstrong daughter than she can give to such

a failure in her own duty is not answerable to her child reverence is too apt to be forgot by children when parents forget what belongs to their own characters parents and children when separated and seeing each other but seldom like other lovers show their best sides to each other the bad qualities in which fond parents too often indulge ther children when infants not seldom at riper years prove

designs of men lovel parents the most indulgent in their own natures often from the errors of a child incur the censure of hardheartedness doubly faulty is that child therefore who by a rash action not only disgraces herself but depreciates the most revered characters what confusion of mind must attend the reflections of a child who from the most promising outsetting has brought ruin on herself and distress on her friends the voice of nature must at last be heard in favor of a child truly penitent when a daughter is strongly set upon a point it is better for a mother if the point be of no high consequence to make herself of her party than violently to oppose her parents should take care that they do not weaken their authority by a needless exertion of it what an enormity is there in that crime of a child which can turn the hearts of parents before indulgent against her the resentment which children and even the world may ascribe to cruelty in an offended parent may be owing to excess of love and disappointed hopes it is to be hoped says miss how that unforgiving parents were always good dutiful and passive children to their parents parents who would cure a childs impatience of spirit should not betray a want of temper in themselves children depending on the weakness of their parents tempers too often harden their own hearts while parents think a child in fault as they have a right to judge for themselves they ought to have great allowances made for them especially it till their displeasure took place they had always been kind and indulgent good children make their parents happy in each other as well as in them bad children unhappy in both when the nearest friends give up an unhappy child every one is ready to propagate slander against her a good child will be careful of making a party against even harsh and severe parents it requires an high degree of understanding and discretion in a daughter when grown up to let it be seen that she mingles reverence with her love to a parent who has talents visibly inferior to her own parents in order to preserve their childrens veneration for them should take great care not to let them see anything in their conduct

lovecases though ever so visible poor arguments will do when brought in favor of what we like an artful man bringing a case home to the passions or interest of his judges will be likely to succeed

rather than not put out both the eyes of a man they are mortally offended with will put out one of their own lovel vile men owe much of their vileness even to women of character who hardly ever scruple to accompany and converse with them though they have been guilty of ever so much baseness to others women being generally modest and bashful themselves are too apt to consider that quality in

reformation conviction conversion a man can hardly be expected to reform who resolves not to quit the evil company he has been accustomed to delight in pretenses to instantaneous convictions are to be suspected conviction is half way to amendment to reform by an enemys malevolence is the noblest revenge in the world very few convictions arise from vehement debatings the first step to reformation is to subdue sudden gusts of passion and to be patient under disappointment the most abandoned of libertines generally mean one day to reform  should they not therefore even as libertines resolve against atrocious guilt were it but to make their future compunction less pungent reformation cannot be a sudden work there is more hope of the reformation of a man of sense than of a fool but this is a delusive hope and has been the cause of great mischief for who thinks not the man she loves a man of sense the observations that follow are more the truth and deserve to be well considered a man who errs with his eyes open and against conviction is the worse for what he knows the man of parts and abilities who engages in a baseness knowing it to be so is less likely to be reclaimed than one who errs from want of knowledge or due conviction women think that the reclaiming of a man from bad habits as lovelace himself observes is a much easier task than in the nature of things it can be for mr belfords scheme of reformation see vol vii p          little hope can there be of reclaiming a man who is vile from premeditation to what a bad choice is many a worthy woman betrayed by that false and inconsiderate notion raised and propagated no doubt by the author of all delusion that a reformed rake makes the best husband belf little do innocents think what a total revolution of manners what a change of fixed habits nay what a conquest of a bad nature and what a portion of divine grace is required to make a profligate man a good husband a worthy father and a true friend from principle it is an high degree of presumption for a woman to suppose her own virtue so secure as that she may marry a profligate in hopes to reclaim him the sincerity of that mans reformation is hardly to be doubted

not easily be put out of countenance  by scoffers when the cause of virtue and religion is to be vindicated there are men who think themselves too wise to be religious there is something beautifully

one reverent act an exercise how worthy of a rational being if as religion teaches us we shall be judged in a great measure by our benevolent or evil actions to one another what must be the condemnation of those who have wilfully perpetrated acts of the most atrocious violence upon their innocent fellow creatures libertines are generally for making a religion to their practices a wickedness which nevertheless lovelace disclaims religion will teach us to bear inevitable evils with patience although i wish not for life says clarissa yet would i not like a poor coward desert my post when i can maintain it and when it is my duty to maintain it i will do everything i can continues she to preserve my life till god in mercy to me shall be pleased to call for it religious considerations timely enforced will prevent the heart from being seized with violent and fatal grief disappointments may bring on an indifference to this life but a truly pious resignation to death requires a better and deeper root enthusiasts often depreciate the scriptures they mean to extol by abused and indiscriminate applications even a lovelace disclaims as illmanners jesting upon religion or religious men a person of innate piety cannot think of shortening her own life whatever her calamities may be even by neglect much less by violence our best prayer in affliction in doubtful or critical situations is that gods will may be done and that we may be resigned to it religion is the only refuge of an heart laboring under heavy and unmerited calamities religion enjoins us not only to forgive injuries but to return good for evil and clarissa blesses god for enabling her to obey its dictates persons of piety cannot permit resentment passion or anger to appear or have place in the last disposition of their secular affairs god will have no rivals in the hearts which he sanctifies persons of education and piety will distinguish themselves as such even in their anger it is a great mistake to imagine that piety is not entirely consistent with goodnature and goodmanners religion if it has taken proper hold of the heart is says lovelace the most cheerful countenancemaker in the

the punishment of the injurer will be over who can tell lovel how often says lovelace do we end in occasions for the deepest remorse what we began in wantonness the remorse that is brought on merely by disappointment cannot be lasting nothing says lovelace but the excruciating pangs which the condemned soul feels at its entrance into the eternity of the torments we are taught to fear can exceed what i now feel and have felt for this week past what a dreadful thing is afterreflection upon a perverse and unnatural conduct heavy must be the reflections of those who on the loss of a worthy friend have acts of unmerited unkindness to that friend to reproach themselves with repentance contrition what is it that men propose who put off repentance and amendment but to live to sense as long as sense can relish and to reform when they can sin no longer that contrition for a guilt under which the guilty till detected was easy is generally to be ascribed to the detection and not to a due sense of the heinousness of the guilt repentance i have a notion says lovelace should be set about while a man is in good health and spirits what is a man fit for  not a new work surely when he is not himself nor master of his faculties lovel hence as i apprehend it is that a deathbed repentance is supposed to be such a precarious and ineffectual thing lovel as to myself proceeds he i hope i have a great deal of time before me since i intend one day to be a reformed man lovelace lived not to repent i have very serious reflections nowandthen yet am i afraid of what i was once told that a man cannot repent when he will  not to hold it i suppose is meant  i have repented by fits and starts a thousand times lovel laugh at me if thou will says belford but never never more will i take the liberties i have done but whenever i am tempted think of beltons dying agonies and what my own may be the most hopeful time for repentance is when the health is sound when the intellects are untouched and while it is in a persons power to make some reparation to the injured or misled reparation should always follow repentance that repentance which precedes the suffering that follows a wrong step must generally be wellgrounded and happy repentance to such as have lived only carelessly and in the omission of their regular duties is not so easy a task nor so much in their power as some imagine no false coloring no glosses does a truly penitent man aim at  see remorse religion reprehension reproof correction the reproof that favors more of the cautioning friend than of the satirizing observer always calls for gratitude reproofs to be efficacious should be mild gentle and unreproaching how much more eligible is it to be corrected by a real friend than by continuing either blind or wilful to expose ones self to the censure of an envious and perhaps malignant world the correction that is unseasonably given is more likely to harden or make an hypocrite than to reclaim a bad man

or forgive if an injury be not wilfully done or avowed to be so there can be no room for lasting resentment the man who would resent as the highest indignity the imputation of a wilful falsehood ought surely to be above the guilt of one the presence even of a disliked person takes off the edge of resentments which absence frequently whets and makes keen women who when treated with indecency have nothing to reproach themselves with may properly resent resentment and revenge ought ever to be separated that resentment which is expressed with calmness and without passion is most likely to last

of the years which can only entitle them to reverence a studied respectfulness or complaisance is always to be suspected even a wicked man will revere a woman that will withstand his lewd attempts it

love men and women revenge revenge grafted upon disappointed love is generally the most violent of all our passions the highest revenge a low female spirit can take is to prevent her rivals having the man she loves and procuring her to be obliged to marry the man she hates even the ties of relationship in such a case lose all their force revenge will not wipe off guilt what revenge can be more effectual and more noble than a generous and well distinguished forgiveness  see resentment satire true satire must be founded in goodnature and directed by a right heart when satire is personal and aims to expose rather than to amend the subject of it how though it were to be just could it be useful friendly satire may be compared to a fine lancet which gently breathes a vein for healthsake the

in the power of the slightest accident to blow up and destroy the longreaching views of the selfish a mans own interest or convenience is a poor plea if there be no better on which to found expectations of favor from another the address which is persisted in against the undoubted inclination of the beloved object is too selfish to be encouraged what a low selfish creature must that child

to form our judgments of the general merits of others as they are kind or reserved to ourselves there must be great selfishness and meanness in the love of a man who can wish a young creature to sacrifice her duty and conscience to oblige him the man who has no other plea for a womans favor but that of his loving her builds only on a compliment made to her selflove by his own selfishness to
